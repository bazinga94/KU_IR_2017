Burnin' like I've never seen
We've got an energy
Bringin' us to life
And I can't beat the feeling
That I
Get when I'm
With you
My heart plays a rhythm in my head
I can't help
But move
Two people synchronized
It's like a power
Brings you closer
Right beside it
I can't beat the feeling
That I get
When I'm
With you
Ooh, yeah
Ooh, yeah
Ooh, yeah
Ooh, yeah
(Whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh)
(Whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh)
I gotta lotta old friends that are gettin' back in touch
And it's a pretty good feelin, yeah it feels pretty good
I get a lotta double-takes when I'm comin' around the corners
And it's mostly pretty nice, yeah it's mostly pretty alright
'Cause most kids give me credit for being down with it
When it was back in the day, back when things were way different
When the Youth of Today and the early 7 Seconds
Taught me some of life's most valuable lessons
There's gonna come a time when the scene'll seem less sunny
It'll probably get druggy and the kids'll seem too skinny
There's gonna come a time when she's gonna have to go
With whoever's gonna get her the highest
There's gonna come a time when the true scene leaders
Forget where they differ and get big picture
'Cause the kids at the shows, they'll have kids of their own
The sing-along songs will be our scriptures
(Whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh)
We gotta stay positive
(Whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh)
We gotta stay positive
(Whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh)
We gotta stay positive
(Whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh)
We gotta stay positive
When the chaperone crowned us the king and the queen
I knew that we'd arrived at a unified scene
And all those little lambs from my dreams
Well, they were there too
'Cause it's one thing to start it with a positive jam
And it's another thing to see it all through
And we couldn't have even done this if it wasn't for you
(Whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh)
We gotta stay positive
(Whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh)
We gotta stay positive
(Whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh)
We gotta stay positive
(Whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh)
We gotta stay positive
I'm just comin' here to come down
I could be here
I could move town
Put my suits right on the guest list
Sign my passport
Became weightless
And I'm all hooked up
Draper Street caught me believin'
Spilt their eyes on
All the ceilings
Forced to live like it's a curfew
Translation:
It means I love you
And I'm all hooked up
I'm just comin' here to come down
I could be here
I could move town
Forced to live like it's a curfew
Translation:
It means I love you
And I'm all hooked up
It's a crime to fall in love
Heart and mind, and soul in love
It's a crime to fall in love
So hard, so hard
I shouldn't have bothered
'Cause you're just like all the others
Now I know, and I won't do that again
I should've guessed that you'd be just like all the rest
Now I know not to go through that again
I'm still crying all night and all day
But if I show it, someone lock me away, because
It's a crime to fall in love
Heart and mind, and soul in love
It's a crime to fall in love
So hard, so hard
My mother said gently, you can buy her a Bentley
But my son, she'll only drive it away
I didn't listen, cause my brain was missing
And I only found it today
I was a man but now I'm only a child
And if it kills me I am going to smile, cause
It's a crime to fall in love
Heart and mind, and soul in love
It's a crime to fall in love
So hard, so hard
You won't be hearing from me anymore
'Cause I can't see through my tears anymore
If it takes years to be any more than a jellyfish
I will not tell you this, because
It's a crime to fall in love
Heart and mind, and soul in love
It's a crime to fall in love
So hard, so hard
So hard, so hard
The story started and it ended so quick
Like Jack and Jill but with heroin
Disco lights and a glint in the eye of
Dancing girls at the Candybox Night
Queuing up for something under priced
Working weekends just to pay for drugs
This little story keeps repeating itself
Reading fashion mags to look at the girls
In the city, in the city tonight
You live by the sword but you die by the knife
The story started and it ended so quick
Like Jack and Jill but with heroin
Disco lights and a glint in the eye of
Dancing girls at the Candybox Night
I want it all; I want it all for me
These things in life they just don't come for free
Converse boots and a look on her face
That says if you've got the money then I'm yours tonight
In the city, in the city tonight
You live by the sword but you die by the knife
In the city, in the city tonight
In the city, in the city tonight
You live by the sword but you die by the knife
In the city, in the city I love
In the city, in the city I love
Somewhere over the rainbow
Way up high
There's a land that I've heard of
Once in a lullaby
Somewhere over the rainbow
The bluebirds fly so high
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then oh why can't I
Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far
Behind me
Where troubles melt like lemon drops
Away above the chimney tops
That's where you'll find me
Somewhere over the rainbow
The bluebirds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then oh why can't I
Why then oh why can't I
Diana
The front page is all your pictures,
They make you look so small,
How could someone not miss you at all?
(Oh-ah-oh)
I never would mistreat ya,
No, I'm not a criminal,
I speak a different language but I still hear your call.
Diana,
Let me be the one to light a fire inside those eyes,
You've been lonely, you don't even know me,
But I can feel you crying,
Diana,
Let me be the one to lift your heart up and save your life,
I don't think you even realize, baby you'd be saving mine.
Diana
It's only been four months but,
You've fallen down so far,
How could someone mislead you at all?
(Oh-ah-oh)
I wanna reach out for ya,
I wanna break these walls,
I speak a different language but I still hear you call.
Diana,
Let me be the one to light a fire inside those eyes,
You've been lonely, you don't even know me,
But I can feel you crying,
Diana,
Let me be the one to lift your heart up and save your life,
I don't think you even realize baby you'd be saving mine.
We all need something,
This can't be over now,
If I could hold ya,
Swear I'd never put you down.
Diana,
Let me be the one to light a fire inside those eyes,
You've been lonely, you don't even know me,
But I can feel you crying,
Diana,
Let me be the one to lift your heart up and save your life,
I don't think you even realize baby you'd be saving mine.
Diana,
Diana,
Baby you'd be saving mine,
Diana,
Diana,
Baby you'd be saving mine
Goat's head in the deli case
Oh sweet angel-angel-bearded face
Paper maché parade on at night
That's what you do with no sunlight
In the tropical tropical
Tropical ice-land
Bleak church on a cold tundra
Mountain-glacier-glacier-glacier-stream
Black stone beach and a black death bottle
Is all me and my baby'll need
In the tropical, tropical
Tropical ice-land
Take intermission at the movies
Freeze outside for one quick smoke
Take a klondike bar from the pop machine
Hey it's ice cream, no not coke
In the tropical tropical
Tropical ice-land
Let's meet in Kristiana next summer
Let's get out before we melt away
I've seen enough stray ponies and puffins
To get me through till the end of May
In the tropical tropical
Tropical ice-land
Please tell my mother I'm down on my knees
And I really miss you
You, you, you
Oh, I love you, all I love
You
One, two, three, four!
I was kidnapped real young by the sweet taste of love
Built a fondness for things that just weren't good enough
I cradled the crow, always shooed off the dove
Which tagged me a naïve son
So the fortunate kids, yeah they left on their lights
And they stuck up their noses and started some fights
Their parents all cackled at dirt on my hands
While my father was slaving, my mother explained it
Sometimes that's just how it is
So my sister went kissing a maple-skinned boy
Finally held up her fists, said "I'm done being coy!"
And the neighbourhood, bored, started buzzing with joy
We finally had front-page news
Although it was sad, I couldn't help but laugh
Such ridiculous hate in the hot summer sweat
I laid on my back, let the punk record spin
The sloppy guitar, it was shooting out stars
It all went to my heart, yeah some rainbows in the dark
So I called up danger, my friends and some strangers
They stumbled and wavered, but caught me a saviour
They slipped me the blood in the whole of the vial
But I didn't feel them change
Then I met a man with a fist for a hand
Held me flat on my back, taught me how to give in
Some phrases were shot, pretty roses got tossed
The gift of a fat-lipped grin
Now they're drilling my teeth while I'm soiling sheets
With my lover, she's counting the diamonds on rings
And even when truth doesn't help with the sting
Out of no numbers, some harsh looking colour
You pull them out, feel they're changed
No need for a thousand cranes
So I thank the city, the lights that it's spinning
The friends that I have and the shoes we're not shining
The drunk horn's so violent, all spinning out sounds
But the colour's so vibrant, the colour's so loud
The newly-born crying realizing what life is
In the eyes of my grandpa, right before dying
The see-saw of love, its rickety bounce
The feeling of coming, the feeling of going
The mother, the child, the tame and the wild
The sleeping in minor, the gold leaf, the tire
The crooked, the straight, all the hip and the fake
Oh, I'm finally feeling the stitching of beautiful seams
Sometimes you just can't hold back the river
Sometimes you just can't hold back the river
Sometimes you just can't hold back the river
Sometimes you just can't hold back the river
Hold back the river, hold back the river, hold back the river
Oh, Susannah's bedraggled but she 
Still wears the locket 'round her neck
She's got a picture on the table 
Of a man who is young and able
Oh, Susannah's gonna cry
Oh, Susannah's still alive
Whiskey or a gin, that's alright
When there's nothing in her bed at night
She sleeps with the covers down
Hoping that somebody gets in
Doesn't matter what she does
She knows that she can't win
Oh, Susannah's gonna cry
She's got a doll with one eye, 
That always cries when it gets some sleep 
She's waiting for a soldier to come home
But she'll cry and never die
Oh, Susannah's gonna cry
Oh, Susannah's still alive
Whiskey or a gin, that's alright
When there's nothing in her bed at night 
She sleeps with the covers down
Hoping that somebody gets in
Doesn't matter what she does
She knows that she can't win
Oh, Susannah's still alive
Oh, Susannah's gonna cry
Oh, Susannah's still alive
Oh, Susannah's still alive
Hey Hey don't pay no mind,
We are the second, you're minutes behind
So you say, Yeah I'm all right
You are the fortunate all the time
Yeah, you are the fortunate...
I've been looking for a way out
Something that isn't so cruel
Well I'm a little tired, you see
Complacent and miserable
I think you're missing out
I think you're dumbing it down
You're past the point of holding up to your words,
There's no getting it by us now
So if it's OK by you,
Hey Hey don't pay no mind,
We are the second, you're minutes behind
So you say, "Yeah I'm all right"
You are the fortunate all the time
So full of this adventure
The feelings insecure
It's so easy, push the pin, fake the tense
And give us nothing more
And if it's OK by you,
Hey Hey don't pay no mind,
We are the second, you're minutes behind
So you say, Yeah I'm all right
You are the fortunate all the time
And if it's the one thing
That I've been sure of,
Well its OK, I know you've got the time
If it's all one in the same thing
Then I've been waiting for the fallout with history
But it's got on for so long, for so long
That I don't think you'll ever be the same
Hey Hey don't pay no mind,
We are the second, you're minutes behind
So you say, Yeah I'm all right
You are the fortunate all the time
Hey Hey don't pay no mind,
We are the second, you're minutes behind
So you say, Yeah I'm all right
You are the fortunate all the time
Hey Hey (don't pay no mind)
Heyo hey (we are the second, you're minutes behind)
Heyo heyo heyyyo (So you say, "Yeah I'm all right")
Heyo Heyoooo Heyooo (You are the fortunate all the time)
You can watch TV and watch the media
President Bush doing takeover
Kate Moss in ads for mascara
All my youth, the young offender
The bill payers, the drug dealers
Girls who are on magazine covers
The part-time jobbers at a call center
No career plans 'cause you won't go far
Put away change for Ibiza
And check your credit on your new Nokia
You can be a follower, but who's your leader?
Break that cycle or it will kill ya
You leader, you lead
Come, do what you do now
What's really good that gonna happen to you?
Your prime minister to your employer,
Ego-lovers need more power
The trendsetters make things better
Don't sell out to be product pushers
The giro-cashier and baby maker
Try something new 'cause it ain't over
All poor people from all over
The lottery's got a rollover
You can be a follower, but who's your leader?
Break that cycle or it will kill ya
Cherokee Indians, Iraqi and Indians
Girls are my girls when it comes to the fellas then
Japanese, Moroccan, Caribbean, African
Life's your life
Oh, who the fuck's your president?
You no get my life 'cause I don't have a side, and I
Spread out boy, I'm a mile wide, and I
Got brown skin, I'm a West Londoner,
Educated, but a refugee still
You want a war? You're old, you go
You wanna fight? You suck, you blow
I can feel a storm brewing over nothing
We were having fun, there's no harm done there
You need attention, I can see you're sulking
It's about time that you learn to share
Lighten up, it's gonna brighten up
I want to play, you're in the way of our sunshine
Lighten up, it's gonna brighten up
Just let it go, and I will throw you a lifeline
I don't know what happened to those resolutions
We think we found the truth at last, when it escapes
Inside the mirror is a false impression
I can feel so swollen when I'm in good shape
Lighten up, it's gonna brighten up
I want to play, you're in the way of our sunshine
Lighten up, it's gonna brighten up
Just let it go, and I will throw you a lifeline
Lighten up, it's gonna brighten up
I want to play, you're in the way of our sunshine
Lighten up, it's gonna brighten up
Just let it go, and I will throw you a lifeline
Lighten up, it's gonna brighten up
I want to play, you're in the way of our sunshine
Lighten up, it's gonna brighten up
Just let it go, and I will throw you a lifeline
Run run over the hills, can't feel the bouncing balls around me
Killed a flower in someone's garden, but I don't care,
I am free!
Strings let themselves loose, my feet won't touch the ground
The city is further away, and I love that I, I can't stay.
The sky is way bigger than I ever thought it could be
I really can't see where it ends
Clouds like bubbles in a sink, touching my face
Makes me forget how to think.
Nada vai mudar entre nós
Como eu sei, eu só sei
Tudo vai permanecer igual, afinal
Não há nada a fazer
Eu não nego, eu me entrego
Você é meu grande amor
E hoje eu vou te dizer eu te amo
Eu imploro eu te adoro
Você tem meu coração
A bater pra você, mais uma canção
Como pode alguém perder você como eu fiz
Como eu quis não te ter?
Vivo iludido a acreditar que o amor não se pôs em você
Eu me entrego, eu não nego, eu errei mas
sou capaz de fazer a sua vida melhor
Tô voltando, não sei quando, pra roubar teu coração
Vou chegar no final de mais uma canção...

Go!
Sick and sad again
Sometimes I'd like the rain to end
Sick and sad again
Sometimes
I'd like
To stand
On my own two feet
Went to the corner of a second and main
But there was somebody to mentioned
That they hoped it would rain forever
Forever
So they could drown
In peace
(Then I)
Went down to Hodgkin P.L.
But there was nobody to answer
When I rang that doorbell forever
Forever
Now I'm sad
All the time
Sick and sad again
Sometimes I'd like the rain to end
Sick and sad again
Sometimes
I'd like
To stand
On my own two feet
Today was the day
But she threw it all away
And I could never understand
'Cause she was never one to play by the rules
Of the game
Her and me
Were still the same
(And I)
I try so hard and I never give in
And I am never satisfied
Until the day that I win against them
But I don't care
I'll follow her
To anywhere
Sick and sad again
Sometimes I'd like the rain to end
Sick and sad again
Sometimes
I'd like
To stand
On my own two feet
(Let's go!)
Sick and sad again
Sometimes I'd like the rain to end
Sick and sad again
Sometimes
I'd like
To stand
On my own two feet
Sick and sad again
Sometimes I'd like the rain to end
Sick and sad again
Sometimes
I'd like
To stand
On my own two feet
Sometimes I'd like to stand
On my own two feet
We're all standing with our backs against the wall, sooner or later
Waiting on a phone that never calls, at all
Heartbreak comes rollin' in like a storm, sooner or later
Trying to swim but your sinking like a stone, alone
And I can feel fire in the night waiting here
Baby, it's like we're walking on a wire through the fear
Take my hand, we'll get there
Sooner or later, I swear we're gonna make it
We're gonna make it
Sooner or later, I swear we're gonna make it
We're gonna make it
Milk and honey till we get our fill
I'll keep chasing it, I always will
Sooner or later, I swear we'll make it there
Sooner than later, sooner or later
Sooner than later, sooner or later
We're all waiting on dream
That's hard to own, sooner or later
Trying to feel the high
Without the low, you know
You can feel fire in the night lying here
Baby, it's like we're walking on a wire through the fear
Take my hand, we'll get there
Sooner or later, I swear we're gonna make it
We're gonna make it
Sooner or later, I swear we're gonna make it
We're gonna make it
Milk and honey till we get our fill
I'll keep chasing it, I always will
Sooner or later, I swear we'll make it there
Sooner than later, sooner or later
The fear inside the hills we've climbed
The tears this side of heaven
All these dreams inside of me
I swear we're gonna get there
Sooner or later, we're gonna make it
Sooner or later, I know, I swear we're gonna make it
We're gonna make it
Sooner or later, I swear we're gonna make it
We're gonna make it
Milk and honey till we get our fill
I'll keep chasing it, I always will
Sooner or later, I swear we'll make it there
Sooner than later
The fear inside the hills we've climbed
The tears this side of heaven
All these dreams inside of me
I swear we're gonna get there
The fear inside the hills we've climbed
The tears this side of heaven
All these dreams inside of me
I swear we're gonna get there
Was it too soon to sigh?
Were we just making time?
Will it ever last?
Should we take the chance?
Was it too soon to sigh?
Were we just making time?
Will it ever last?
Should we take the chance?
Was it too soon to sigh?
Were we just making time?
Will it ever last?
Should we take the chance?
Was it too soon to sigh?
Were we just making time?
Will it ever last?
Should we take the chance? (The chance, chance...)
If we come, come together
If we come, come together
If we come, come together
If we come, come together
If we come, come together
If we come, come together
If we come, come together
If we come, come together
If we come, come together
If we come, come together
If we come, come together
If we come, come together
If we come, come together
If we come, come together
I'm gonna ask you so ya understand
What you done with your time
Oh think it over baby
Just keep walkin' on
Until you find your man
Don't it feel so bad?
Well I'm used to that
Don't it feel so bad?
Get used to that
Baby, please don't go to far
I swear I love you
Just the way you are
All this justice in my hands
And what you done with your time?
I could stand it if I just keep breathin' oh
What you done with your time?
Don't it feel so bad?
Well I'm used to that
Don't it feel so bad?
Get used to that
Don't push it baby
Please don't go to far
I swear I love you
Just the way you are
Oh skin and bones baby
Yes you are my star
I swear I love you
Just the way you are
Don't push it baby
Please don't go to far
I swear I love you
Just the way you are
Oh skin and bones baby
Yes you are my star
I swear I love you
Just the way you are
Remember that tank-top you bought me?
You wrote "You're gorgeous" on it
You took me to your rented motor car
And filmed me on the bonnet
You got me to hitch my knees up
And pulled my legs apart
You took an Instamatik camera
And pulled my sleeves around my heart
Because you're gorgeous
I'd do anything for you
Because you're gorgeous
I know you'll get me through
You said my clothes were sexy
You tore away my shirt
You rubbed an ice cube on my chest
Snapped me till it hurt
Because you're gorgeous
I'd do anything for you
Because you're gorgeous
I know you'll get me through
You said I wasn't cheap
You paid me twenty pounds
You promised to put me in a magazine
On every table in every lounge
Because you're gorgeous
I'd do anything for you
Because you're gorgeous
I know you'll get me through
Because you're gorgeous
I'd do anything for you
Because you're gorgeous
I know you'll get me, know you'll get me through
Know you'll get me through
Know you'll get me through
Know you'll get me through
Know you'll get me through
Know you'll get me through
Know you'll get me through
I know you'll get me, know you'll get me through
I know you'll get me, know you'll get me through
Because you're gorgeous
I'd do anything for you
Because you're gorgeous
I know you'll get me through
I know you'll get me through
Take the sky
For example
A canvas of a billion suns
But our local hero
Shines them out by day
Safe for the winking of a Venus or Mars
Even the stars
Sometimes fade to grey
Even the stars
Hideaway
I see the bare moon
Raise it's big bald head
I see my friends play the fool
I'll make my own way
In the wide world
Just know I don't want to wander too far
Even the stars
Sometimes fade to grey
Even the stars
Hideaway
Even the stars
Sometimes fade to grey
Even the stars
Hideaway
It's so calming
All kinds of names
Some say I don't the play the right kind of game
I try to be honest
I try to be kind
And honestly leave when I know that it's time
I know that it's time
Hear a phoebe sing his only song
The summer's day is hovering
I'll write my full heart
Troubles while I can burst
Out the windows of our traveling car
Even the stars
Sometimes fade to grey
Even the stars
Hideaway
(x3)
Picture a scene in your mind
Look at all the people and take note of the setting behind
Listen, watch, and wait
A plot begins to take shape
There's a story
And then characters will come to you
Relating events as they choose to
But all their words and actions come entirely from you
If you're a storyteller you might think you're without responsibility
And you can lead your characters anywhere you want
You have immunity
Have you considered the way
People might react to all the things that your characters say?
And are their actions hand in hand with what you want to portray?
Are you sick?
Are you crippled? Insane?
Expressing the desires that daren't speak their name?
Are you the one to be blamed?
Now you're a storyteller you might think you are without responsibility
But in directions, actions and words
Cause and effect
You need consistency
How can you finish the tale?
Lives which have played a part
Are summarised from the very start
And episodes left out to make it all go our way
"It's a might big world
Some of it I've seen
But mostly I've only heard
And stories are all fiction from their moment of birth"
You're just a storyteller
You're not trying to escape responsibility
If we believe you then you're successful
But you don't make claims of verity
I remember when I'd run to you
Through fields of white flowers
Your embrace was my air
How I needed you there
All of the world and all of its powers
Couldn't keep your love from me
'Cause I need you like the dragonfly's wings need the wind
Like the orphan needs home once again
Like heaven needs more to come in
I need you here like you've always been
Then I waved goodbye to you 
From fields of white flowers
You were so proud of me
I was too proud to see 
That all of the world and all of it's powers
Couldn't keep your love from me
I need you like the dragonfly's wings need the wind
Like the orphan needs home once again
Like heaven needs more to come in
I need you here like you've always been
Taking for granted all of her smiles that got away
Now I'm looking up at you
From fields of white flowers
You were so proud of me
I'm so proud of you
All of the world and all of its powers
Couldn't keep your love from me
Yeah, I like it when the girls stop by in the summer
Do you remember, do you remember
When we met that summer?
New Kids On The Block had a bunch of hits
Chinese food makes me sick
And I think it's fly when girls stop by
For the summer, for the summer
I like girls that wear Abercrombie and Fitch
I'd take her if I had one wish
But she's been gone
Since that summer, since that summer
Hip Hop, marmalade, spic and span
Met you one summer and it all began
Your the best girl that I ever did see
The great Larry Bird, jersey 33
When you take a sip, you buzz like a hornet
Billy Shakespeare wrote a whole bunch of sonnets
Call me Willy Whistle 'cause I can't speak, baby
Somethin' in your eyes went and drove me crazy
Now I can't forget you and it makes me mad
Left one day and never came back
Stayed all summer then went back home
Macaulay Culkin wasn't Home Alone
Fell deep in love, but now we ain't speakin'
Michael J. Fox was Alex P. Keaton
When I met you, I said my name was Rich
You look like a girl from Abercrombie and Fitch
New Kids On The Block had a bunch of hits
Chinese food makes me sick
And I think it's fly when girls stop by
For the summer, for the summer
I like girls that wear Abercrombie and Fitch
I'd take her if I had one wish
But she's been gone
Since that summer, since that summer
Cherry Pez, Cold Crush, rock star Boogie
Used to hate school so I had to play hookie
Always been hip to the B-boy style
Known to act wild and make girls smile
Love New Edition and the Candy Girl
Remind me of you because you rock my world
You come from Georgia where the peaches grow
They drink lemonade and speak real slow
You love hip hop and rock 'n' roll
Dad took off when you were four years old
There was a good man named Paul Revere
I feel much better, baby, when you're near
You love fun dip and cherry coke
I like the way you laugh when I tell a joke
When I met you I said my name was Rich
You look like a girl from Abercrombie and Fitch
New Kids On The Block had a bunch of hits
Chinese food makes me sick
And I think it's fly when girls stop by
For the summer, for the summer
I like girls that wear Abercrombie and Fitch
I'd take her if I had one wish
But she's been gone
Since that summer, since that summer
In the summertime girls got it goin' on
Shake and wiggle to a hip hop song
Summertime girls are the kind I like
I'll steal your honey like I stole your bike
Bugaloo shrimp and pogo sticks
My mind takes me back there, oh, so quick
Let you off the hook like my man Mr. Lipit
Think about that summer and I bug 'cause I miss it
Like the color purple, macaroni and cheese
Ruby red slippers and a bunch of trees
Call you up but what's the use
I like Kevin Bacon, but I hate Footloose
Came in the door said it before
I think I'm over you but I'm really not sure
When I met you I said my name was Rich
You look like a girl from Abercrombie and Fitch
New Kids On The Block had a bunch of hits
Chinese food makes me sick
And I think it's fly when girls stop by
For the summer, for the summer
I like girls that wear Abercrombie and Fitch
I'd take her if I had one wish
But she's been gone
Since that summer, since that summer
'Cause summer girls come and summer girls go
Some are worth while and some are so so
Summer girls come and summer girls go
Some are worth while and some are so so
Summertime girls got it goin' on
Shake and wiggle to a hip hop song
Summertime girls are the kind I like
I'll steal your honey like I stole your bike
New Kids On The Block had a bunch of hits
Chinese food makes me sick
And I think it's fly when girls stop by
For the summer, for the summer
I like girls that wear Abercrombie and Fitch
I'd take her if I had one wish
But she's been gone
Since that summer, since that summer

And we be chillin' like a bottle sittin' on the rocks
Shoppin' bags full of cartier forget-me-nots
But money can't buy you love, baby that's a fact
But you can rent some love with a couple stacks
Man I gotta lease nothin' I own one
And every time I hit, she say it's a home run
When asked how can we be serious at so young
I just say I'm in it for the long run.

Your picture
Is still
On my wall
On my wall
The colors are bright
Bright as ever
The red is strong
The blue is true
Some things last a long time
Some things last a long time
Your picture
Is still
On my wall
On my wall
I think
About you
Often
Often
I can't forget all the things we did
Some things last a long time
Some things last a long time
It's funny
But it's true
And it's true
But it's not funny
Time comes and goes
All the while
I still think of you
Some things last a long time
Your picture
Is still
On my wall
On my wall
The colors
Are bright
Bright
As ever
Things that we did
All we forget
Some things last a life time
Some things last a life time
Oh yeah, I tell you something
I think you'll understand
When I say that something
I wanna hold your hand
I wanna hold your hand
I wanna hold your hand
Oh, please say to me
You'll let me be your man
And please, say to me
You'll let me hold your hand
You'll let me hold your hand

Let's board a plane without no destination
Take your time you're gonna need some patience, girl
A holiday
Leave the city for an open highway
Or the planet for a clear blue sky-way, oh
It's our world, girl
We need a holiday
Away from here
To Zimbabwe-babwe-babwe-babwe
It's not a change, it's just a slight vacation
Let's go around to other distant nations, now
A holiday
Leave the office for the open planes and
Leave the paperwork for other days, just go
We need a holiday
Away from here
To Zimbabwe-babwe-babwe-babwe
We need a holiday
Away from here
To Zimbabwe-babwe-babwe-babwe
We need a holiday
Away from here
To Zimbabwe-babwe-babwe
Wandering alone on the ridge of a coast
Lost to the world he had known as a boy
He knows his lover lies south in the city
Passing along and sleepy as night
Warm in the woods that conceal him from light
He is accustomed to hiding from people
Taking his time as he crosses the bridge
Holding the flowers he picked from the ridge
Walking in the shadows to his senorita
Safe in the dawn he gets under the sheets
His Senorita a heavenly sweet... soul
That was put there to save and protect him
He knows that time can not endlessly go
Traps will be sat by the people below
She will be caught too and he could not bear it
Hope in the freedom he can almost touch
Folk take for granted as they walk to church
He says his prayers and
God listens to him
Sir all I want is a chance to amend
Past infidelities please do not send
Me far away from my wise
Me far away from my wise
Me far away from my wise Senorita
Ooh x4
It's a long way now through the deadroads in our hometown
I never tried
To hold you tight until you left me and fade
Neighborhoods under the lights
We felt our hearts so strong
I never tried to hold you tight until you left me now
Ooh x2
It's a long way now through the deadroads to your house
I never tried to hold you tight until you left me and fade
Neighborhoods we learned to drive
We learned to grow up strong
I never tried to hold you tight until you left me and
I should run away and think of those
Nights not up close still hold a ghost of our empty town
Ooh x4
It's a long way now through the deadroads in our hometown

She said I can be a frog, I can be a bat
I can be a bear or I can be a cat
She said I can be a lion, I can be a Gila monster
I can be a warrior Indian, I can be a helicopter
She said I can be a wolf, I can be a finch
I can be a jaguar or a locust on a branch
She said I can be a monkey, I can be a tiger
I can be a tornado knocking down your wires
Well, it seems like she can be anything
Any kind of creature she wants to be
Oh, it seems like she can be anything
Any kind of frog, any kind of bear
Any kind of monkey she wants to be
My! My! Time Flies! One step and we're on the Moon
Next step into the stars
My! My! Time flies! Maybe we could be there soon
A one way ticket to Mars
My! My! Time Flies! A man underneath a tree
An apple falls on his head
My! My! Time Flies! A man wrote a symphony
It's 1812
My! My! Time Flies! Four guys across Abbey Road
One forgot to wear shoes
My! My! Time Flies! A rap on a rhapsody
A king who's still in the news
A king to sing you the blues
My! My! Time flies! A man in a winter sleigh
White white white as the snow
My! My! Time flies! A new day is on its way
So let's let yesterday go
Could be we step out again
Could be tomorrow but then
Could be 2010
Waiting for the 7.18
January is endless
Weary-eyed and forlorn
The Northern Line is the loudest
Sitting in silence in bars after work
I've got nothing to add or contest
Can I still kick a ball a hundred yards?
Now we cling to bottles
And memories of the past
Give me moments
Just give me moments
Give me moments
Not hours or days
Give me moments
Just give me moments
Give me moments
Grinding your teeth in the middle of the night
Let the sadness off those molars
Spend all your spare time trying to escape
With crosswords and Sudoku
If I could do it again I'd make more mistakes
I'd not be so scared of falling
If I could do it again I'd climb more trees
I'd pick and I'd eat more wild blackberries
Give me moments
Just give me moments
Give me moments
Not hours or days
Give me moments
Just give me moments
Give me moments
Let's drive to Brighton on the weekend

The weekend is the weekend
And it's sunny in the park
I'll stay here with my beer and fish and chips till it gets dark
I've got a lot of homework
But homework he can wait
I never start my homework till its already too late
My parents say think about your future and my teachers say the same
But it's hard
When there's a basketball game in the park
It's 1998
And everybody's saying:
"Harry, you're going to be a lawyer some day"
It's Monday bloody Monday
And there's two things I forgot
I forgot to do my homework
And I've only got one sock
I'm halfway through a test
But I just can't concentrate
I'm sitting next to Fontaine
I want to ask her on a date
I really want to start a conversation
But each time she walks past
I start choking on my pencil
And fall flat on my ass
I need to concentrate
I have to get this grade
Or I might fail to be a lawyer someday
But just right now
Can't think of anything better to do
Than just sit down at the piano and a write this tune
And maybe later
Maybe later in the afternoon
I'll sit back and relax
And think of all the things I'm going to do
Someday
I'll buy an old car
Someday
I'll get that car to start
Someday
I'll learn how to drive too
And then Someday
Imagine all the things I could do.
(That was 1998 now
Bring it forward to the present day now
Cause some things have changed
But some things never change)
The weekend is the weekend
And it's sunny in the park
I'll stay here with my beer and fish 'n' chips till it gets dark
I just saw Peter Parsons
Who used to be in my class
I always gave him wedgies 'cause I thought he worked too hard
He said, "Harry, life is great
I feel so happy these days
I'm a litigation lawyer
So I got it made
I'm going out with Fontaine
Rememer her from tenth grade?
I drive a Porsche so I can't complain"
Shit! And look at me can't think of anything better to do
Than just sit down at the piano and write this tune
And maybe later
Maybe later in the afternoon
I'll sit back and relax and think of all the things I'm going to do
I was young and I was stupid--I had just turned seventeen.
I took my hits on a dumb road trip to Nashville, Tennessee,
I packed my antihistamines and tupperware drums,
A harmonica and a box guitar,
In a canvas covered wagon stuff with apples and with guns.
We quietly slipped across the border into Arkansas,
But still we couldn't find what it was we were looking for,
So we trucked on down to try our luck along the Rio Grande,
But I couldn't help but notice how,
The little things that used to make us happy made us sad.
But still I'm glad I hitched my apple wagon to your star,
I never would've got here if I'd followed my heart,
I didn't think much of it till I took it apart,
I'm glad I hitched my apple wagon to your star.
We never ever made it down to Nashville in the end,
And no one ever signed our stupid country disco band,
However hard we tried it never seemed to be enough,
We never did get famous,
Still it made us kind of happy and it kept me off of drugs.
And now I'm glad I hitched my apple wagon to your star,
I never would've got here if I'd followed my heart,
I didn't think much of it till I took it apart,
I'm glad I hitched my apple wagon to your star.
But still I'm glad I hitched my apple wagon to your star,
I'm happy if you're happy but it breaks my heart,
I didn't even notice it till it fell apart,
I'm glad I hitched my apple wagon to your star.
Now, I can't behave
I feel it in my feet on the streets
But don't you know?
There's something I can feel when I breathe
I told you once
You're breaking into separate parts
But don't you know?
It's something that I can't live without
And if somebody's going to make it
Then this somebody ought to be you
And I keep telling my reflection
Ambitions are already starting to fade
I can't tolerate
The feelings that I feel when I feel
But don't you know?
Some feelings never seem to let go 
Like a silverblade
I cut my way out of control
But don't you know?
Some blades will cut you right to the bone
And if somebody's going to make it
Then this somebody ought to be you
And if somebody's going to fake it
Then this somebody, somebody is you
If it's me that was going to take it
Then I know that it wouldn't be straight
And I keep telling my reflection
Ambitions are already starting to fade 
I Can't tolerate...
(Can't tolerate)
I Can't tolerate...
(Can't tolerate)
And if somebody's going to make it
Then this somebody ought to be you
And if somebody's going to fake it
Then this somebody, somebody is you
If it's me that was going to take it
Then I know that it wouldn't be straight
And I keep telling my reflection
Ambitions are already starting to fade 
And I keep telling my reflection
Ambitions are already starting to fade
(Let's go!)
(Yeah! All right!)
Walking through the terminal
I saw something beautiful
You left, for your duty call
Next I'm getting on the plane
That's when I see you again
I can't get you off my brain
(Let's go)
That uniform you're wearing
So hot I can't stop staring
You're putting on an awesome show
The cabin pressure's rising
My coke has got no ice in there
Air hostess
I like the way you dress
You know I hate to fly
But I feel much better
Occupy my mind
Writing you a love letter
I messed my pants
When we flew over France
Will I see you soon
In my hotel room
For a holiday romance?
Air hostess
Throwing peanuts down the aisle
Stupid but it made you smile
You came over for a while
Then you whispered in my ear
The words that I longed to hear
I want you to thrill me here
You can't because you're working
The paparazzi's lurking
You didn't know I'm in a band
In England people know me
One photo's worth a hundred grand
Air hostess
I like the way you dress
You know I hate to fly
But I feel much better
Occupy my mind
Writing you a love letter
I messed my pants
When we flew over France
Will I see you soon
In my hotel room
For a holiday romance?
Air hostess
That uniform you're wearing
So hot I can't stop staring
You're putting on an awesome show
The plane has almost landed
So tell me where I'm standing now
Air hostess
I like the way you dress
You know I hate to fly
But I feel much better
Occupy my mind
Writing you a love letter
I messed my pants
When we flew over France
Will I see you soon
In my hotel room
For a holiday romance?
Air hostess
'Cause you're my air hostess
I love the way you dress
Air hostess
My air hostess
I love the way you dress
Air hostess
Everyday, a shade of blue
You won't believe, what I'm goin' through
It just feels like I can't afford to let myself go
Oh oh, no
Everyone, is just the same
They touch me, but I can't say
There has been no one brighter than you
I can't deny these things that I do
Feels like the world's at stake 'cause
I have been waiting, I have been waiting for you
Heavenly, that's what you are
You're burning me, like a shining star
How am I supposed to be that king without you?
Oh oh it's true
Everyone, is just the same
They love me, but I can't say
There has been no one brighter than you
I can't deny these things that I do
Feels like the world's at stake yeaaa
I have been waiting, I have been waiting for you
(Hey yeah yeah)
There has been no one brighter than you
I can't deny these things that I do
Feels like the world's at stake 'cause
I have been waiting, I have been waiting for you
I have seen no one brighter than you
I can't deny these things that I do
Feels like the world's at stake yeaaaaa
I have been waiting, I have been waiting for you
(Aaaaaa, for you, ba ba ba ba babaaaa, yeah yeah yeah)
Everyday I sit down and I feel like I'm waiting
For you
I've been waiting for you
For you
I have been waiting, I have been waiting for you
Ooh, don't pull it's legs! They're pulled!
Don't squeeze it too hard up, don't mash it up
Ooh, don't pull it's legs! They're pulled!
Don't squeeze it too hard up, don't crush it up
If you snap it like a twig, glue it back with little sticks
Put it back into the grass again
If you break a kitten's neck, you must shake it's body and check
If it's still alive be gone to sleep
If you snap it like a twig, glue it back with little sticks
Put it back into the grass again
Oh, what a shame that your pockets did bleed on St. Valentine's
And you sat in a chair thinkin' "Boy I'm such a prince"
Well life's a train that goes from February on day by day
But it's makin' a stop on April first
And you will believe in love
And all that it's supposed to be
But just until the fish start to smell
And you're struck down by a hammer
Sure you were swift when the handsome Greek boys dropped by with gifts
You are suave thanks to ribbons that opened sesame
But in the stars and closer to home in every planet
It ain't hard for me and dear JoJo to see
That you will believe in love
And all that it's supposed to be
But just until the fish start to smell
And you're struck down by a hammer
So let it all go by
Lookin' at the sky
Wonderin' if there's clouds and stuff in hell
Let it all go by (Looking at the sky)
Lookin' at the sky (Wonderin' if there's clouds and stuff in hell)
Wondering if there are clouds in hell
And you will believe in love
And all that it's supposed to be
Yes you will believe in love
Girl you will believe in love
And all that it's supposed to be
Yes you will believe in love
But you will believe in love
And all that it's supposed to be
Yes you will believe in love
And you will believe in love
And all that it's supposed to be
Yes you will believe in love
What's a man without all the attention?
Well, he's just a man
And why do you fear that no one will hear
What you've got to say?
Who am I without all your affection?
I'm a nobody, too
I'm not above being unloved
If that's how I've got to pay
You can tell everyone, everyone
That I've got your number, son
'Cause I can shine my light on
I can shine my light on, too
'Cause I can shine my light on
I can shine my light on you
I don't want to spend night after night with you
While you figure it out
While you're getting restless
I'm getting restless looking at you
I don't want to be your rock in hard times
'Cause I've figured you out
And you're not a man who can understand anyone but you
You can tell everyone, everyone
That I've got your number, son
'Cause I can shine my light on
I can shine my light on, too
'Cause I can shine my light on
I can shine my light on you
Would I sacrifice myself
At the altar of someone else's love for me?
No, that doesn't comfort me
You think you can creep in the shadows
While you figure it out
I've listened to enough of all of your stuff
To fill a book or two
And you can tell everyone, everyone
That I've got your number, son
'Cause I can shine my light on
I can shine my light on, too
'Cause I can shine my light on
I can shine my light on you
'Cause I can shine my light on
I can shine my light on you
She gives me money when I'm need
Yeah, she's kind of friend indeed
I got a woman, way over town
She's good to me
I got a woman, way over town
She's good to me, oh yeah (x2)
She saves her lovin' early in the morning
Just for me, oh yeah (x2)
She saves her lovin' just for me
Oh when she love me, love me, love me so tenderly
I got a woman, way over town
She's good to me
She's there to love me, all day and night
Never grumbles or fusses, always treats me right
Never running in the streets, leaving me all alone
Cause the woman, She knows a place
Is right there now in her home
I Got a woman, way over town
She's good to me, oh, yeah (x3)

Kid can you wake up?
Boy it ain't long 'til the warning arrives
And it's the shake-up
That's got me waiting for your dynamite
I never knew your middle name, no need to play that game 
I called your doctor up and he promised me pain was fun 
Tried a little bit of moving on, it lasted way too long
Dressed up as bubblegum, I'm stuck to your shoe, let's run
Can you give me that
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep
Two timing your state of mind, these feet got left behind 
We dive so deep we keep in touch with your buried bones 
Can I get a little fading on? (Fade it, fade it) Don't be long 
Dressed up as bubblegum, I'm stuck to your shoe, let's run
Can you give me that

Did they mistake us for an eight that's turning into a nine?
Said if I played the evil lover, can I trade you for your alibi? 
Done living like a runaway, break those hearts so carefully
Done living like a runaway 
Every time that I turn around, I let you down, you read my mind
Bring the beat back

Everyone's got a combination
If you put in the time
The numbers come like a revelation
You show me yours, I'll show you mine
And when you're down, girl, you got to know this
Nobody else is in your room
We'll make it through
Time is passing by, I still want you
Crime is on the rise, I still want you
Climate change and debt, I still want you
Nuclear distress, I still want you
The Earth is heating up, I still want you
Hurricanes and floods, I still want you
Even more than I did before
I used to think that I knew the big time
Before you came around
But I was up in the velvet goldmine
And you put my feet back on the ground
A piece of mine is a lot to ask for
These silly days, but we got it made
Don't let it fade
Time is passing by, I still want you
Crime is on the rise, I still want you
Climate change and debt, I still want you
Nuclear distress, I still want you
The Earth is heating up, I still want you
Hurricanes and floods, I still want you
Even more than I did before
And when your mind's made up
I'm gonna bring it down
And when you got no time
You gonna see it found
Your heart grows cold
There's something on the line
It's hard for me to show
There's something you should know
The time is passing by, I still want you
Crime is on the rise, I still want you
Climate change and debt, I still want you
Nuclear distress, I still want you
The Earth is heating up, I still want you
Hurricanes and floods, I still want you
Even more than I did before
The time is passing by, I still want you
Crime is on the rise, I still want you
Nuclear distress, I still want you
Climate change and debt, I still want you
The Earth is heating up, I still want you
Hurricanes and floods, I still want you
Even more than I did
Even more than I did before
If you find, if you, if you find out
That you can't decide on the path to take
If you find, if you, if you find out
That you can't define all the ways to say
If you find, if you, if you find out
That you can't define all the paths to take
If you find, if you, if you find out
That you can't decide all the ways to say
If you need, if you, if you need to
You can see through, you can see the way
If you need, if you, if you need to
You can see the truth, you can see the way
If you find, if you, if you find out
That you can't rely on the rails to race
If you find, if you, if you find out
That you can't rely on the rails to race
If you find, if you, if you find out
That you can't rely on the rails to race
Watch me overcome what I'm running from and change the tune
So I let it go what matters now is story soon
I get up
Try my luck
It starts to call on me
Never sure
How it feels
Let it rain on me
In the meantime you're in between time
In the meantime you're in between time
What I care to see
Lay your hands on me
And just for now
Let me bury too
What is scaring you
Is six feet underground
I got a whole bag of trouble to be taken away
And my veins keep throbbing when I'm out on display
Couldn't this be the moment you discover my intentions
Will you ever
Maybe never
Take me away to be closer
Take me away to be closer
In the meantime you're in between time
In the meantime you're in between time
In the meantime you're in between time
In the meantime you're in between time
I'm sending out all of my love
Do you have a heart to feel it?
You with the?
With the eyes to see it
Love goes ahead
Love stands beside
Love is within
Each heart to guide us
And I thank the sun for shining your light
And let your love blaze like
Fiya, wata
We are still learning
?
?
Some say, the river won't flow
They say it's gonna stay bone dry
We know what's up, the river will flow
Forever when time runs dry
We all be sharing a river of love
And letting love blaze like, fire
River, river, river, river
And river, it flows
Love like a river, a river, it flows
How will the?
But when you are, that's when a?
Our love does run, it's your reflection
It's true, we're one
We have each other
I know, yeah we are still learning
Until, the light we are returning
I love the sun, it's your reflection
We're two, we're one
We are reflections
Lay down your arms
Lay down your guns
Open your heart
Free your heart
I know one day I'll see you all
Falling down the river
To a place we never, ever go, go
Tonight our song will find it though
The song about the river
To ? the winter snow
And I think it's time for shining that light
I'm packed and I'm holding
I'm smiling, she's living
She's golden, she lives for me
Says she lives for me
Ovation, her own motivation
She comes 'round and she goes down on me
And I make her smile like a drug for you
Do ever what you want to do, coming over you
Keep on smiling, what we go through
One stop to the rhythm that divides you
And I speak to you like the chorus to the verse
Chop another line like a coda with a curse
Come on like a freak show takes the stage
We give them the games we play, she said
I want something else
To get me through this
Semi-charmed kind of life, baby, baby
I want something else
I'm not listening when you say goodbye
The sky was gold, it was rose
I was taking sips of it through my nose
And I wish I could get back there
Some place back there
Smiling in the pictures you would take
Doing crystal meth will lift you up until you break
It won't stop, I won't come down, I keep stock
With a tick-tock rhythm, a bump for the drop
And then I bumped up, I took the hit that I was given
And I bumped again and I bumped again
I said
How do I get back there
To the place where I fell asleep inside you?
How do I get myself back to the place where you said
I want something else
To get me through this
Semi-charmed kind of life, baby, baby
I want something else
I'm not listening when you say goodbye
I believe in the sand beneath my toes
The beach gives a feeling, an earthy feeling
I believe in the faith that grows
And the four right chords can make me cry
When I'm with you I feel like I could die
And that would be all right, all right
And when the plane came in, she said she was crashing
The velvet, it rips in the city
We tripped on the urge to feel alive
Now I'm struggling to survive
Those days you were wearing that velvet dress
You're the priestess, I must confess
Those little red panties they pass the test
Slide up around the belly, face down on the mattress
One, and you hold me
And we are broken
Still it's all that I want to do
Just a little now
Feel myself hovering off the ground
I'm scared, I'm not coming down, no no
And I won't run for my life
She's got her jaws now locked down in a smile
But nothing is all right, all right
And I want something else to get me through this life, baby
I want something else, not listening when you say
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
The sky was gold, it was rose
I was taking sips of it through my nose
And I wish I could get back there
Some place back there
In the place we used to start
I want something else
Mothers see it coming around
They know they got their heads screwed on
I'm standing in the middle of town
I know I might never come home
Just standing where I am with all the people passing by me
The sound of all these passers-by mixed in with the bus andmotor-car
I must be sure these are the signs
'Cause I've been here a million times before
Just tell me when it's coming around, coming around
I think I see you coming to town,
Hunting you down Bringing you round
Tell me if I'm bringing you down
'Cause I was fine till you came along
You tell me that the tears of a clown
That I'm confusing while abusing my mind
So far away I wanna be
That's not as close to you and me
The things they call our destiny
Now why do you have to pick on me at all?
My walls are coming down
Just tell me when it's coming around, coming around
I think I see you coming to town, hunting you down
Coming around
Just tell me when it's coming around, coming around
I think I see you coming to town, dragging you down
Just tell me when it's coming around, coming around
I think I see you coming to town, just dragging you down
It's coming around
Coming around
This is a black market reformation,
Keep your lips closed,
And don't you ever give away our underground location,
This is a black tie affair,
Don't ever close your mouth,
And we'll stay here until someone falls in their own snare,
I had this planned all along, and I brought you here for this,
So tie your mask on and pretend that nothing's wrong.
And I'll try to stay awake as long as I can,
And I'll try to stay here with you.
This is a black market reformation,
How does it feel to be under the gun?
Last ones to laugh pull the trigger here on the run
You can hide the money, I'll mark an X,
I am above the law and you're the order,
You make everything make sense.
And I'll try to stay awake as long as I can,
And I'll try to stay here with you.
And I know Mexico is south of here,
Beautiful this time of year,
So let's jump the border when the coast is clear,
Salvation waits at ocean shore,
We won't have to lie no more,
Don't you worry baby I'll be right here.
And I'll try to stay awake as long as I can,
And I'll try to stay here with you.
And I'll try to stay awake as long as I can,
And I'll try to stay here with you.

Maestro, as you paint this picture would you
Tell me what - what's going on
In your mind.
Now the cross, the mystical, vertical cross.
Out of black paint,
(... Via con questo coso per... cortesia...)
A cros comes down from the top left hand
Side of the canvas.
(Via con quella testa per cortesia!)
He has just thrown a bunch of gold paint
Which has not only hit me in the face
(... Ostia...)
But has gone across the canvas to the
Applause of the crowd below.
(... Calma... aspetta... ahó aspetta cazoo, eh...
Adesso, aspetta!)
Now some black paint
(... Giù con quella test! giù la testa nico... via
Via con quel coso lí porcoddio...)
This is the head, this is the head -
This is the head of the black death.
The canvas and the photographers are
Covered with paint.
I might add, its black paint and gold paint on
A white canvas.
(... Un pochettino un pochettino! 'causeí 'causeí dai!
Pií in lá!)
(Crowd)
That was a - a big slash of paint.
What is this.
(Ah ah ah ah (dialetto) è bellissimo?? non
Va piè via... (dialetto) guarda,
No, no, no! Eeeh!)
Now he got even with the photographers who
Have been covering the canvas,
And opens the canvas and out comes twelve
Pigeons! Ha ha ha!
Twelve homing pigeons have just flown out of
The canvas.
Maestro, what are you doing?
(Applause)
You call this painting...
Le Lion de St. Mark.
The lion of St. Mark
Hommage à Venice.
Homage to Venice, the home (ha ha) of the
Lion of St. Mark.
Take your friends and move them out
We are the chase-ups of the night
Losers-bite it
But we don't go down without a fight
Ugly trends and pick-up lines
Have shattered its own pride
Hopes and dreams and memories
Have stopped to say good-byes
One more song we can sing along to
Our big break
No more mistakes
One more time, we'll do what we have to
To get this off the ground
One more song we can sing along to
Our big break
No more mistakes
One more time, we'll do what we have to
To get this off the ground
No more should've-been, no more could've-been
There's no last thing now
Carve into the drawing board, just to wash it clean
They big talk but they will never say what they mean
Crowded floors and sleepless nights,
Photographs and stupid fights
Hopes and dreams and memories
You can't take away from me
Oh, oh oh oh, yeah
One more song we can sing along to
Our big break
No more mistakes
One more time, we'll do what we have to
To get this off the ground
One more song we can sing along to
Our big break
No more mistakes
One more time, we'll do what we have to
To get this off the ground
No more should've-been, no more could've-been
There's no last week
No more should've-been, no more could've-been
There's no last thing now
Whoa, yeah
Whoa, yeah
We only get one chance at this
In this life it's hit or miss
My hopes and dreams and memories
You can't take away from me
One more song we can sing along to
Our big break
No more mistakes
One more time, we'll do what we have to
To get this off the ground
One more song we can sing along to
Our big break
No more mistakes
One more time, we'll do what we have to
To get this off the ground
No more should've-been, no more could've-been
There's no last week now
Come tomorrow I'll be on my way back home.
In the morning call from a roadside telephone.
One night doesn't mean the rest of my life.
If I go it's not impossible
Possible is probably wrong.
So, let go
'Cause I'm afraid to try
Keep my hands by my side.
You won't come back
I hope some day you'll understand
I wanna try, make it right
Don't know if I can.
Last night everything was right
The rain was gone.
One summer night's the only time we've known.
So, shut your eyes
When you wake up I'll be gone.
When you wake up I'll be gone.
One night doesn't mean the rest of my life.
If I go it's not impossible
Possible is probably wrong.
So, let go
Because I'm afraid to try
I wake up in a room and realize I'm insane again
This is the fifth time straight in a year I've ended up in here
Eating p.b.j's and watching the church channel nightly
I didn't mind what I did
I fell behind on my nightly four-course meal of rainbow pills
And now I'm wondering what is fake and what is real
But who's that ghost who keeps walking by my door
I've never seen a girl look so good in thick-rimmed glasses before
And I feel her gaze on me during sleeping hours and when I shower
They let us play with markers but I keep trying to draw infinity
And I read the bible to pass the time
But one day out of nowhere, she sits down and looks over my shoulder
I'm shaking harder then I've ever shook before.
Hayley Williams:
"Oh, do you remember me? is your mind that worn?
We both were born to be one with that which the public scorned
Though you were forlorn
In despair with your drugs and your hardcore porn
Trust me, those days won't be mourned."
So lay your head on me
So lay your head onto me.
Is it over yet? When she spent the week in bed
Cause all your wrongs are wrong and you can't make em' right
Was it all a dream, cause your finally breaking free
We're gonna to feel the rush coming over us tonight
'Cause we're going going gone
Throw your hands to the sky like your flying
Throw your hands in the air 'cause we'll shake it up tonight
Hot hot like a fire
When electric hearts, collide
We're gonna to crash around, till we wake this whole damn town
We're gonna flip the switch, and plug it in
And when you loss control
When your beating heart explodes
Your going to scream along to every song we sing to you
'Cause we're going going gone
Throw your hands to the sky like your flying
Throw your hands in the air 'cause we'll shake it tonight
Hot hot like a fire
When electric hearts
Throw your hands to the sky like your flying
Throw your hands in the air 'cause we'll shake it tonight
Hot hot like a fire
When electric hearts, electric hearts
We're gonna take your breath away
Your gonna scream the pain away
And try your luck again, be strong, don't bend
Just give it all we can and do it again
Throw your hands to the sky like your flying
Throw your hands in the air 'cause we'll shake it tonight
Hot hot like a fire
When electric hearts
Throw your hands to the sky like your flying
Throw your hands in the air 'cause we'll shake it tonight
Hot hot like a fire
When electric hearts
Throw your hands to the sky like your flying
Throw your hands in the air 'cause we'll shake it tonight
Hot hot like a fire
When electric hearts, electric hearts
When electric hearts, collide
Smudged funnies in a broken bottle
On the dot at nine
So Daddy throws clothes, throws on an old stove
I'm crying in the corner at five
Well I've seen black
And I've seen blue
But fine lines I don't see
And just because I am in misery
Don't it mean a thing
That I wanna know
That I wanna know
Graduation Day, Graduation Day
We take back everything we said about you
September, as far as she remembers
They don't teach humility
And just because her only signal is mayday
Don't it mean a thing
That she's seen love
And she's seen war
But fairness she don't see
And just because she is in misery
Don't it mean a thing
That she wants to know
That she wants to know
Graduation Day, Graduation Day
We take back everything we said about you
Graduation Day, Graduation Day
We take back everything we said to...
The camaraderie's old
Doing what I'm told
And everybody knows
This is getting out of hand
Everybody is dying for
The chance to be heard, not ignored
And everybody knows
This is getting out of hand
Graduation Day, Graduation Day
We take back everything we said about you
Graduation Day, Graduation Day
We take back everything we said to...
I'm not gonna
I'm not gonna
I ain't goin' to school
I'm not gonna
I'm not gonna
I'm not goin' to school
Bright future, bright pink
Bright light in my eyes, oh, this desert's a tease
Giant heart, down in this dust
Fell to the earth at a fascinating speed
Well, further up in the ponderosa
The nervous coyotes caterwauling, their choruses foreboding
And couldn't you've stayed on the ground?
Couldn't you have stayed on your feet?
But your mind was wound so tightly
Always bold and wise and unsettling
I live in your tall trees, amongst your fearless leaves
Saw the bright colors, bright future
The night is patient, the night's a glass dome
The night is still and cold but this desert can turn
Your restless mind was born in a flash
And you lived in these clouds with lightning in your feet
And yes, your mind was wound so tightly
Always bold and wise and unsettling
I live in your tall trees, amongst your fearless leaves
Saw the bright colors, bright future
You may think me very naive
Taken as true
I only see what I want to see
Avoid eye contact at all costs
What can I do
To see your fine teeth smiling at me
You might say
That we should build a city of tears
All I'm saying
Is I'm alone and consequently
Only my tears satisfy the real need of my heart
I resist
You say that there's a thousand like you
Maybe that's true
I fell or you and nobody else
So I'm standing here so lonely
What can I do
But learn to laugh at myself
You might say
That we should build a city of tears
All I'm saying
Is I'm alone and consequently
Only my tears satisfy the real need of my heart
I resist
Fall falling falling again
'Cause I want to take the pleasure with the pa-in
Fall falling - falling again
'Cause I wan to take
The pleasure with the pain pain pain pain pain pain pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-in
Falling and laughing
Falling and laughing
Falling and laughing
Falling and laugh - ing
Our frank and open
Deep conversations
They get me nowhere
They bring me down, so
Give it a rest, won't you?
Give me a cigarette
God give me patience
Just no more conversation
Oh, give us a drink
And make it quick
Or else I'm gonna be sick
Sick all over
Your frankly vulgar
Red pullover
Now see how the colors blend
Our frank and open
Deep conversations
They get me nowhere
They just bring me down, so
Give it a rest, won't you?
Now will you just give over?
The world may be ending
But look, I'm only human
So, give us a drink
And make it quick
Or else I'm gonna be sick
All over
Your frankly vulgar
Red pullover
Now see how the two colors blend, my friend
(Won't somebody help?)
Won't somebody stop me
From thinking
From thinking all the time
About everything
Oh, somebody
From thinking all the time
So deeply, so bleakly?
So bleakly all the time
About everything?
(Who I am, how I ever got here)
Somebody stop me
From thinking
From thinking all the time
So bleakly, so bleakly
So bleakly all the time
Lazy confessions
Crazy intentions
Scratching unwilling
Sports cars are thrilling
I like potatoes
I don't like tomatoes
I'm goin' fishin
'Cause I'm on a mission
I wanna live for today
I wanna roll in the hay
But I'm floating away
I got nothing to say
It makes me slappy
To walk like your pappy
I need to improvise
Just lookin' at the pies
Boohoo I'm dying
Ravenous sighing
I think you're pretty
My shrink says I'm witty
I wanna live for today
I wanna roll in the hay
But I'm floating away
I got nothing to say
But I'm floating away
I got nothing to say
People are wasteful, they waste all the food
People are hateful, and people are rude
But God I love some people sometimes
Because people are very very special
And people are impatient, they don't know how to wait
And people are selfish, and people are prone to hate
But God I love some people sometimes
Because people are the greatest thing to happen
I said God I love some people sometimes
Because people are the greatest thing to happen
And People are people, regardless of skin
And people are people, regardless of creed
People are people regardless of gender
People are people regardless of anything
I said people are people regardless of gender
People are people regardless of anything
And people are my religion, because I believe in them
People are my enemies and people are my friends
I have faith in my fellow man
And I only hope that he has faith in me
I said I have faith in my fellow man
And I only hope that he has faith in me
Trying to find the perfect match between pretentious and pop,
Some crappy artwork that took too way way long to draw,
Hand-written track listing restarted every time the pen smudged,
Encoded title doesn't give away as much as it should.
It started with a mix, 
How did it come to this?
I think it always will.

Some people wind up
With the one that they adore
In a heart-shaped hotel room
It's what a heart is for
The bubble floats so madly
Will it stay sky-high?
Hello partner, kiss your name bye-bye
Sometimes
Romantic Piscean seeks angel in disguise
Chinese-speaking girlfriend, big brown eyes
Liverpudlian lady, sophisticated male
Hello partner, tell me love can't fail
And it's you and me in the summertime
We'll be hand-in-hand down in the park
With a squeeze and a sigh
And that twinkle in your eye
And all the sunshine banishes the dark
Some people wind up
With the one that they abhor
In a distant hell-hole room
This third World War
But all I see is films where a colourless despair
Meant angry young men with immaculate hair
Sometimes
"Get up" a voice inside says
"There's no time for looking down
Only a pound a word 
And you're talking to the town"
And how do you coin the phrase though
That will set your soul apart
Just to touch a lonely heart
And it's you and me in the summertime
We'll be hand-in-hand down in the park
With a squeeze and a sigh
And the twinkle in your eye
And all the sunshine banishes the dark
And it's you I need in the summertime
As I turn my white skin red
Two peas from the same pod, yes we are
Or have I read too much fiction?
Is this how it happens?
How does it happen?
How does it happen?
How does it happen?
Is this how it happens?
Now, right now
Goodbye
Goodbye-ee-eye

Everyday I look across the office floor, there you were
Your hair down to your legs and your legs down to the floor
Leggy Blonde, goodbye, goodbye
Now that you are gone, I'll never see here for tech repair
Wish you knew how much I loved your legs and your hair
Leggy Blonde, goodbye, goodbye
Leggy, Leggy, Leggy, Leggy
Leggy, Leggy, Leggy, Leggy
Leggy, Leggy, Leggy, Leggy
Leggy, Leggy, Leggy, Leggy
Blondie, Blondie, Blondie, Blondie
Blondie, Blondie, Blondie, Blondie
Blondie, Blondie, Blondie, Blondie
Blondie, Blondie
Leggy Blonde, goodbye, goodbye
I had a budgie but it died
Whoa-oh whoa
I like pie
Leggy, Leggy, Leggy, Leggy
Leggy, Leggy, Leggy, Leggy
Leggy, Leggy, Leggy, Leggy
Leggy, Leggy, Leggy, Leggy (Whoa-oh whoa)
Blondie, Blondie, Blondie, Blondie
Blondie, Blondie, Blondie, Blondie
Blondie, Blondie, Blondie, Blondie
Blondie, Blondie
Leggy Blonde
I'll never get, I'll never get to be with you
I'll never get to share another cup of tea with you
Never get to let you know how much I think of you
I'll never get to tear your clothes off on the photo copier
He'll never get
He'll never get
He'll never get
He'll never get to say
Hoop, Leggy Blonde, you got it goin' on
Wanna see you wearin' that thong, thong, thong
See you gettin' down till the break of dawn
Doesn't really count with your panties on
Goodbye
I have been crazy
But that's just all right, all right
I have been lonely
But that's just all right, all right
My feelings I don't
Hide them, hide them, hide them
Inside they keep on
Burning, burning, burning
Your feelings you shouldn't
Hide them, hide them, hide them
From me...
Nah na na no 'right
Come and get it if you really want it
Come and get it if you really need it
Come and get it if you really want it
Come and get it if you really need it
I don't feel so unfortunate
But that's just all right, all right
I have been treated so badly, baby
But that's just all right, all right
My feelings I don't
Hide them, hide them, hide them
Inside they keep on
Burning, burning, burning
Your feelings you shouldn't
Hide them, hide them, hide them
From me...
Nah na na no 'right
Come and get it if you really want it
Come and get it if you really need it
Come and get it if you really want it
Come and get it if you really need it
Every man has been broken
Every women too
The reason I think I'm something special baby
Is 'cause I was never broken by you
Come and get it if you really want it
Come and get it if you really need it
Come and get it if you really want it
Come and get it if you really need it
Come and get it if you really want it
Come and get it if you really need it
Come and get it if you really want it
Come and get it if you really need it
We'll wake up your mothers, we'll start a commotion
We'll take you apart, we'll swallow the ocean
And just when you've labeled us one of your types
We'll fly our flag right up up out of your sky
So puff out your chest in some weird dusty fight
We're taking no part in your cracked antique life
We're believing everything that we have heard
We're taking our turn with the kids that don't learn
You know I'm going to take my turn
Let us be free, let us sing songs along
The bottoms of barrels, let us be free
So out come you clowns, all you wolves, all you martyrs
You holy rat rattlers, holy found fathers
We're selling ourselves so ourselves can find
We're living at night trying to pull out the light
We'll turn up the heat as we burn up you boxes
We'll loosen our wrists as we fill in your foxholes
You've got your bad apples to ruin your bunch
Yeah we're all right here so you better eat up
Oh yeah, there's nothing you can do
If you want me here, you can have me here
If you want me now, you can have me now
If you want me down, I will get really low
You better believe I'll be down by your shoes
If you want it all, you can have it all
If you want some more, come and get some more
'Cause the dirt feels good when you're underground
You better believe that we're all getting down
You know that us feral kids love straying about
So start giving in, yeah you better get down
If you don't believe me,
If you don't like my plans,
You musn't tell me,
How I know your face like the back of my hands.
We walk the city,
I talk to you, understand
So won't you tell me.
How I know this place like the back of my hands.
My arms get cold,
In February air.
Please don't lose hold of me, out there.
And I know you're near me.
I know you understand.
Say that you're with me.
Say you know my face like the back of your hands.
My arms get cold,
In February air.
Please don't lose hold of me out there.
My arms get cold,
In February air.
Please don't lose hold of me, out there.
My arms get cold,
In February air.
Please don't lose hold of me out there.
My arms get cold,
In February air.
Please don't lose hold of me out there.
And I know this place like the back of my hands
I found the truth beneath your lies
And true love never has to hide
(True love never has to hide)
I'll trade your broken wings for mine
(Trade your broken wings for mine)
I've seen your scars and kissed your crime, oh
(Seen your scars and kissed your crime)
So many people that I know, they're just tryna touch ya
Kiss up and rub up and feel up
Kiss up and rub up and feel up on you
Give some time to prove that I can trust you again
I'm gonna kiss up and rub up and feel up
Kiss up and rub up and feel up on you
All night long
Sweet love all night long
Sweet love all night long
Sweet love all night long
All I wanna, ain't no other
We together, I remember
Sweet love all night long
Our love was stronger than your pride
Beyond your darkness, I'm your light, oh
If you get deep, you'll touch my mind
(If you get deep, you'll touch my mind)
Baptize your tears and dry your eyes, oh
(Baptize your tears and dry your eyes)
There's so many people I know, they're just tryna touch ya
Kiss up and rub up and feel up
Kiss up and rub up and feel up on you
Give you some time to prove that I can trust you again
I'm gonna kiss up and rub up and feel up
Kiss up and rub up and feel up on you
All night long
Sweet love all night long
Sweet love all night long
Sweet love all night long
All I wanna, ain't no other
We together, I remember
Sweet love all night long
They say true love's the greatest weapon
To win the war caused by pain (pain)
But every diamond has imperfections
But my love's too pure to watch it chip away (chip-a, chip-a, chip away)
Oh, nothing real can be threatened
True love breathes salvation back into me
With every tear came redemption
And my torturer became my remedy
So many people I know, they're just tryna touch ya
Kiss up and rub up and feel up
Kiss up and rub up and feel up on you
Give you some time to prove that I can trust you again
I'm gonna kiss up and rub up and feel up
Kiss up and rub up and feel up on you
All night long
Sweet love all night long
Sweet love all night long
Sweet love all night long
All I wanna, ain't no other
We together, I remember
Sweet love all night long
How I missed you, my love
I kissed you goodbye at the airport
Held you so close to me
I said: "So here we are now and I can't stop from crying Lilly"
And you said: "Hey hey ho, you know this is the way to go
You will forget about me when I'm on that plane
Forget about me when I'm on that plane"
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
I wanna be with you tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
I wanna be with you tonight
The plane took off and my love went with it
The chilly wind whipped my both cheeks hard
And the man that stood there next to me said "Everything is gonna be alright"
I said: "Nothing is gonna be alright, but thank you anyway"
And then I saw your face in the airplane window
I waved my hands and I shouted to you:
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
I wanna be with you tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
I wanna be with you tonight
I wore a T-shirt and my worn out hat
Abandoned as a summer cat
And as I stood there as a broken hearted
I realized you got the car keys still
So I broke into my own old car
I fell asleep on the passenger seat
I dreamed of summer sex with you and you whispered in my ear:
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
I wanna be with you tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
I wanna be with you tonight
Why can't you leave me tomorrow instead?
Why can't you leave me tomorrow instead?
And above the clouds she said to herself
"I can't believe how naive a man can be
That's why I love you so and that's why I can't be with you"
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
I wanna be with you tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
I wanna be with you tonight
You know it kills me to see such a pretty girl so tired
You've got your mother's cheekbones and your father's crooked smile
Forget all those places that you've never really been
And all those situations you somehow found yourself in
Let your body sink into me
Like your favorite memory
Like a line of poetry
Or a fucking fit of honesty
I'll do my best to keep you, keep you sleepy as the south
With my old watch on your wrist
And my thumbs inside your mouth
Suck on my fingertips until you kill all my prints
So your boyfriend has no clue
Of how much I've been touching you
My problem with me is my problem with you
It doesn't take much
For me to come unglued
I put my headphones on
And hear your favorite songs
And it kills me to know
That this won't be one of them
You know it saves me to think even for a little while
I owned the set of shoulders that you came to rely on
Like in that movie theater when you whispered in my ear
I almost didn't make it
This has been my hardest year
Your job is killing you faster than a cancer could
So now you're giving up like they always said you would
You've got that old map out now and you found the farthest town
You hope that if you're lucky this is where you'll settle down
I don't care where you move I don't care if it's far
All that I ask is that I know where you are 
In case our timing is right
In case you need more from me
Than a bit of advice
Or a tongue full of sympathy
I'd like to have company during thunderstorms
I'd like you to fall for me but it would soon turn lousy and wrong
I meant what I said, all I want is to be one of the best
Been getting some extra help from a special band
Oh yeah, they've been helping us out
And we're thankful they're lending a hand
Here is my request, play the ones that we all know best
I don't do crowds, everyone put it down to rudeness
I laughed out loud, could they all see that it was madness?
Please come to save me from myself again
To shield me to disguise that my heart has a secret
And this will make you sigh and me cry
Oh, will there be dancing in the hall tonight?
'Cause if there is dancing I won't lack fight
It seems I'm less afraid of life itself than of what you see
You turned the heads of every boy and girl alike
Would you have them all if there were enough hours in the night?
You took care of your skin
Sure did help but it didn't solve everything
I don't do crowds, everyone put it down to rudeness
I laughed out loud, could they all see that it was sadness?
Please come to save me from myself again
To shield me to disguise that my heart has a secret
And this will make you sigh, you sigh, you sigh and me cry
I find it funny that you never even knew
All the times when I stole a look from you
Oh, what's in my mind
Oh, they're gonna put me away this time
Only just a friend the love story begins
Now here's a happy ending to believe in
You're always there for me, now you're with me in dreams
It's got me wondering if you ever dream of me
I don't wanna risk losing everything
But I'll take the chance and tell you what I'm thinking
Girl, you've been my best friend
Can we put this to bed then
Tonight's the night to cross the line
Baby won't you be mine
Not just my home girl
Time that I take you home girl
Tonight's the night to cross the line
Let me love you tonight.
I ... I ... I ...
Kiss (kiss) kiss (kiss) kiss me on my lips
We've been dancin round the moment now we're doin' it
Then breathe (breathe) breathe (breathe) a sigh of sweet relief
We been holding it so long the wait was killing me
Oh and we oh and we have been waiting for
So baby open your mind while I close the door
Oh girl,
You've been my best friend
Can we put this to bed then
Tonight's the night to cross the line
Baby won't you be mine
Not just my home girl
Time that I take you home girl
Tonight's the night to cross the line
Let me love you night
I ... I ... I ...
Don't let this moment slip away
'Cause we'll never know unless we try it someday
If you're ready I'm so ready
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night
Oh girl,
You've been my best friend
Can we put this to bed then
Tonight's the night to cross the line
Baby won't you be mine
Not just my home girl
Time that I take you home girl
Tonight's the night to cross the line
Let me love you night
I check my bed for bugs and spiders
Though I don't really think they're there
I check my head, it's getting tighter
I want to stop, but I don't dare
I will not sleep until I've counted to 200 three times
I will not sleep until my pencils lie in a straight line
Goodnight, goodbye
It's late, and I'm too tired to cry
Goodnight, goodbye
Just let me close my weary eyes
I pray to God twice in the evenings
And check the stove four times each day
I spin around the door to make sure that it's locked
And wear these lucky socks until they fade away
The house might burn down, and it's all my fault if that puddle doesn't get me wet
If I get home before the rain you're mine, but I won't bet
Goodnight, goodbye
It's late, and I'm too tired to cry
Goodnight, goodbye
Just let me close my weary eyes
One day, I'll be stepping
On cracks and close my eyes
But I'm too tired to argue with myself
I'll just do this one more time
Goodnight, goodbye
It's late, and I'm too tired to cry
Goodnight, goodbye
Just let me close my weary eyes
Get comfortable, get unfrustrated
Get healthy, and all the things that you want
I do, I do, I do not
Fuck with the sure shot
Not serious, about the way that you are
Carolina, happy belated
Always golden, still the greatest
Not sensible, I wanna marry a dancer
Vegetarian, can't stand to be wrong
I do, I do, I do not
Fuck with the sure shot
Not serious or taken seriously
Oh Carolina, happy belated
Always golden, still the greatest
'Cause it's there on the tip of your tongue,
On the back of your hand,
In the place that you had it last,
You need to be careful
All in a single night,
In a single dose,
Is the best of the best for me,
So what do you need, what do you need, what do you need?
Is it a call for an emergency?
So what is it like
For your song on karaoke night?
Oh Carolina, happy belated
Always golden, still the greatest
It's a fiasco at your back door once again
Run up at you hot footed, catch me if you can
It's a hop to a step to a jiggity drop
And then I'm back coming at you with a biggity bop
Now clap your hands high, no need to be shy
Shimmy down and show us part of in the meantime
Skip to it, stretch to it, taking a twist
Hear the sound coming round, see what you nearly missed
Like nothing's gonna happen
For we spent the summer in your birthday
So we
You think you'll never get
In the confusion of revolution, tell me how
Think of something, look, look following the crowd
Now walk with me, walk with me, keep up for sure
Stomp, stomp the beat
Prove that you're rock steady
Live your life
Live your life
Instrumental
Do you wanna dance and hold my hand?
Tell me baby I'm your lover man
Oh baby, do you wanna dance? 
Well do you wanna dance under the moonlight?
Squeeze me baby all through the night
Oh baby, do you wanna dance?
Do you, do you, do you, do you wanna dance?
Do you, do you, do you, do you wanna dance?
Do you, do you, do you
Do you wanna dance?
Well he's watching all the wealthy folk on his way to work
Saturady's so far away there's so mush shit to shirk,
He's got to keep his chin up
He's got to keep his nerve
But he just wants so skin Up
Sit down
And flaming well sod those who he serves
What's the use of money of you got no time to use it?
He don't want to sell his life to you
You know he'd rather have his time
Than a Bob or two
Can't find the money for your rent
Or repay the loans your lent
You better turn to god
Cause your up shit creek
And your Sailing into hell
You'll be wailing when they sell your soul to the repo man
Now he's unemployed he lives on milk and bread
His graduate account is so far in the red
He listened to his heart when he should have used his head
He suffers for his art
He's so Skint
His tenancy is hanging by a thread
Now he's got the time
He hasn't got the money
To do this things that people do
But still he'd rather have his time than a bob or two
Can't find the money for your rent
Or repay the loans your lent
You better turn to god
Cause your up shit creek
And your Sailing into hell
You'll be wailing when they sell your soul to the repo man
All of his money is gone
(All of his money is gone)
What did he spend it all on
(What did he spend it all on)
He's never had so much fun
(He's never had so much fun)
All of his money is gone
(All of his money is gone)
Oh No,
Now my last penny has been spent
Still my life is heaven sent
'Cause I got my friends
To help me through this time
I'll repay you in the end
Don't you worry
I promise you I'll pay you back with Time
Can't find the money for your rent
Or repay the loans your lent
You better turn to god
Cause your up shit creek
And your Sailing into hell
You'll be wailing when they sell your soul to the repo man
All of his money is gone
(Find the money for your rent, find the money for your rent)
She got out first ... away from me
Light and day
Is more than you'll say
Cause all my feelings
Are more than I can let by
Or not
It's more than you've got
Just follow the day
Follow the day and reach for the sun
You don't see me fly into the red - one more you're done
Just follow the seasons and find the time
Reach for the bright side
You don't see me fly into the red - one more you're nuts
Just follow the day
Follow the day and reach for the sun
Just follow the day
Follow the day and reach for the sun
You don't see me fly into the red - one more you're done
Just follow the seasons and find the time
Reach for the bright side
You don't see me fly into the red - one more you're nuts
Just follow the day
Follow the day and reach for the sun
Just follow the day
Follow the day and reach for the sun
Just follow the day
Follow the day and reach for the sun
Sha la la la la la la la la la la la
Sha la la la la la la la la la la la
I hear a song makes me think of a girl I used to know
I sing along when I hear it on the radio now
Hey, now where'd we go?
Ooh yeah, days when the rains came
Way down in the hollows
Ooh yeah, playing a new game
Laughing and a running, hey hey hey
Skipping and a jumping, yeah yeah
In the misty morning fog
Oh baby, yeah my heart's a thumping, you
My brown eyed girl
You my brown eyed girl
Do you remember when? (Do you remember when?)
Yeah, we used to sing
Sha la la la la la la
La la la la la
Sha la la la la la la
La la la la la
I hear a song it makes me think of a girl I used to know
Yeah, yeah, yeah (la la la)
I sing along when I hear it on the radio now
Ooh, now that the years gone by
Yeah, now that I'm on my own
I saw you just the other day
But my baby, you have grown
I cast my memory back there, Lord
Sometimes I am overcome just thinking about it
Making love in the green grass
Behind the stadium with you
My brown eyed girl
You my brown eyed girl
You my brown eyed girl
Do you remember when? (Do you remember when?)
(Do you remember when? Do you remember when?)
Yeah, we used to sing
Sha la la la la la la
La la la la la
Sha la la la la la la
La la la la la
Sha la la la la la la
La la la la la, la la
I hear a song it makes me think of a girl I used to know
(Hey, hey, hey, hey) La la la
I sing along when I hear it on the radio now
(Hey, hey, hey, hey)
I sing along when I hear it on the radio now
I sing along when I hear it on the radio now
On the ferris wheel
Looking out on Coney Island
Under more stars than
There are prostitues in Thailand
Our hair in the air
Our lips blue from cotton candy
When we kiss it feels
Like a flying saucer landing
And I can't sleep
Cause you got strange powers
You're in my dreams
Strange powers
In Las Vegas where
The electric bills are staggering
The decor hog wild
And the entertainment saccharin
What a golden age,
What a time of right and reason
The consumers king
And unhappiness is treason
And I can't sleep
Cause you got strange powers
You're in my dreams
Strange powers
The sun falls down like money
The moon pours down like mercury
The stars fall down like money
And you come back to me
Strange powers
Pray for content, settle for free rent
The tenements recall Rome
High five, look up, look alive
As the scions of history guess another mystery wrong
Wrong, wrong
Recite your lines and I'll quote scriptures
Everything was fine until membership lost its privileges
Everyone in town wanted to be around you
This went on for awhile until they finally found you
Ever so careful on the strip
We cruise crippled in someone else's shoes
Who knew? Mind you I never had to stand in line
You did for the ballad of a comeback kid
Watch your step
As you step down from the podium
Returned from the war to a hero's welcome
What's more, you just had to win
Blazing new trails
Waving goodbye to the audience
Held captive, the crowd was inactive
It made such perfect sense
Ever so careful on the strip
We cruise crippled in someone else's shoes
Who knew? Mind you. I never had to stand in line
You did
But you won't
Kelly says she could have
But you won't
Kelly says she could have
Like a bat out of hell, time has come for you
Like a bat out of hell, time has come for you
Like a bat out of hell, time has come for you
Ever so careful on the strip
We cruise crippled in someone else's shoes
Who knew? Mind you, I never had to stand in line
You did
Ever so careful on the strip
We cruise crippled in someone else's shoes
Who knew? Mind you, I never had to stand in line
You did for the ballad of a comeback kid
I know you're making
Accidents and stars for everyone
You're amazing
Half of them won't know until you're gone
And in this ritual
You take command and lose control
And in this situation
Find an ocean, sell your soul
Fly around my pretty little miss
Why don't you fly around my pretty little miss?
Why don't you fly around my pretty little miss?
Why don't you fly around my pretty little miss?
And when it's over
Set aside a moment to forget
It's now or never
Now's the chance to choose what you'll regret
To taking all your time
And leaving me with more than I want
Because I know this time
Absolutely, positively
Maybe, maybe
Maybe, maybe
Maybe, maybe
Maybe
Fly around my pretty little miss
Why don't you fly around my pretty little miss?
Why don't you fly around my pretty little miss?
Why don't you fly around my pretty little miss?
And all the signs of your life
You're making all time alright
And all the lines of your life
You make it fine
And when it's later
Open up your window just in case
You're a radar
Built to scan the deeps of outer space
And if you recognize
Subtle patterns in the sky
Don't take it as a sign
Unless it eases your mind
Why don't you fly around my pretty little miss?
Why don't you fly around my pretty little miss?
Why don't you fly around my pretty little miss?
Why don't you fly around my pretty little miss?

Tonight I'm gonna have myself a real good time,
I feel ali-ha-ha-hive and the world's turning inside out,
I'm floating around in ecstasy
Don't stop me now don't stop me now
I'm having a good time having a good time.
I'm a shooting star dancing through the sky
Like a tiger defying the laws of gravity
I'm a racing car passing by like Lady Godiva
I'm gonna go go go
There's no stopping me.
I'm burning through the night!
Two hundred degrees
I said they call me Mister Fahrenheit
I'm traveling at the speed of light
I'm gonna make a supersonic man of you.
Don't stop me now I'm having such a good time
I'm having a ball, don't stop me now
If you wanna have a good time, just give me a call
Oh baby! Don't stop me now (I'm having a good time)
Don't stop me now (I'm having a good time)
Never want to stop at all.
I'm a rocket ship on my way to Mars
On a collision course
I am a satellite, I'm out of control
I am a sex machine ready to reload
Like an atom bomb I'm gonna:
Oh oh oh oh oh explode!
I'm burning through the night!
Two hundred degrees
I said they call me Mister Fahrenheit
I'm traveling at the speed of light
I'm gonna make a supersonic woman out of you.
Don't stop me, don't stop me, don't stop me, don't stop me
Hey hey hey!
Don't stop me don't stop me
(Good Time, Good Time) Don't stop me, don't stop me
Whoa whoa whoa explode!
Burning through the night!
Two hundred degrees
I said hey call me Mister Fahrenheit
I'm trav'ling at the speed of light
I'm gonna make a supersonic woman of you.
Don't stop me now, I'm having such a good time
I'm having a ball, oh baby, don't stop me now
If you wanna have a good time
Just give me a call
Oh baby, don't stop me now (I'm having a good time)
Don't stop me now (I'm having a good time)
Never wanna stop at all.
(Bah Dah Dah Dah Bah Bah Bah Bah Duh Bah)
(Bah Dah Dah Dah Bah Bah Bah Buh Dah)
(Bah Dah Dah Dah Bah Bah Bah Bah Duh Bah)
(Bah Dah Dah Dah Bah Bah Bah Buh Dah)
Why don't you just go away
I can't seem to get my head straight
There's so much I need to say
It could take All Day
Yeah but what you got, I don't need it
I can't listen to all your reasons
Wake up, I don't feel it
I can't listen to all your reasons
You're bad mood just ties my hands
Turns my cartwheels into head stands
I've done everything I can
You get old, I have
Ever what you got, I don't need it
I can't listen to all your reasons
Wake up, I don't feel it
I can't listen to all your reasons
Why I
You don't help me none
So warn down, so torn up
Still in Love
Yeah but what you got, I don't need it
I can't listen to all your reasons
Wake up, I don't feel it
I can't listen to all your reasons
Woman, I don't need it
I can't listen to all your reasons
Wake up, I don't feel it
I can't listen to all your reasons
Why (Bah Dah Dah Dah Bah Bah Bah Bah Duh Bah)
Tell me why (Bah Dah Dah Dah Bah Bah Bah Buh Dah)
Tell me why (Bah Dah Dah Dah Bah Bah Bah Bah Duh Bah)
Tell me why (Bah Dah Dah Dah Bah Bah Bah Buh Dah)
Tell me why
I broke my promise on a very sharp rock
And I was possessed by something quite unfriendly
And I was haunted by a demon in my sleep
That's how I learned how to survive
And I gave a beer to a bum that was drinking
And I gave some sauce to my bestest friend for cooking
And I gave water to all I thought were thirsty
That's how I learned how to survive
And I give my money to the bank for safe keeping
And I give my money to my landlord, he was needing it
And I gave attention to the TV that was bleeding
That's how I learned how to survive
If you ain't got the do-re-mi, boys
If you ain't got the do-re-mi
Well you better go back to beautiful Texas
Oklahoma, Kansas, Georgia, Tennessee
California is a Garden of Eden
A paradise to live in or see
But believe it or not, you won't find it so hot
If you ain't got the do-re-mi
And we totally ripped off a man named Woody Guthrie
And I bought a restaurant for his son named Alice
And I fed false information to the audience
That's how I learned how to survive
And I give a thank you to my father for not raising me
And I give a finger to my step father for beating me
And I give props to myself for achieving
Goddamn, I'm glad that I survived
Goddamn, I am surprised that I have survived
And I just handed you a giant load of gibberish
And I give love to a lover quite deserving of it
And I give thanks to all of you for listening
To the story of how we learned how to survive
You can be my head
Oh, I really need one
'Cause it's used all its better days
You can be my head
'Cause I've ruined this one
Blasting holes where it used to be
And if it's not a big thing,
You could swap or lend me
You should stop and ask me
Be my head, and I'll be yours (2x)
You can be my head
Oh, they've eaten this one
Putting swirls in this giant hole
You can be my head
'Cause I can't afford to buy one
Seeking stars in its other side
And if it's not a big thing,
You could swap or lend me
You should stop and ask me
Be my head, and I'll be yours (2x)
Won't you be my head, and I'll be yours
Be my head and I'll be yours (3x)
I feel like a sail-boat
Adrift on the sea
It's a brand new day
So when you gonna phone me
I could take you to heaven
I could spin you to hell
But I'll take you to New York
It's the place that I know well
Sitting on a flagstone talking to a faceless girl
And I wondering what to say but my eyes do the talking so well
Duck and I sway - what's my line
Shoot at a full moon - what's my line
So what's my line - shake it baby
Cause love is the answer
Love's talking to me
I'd scream and I'll fight for you
You're better than money
We're the kind of people who can shake it if we're feeling blue
When I'm feeling disconnected well I sure know what to do
Shake it baby
Ah shake it shake it
I duck and I sway - what's my line
I shoot at a full moon - what's my line
So what's my line - shake it shake it baby
Shake shake it
Shake it baby
Shake shake it
Shake it baby
Shake it shake it

I had to leave you and go away
But I think about you everyday
And in the morning and the afternoon
I wish that I could see you soon
And when I held you I felt so fine
It was like there was nothing left on my mind
It was like Rockaway Beach in the month of June
I wish that I could see you soon
I had no plans to meet you baby
I had a million things to do baby
But you hit my heart with a harpoon
I wish that I could see you soon
The angels go "How long till you can see her?"
And I'm like: "The sooner the better",
"Do you really think she will wait for you?"
"Well I have no way to say and there's nothing I can do,
Well I have no way to say and there's nothing I can do", go!
Now listen, now that I am across the sea
I wonder if you're gonna wait for me
Or if you're gonna find a new boy to spoon
I wish that I could see you soon
And if you wait a little my pretty friend
Until I come back to hold your hand
We'll be like bugs when they break through a cocoon
You know, I wish that I could see you soon
It's been a while since I felt like this
Now I found someone I really miss
Under the sun, under the moon
I wish that I could see you soon
Angels: "how long till you can see her?"
And I'm like: "The sooner the better"
Angels: "do you really think she will wait for you?"
And I'm like: "there's no way to say and there's nothing I can do
There's no way to say and there's nothing I can do", go!
Angels again: "How long till you can see her?"
I'm like: "Well, the sooner the better"
"Do you really think she will wait for you?"
And I'm like: "There's no way to say and there's nothing I can do
No way to say and there's nothing I can do,
Well, no way to say and there's nothing I can do
No way to say and there's nothying I can do"

On a highway, unpaved, going my way 
You're so alone today
Like a ghost town, I've found
There's no belief, no salt in the sea
Is it true what they say?  You can't behave
You gambled your soul away
Measuring your dreams of this life seems
Like the gristle of loneliness
Don't let the sun catch you cryin'
Don't let the sun catch you cryin'
Like an ice age, nice days are on your way
Sipping the golden drinks
On a rip-tide, freak's ride
Asleep inside, a parasite's appetite
Oh, say can't you see?  The chemistry
The parasites, the clean up fee
Death never hands recycled cans
And get well cars to the hostage vans
Don't let the sun catch you cryin'
Don't let the sun catch you cryin'
You're a deadweight, right straight on your way
Sunk in the midnight shade
Skies burned, eyes turned
Learning to counterfeit their disease
In this town where we roam
We bluff our souls on canteen patios
Drink the bravest drauft
The music drags
The music drags
The music drags
Don't let the sun catch you cryin'
Don't let the sun catch you cryin'
Swimming fast
Hone in on the buzz in ways you could not
I like you real silver-like
Oh see them fast, take off at last
And we get better
I wanna breathe in a sunlight beam
I wanna be with a girl like she
Step out fast
Hone in on the buzz in ways you could not
Know, my own electricity
You did this to me
I want someone to carry me
Oh, ill-advised, your desire
Tulip bell
And I'd rather be a satellite
And I'm picking up the phone
And I'd rather be a satellite
And I'm picking up the phone
Remember when
It was then we sealed to unlock never again
The way we might on movie night
(Suspend disbelief)
And this is much better
(I can see you crying)
None of these remedies, I feel
Could make things matter that much
It's only right on movie night
(Solemn summer)
And I'd rather be a satellite
And I'm picking up the phone
Picking up the phone
And I'd rather be a satellite
And I'm picking up the phone
Eleven past
I love all the things that are wrong with you
Know my own electricity
You did this to me
I like you real silver-like
Oh see them fast, take off at last
And we get better
And I'd rather be a satellite
And I'm picking up the phone
And I'd rather be a satellite
And I'm picking up the phone
Picking up the phone
My life is my own
And now I'm always home
(x2)
That's where I spend my time
What, you think I'm up all night?
That's where I spend my time
What, you think I'm up all night?
Hey brother, do you remember when
We used to play outdoors
Till the light was absorbed by the night?
Hey brother, it was a nicer time
We used to laugh till we cry
We're still boys on the inside
(I want to do it again)
The first time staying out all night
The last that we got away with lies
I can hear it in the back of my mind
Over and over again
(I want to do it again)
Late nights and early lights
Never thought it would come to a goodbye
I replay it in the back of my mind
Over and over again
(I want to do it again)
Lala la, lala la la la
Lala la la la
(I want to do it again)
Hey lover, do you remember when
We would dance in your apartment
Till neighbors would knock on your door?
And I remember, you remember when
We had no money to speak of
No where else to eat but your floor
(I want to do it again)
The first time staying out all night
The last time you look me in the eyes
I can see that in the back of my mind
Over and over again
(I want to do it again)
Late nights, all entwined
Made a promise to never say goodbye
I replay in the back of my mind
Over and over again
All those days gone forever
Wonder if we're going to ever
See all our younglife friends that we made again
Have we all lost connection?
The life pulls in all direction
Memories bring us back to where we've been
(I want to do it again)
The first time staying out all night
The last time that we got away with lies
We can hear it in the back of our minds
Over and over again
(I want to do it again)
Late nights and early lights
Never thought it would come to a goodbye
We replay it in the back of our minds
Over and over and over
(I want to do it again)
Lala la la, lala la la la
Lala la la la
(I want to do it again)

If I had a scheme for everything,
It seems I'd be sure not not to change it all
If I had it in me to stop my random thoughts,
And my dumb dreams
I could deal with this nonstop spinning world.
If only I could say that everything's okay
Take a good look
Look the other way,
Frustration, hell, who needs it anyway?
I'd rather sit back,
Just smoke cigarettes.
Be the one with the loudest mouth
Be the most closed minded as I could get
My heart it dances, 
Whenever I'm with you 
Don't make advances 
I'm scared of what you'll do. 
We go out, 
Have a laugh, 
Have a good time, 
You and I, 
We go on, 
Have a drink, 
Have a good time 
You and I 
And when the night is through 
It feels so right to kiss your lips 
Wish I could say to you 
That I've got so much 
Come and get it. 
Get it, get it 
Get it, get it. 
Hug and kiss it 
Love it love it! 
Get it, get it, 
Get it, get it. 
If you're with it 
Come and get it. 
Come and get it. 
I'm waiting in my room 
To pick you up at eight. 
There's so much we can do 
I promise I won't be late! 
We go out, 
Have a laugh, 
Have a good time, 
You and I, 
We go on, 
Have a drink, 
Have a good time 
You and I 
And when the fun ends 
I look into your eyes and say 
Oh what a lovely time 
I think that this might be the day to 
Get it, get it 
Get it, get it. 
Hug and kiss it 
Love it love it! 
Get it, get it, 
Get it, get it. 
If you're with it 
Come and get it. 
And when the night is through 
It feels so right to kiss your lips 
Wish I could say to you 
That I've got so much 
Come and get it. 
And when the fun ends 
I look into your eyes and say 
Oh what a lovely time 
I think that this might be the day to... 
Get it, get it 
Get it, get it. 
Hug and kiss it 
Love it love it! 
Get it, get it, 
Get it, get it. 
If you're with it 
Come and get it.

That's why I'm standing here today
Whoa oh oh, whoa oh oh

So put your arms around me 
And then stay there forever
Let it always be this way
You and me together
So put your arms around me

I know they're easy words to say
But I mean it more than ever
Yours is the kind of love
Makes nothing else feel good enough
And I'm never gonna give you up
Oh no, oh no
Yours is the kind of love
Makes nothing else feel good enough
And I'm never gonna give you up
Oh no, oh no
I can't explain
What's the glue that holds us in
Whoa oh oh, whoa oh oh 
I can't refrain 
If I had the chance I'd do it over again
Whoa oh oh, whoa oh oh
So put your arms around me
And then stay there forever
Let it always be this way
You and me together
So put your arms around me
And then never let go
I know they're easy words to say

Makes nothing else feel good enough
And I'm never gonna give you up
Oh no, oh no
Yeah you!
Yeah you!
I used to wanna be
Living like there's only me
And now I spend my time
Thinking 'bout a way to get you off my mind
(Yeah you!)
I used to be so tough
Never really gave enough
And then you caught my eye
Giving me the feeling of a lightning strike
(Yeah you!)
Look at me now, I'm falling
I can't even talk, still stuttering
This ground of mine keeps shaking
Oh oh oh, now!
All I wanna be, yeah all I ever wanna be, yeah, yeah
Is somebody to you
All I wanna be, yeah all I ever wanna be, yeah, yeah
Is somebody to you
Everybody's trying to be a billionaire
But every time I look at you I just don't care
Cause all I wanna be, yeah all I ever wanna be, yeah, yeah
Is somebody to you
(Yeah you!)
I used to ride around
I didn't wanna settle down
But now I wake each day
Looking for a way that I can see your face
(Yeah you!)
I've got your photograph
But baby I need more than that
I need to know your lips
Nothing ever mattered to me more than this
(Yeah you!)
Look at me now, I'm falling
I can't even talk, still stuttering
This ground of mine keeps shaking
Oh oh oh, now!
All I wanna be, yeah all I ever wanna be, yeah, yeah
Is somebody to you
All I wanna be, yeah all I ever wanna be, yeah, yeah
Is somebody to you
Everybody's trying to be a billionaire
But every time I look at you I just don't care
Cause all I wanna be, yeah all I ever wanna be, yeah, yeah
Is somebody to you
(Yeah you!)
Look at me now, I'm falling
I can't even talk, still stuttering
All I wanna be, yeah all I ever wanna be, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Yeah you!)
All I wanna be, yeah all I ever wanna be, yeah, yeah
Is somebody to you
All I wanna be, yeah all I ever wanna be, yeah, yeah
Is somebody to you
(Yeah you!)
All I wanna be, yeah all I ever wanna be, yeah, yeah
Is somebody to you
All I wanna be, yeah all I ever wanna be, yeah, yeah
Is somebody to you
(Yeah you!)
Everybody's trying to be a billionaire
But every time I look at you I just don't care
Cause all I wanna be, yeah all I ever wanna be, yeah, yeah
Is somebody to you
(Yeah you!)
Cause all I wanna be, yeah all I ever wanna be, yeah, yeah
Is somebody to you
(Yeah you!)
Yeah you!
I saw the autumn leaves
Peel up off the street
Take wing on the balmy breeze
And sweep you off your feet
And you blushed as they scooped you up
On sugar maple wings
To gaze down on the city below
Ablaze with wondrous things
Downy feathers kiss your face
And flutter everywhere
Reality is a lovely place
But I wouldn't want to live there
I wouldn't want to live there
Weighed down by heavy lids
And lunar lullabies
I knew you were wide awake
'Cause you smile with your eyes
Downy feathers kiss your face
And flutter everywhere
Reality is a lovely place
But I wouldn't want to live there
From the green belt balcony
The wildfires look so pretty
Ponderosa canopy
I'd never leave if it were up to me
To the ruby redwood tree
And to the velvet climbing ivy
Painted all mahogany
I'd never leave if it were up to me
(If it were up to me)
With a starry brush
Paint the dusk venetian blue
'Cause in the evening hush
You'll never believe the view
And when the leaves return
And their whisperings fill the night
They'll freeze and burn
Where fire and ice collide
Where fire and ice collide
Can you feel a silk embrace
In the satin air?
If we dissolve without a trace
Would the real world even care?
Downy feathers kiss your face
And flutter everywhere
Reality is a lovely place
But I wouldn't want to live there
I wouldn't want to live there
I saw the autumn leaves
Peel up off the street
Take wing on the balmy breeze
And sweep you off your feet
Changing your strut when you know I'm behind you
Changing your ways 'cause you don't know what to do
I only wanna tell you
How I feel inside
If only you could listen
Try to change your mind
So I walk right up to you
And you walk all over me
And I ask you what you want
And you tell me what you need
Can't you feel it all come down
Can't you hear it all around
At the place where lost is found
That great love sound
Talking to you makes me wanna shake and shout
(Makes me wanna shake and shout)
Touching you makes me wanna come right out
(Makes me wanna come right out)
You could never want me
The same way I want you
I'm love tornado struck
I don't know what to do
So I walk right up to you
And you walk all over me
And I ask you what you want
And you tell me what you need
Can't you feel it all come down
Can't you hear it all around
At the place where lost is found
That great love sound
So I walk right up to you
And you walk all over me
And I ask you what you want
And you tell me what you need
Can't you feel it all come down
Can't you hear it all around
At the place where lost is found
That great love sound
Can't you feel it all come down
Can't you hear it all around
At the place where lost is found
That great love sound
Oh reckless, a boy wonder, so quiet, nose broken
Oh, you're standing there, look tired as your singing
And you're on fire, they're throwing punches
So backwards the landscape you thought you knew, it starts unwinding
Now you're jumping through their hoops
You're just trying to dodge all their questions
They're shooting bullets
'Cause we all want to hear but you can't, you can't
And we all want to see but you don't, you don't
You are amazing
Oh the horses, suits and ties, they will not hesitate to trample
You keep moving, stop moving, it's the same
You know if it is broken they'll try to fix it
It's a shame that, did they get you? they got you
Yeah they might have
You keep covering their mouths, they keep on talking
The parade it is coming, I hear them marching
Case we all want to hear but you can't, you can't
And we all want to see but you don't, you don't
You are amazing
Yeah we all think we're right but we're wrong, we're wrong
And we all want to talk and we do, we do
They have convinced you
It's so shocking
You cheated your fate now, we can't read your face
You are gone
When I wake up in the mornin' love
And the sunlight hurts my eyes
Then somethin' without warnin love
Bears heavy on my mind
Let's get them dollars, Let's get this money
I keep my mind on my money, money on my mind
I got my finger on tha trigga, stayin' on tha grind
And when I wake up in the mornin', I got's to hit a lick
Saw the 2000 and 3 Navi, on Sprees wit' a kit
Soon as my eyes see tha sunshine
My thoughts is jukin' the block, and dodgin' the one time
Peep how we movin' the rocks and wit' pounds of dro before I double my shit
I can serve sixteen ounces for six and get back ninety-six
A killa for tha skrilla, Nigga, Best not be stalkin'
I got's to get them bigga, figga's, fuck what you talkin'
I represent them nigga's ballin' wit' jewelry full of zickels
Down to the nigga's chasin' million, their dreams' servin' nickels
And I know, one day, I'm gon' come up
And when you see me, don't hate, that I rolled up
Get paid whether you legit when you slang, or tippin' off 'cane
Until I take a dip in the Range, I'm flippin' them thangs
Gotta get that money man
It's a lovely day, just got paid
Stack it up, be on my way
It's Lovely day, lovely day
Lovely day, lovely day
It's a lovely day, just got paid
Stack it up, be on my way
Lovely day, lovely day
Lovely day
A hustler's definition, is a hustler for scratch
You serve a motherfucker, you serve him for that
I'm makin' money off of verses when I spit 'em on tracks
And if I ain't sellin' no records, I'm servin' them packs
I got a, clip full of hollows, money makin's my motto
Semi-auto and Marlboros in the bottle, 'til I hit the lotto
Wit' dreams of ownin' a records label, flippin' words
My nigga flippin' buildin's better than he was flippin' birds
I got tha, mentality and tha motive I'm on a mission
For tha money, you can get it too, it's all about yo ambition
Play yo position, provide the plans, and follow procedures
In tha six-hundred, blunted, wit' a pocket full of hundred's and Visa's
Love, when I get that dust, hit 'em up, re-cock then I get back up
Love, when I get that gig, get a crib, get a car when tha grip stack up
It's still in the evenin' if I'm sleepin' paper problems
Soon as I get up it's just another day, another dollar
Gotta get that money man
It's a lovely day, just got paid
Stack it up, be on my way
Lovely day, lovely day
Lovely day, lovely day
It's a lovely day, just got paid
Stack it up, be on my way
Lovely day, lovely day
Lovely day
Got love for the corporate playas that's ballin' rollin' jags
Got love for the thug nigga's who get' it on tha ave.
Love for those, who can make a mil and sit back and laugh
And love for the fine stripper's who get it poppin' ass
Love for the single parent's that's workin' through the struggle
Love for those who gotta make a livin' movin' muscle
Love for those who gotta watch tha hater's rollin' bubbles
Causin' trouble every time a young brotha try to hustle
And if I can't, legally make or not
Then I gotta get, right back on the block
And if it no work we do a stick-up and whip-up a concoction
Might leave yo face down in the dirt because hurtin's not an option
Gotta get that money man
It's a lovely day, just got paid
Stack it up, be on my way
Lovely day, lovely day
Lovely day, lovely day
It's a lovely day, just got paid
Stack it up, be on my way
Lovely day, lovely day
Lovely day
It's a lovely day, just got paid
Stack it up, be on my way
Lovely day, lovely day
Lovely day, lovely day
It's a lovely day, just got paid
Stack it up, be on my way
Lovely day, lovely day
Lovely day
When I wake up in the mornin' love
And the sunlight hurts my eyes
Somethin' without warnin' love
Bears heavy on my mind
You feel lonesome don't you
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
The light that you seek just ain't in you today
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
So bang your head against the wall
But no one wants to see you fall down
The repetition kills you, the repetition kills you, the repetition kills you
Put your hands over your eyes
And stumble your way through the night
The repetition kills you, the repetition kills you, the repetition kills you
You feel lonesome don't you
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
The light that you seek just ain't in you today
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
So shout until your hear no more
But don't you ever ask yourself why
The repetition kills you, the repetition kills you, the repetition kills you
Dig yourself a bottomless hole
But don't you ever lose that light
The repetition kills you, the repetition kills you, the repetition kills you
This is a repetition of words, dancing needs a
Repetiton to work
You feel lonesome don't you
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
The light that you seek just ain't in you today
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
So bring it up, bring it up, bring it up yeah
The repetition kills you
So bring it up, bring it up, bring it up yeah
The repetition kills you
So bring it up, bring it up, bring it up yeah

(x3)
Up so early, feel so bright 
Didn't get much sleep last night 
Freight train rattled through my head 
Whistle blowing love is dead 
Is dead 
Heart attacked by fear and doubt 
Won't be long till the truth comes out 
First impressions never last 
Lover's bonds they hold so fast 
Restless future burning bright 
The past is holding on so tight 
Never heard the warning bell 
And I just want to wish you well 
I just want to wish you well 
Welcome swallows dip and swing 
Take their cue from the slightest thing 
Rolling fog into my room 
Why did you give up on me so soon? 
So soon 
Restless future burning bright 
The past is holding on so tight 
Never heard the warning bell 
And I just want to wish you well 
I just want to wish you well 
I just want to wish you well 
I just want to wish you well 
Why did you give up on me so soon? 
Did you give up on me so soon? 
I just want to wish you well 
I just want to wish you well

I could talk to you for days
You make me laugh one thousand ways
And I realise - you fill me up
Like hot water - in my tea cup
I'm enchanted by your smile
I must admit it took a while
For me to see that - this was something
More than - he's my friend, it's nothing
I hope to God you feel the way I feel
Caus this could be amazing
Something so super real
There's something about you and you don't even know it
I'm telling you now that you got me good
There's something about you and I can't help but show it
Damn right, you got me good
Now I'm not alone
With you I'm whole
I gotta let you know
You got me good
Your style, your voice, your points of view
The good, the bad and ugly too
Boy I'll take it (give it to me)
I'll be careful (give it to me)
Addiction don't come close to this
Official is what this sh- is
Still I can't say it
No I can't say that I'm in love
I hope to God you feel the way I feel
'Cause this could be amazing
Something so super real
There's something about you and you don't even know it
I'm telling you now that you got me good
There's something about you and I can't help but show it
Damn right, you got me good
Now I'm not alone
With you I'm whole
I gotta let you know
You got me good
I just wanna
Be your all and all
I just wanna be the one to make you fall
I wanna take you away
I want you to be for me
I want you here with me forever
Be my holiday, yeah
Oh yeah
Let me take you away
There's something about you
There's something about you and you don't even know it
I'm telling you now that you got me good
There's something about you and I can't help but show it
Damn right you got me good
Now I'm not alone
With you I'm whole
I gotta let you know
You got me good
You got me
You got me good
Uh, uh
Uh, uh
Uh, uh
Uh, uh
I gotta go, gotta go
Before I do something stupid
I gotta go
I gotta go, gotta go
Before I do something lame
I know it's your fault
That I'm in the mess I'm in
And you think I'm cool
But I don't, man
And maybe, it's too soon (it's too soon)
But I think it's too late (it's too late)
But things like bad timing just won't wait
Maybe it's not right
I have a girlfriend
Made a friend tonight
Who is a girl and
I just wanted to talk to you
But then I started wondering
If she's the one or not
So I gotta go, gotta go,
Before I do something stupid
I gotta go
I gotta go, gotta go
Before I do something lame
Maybe it's not right
I have a girlfriend
Made a friend tonight
Who is a girl and
I just wanted to talk to you
But then I started wondering
If she's the one or not
Uh, uh
Uh, uh
Uh, uh
Uh, uh
Well, I know flirting is nothing
And it should be where it ends,
But I know, yes I know
That I want you for more than a friend
More than a friend
Maybe it's not right
I have a girlfriend
Made a friend tonight
Who is a girl and
I just wanted to talk to you
But then I started wondering
Oh yes, I started wondering
If you're the one, ha ha
So I gotta go, gotta go,
Before I do something stupid
I gotta go
I gotta go, gotta go
Before I do something lame
I gotta go, gotta go,
Before I do something stupid
I gotta go
But I know, I know
That it's too late
For a second I'll be the fashion police
And I'm just looking at your garms
You been on too many catalogue sprees
With your grannyfied curtain designs
You're hurting my eyes
You really should revise your dress sense before you walk on by
I'm kinda mixed up in this disco inferno
Baggy jeans and a tight top, lemonade and Pernod
I'm sticking out like a sore thumb
But I ain't concerned though
No, uh oh, oh oh oh (boogie)
(Chorus (repeat 2x))
Fling on an Adidas hoodie and just boogie woogie with me
Ooh...
Or you can just
Put on your dancing shoes
And get loose, can you, get loose, can you?
So I was up in this trendy bar mingling
My keys around my neck were jingling
And you was looking at me like it was my bling
You was staring at me like to say I was Ginger
I was dishing out the same dirty looks
Trust me you're the minger
Errrr, who's she, who's that, who's her??
The bouncer was approaching me
'Cause I was dressed really inappropriately
No hood, no hats, no this, no that
Let's roll, uh 'oll 'oll 'oll...(out!)
Right everybody
If you've got someone who can't dress properly
Yeah you need to direct them this way
Why not just cut up all your old clothes and make a quilt
So I can wrap myself up when I'm feeling cold
Why not dash your ugly boots on the fire and then dump charcoal
If you're not feeling the way that your bredgin is dressin'
Don't be stressin', send them in my direction please
Black shoes, white socks, no uh oh
Polka dots, no uh oh
Flowery frocks, no uh oh
Just boogie woogie with me!
(Chorus repeat until end)
We thank you people for being around
Supporting Volbeat with love and hell fire
Gu'fanden do we care
You're all our brothers, sisters and our babies
Going out the street again 
With open arms and fists
Sweating out all the whisky tømmermænd
And the pain that comes with it
But we know who we are and more
Protectors of this band - oh oh oh oh
And we know we're not alone anymore
We got supporters in this rock 'n' roll band
The song is for all the ones who's singing out loud
Yeah! we make a lot of noise
Refuse to sit down and be tamed
We still think that we owe you some
So we're making a lot of noise
We sing it out loud, we sing it out proud
Sacrificing all the things that we had
Just to do this thing
Not even money for some glue
So we hang all the posters up with jam
But we know who we are and more
Protectors of this band - oh oh oh oh
And we know we're not along anymore
We got supporters in this rock 'n' roll band
This song is for all the ones who's singing out loud
Yeah! we make a lot of noise
Refuse to sit down and be tamed
We still think that we owe you some
So we make a lot of noise
We sing it out loud, we sing it out proud
We thank you people for being around
Supporting Volbeat with love and hell fire
Gu'fanden do we care
You're all our brothers and sisters and our babies
So when you sing this song out loud
Remember it's for you, for helvede we are proud
Let's all have a beer 
You're all our brothers sisters and our babies
This song is for all the ones who's singing out loud
Yeah! we make a lot of noise
Refuse to sit down and be tamed
We still think that we owe you some
So we make a lot of noise
We sing it out loud, we sing it out proud
I got the concept and came to the conclusion
That the top floor is just an illusion
To the fact that I go this break in my back
That I can't get out; I can't figure out how
You appeared right in front of me
Before your march down south a university
Is where you spend your daylight
But we're both just waiting for this Friday night
Although the distance is daring
We both know how to drive
Wo-o
We can't make-up for the lost time that we both apologize for
I can't stand the fact that this extremity is the center of my day
I see where your coming from
We've been on the same boat since day one
I see how you like to run
Back to the things that got you here
Wo-o
Although the distance is daring
We both know how to drive
Wo-o
We can't make-up for the lost time that we both apologie for
I can't stand the fact that this extremity is the center of my day
Mondays I sleep away
Tuesdays I lay awake
Wednesdays they are the worst
Thursdays I reminisce
Fridays I see your face
And I can't breathe
Although the distance is daring
I sure know what it is like to be alone
It's you to me - gentle face, overdue, worth the wait
Out of my reach but I'm reaching out for you
Me to the night - say goodbye, time is up, fight the time
A needed award I can't afford, a finished song, one more chord
It's already in my mind
I'm in over my head inside
It's already in my mind, inside
Everyone back my hearts at war
With all the plans I had before
I'm losing my grip but I'd lose it all for you
So I go driving all around and I'm denying all the sounds that hit my ear
Drum the beat of a heart I can't defeat
And so
It's already in my mind
I'm in over my head inside
It's already in my mind, inside
Let me in
Won't you take me where my feet feel happy in their own time?
The cathedral of reason lets the bells chime
And the lighting is fine
I'm old enough to know that people waiting on some big sign
Should quit their waiting on the divine
Divine is what's in your mind
I've seen the cruel and hard
And I've seen them hard on you
But I'll buy you brand new shoes if you cross to my side
There's a whole lot of walking to do
And if we're near or far from our city by the seaside
Well as long as we keep our stride
I believe we'll be fine
You've seen the years roll on
And you've seen me roll with you
I see the road is long, so get on my side
There's a whole lot of walking to do
And if we stay on our feet we'll make it in our own time
And though the road has got some steep climbs
I believe we'll be fine
From your house to my house to the Mews
There's a whole lot of walking to do
Bethnal Green to the tube
There's a whole lot of walking to do
Ayoma to Shobuya
There's a whole lot of walking to do
Rock Creek Park, the Ave. and on past the zoo
There's a whole lot of walking, whole lot of walking to do
Well, I'm here and you're here and it's true
There's a whole lot of walking to do
And you're cool and I'm cool and it's true
There's a whole lot of walking to do
There's no fuss and I trust, I trust you
There's a whole lot of walking to do
And you're strong and I can be too
There's a whole lot of walking to do
And you do and I do
There's a whole lot of walking to do
This wrinkle in time, can't give it no credit
I thought about my space, and I really got me down (Got me down)
I got me so down, I got me a headache
My heart is crammed in my cranium, and it still knows how to pound
I was counting the rings
And I fell me into sleep
I peeked to see if you were way back when
I was counting the trees
Until a day when there was one
I'd hoped, beneath, asleep, is where that you had been
This wrinkle in time, can't give it no credit (Credit)
I thought about my space, and I really got me down (Got me down)
I got me so down, I got me a headache (Headache)
My heart is crammed in my cranium, and it still knows how to pound
Well, I found you
Maybe you can help me
And I can help you
This wrinkle in time, can't give it no credit (Credit)
I thought about my space, and I really got me down (Got me down)
I got me so down, I got me a headache (Headache)
My heart is crammed in my cranium, and it still knows how to pound (How to pound)
I got me so down, I got me a headache (Headache)
My heart is crammed in my cranium, and it still knows how to pound (How to pound)
This wrinkle in time, I can't give it no credit (Credit)
I thought about my space, and I really got me down (Got me down)
We've gotta get out of this place, she said
And follow our hearts to content, she said
I want it all, but there's nothing you can do to stop me now
Oh my god, the way you look tonight
Oh my god...
And this could be the way for us to change
This could be, this could be
The way for us to change
Oh no, oh no
This could be 
This could be
This could be
The way for us to change...
I can feel my breath growing faster...
I think this could be right now
Let's call out all our fears right now
And open hearts with clear content
We know, it's all about the way it comes out
Of your mouth and mind
And oh my god, I think it's happening
Oh my god, the way you look tonight
And this could be 
The way for us to change...
I need you more now than ever
This could be the right time to change...
I can feel my breath growing faster...
I think this could be right now
Don't try and tell me you've been looking at me
'Cause I've been looking at you
And I can read what you think, yeah
Don't cut no corners when you're talking to me
Like I don't know how it is
But I can see it
You've got no answers but you've got your concerns
About the people we see
And all the secrets we're keeping
I think about what you're expecting of me
Like you don't know how it is
But I can see all of it
We always have to wait
By the choice we had to make
You sold yourself so short
Is this the way to carry on?
In the most unexpected places...
Don't try and tell me you've been thinking of us
'Cause I will never believe you
Now you're shit out of luck, yeah
Don't cut no corners when you're talking to me
Like I don't know how it is
But I can see all of it
We always have to wait
By the choice we had to make
You sold yourself so short
Is this the way to carry on? 
In the most unexpected places
I see...
We always have been caged
By the choices that we make
You sold yourself so short
Is this the way to carry on?
In the most unexpected places, I see changes
In the most unexpected faces, I see changes
Change, changing the way...
We always have to wait
By the choices that we made
You sold yourself so short
Is this the way to carry on?
In the most unexpected places, I see changes
We always have been caged
By the choices that we made
We sold ourselves so short
Is this the way to carry on?
Is this the way to carry on?
Is this the way to carry on?
Is this the way to carry on?
Is this the way to carry on?
Is this the way to carry on?
Some days I feel like crying
It don't matter if it's rain or shine
I feel like my heart was broken
At least a million times
Some days I wake up dreaming
Feels like I've never even woke
I answer life's big questions
As if it's one big joke
Maybe it's too soon to be sure
But I really do believe that someday 
We're gonna have it all
So I try so hard to keep the rhythm of a train
Rolling right along 
When the ride gets rough you got to carry on
Carry on
Some days I feel like singing
I sit back and just groove the day away
Maybe pick up a guitar 
And play what I want to play
Maybe it's too soon to be sure
But I really do believe that someday 
We're gonna have it all
So I try so hard to keep the rhythm of a train
Rolling right along 
When the ride gets rough you got to carry on
Carry on
Today I feel like laughing
Seems to be no reason at all
And if the world stops spinning
I'm not afraid to fall
Maybe it's too soon to be sure
But I really do believe that someday 
We're gonna have it all
So I try so hard to keep the rhythm of a train
Rolling right along 
When the ride gets rough you got to carry on
Maybe it's too soon to be sure
But I really do believe that someday 
We're gonna have it all
So I try so hard to keep the rhythm of a train
Rolling right along 
When the ride gets rough you got to carry on
Carry on
I could write a song with my new piano;
I could sing about how love is a losing battle...
Not hard... (it's not hard...) It's not hard... (It's not hard...)
It's not hard... (it's not hard...) It's not hard... (It's not hard...)
And I could sing about Cupid and a shooting arrow;
In the end, you find out that my heart was battered
Real hard... (Real hard...) It's so hard... (It's so hard...)
Real hard... (Real hard...) It's not hard... (It's not hard...)
But I'd rather make a song they can play on the radio
That makes you wanna dance - don't it make you wanna dance?
But I'd rather make a song they can play on the radio
That makes you wanna grab your lover's hand...
So hold up and take it through the night,
And you should follow through to make it alright...
Now grab each others' hands, get on up;
I want to see you rock to the piano, the piano...

Open up both your eyes
Stay mine shut, I don't mind
Pylons bust, right outside
But all I hear is you
Remember when it rained all day
No playtime locked away
Dancing to the beat of rain
Will it ever stop?
'Cause we are a pair of apples
That we'd share after the stretch
But for fifteen minutes or so
We were there
Nervous walks in a park
I never knew could get so dark
I'm running out of things to say, will you please start talking
About yourself or your family
Any friends, I've got one two three
But they are all imaginary
Come and stroke the air
We are a pair of apples
That we'd share after the stretch
But for fifteen minutes or so
We were there
Brand new sheets, let's break them in
Underneath our feathered skin
I feel your warmth, you let me in
Shall we stop, let's stop
I look at you, you look away
It's the beginning of the end today
Three more weeks, and we could say
We mirrored the world
'Cause we are a pair of apples
That we'd share after the stretch
But for fifteen minutes or so
We were there
Feelin' Better
Since I surrendered
You can't Climb
Till Your ready to fall
You're not a land mine
You're not a gold mine
No you're not mine at all
So tell me baby
Can you hear me?
I sent a message out into the dark
It's a mystery
When you're near me
I've gotta find my way to your heart
I learnt my lesson
First impressions
More ofern right than wrong
It's not a slow dance
This modern romance
Feels like we've already waited to long
Don't worry baby
That how is should be
I sent a message out into the dark
I'd rather talk to you
About how it could be
I've gotta find my way to your heart
I was one of those
Breathing tornadoes
But now I live at the eye of the storm
And it's all faded
Then since the separation
Since I let your love keep me warm
You tell me baby
That you can feel me
I sent a message out into the dark
When I kiss you
That's the real me
I've gotta find my way to your heart
So tell me baby
Can you hear me?
I sent a message out into the dark
It's a mystery
When you're near me
I've gotta find my way to your heart
I've gotta find my way to your heart
I've gotta find my way to your heart
I read you
And god I'm good at it, I'm so spot on
Chord shapes in air
Go press that dissonance, if you dare
And you breathin' in
Finesse an innocent, from her partying
And I'm high enough from all the waiting
To ride a wave on your inhaling
And I'm high enough from all the waiting
To ride a wave on your inhaling
'Cause I love you, no?
Can't help but love, you know
What part of no
Don't you understand? I've told you before
So just get off my case
This isn't happening, stop this now
And I, where was I?
I have to be somewhere
Now where did I put it?
And I'm high enough from all the waiting
To ride a wave on your inhaling
And I'm high enough from all the waiting
To ride a wave on your inhaling
'Cause I love you, no?
Can't help but love, you know
Is this it? Is it?
Is this it? Yeah
Is it? No
Is this it? No
Is this it? No
Is this it? No
Is this it? Yes
Hello we're back
And we're taking calls
Now what was the question?
And I'm high enough from all the waiting
To ride a wave on your inhaling
And I'm high enough from all the waiting
To ride a wave on your inhaling
And I'm high enough from all the waiting
To ride a wave on your inhaling
And I'm high enough from all the waiting
To ride a wave on your inhaling
'Cause I love you, no?
Can't help but love, you know
'Cause I love you, no?
Can't help but love, you know
'Cause I love you, no?
Can't help but love, you know
Hey, I live for that look
Hey, is that all it took?
I know why, I know why
Hey, it's all on your head
Hey, is that what you said?
I know why, I know why 
You run around
And you won't see tomorrow
See today, no way
Time to pay
Up for not having
A time to even say
Hey, it's goin' no place
Hey, don't give me that face
I know why, I know why
Hey, be better this time
Hey, get out of my mind
I know why, I know why
You run around
And you won't see tomorrow
See today, no way
Time to pay
Up for not having
A single thing to say
Tell me now, tell me now
Stand on up and take a bow
There's something there and it?�s showing
There's no need to look around
You're the best we've got going
Shout out to the dreams you'll chase
Shout out to the hearts you'll break
Nothing's gonna stop you know
I guess you better be going
Like never before
I'm keeping you near

Yeah and you can tell them your story
Like never before

I just ran into a few someone's today
Someone's that I never really knew
And I used to think how I had them all so figured out
But no, none of it's true 'cause I never knew you
And now the truth of it is, is I wanna be like you
So hello, good friend, I wanna be next to you
For my head for my heart for it's true
So I'm burning the thoughts of the things that I once said
Because you tore down the walls that the world that has put inside my head
And I just get sick of the things that we think, we think we know
And no, none of it's true 'cause I never knew you
And now the truth of it is, is I wanna be like you
So hello, good friend, I wanna be next to you
For my head for my heart for it's true
So take me and save me and change me and then make me
And embrace me and then brave my heart for you
No, no, 'cause I can't go on without you
And it's time for something never knowing, oh
And no, none of it's true 'cause I never knew you
And now the truth of it is, is I wanna be like you
So hello, good friend, I wanna be next to you
For my head for my heart for it's true
And as they as strolled along
My heart broke out in song
From all the things and the thoughts and assumptions that I had wrong
See now I'll be on my way to make this claim
I'll make it famous in every way
I'll make it stay when I will save it...
No, none of it's true 'cause I never knew you
And now the truth of it is, is I wanna be like you
So hello, good friend, I wanna be next to you
For my head for my heart for it's true (x3)
Back in the old days, tight like a fight,
Used to hang with the devil in the broad daylight
We had a route, a walkabout,
Until we had a row, a kind of falling out
He showed me the low, showed me the down
Called it the happy low down
We used to rock some tunes with a guy named lloyd
Lloyd still got them polaroids
Broad daylight
Broad daylight
Stop climaxing, you got your fight
Leaving him alone in the broad daylight
He might get it on, on his own and start building a throne
Out of worn out razors
Look at you shaking you can't find his plight
Got you scared of ghosts in the dead of night
While you're making up stories trying to make it ok,
He'll be bringing them in to let them out and play
In the broad daylight
Broad daylight
Leaving me alone in the broad daylight
In the broad daylight
Broad daylight
In the broad day...
Please don't leave me alone
Leaving me alone in the broad daylight
You'll get your money, you'll get your night
Just leave me alone up (in the broad daylight)
I need some shit of my own, I need a throne
Not them razors
And who you think you are screaming Hollywood burn?
If you really want to stop it then burn your sperm
'Cause this here be going on until it's not and then a little more
Broad daylight
Leaving me alone in the broad daylight
In the broad daylight
Broad daylight, in the broad day
Please don't leave me alone
Leaving me alone in the broad daylight
In the broad daylight
In the broad daylight
In the broad daylight
In the broad daylight
Broad daylight
In the broad day
Please don't leave me alone
Leaving me alone in the broad daylight
We followed what the symbols said
Held each other to the breaking day
I've opened up like I never planned
Showed me how to love again
You carved a path to my heartland
Sailed along a foreign wave
All the winds are changing without fail
Cross the ocean way
We celebrate, we celebrate our love
Oh, we celebrate our love
We celebrate, we celebrate our love
Oh, we celebrate our love
Drawing the pictures of our lives
Watch and wonder as they come alive
The characters become my friends
As the empire begins to rise
Something gains its place now
After the floods have washed away
Just love someone more than yourself
Give yourself away
We celebrate, we celebrate our love
Oh, we celebrate our love
We celebrate, we celebrate our love
Oh, we celebrate our love
We celebrate, we celebrate our love
Oh, we celebrate our love
We celebrate, we celebrate our love
Oh, we celebrate our love
History begins with you and I
I long to be right by your side
Watching how you feel
Lives within your life
We celebrate, we celebrate our love
Oh, we celebrate our love
We celebrate, we celebrate our love
Oh, we celebrate our love
We celebrate, we celebrate our love
Oh, we celebrate our love
We celebrate, we celebrate our love
Oh, we celebrate our love
Oh, you and me on a fantasy.
This is what it's like on a fantasy.
No, I wouldn't challenge your home.
In the basement of words we knew, there were more of us.
Don't want to make you grow numb.
If it's not what you thought it was, legs are for discovering.
Relieved and now we see the road. 
This is what's like on a fantasy.
Little codes bring the balance to none. 
And the shapes of your hands do tell of such a rare variety.
You put your life on hold as we interest one another.
Two steps closer to the level I imagined. 
I remember when it poured and you sang to me in summer.
It's a fantasy.
Right now
Right now there's the the right time
For the good thing tonight
Let's celebrate
Let's bring up on the better times
And not the sadder times
Dissipate (?)
Oh, I feel like a champion in the stadium
There's love?
Imma put this in my memory
As the best time ever
This is the best one yet
And I'm so happy
How could we ever forget
This is the best one

This is the best one yet (Oh-Oh-Wi-Oh)
And I'm so happy

Let's celebrate, let's celebrate, let's celebrate (Oh-Oh-Wi-Oh)
Let's do it right now
We're not hesitate
We gonna rock it to the top
Like elevate
Bottoms up
Here we go
Let's intoxicate
I was feeling good
But now I'm feeling afraid
Best ever
And you know I don't exaggerate
This moment is the moment I will appreciate
Today is a day I will remember
This is the best one yet
And I'm so happy
How could we ever forget
This is the best one
This is the best one
This is the best one yet (Oh-Oh-Wi-Oh)
And I'm so happy

This is your moment
This is your moment
This is the time
This is the time
To get it right tonight
To get it right
You don't wanna let the moment pass you by
So come on and save this one in a photograph
Everything I ? describe
It made us laugh
The night's young and we raise our glass
We'll make it count like the best one we ever had
The best one yet
The best one yet
The best one yet
The best one yet
The best one yet
The best one yet
This is the best one yet
The best one yet

Let's celebrate, let's celebrate, let's celebrate (Oh-Oh-Wi-Oh)
Let's celebrate, let's celebrate, let's celebrate (Oh-Oh-Wi-Oh)
She makes me feel glad
I want her so bad
My heart is beating madly for her
If you ask me why
I'm not going to lie
I'll have to say that I adore her
Look what you do to me baby
You're making me feel so fine
Step out in front of me baby
They want you in the front line
They want to see your sun shine
She picks up daisies from a field
She loves to weave them in her hair
And though she knows it isn't real
She still hears music in the air
It's coming from inside her heart
I hope it lasts forever
The sun is shining in her sky
She wants to dance around the world
And though I'd love to be the guy
That gets to walk off with the girl
I'll go along with all she needs 
And it will be my pleasure
Look what you do to me baby
You're making me feel so fine
Step out in front of me baby
They want you in the front line
They want to see your sun shine
She makes me feel glad
I want her so bad
My heart is beating madly for her
If you ask me why
I'm not going to lie
I'll have to say that I adore her
Look what you do to me baby
You're making me feel so fine
I want to see your sunshine
We are grown but cannot see
Lost our world of make believe
Simple times now seem so far
Used to be in my backyard
Yeah, the world was still in my backyard
But, we are okay, we are alright
We sing very loud,
Yeah, we're singing
We are okay, we are alright
Close our eyes, close our mouth
Yeah, we shut our eyes though we're in doubt
Build me a home from a cardboard box
Many windows never locked
This is how we used to play
Shorter nights and longer days
With faith we would not fade away
But we are okay, we are alright
We sing very loud
Yeah, we're singing
We are okay, we are alright
Close our eyes, close our mouth
Yeah we shut our eyes though we're in doubt
And so it goes
We can never seem to find, the time we lost
Though we try at any cost
We try, we sing
We are okay, we are alright
We sing very loud
Yeah, we're singing
We are okay, we are alright
Close our eyes, close our mouth
Yeah we shut our eyes though we're in doubt
We're a thousand miles from comfort, we have traveled land and sea 
But as long as you are with me, there's no place I'd rather be 
I would wait forever, exalted in the scene 
As long as I am with you, my heart continues to beat 
With every step we take, Kyoto to The Bay 
Strolling so casually 
We're different and the same, gave you another name 
Switch up the batteries 
If you gave me a chance, I would take it 
It's a shot in the dark but I'll make it 
Know with all of your heart you can't shame me 
When I am with you, there's no place I'd rather be 
N-n-n-no, no, no, no place I'd rather be
N-n-n-no, no, no, no place I'd rather be
N-n-n-no, no, no, no place I'd rather be
We staked out on a mission to find our inner peace
Make it everlasting so nothing's incomplete
It's easy being with you, sacred simplicity
As long as we're together, there's no place I'd rather be
With every step we take, Kyoto to The Bay
Strolling so casually
We're different and the same, gave you another name
Switch up the batteries
If you gave me a chance, I would take it 
It's a shot in the dark but I'll make it,
Know with all of your heart you can't shame me 
When I am with you, there's no place I'd rather be 
N-n-n-no, no, no, no place I'd rather be
N-n-n-no, no, no, no place I'd rather be
N-n-n-no, no, no, no place I'd rather be
When I am with you, there's no place I'd rather be
Hmm, hoo
Be, be, be, be, be, be, be, be, be
Yeah-e-yeah-e-yeah-e-yeah-e-yeah, yeah, yeah 
If you gave me a chance, I would take it 
It's a shot in the dark but I'll make it 
Know with all of your heart you can't shame me 
When I am with you, there's no place I'd rather be 
N-n-n-no, no, no, no place I'd rather be
N-n-n-no, no, no, no place I'd rather be
N-n-n-no, no, no, no place I'd rather be
When I am with you, there's no place I'd rather be 
N-n-n-no, no, no, no place I'd rather be
N-n-n-no, no, no, no place I'd rather be
N-n-n-no, no, no, no place I'd rather be
When I am with you, there's no place I'd rather be
Open hearts, empty spaces, dusty roads to distant places
But all the time when I'm alone I think of you and how you've grown
Far and wide, sweet and simple Jehovah knows that I've been sinful
But if Jesus comes to take your hand I won't let go, I won't let go
I'm not cruel and you're not evil and we're not like all those stupid people
Who can't decide which book to read unless the paper sows the seed
You're the kind of person that I've always wanted to be with
Well, you're really cool and you always say the right things to me
Now I'll tell you something for my heart beats for you deep inside
You'll never be a burden and my love for you will never die
Never die, never die, never die
If Jesus comes to take your hand I won't let go, I won't let go
If Jesus comes to take your hand I won't let go, I won't let go
Good times around the corner, good times around the corner
Good times around the corner, I swear it's getting warmer
Good times around the corner, good times around the corner
Good times around the corner
I'm gonna live till I die, I'm gonna live to get high
Caí en la trampa, de ser tu amigo, caí en la trampa de tí confiar
Desde que un día, tú decidiste, dejar lo nuestro en lo vulgar
Caí en la trampa, de ser tu amigo, caí en la trampa de tí confiar
Desde que un día, tú decidiste, dejar lo nuestro en la na'
PINOCCHIO!!!
Caí en la trampa, de ser tu amigo, caí en la trampa de tí confiar
Tú eras mi amigo, yo era tu socio, y ese negocio me salió mal
En la gran feria, de la mentira, tu eres el rey el rey de un día
En la gran feria, de la mentira, yo fui el ciego el que no sabía
Caí en la trampa, de ser tu amigo, caí en la trampa de tí confiar
Desde que un día, tú decidiste, dejar lo nuestro en lo vulgar
Mufatango, mufatango, mufatango, mufatango
Mufatango, mufatango, mufatango, mufatango
I'm so sorry when I told you
Those smokestacks were making clouds for the sky
But if I told you the truth
It would just bring so many tears
So many tears to your eyes
I said it that's the way it is
And the way it's gonna be
If that's the way it is
I'd rather make believe
Oh remember sitting on that beach
Watching all tha lightning fill up the sky
Well you got so scared
Until I told you it was just fireworks like the fourth of July
I said it that's the way it is
And the way it's gonna be
If that's the way it is
I'd rather make believe
I Know one day you'll be old enough
To know my stories I told are not true
But when you have your own children
And they ask you questions
You'll know, you'll know just what to do
You'll say it that's the way it is
And the way it's gonna be
If that's the way it is
I'd rather make believe
Oh that's the way it is
And the way it's gonna be
If that's the way it is
I'd rather make believe
We lied in so many words
We say that we'd take you down
To the water's edge and watch you drown
We lied in so many words
We don't need to drive
Hang us out to dry
About to bust
We don't need to drive, oh no
What you got?
We lied in so many words
I said that I'd take you down
To the water's edge and watch you drown
We lied in so many words
We don't need to drive
Hang us out to dry
About to bust
We don't need to drive
We don't need to...
Kori:
I saw you walking on the sidewalk
Your head was taller than the trees
The reconstruction had just started
And I knew we'd view it piece by piece
Jason:
I can't say, who do I believe?
Chance would have it that way
I can't say, who do I believe?
I'll follow it at the same pace
What do you think you see?
Kori:
The horses their collision courses
I know exactly what you mean
'Cause I'm obsessed with what would happen
If we'd had never changed a thing
Jason:
I can't say, who do I believe?
Chance would have it that way
I can't say, who do I believe?
I'll follow it at the same pace
I'm about to bust
Jumpin' out the window
Movin' on, groovin' on
Which way will the wind blow?
We can't be wrong, so say 'solong'
I'mma pick you up, I'mma pick you up
What're you tryin' to say to me?
Catch the train out to what you're tryin' to do
Are you gonna play with me?
All my life, I've been waiting
Pass my time, procrastinating now
It's a trip on a flip
And flash right through the scene
Can't you see what I mean?
Breaking through the boundaries
Rollin' on, strollin' on
They won't ever find me
And fter all, we'll have a ball
I'mma pick you up, I'mma pick you up
We're gonna see where we can go
This is how I live, this is what I give
And you're the one I want to know
All my life, I've been waiting
Pass my time, procrastinating now
It's a trip on a flip
And flash right through the scene
Can't you see what I mean?
Tiny minded two-tone suckers
Same old faces make me shudder
Countless times I've screamed 'oh brother!'
Where are you? I need someone to be my lover
All my life, I've been waiting
Pass my time, procrastinating now
It's a trip on a flip
And flash right through the scene
Can't you see what I mean?
It's a trip on a flip
And flash right through the scene
Can't you see what I mean?
Self pity me, it's so pitiful
You can see that birds and worms don't get along
Self righteous me, it's so wrong and
You can see that we don't have to get along
Self pity me, it's so pitiful
You can see that birds and worms do not agree
And we will crawl
I wake up in a town that never sleeps 
Love has taken me 
My words get lost in the morning heat 
I never admit defeat 
And it turns off and goes again 
My faith won't give in 
The sun can't burn away our sins 
Don't forgive me 
My words get lost in the moment of things
Love has taken me 
I stand up to the shadow that never leaves 
I never admit defeat 
And it turns off and goes again 
My tears won't give in 
The sun can't burn away our sins 
Don't forgive me
Have you ever been to heaven at night (heaven at night)
Have you ever been to heaven at night
Heaven at night
Have you ever been to heaven at night?
Closing your eyes the feeling so right
At first you might see this one bright beam of light
Clutching your soul to the toll of the blight
Happy unites and feelings take flight
Blind to the evils you give them no sight
Focus on floatin', your focus is tight
Like you rewrote a essay for a class
To pass in the night
Have you ever seen the ending so nice
You feel so free like your high as a kite
Like how you feel if you drink some bud light
Followed by Jag
Models will smile then tilt their heads back
These are a few of the visions I like
Mixed in with light, these are my favorites to dream in the night
This is my heaven at night
Have you, ever been to heaven at night (to heaven at night)
Heaven at night (heaven at night)
Oh have you
Ever been to heaven at night (to heaven at night)
Heaven at night (heaven at night)
Man
Oh, I need what the world can't give me (can't give me)
Can't give me
Man
Oh, I see what the world can't show me (can't show me)
Can't show me
Dog
Oh, I lack what the world can't give me (can't give me)
Can't give me
Dog
Oh, I sing but the world can't hear me (can't hear me)
Can't hear me
Heaven at night
Heaven at night
Have you ever been to heaven at night (heaven at night)
Heaven at night
Oh, have you ever been to heaven at night
Heaven at night
Gimme just a little break
Ain't no more that I can take
I am asking for the planets to align
Calling on the universe
Maybe once, just put me first
Gimme what I need or give a little sign
Nothing plays out like it should
And nothing does me any good
'Cause I'm missing you, it's making me cry
Ooh, I know it's turning
Inside I'm burning...
I'm so tired of the way the world works
I'm so tired of the way the world works
They conspire in trying to keep us apart
Nothing ventured, nothing gained
I don't mind a little pain
But enough's enough
But does the heart grow fonder?
Will I wait here on ya?
Baby, how much longer?
Ooh, I know it's turning
All I am learning is...
I'm so tired of the way the world works
I'm so tired of the way the world works
They conspire trying to keep us apart
There's so much in life that's undecided
There's so much touble that's uninvited
And only so much you can control
What are the forces that try to tease us
I wish the forces would just release us
I haven't seen you in forever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, baby
(Hey, hey, gimme just a little break, hey, hey, ain't no more that I can take, hey, hey)
They're trying to keep us apart
I'm so tired of the way the world works
I'm so tired of the way the world works
They conspire in trying to keep us apart
I'm so tired of the way the world works
I'm so tired of the way the world works
They conspire in trying to keep us apart
And I can do the frug
I can do the Robocop
I can do the Freddie
I cannot do the Smurf
And I can hate your girl
I can tell you that she's real pretty
I can take my clothes off
I cannot fall in love
And I can do the frug
I can do the Robocop
I can do the Freddie
I cannot do the Smurf
And I can watch TV
I can shuffle up to Buffalo
I can do a backbend
I will not call you back
And I can start a book
I can make some mac and cheese
I can sleep twelve hours
You'll never see my eyes
And I can do the frug
I can do the Robocop
I can do the Freddie
I cannot do the Smurf
And I can hate your girl
I can tell you that she's real pretty
I can take my clothes off
I cannot fall in love
You'll never see my eyes
I will not call you back
I cannot do the smurf
I cannot fall in love
I'll never fall in love
I cannot fall in love...
And I can do the frug
I can do the Robocop
I can do the Freddie
I cannot do the Smurf
Ils se croisent tous les jours comme un couple en amour
Elle lui sourit légèrement avec un tas d?�arrières pensées
Regarde toujours où il va, ce qu?�il fait
dans son retroviseur mais elle n?�a jamais osé
Quand elle ne le voit pas un matin, elle s?�inquiète
comme si il lui appartenait un peu dans sa tête
Elle n?�a jamais ne serait-ce que baissé sa fenêtre
Il ne s?�en rend même pas compte à croire qu?�il est bête
Que veux-tu ? Je suis folle de toi
Mon cœur ne bat plus quand je te vois
Tu es beau, tu es grand, tu es fascinant
T?�as des chevaux, des poneys, faisons des enfants
Quelle issue y a-t-il pour moi ?
Mon corps ne bouge plus quand j'entends ta voix
Tu es chaud comme un gant autour de mes doigts
mais ton regard de braise est tellement froid
Jamais un simple hochement d'tête
comme un adolescent timide dans une fête
« J?�adore vraiment ton style, comment tu t?�habilles »
Je n?�suis pas sûre que cette première phrase serait habile
J?�aimerais déjà te dire « Je t?�aime » sans consonne ni voyelle
Les choses se feraient d?�elles-même, j?�ai la flamme et la flemme
Dis moi qu'il n'y a personne, d'autres que c'est de ma faute
Tu attends que je viennes
J?�aimerais déjà te dire « Je t?�aime » sans consonne ni voyelle
Les choses se feraient d?�elles-même, j?�ai la flamme et la flemme
Dis moi que tu es fort comme cet étalon noir à côté de ce chêne
Que veux-tu ? Je suis folle de toi
Mon cœur ne bat plus quand je te vois
Tu es beau, tu es grand, tu es fascinant
T?�as des chevaux, des poneys, faisons des enfants
Quelle issue y a-t-il pour moi ?
Mon corps ne bouge plus quand j?�entends ta voix
Tu es chaud comme un gant autour de mes doigts
mais ton regard de braise est tellement froid
Charismatique, jean magnifique
Trèfles à quatre feuilles sous les chevaux au galop
Cet homme qui pique, sa force hippique
a touché mon cœur dans sa chemise à carreaux
Que veux-tu ? Je suis folle de toi
Mon cœur ne bat plus quand je te vois
Tu es beau, tu es grand, tu es fascinant
T?�as des chevaux, des poneys, faisons des enfants
Quelle issue y a-t-il pour moi ?
Mon corps ne bouge plus quand j?�entends ta voix
Tu es chaud comme un gant autour de mes doigts
mais ton regard de braise est tellement froid
I was walking along
Mindin' my business
When out of the orange colored sky
Flash, Bam, Alakazam,
Wonderful you came by
I was hummin' a tune
Drinkin' in sunshine
When out of that orange colored view
Wham, Bam, Alakazam,
I got a look at you.
One look and I yelled "timber"
Watch out for flying glass
'Cause the ceiling fell in
And the bottom fell out
I went in to a spin
And I started to shout
"I've been hit, this is it, this is it"
I was walking along
Mindin' my business
When love came and hit me in the eye
Flash, Bam, Alakazam,
Out of the orange colored sky
Well, one look and I yelled "timber"
Watch out for flying glass
'Cause the ceiling fell in
And the bottom fell out
I went in to a spin
And I started to shout
"I've been hit, this is it, this is it, I've been hit"
I was walkin' along
Mindin' my business
When love came and hit me in the eye
Flash, Bam, Alakazam,
Out of that orange colored,
Purple striped,
Pretty green polka-dot sky
Flash, Bam, Alakazam...
And goodbye
Oh, next light bust a right.
It's not gonna be too hard.
If there's no parking on the street pull up on the front yard.
Don't bring no vodka, or whiskey,
We've got everything you need.
Just bring a pair of your dancing shoes and get down to this beat.
Let's go down.
Wash that sugar down.
You gotta realize that.
Because there ain't no party
Like the party going on in my house.
Better believe that it's gonna be the biggest night of the year.
Because there ain't no party
Like the party going on in my house,
But it would be so much better if you were only here.
Mmmm, oh,
That's right.
Prom night, oscar night, got all that BS beat.
There's twenty girls for every single boy
And they're crazy from this heat.
We'll take you up and down and everywhere in between.
Mom and Dad are out of town all week,
So you better get on your feet.
Let's go down.
Wash that sugar down.
Because there ain't no party like the party going on in my house.
Better believe that it's gonna be the biggest night of the year,
Because there ain't no party like the party going on in my house,
But it would be so much better if you were only here. Mmmm.
Everything you ever wanted from this life is gonna happen right now.
Ooh, those girls tend to hide,
And the temperatures rise,
Better reach for the sky and raise up the ceiling...
Because there ain't no party like the party going on in my house.
Better believe that it's gonna be the biggest night of the year.
Because there ain't no party like the party going on in my house,
But it would be so much better if you were only here.
If only you were here.
The world is our carpet now 
The world is our dance floor now 
Remind me how to dance again 
The world is our carpet now 
The world is just waiting now 
No staring out windows now 
Our train stopped moving hours ago 
We're here, we're here, we're here 
Yes, we're here 
Free to run and cry 
Obliged to try 
And nothing here's worth winning without a fight 
When I can't move 
I'll enjoy the still for a while 
And lose myself in waves 
And mountains and the sky 
And I'm back here quick as lightning 
'Cause we are just seconds 
Seconds in a day 
It's a dance floor now 
No staring out windows now 
Our train stopped moving hours ago 
We're here, we're here, we're here 
What do I do?
Free, free to run and cry 
Obliged to try 
And nothing is worth winning without a fight 
Oh, yes, we're here 
Free to go insane 
Joy and pain are fighting in the corridors inside 
When I can't move 
I'll savor the pause for a while 
And lose myself in waves 
And mountains and the sky 
And I'm back here quick as lightning 
'Cause we are just seconds 
Seconds in a day
Christmas break of ninety eight just flipped me upside down
One coast out to the other, following the sound
Headed west to get the best of what we all knew then
One ocean to another, waves come crashing down
Carrying just me, Aunt Stephanie, she held my hand
Told me, why, I was
Blazing down that highway on my way to Rock Star Land
California, a place they say glistens gold.
I wanna go there and never come back home, yeah.
Staring up at freeway signs in dreams that make me sad
One coast out to the other
One ocean to another
We cruised out to the other side
Loved us in Nebraska how they cheered us in Mattane
Told me why, I, was
Blazing down that highway on my way to Rock Star Land
California, a place they say glistens gold.
I wanna go there and never come back home.
California, a place they say glistens gold.
I wanna go there and never come back home.
Everybody knows that he is gonna steal the show
You better keep it in control or you'll go crazy
Back mask, spinning wax, the record had a heart attack
It made you do the things that drove you crazy
You're the one
You're the one
You're the one, that's making me crazy
I'm in love, but its only temporary
You're the one that keeps me coming
When I'm running out of loving
I can only do it once, they'll call me lazy
Take back this and that
Shut your mouth, my wallet's fat
I'm selling out to make another million
You're the one
You're the one
You're the one that's making me crazy
I'm in love but it's only temporary, temporary
You're the one
You're the one that's making me crazy
I'm in love but its only temporary
It's making me crazy
I'm in love but its only temporary, temporary
Your're the... one
Loneliness, don't come around here
I've boarded up all the doors
There's nothing to give no more
I recall, a time when I knew it all
Wish someone done me wrong 
So I can then do no wrong
But if you try to keep moving on
And it seems like it's always so hard
And if you left me
Darling I know I'll be found
And if you need me
Don't you let me know
It's alright...
Maybe I, had too little love to realise
All that I tried to give 
Could never, ever be enough
But if you try to keep moving on
And it seems like it's always so hard
But if you left me
Darling I know I'll be found
And if you left me
And if you try
Oh and if you try
Oh and if you try, try
Oh and if you try, try
Oh and if you try, try
Oh and if you try...
I loved you in the morning
Before the sun would come 
You were the dawn to me
I loved you in the evening
While the birds were still singing 
You gave every song to me 
I want to see you 
More than anything 
Babe I miss you 
All day and everyday 
It's not that I can't go on without you 
Got a lot of things to do 
I'm busy, busy all the time 
Still I can't stop thinking about you
Woke up this morning
I suddenly realized
We're all in this together
I started smiling
'Cause you were smiling
And we're all in this together
I'm made of atoms
You're made of atoms
And we're all in this together
And long division
Just doesn't matter
'Cause we're all in this together
I saw you walking
In the city
We're all in this together
The city's changing
'Cause we are changing
And we're all in this together
Every twelve seconds
Someone remembers
That we're all in this together
In the kitchen
Of your rent-control apartment
We're all in this together
C'mon baby
I don't mean to rush you
I only wanted to reach out and touch you
I've gotta start to open my heart
I know you think
About jumping ship before it sinks
But we're all in this together
Ask a scientist
Its quantum physics
We're all in this together
And on the subway
We feel like strangers
But we're all in this together
Yeah I love you and you love her
And she loves him
But we're all in this together
Y'know baby
There's never been protection
In all the history of human connection
C'mon darling
It's all right to show me
You don't ever need to be lonely
Once you start to open your heart
I saw you crying
I started crying
'Cause we're all in this together
And then religion
It's a big decision
But we're all in this together
We're all in this together
Yeah, I left my body in a sea of people, and that's just how I'll leave it
Yeah, I left my body in a sea of people, and that's just what I believe in
Yeah, we laughing like a Wednesday night
We ran across the interstate
And drank a bottle of vinegar
And then we stayed up really late
Bring me down, break it down in the hot, hot desert
This is where I wanna be
Bring me down, break it down in the hot, hot desert
This is where I wanna be
And I am what I am, a natural disaster
Pick me up at three, send me off to sea
And maybe I'll come back for you
See, I lost my clothes, I'm skinny-dipping
And I can't understand what I'm after
So as we lay upon this ground, I swear you look like Lucifer
But green is blue, and so are you, 
And now we gone to Jupiter (Right now)
To Jupiter (Ah, shit)
Bring me down, break it down in the hot, hot desert
This is where I wanna be
Bring me down, break it down in the hot, hot desert
This is where I wanna be
And I am what I am, a natural disaster
Pick me up at three, send me off to sea
And maybe I'll come back for you
See, I lost my clothes, I'm skinny-dipping
And I can't understand what I'm after
Swim, swim, swim in a swimming pool
The sky is blue, the trees are, too
Swim, swim, swim from green to red
Go to bed, you sleepyhead
Swim, swim, swim in your swimming pool
Like swimmers do, I'll call on you
Yeah, I met somebody in a sea of people, and that's just how I'll leave it
Yeah, I left my body in a sea of people, and that's just what I believe in
That's just what I believe in 
That's just what I believe in
And I am what I am, a natural disaster
Pick me up at three, send me off to sea
And maybe I'll come back for you
See, I lost my clothes, I'm skinny-dipping
And I can't understand what I'm after
Swim, swim, swim
Stepping out tonight, flying so high
It's the good times keeping me alive
Are you ready to hit it running?
This is where it's at six in the morning
You can't fake this, only imitate this
You wanna lose control
You wanna lose control
You can't fake this, only imitate this
You wanna lose control
You wanna lose control
The way that she does it, I can't get enough
Attack! We keep it on the dance floor
Discotech! Meet me at the back door
Let's get down, we've been waiting a long time
A long time
She's back, I can feel it in the air
Discotech! You know she's gonna be there
Let's get down, we've been waiting a long time
A long time
(The way that she does it, I can't get enough)
Show up in the crowd, take a look around
Me and my crew, we came to get down
She's giving me looks, I can't help it
The way I'm feeling, it's gonna happen
You can't fake this, only imitate this
You wanna lose control
You wanna lose control
You can't fake this, only imitate this
You wanna lose control
You wanna lose control
The way that she does it, I can't get enough
Attack! We keep it on the dance floor
Discotech! Meet me at the back door
Let's get down, we've been waiting a long time
A long time
She's back, I can feel it in the air
Discotech! You know she's gonna be there
Let's get down, we've been waiting a long time
A long time
You make fast living look just fine
Looks like I got here just in time
Tonight, the city is yours and mine
But it won't last forever...
Attack! We keep it on the dance floor
Discotech! Meet me at the back door
Let's get down, we've been waiting a long time
A long time
She's back, I can feel it in the air
Discotech! You know she's gonna be there
Let's get down, we've been waiting a long time
A long time

Clouds float away like iron tools on the moon
All my time is in half life
Memories over memories
Can I see more than I'm programmed to be
Constellation of orion
A picture with a past, a future so vast
A mnemonic game on the arc of a journey
I report there once were cities
Open academies, avenues and tree
Human law, automatic oracles
Calendar, the years, verbal hemispheres
Constellation of orion
The repositioned light, the post atomic night
Informing me I'm near the axis of feeling
Constellation of orion
A picture with a past, a future so vast
A mnemonic game on the arc of a journey
Now with your hand in mine
The heat strikes me as divine
Seated here by my side
The day glows into the night
How is it you seem to know what I tried not to show
This must be rare
'Cause nothing else can compare
Not that I'm aware of
Seems like we traveled for days though we vanish away
Tell me where you need to go
Darling can we take it slow
Let's not stop
Please let's go
Say you're mine
Say it slow to be sure we know
'Cross the saccharine plain
Cracked and devoid of rain
I think of life without pain
To hide my hope from this scissor strain
How is it you seem to know what I tried not to show
This must be rare
'Cause nothing else can compare
Not that I'm aware of
Seems like we traveled for days though we vanish away
Tell me where you need to go
Darling can we take it slow
Let's not stop
Please let's go
Say you're mine
Say it slow to be sure we know
Well there's an ideal inside of me
That we're nothing at all
There's nothing threatening controlling me
In fact there's nothing at all
And still the wheel turning's all I'll be
It carries on till you crawl
You gotta know what you want to be
But there's no number to call
You got a feeling nothing here is free
'Cause you grew up in a mall
Your mom she caught you all on TV
And you can still hear her bawl
You got a million things you want to flee
Smuggle an ounce in a doll
You cut your eyes so you could finally see
That there ain't nothing at all
Turns out there's nothing at all
There must be a flaw in this fable, I
Have to contend with it all night
Wasn't alive back in the sixties
Somehow that was my fault
I'm just a shell empty as can be
Yeah, I've got nothing at all
You want to put your trust in some solid thing
Yeah, it's a drug to us all
But there's no ideal inside of me
So I got nothing at all
No I got nothing at all
And I got nothing at all
Must be a fault in this fable, I
Have to contend with all night
Such a danger so we gotta slide
Into the depths of the salt mine
There's nothing at all
There's nothing at all
There's nothing at all
There's nothing at all
There's nothing at all
There's nothing at all
There's nothing at all
There's nothing at all
Years ago I lost my guard
Ever since it's been hard
Standing up like a man, like a father
Understand that all I do
Is not enough for myself
I am tough on myself
I need to freeze, I need direction, aww please...
Show me all the rules girl,
I just want to get 'em wrong
Show me all the rules girl,
I just want to belong
First I'm gonna sing my song
I try to do what is right,
I try to win without a fight
From time to time I turn around
To that gun on the ground
I try to seek more than this:
A nice smile, a wet kiss
Don't want to miss what I'm looking for,
But it's behind your door.
Show me all the rules girl,
I just want to get 'em wrong
Show me all the rules girl,
I just want to belong
You've been locked up, and you need to escape
You broke the law, it was your first offence
Drug addiction, subtracting all your privileges
But giving up just makes no sense
We'll find a way
We'll find a way
Don't give in, don't give in
Don't give in, don't give in
All you can think about is breaking free
You can't make it on your own
You're thinking negative, nothing can go right
It's eating you down to the bone
We'll find a way
We'll find a way
Don't give in, don't give in
Don't give in, don't give in
We'll find a way
We'll find a way
Don't give in, don't give in
Don't give in, don't give in
Lay down in the tall grass
In a flat-bottom boat
Lay down and wait for you
With nothing but a piece of rope
Dreaming every night of you
Shaking at the sight
I'll be dreaming every night of you
I'll be shaking at the sight - of - you
Will you beg for forgiveness?
Will you pray to be saved?
Will you choke your children when they spit in your face?
Dreaming every night of you
Shaking at the sight
I'll be dreaming every night of you
I'll be shaking at the sight
I dreamt you found me out in a field
You tripped over my site
And you dug me out of this shallow grave
With your Swiss Army knife
And only you could revive me, so badly decomposed
I was bone white, dry, and scaly
But you still took me home
Dreaming every night of you
Shaking at the sight of you
I'll be dreaming every night of you
And how could you be so serene?
Motivation unclear
In a late basement seance that brought us to tears
Dreaming every night of you
Shaking at the sight
Oh, I'll be dreaming every night of you
I'll be shaking at the sight
I dreamt you found me out in a field
You tripped over my site
And you dug me out of this shallow grave
With your Swiss Army knife
And only you could revive me, so badly decomposed
I was bore white, dry, and scaly
But you still took me home
Dreaming every night of you
Shaking at the sight of you
I'll be dreaming every night of you
A dark congregation 
Of familiar faces
Gathered around the quiet earth
A red rose fell upon the soft snow
Prayers were whispered so slow
From our mouths
Our breath rose in the cold
Like a hundred souls escaping
Save me
I am swallowed by the guilt of this
You're gone
Sleeping in the dust
We will not let time erase us
We are surrounded
By all of the quiet sleepers inside the quiet earth
A fear that I cannot shape
You dared to kiss the face of the night
Our lips were cold as clay
We couldn't speak anyway
Save me
I am swallowed by the guilt of this
You're gone
Sleeping in the dust
We will not let time erase us
Our breath rose in the cold
Like a hundred souls
We, we are alone 
I know you're gone
Save me
I am swallowed by the guilt of this
You're gone
Sleeping in the dust
We will not let time erase us
Sing your life
Any fool can think up words that rhyme
Many others do
Why don't you?
Do you want to?
Sing your life
Walk right up to the microphone
And name
All the things you love
All the things that you loathe
Oh sing your life
The things that you love
And the things you loathe
Oh sing your life
Oh sing your life
La la la la
Sing your life
Others sang your life
But now's your chance to shine
And have the pleasure of saying what you mean
Have the pleasure of meaning what you sing
Oh make no mistake my friend
All of this will end
So sing it now
All the things you love
All the things you loathe
Oh sing your life
The things that you love
And the things you loathe
Oh sing your
Oh sing your
La la la la
Sing your life
Don't leave it all unsaid
Somewhere in the wasteland of your head
And make no mistake, my friend
Your pointless life will end
But before you go
Can you look at the truth?
You have a lovely singing voice
A lovely singing voice
And all of those
Who sing on key
They stole the notion
From you and me
So sing your life
Sing your life
When I look back on what I done
About 100 years from now
Gonna cry myself to sleep at night
Somebody shows me how
Uh huh
When the sun shines down what's left of me
About 100 years from now
Gonna cut my water with a rebel yell
And claw my way back to town
100 years
100 years
They'll break me
But I'll break them too
Oh and this years for the brakemen
And this one is for you
When sky cracks open and the thunder comes
About 100 years from now
Gonna bury this old yoke and chain
In the cold wet ground
And when I get off at Tennebrook Farm
About 100 years from now
I'm gonna marry you out of common sense
And get out from behind this plow
100 years
100 years
They'll break me
But I'll break them too
Oh and this years for the brakemen
And this one is for you
100 years
100 years
They'll break me
But I'll break them to
Oh and this year's for the brakemen
And this one is for you
Yesterday I turned 23
The date didn't mean that much to me
Then I started adding figures up in my head
It seems the cost of dreaming's left me in the red
Because of alcohol, I've shared 16 beds
With a five year reunion hanging over my head
11,000 people think I'm something I'm not
The courage to let them down is something I've still got
Sometimes I wanna cheat, but I don't
I wanna quit, but I won't
'Cause I made this bed
Give me a shovel, you'll be amazed
At how fast I dig a grave
Baby just lay in it
You're only brave till you're scared
You're only unique until compared
To every other worthless fuck trying to
Crawl into bed tonight...
She can't afford to live like this
Yes we can, oh yes we can
She can't be dumb enough to dream so big
Yes we can, oh yes we can
Move through the sleazy scenes
Past all the casting couches, rug-burned knees
I'm not done yet
No, I'm only getting started
You can't afford to live like this
You can't be dumb enough to dream so big
Yeah we sailed through all the sleazy scenes
Past all the casting couches, rug-burned knees
No, I'm not done yet
You can't afford to live like this
Yes we can, oh yes we can
You can't be dumb enough to dream so big
Yes we can, oh yes we can
Move through the sleazy scenes
Past all the casting couches, rug-burned knees
I'm not done yet
No, I'm only getting started
I'm caught in excitement 
An unusual spell
It's pure in a sense 
And abstract from our lives
And we talked a lot, 
Abstraction came into focus
Her tales of the tour 
And a hardcore life 
Were unmatched by the 
Pop sub-culture in mine
And we talked a lot 
And soon it would come into focus
(I tried to focus, I tried to focus! woah!)
There's no time for fighting
Any sex is personal 
Information not appealing 
To me in any sense at all
Is it wrong to think 
I'm a traditional man? 
I'd hope I'd be up 
For an annexation of that 
Yea, a part of me 
Can deal with this open relations
But concept to do 
Is like yes to a goal 
It's unclear how it happens
Maybe we'll act how we planned it
We sure talked a lot 
And soon it came into focus
(I tried to focus, I tried to focus! woah!)
There's no time for fighting 
Any sex is personal
Keep your head above the meaning 
And devotion doesn't swell
Any sexual encounter 
Adds an awful twisting touch
It's like scamming in the 90's
But getting used to this is hard
There's no time for fighting 
Any sex is personal
Keep your head above the meaning 
And devotion doesn't swell
Any sexual encounter 
Adds an awful twisting touch, touch, touch, touch, touch
It's like scamming in the 90's
But getting used to this is hard
I know you're losing sleep over me
I know you'll relive every moment
Below sheets where dreams are made
I know you'll cover your eyes
I know you'll quiver when fingers touch your side
But it all coincides some way.
Move a little closer, hold me tighter
I'll stay if you're gonna keep me in line
Don't want it to be over, move move slower
I'll stay if you're gonna keep me in line (in line)
I know everything reminds you of me
Even the songs you thought I'd never sing
I know you'll mess up your hair
I know you'll do things you would never dare
But it all coincides in some way
Now we're here, with the lights turned low
You won't regret anything we do
It's up to you, now make your move
These are the days, oh
These are days you'll remember
Never before and never since I promise
Will the whole world be warm as this
And as you feel it you'll know it's true
That you are blessed and lucky
It's true that you are touched by something
That will grow and bloom in you
These are days you'll remember
When May is rushing over you with desire
To be part of the miracles you see in every hour
You'll know it's true
That you are blessed and lucky
It's true that you are touched by something
That will grow and bloom in you
These are days
These are the days you might fill with laughter until you break
These days you might feel a shaft of light
Make its way across your face
And when you do, you'll know how it was meant to be
See the signs and know their meaning
It's true, you'll know how it was meant to be
Hear the signs and know they're speaking to you
To you
Hey, hey, I'm like a beast
Hey, hey, I'm like a beast
DJ drop the record, I'mma start a stampede
He drop the record, I start a stampede
Hey, boy, I push it out
Hey, boy, I push it out
Fire, move my body like a merry-go-round
Front to the back, I'll make you go 'round
Get like me, get on the dance floor
Get like me

Oh, here I go, drip-drop it way down low
You're 'bout to miss, winding to this, don't make me start without you
Oh, here I go, you're moving way too slow

I don't want to start without you

Hey, boy, way that I move
Hey, boy, way that I move
Body like a weapon that'll make you go boom
Hip like a drum I'll make you go
Hey, boy, oi, where you at?
Hey, boy, oi, where you at?
You're the only one that I want on my back
The only one I want on my back
Get like me, get on the dance floor
Get like me
I don't want to start without you
Oh, here I go, drip-drop it way down low
You're 'bout to miss, winding to this, don't make me start without you
Oh, here I go, you're moving way too slow
I'm coming up, put down your cup, don't make me start without you
Hear it out, push it out, watch it how she work it out
Poppin' a couple of bottles, drink it all and get another round
I know you love to rub a dub with a thug
Don't start without me, I just got in the club
You steal the show, no competition
Beauty after thinks is for your invention
Drop it for me hey, like ya give me amnesia
Shake it, shake it, shake it, like your booty got a seizure
Take it down, propeller, she winding, winding, wind

My girl, she know what to do
Drop for me, missile that'll make you go boom
Get like me
Get on the dance floor
Get like me
Get on the dance floor
Oh, here I go, drip-drop it way down low
You're 'bout to miss, winding to this, don't make me start without you
Oh, here I go, you're moving way too slow
I'm coming up, put down your cup, don't make me start without you
Oh, here I go, drip-drop it way down low
You're 'bout to miss, winding to this, don't make me start without you
Oh, here I go, you're moving way too slow
I'm coming up, put down your cup, don't make me start without you

You got everybody acting crazy
I'm not gonna say you don't
You got everybody listening
You got everybody putting on a show 
You got everybody acting crazy
I'm not gonna say you don't
You got it all wrong
You're so scene, listening,
You can feel but you won't sing
Anything you know you mean 
Do you take it, do you take it seriously
Because seriously, this high life scenery 
It makes me crazy
Hey, what do you say
I need some help, help me out boys
I'm not feelin' so good
Girl, I've got the feeling you're feeling something
If what you say is moving you
Everybody in here has got it goin' on and I can't compete with that
I'll take off all my clothes to the thrift store
And take it all, take it all back
You're so scene, listening
You can feel, but you won't sing
Anything you know you mean
Do you take it, do you take it seriously
Because seriously, this high life scenery
Is making me...
Hey, look, what do you see?
Take a look, take a look
You're looking at me
Singing and thinkin' that I'm about to scream (scream, scream)
You're so scene, listening
You can feel, but you won't sing
Anything you know you mean
Do you take it, do you take it seriously
Because seriously, this high life scenery
It makes me crazy.

Well, she woke up from a weird dream
I don't know, half asleep
I try to speak about it all
Another one about a babe from back in the day
Get a strange look from a girl who looked uptight
All night, I guess I did nothing right
If she doesn't beat me, well brother she tried
If she isn't screaming, she doesn't belong inside
Saint Jerome, I don't ever ever wanna be alone
I don't ever ever wanna be alone, oh Saint Jerome
Come home
Take a long walk down a short block
Turn around, go back and lose her pound for pound
Man, you wouldn't believe what I wouldn't believe
Now you return in a rain coat, riverboat
Show up late dressed like a domino
Your eyes, they never looked so good at me
Saint Jerome, I don't ever ever wanna be alone
I don't ever ever wanna be alone, oh Saint Jerome
Come home
Saint Jerome, I don't ever ever wanna be alone
Saint Jerome
Oh Saint Jerome, I don't ever ever wanna be alone
Oh Saint Jerome
Come home
He wants to know what he doesn't know
He doesn't know what he wants to know
And for a change he's not coming home
Home for the weekend,
Looking for a good time;
Of all the numbers you end up calling mine.
Ready or not, I think I'll give this a shot.
I should know better than to
Give her what she wants.
I picked her up and she was three-forths gone.
She passed out before we even got to talk.
All I want to know is:
Where were you when I needed you most?
Why did you leave me alone?
We gave up before we gave it a chance,
And I don't understand.
Back to where we left off, baby.
"How you been and what's been new with you lately?"
Just forget it, it's the same old runaround.
You build me up just to let me down.
Down!
Where were you when I needed you most?
Why did you leave me alone?
We gave up before we gave it a chance,
And I don't understand.
Just forget it, it's the same old runaround,
Just forget it, just forget it
What did you want to see?
What did you want to be when you grew up?
What did you want to see?
What did you want to be when you grew up?
To go away and not look back
And think of what the others say
To go ahead and change your life
Without regard to what is said
And everyone must do the same
You find yourself lost again
Forget the things you've left behind
Through looking back you may go blind
What did you want to see?
What did you want to be when you grew up?
What did you want to see?
What did you want to be when you grew up?
To go away and not look back
And think of what the others say
To go ahead and change your life
Without regard to what is said
And everyone must do the same
You find yourself lost again
Forget the things you've left behind
Through looking back you may go blind
What did you want to see?
What did you want to be when you grew up?
What did you want to see?
What did you want to be when you grew up?
What did you want to see?
What did you want to be when you grew up?
What did you want to see?
What did you want to be when you grew up?
What did you want to see?
What did you want to be when you grew up?
What did you want to see?
What did you want to be when you grew up?
What did you want to see?
What did you want to be?
Now, don't you believe me?
Oh, can't you see I'm full of lies?
Oh, something
Oh, something once pure 
I came to the city
To build a mountain of envy
And to marry a Kennedy 
So let's stay out tonight
I just can't stop it
I just can't stop it
Ooh
Girl, I said, ooh
Whatever happened
My friend
Ooh
Girl, I said, ooh
Whatever happened
My friend
Corey Haim 
So if I betray you
I won't be the first, you won't be the last
Oh, something
Oh, something once pure 
I'm Paramount Pictures
I'm Andy Warhol with other peers
Hey, has-beens
I'm the American dream 
So let's stay out tonight
You see, I just can't stop it
I just can't stop it
Ooh
Girl, I said, ooh
Whatever happened
My friend
Ooh
Hey, girl, I said, ooh
Whatever happened
My friend
Yeah, Corey Haim, Haim, Haim, Haim 
So put on that dress tonight
You see, we just can't stop it
We just can't stop it
Ooh
Hey, girl, I said, ooh
Whatever happened
My friend
Corey Haim
All right
All right
All right
Down at the Astoria the scene was changing
Bingo and rock were pushing out X-rating
We were the first band to vomit in the bar
And find the distance to the stage too far
Meanwhile it's getting late at ten o'clock
Rock is dead they say
Long live rock
Long live rock, I need it every night
Long live rock, come on and join the line
Long live rock, be it dead or alive
People walk in sideways pretending that they're leaving
We put on our makeup and work out all the lead-ins
Jack is in the alley selling tickets made in Hong Kong
Promoter's in the pay box wondering where the band's gone
Back in the pub the governor stops the clock
Rock is dead, they say
Long live rock
Long live rock, I need it every night
Long live rock, come on and join the line
Long live rock, be it dead or alive
Landslide, rocks are falling
Falling down 'round our very heads
We tried but you were yawning
Look again, rock is dead, rock is dead, rock is dead
The place is really jumping to the high-watt amps
'Til a 20-inch cymbal fell and cut the lamps
In the blackout they dance right into the aisle
And as the doors fly open even the promoter smiles
Someone takes his pants off and the rafters knock
Rock is dead, they say
Long live rock, long live rock, long live rock
Long live rock, long live rock, long live rock
Long live rock, long live rock, long live rock
Long live rock, I need it every night
Long live rock, come on and join the line
Long live rock, be it dead or alive
It's that desire over love I have to turn around
And come right back to bay
'Cause you're my ceiling of plankton
You hold the white light much better
And you know
You got that keeping it warm
Not too tight
Just like my favorite sweater
And you glow a purple star
And when you notice all your stars are in line
Yes, yes you'll find me
I'll be there waiting right behind
And when you notice that your heart is bleeding
Mine is bleeding too
That magic walk that's in your sky
I'll give you all my guts
You make me still
You make me blush
You make me go out my own mind
And when you notice all your stars are in line
Yes, yes you'll find me
I'll be there waiting right behind
And when you notice that your mind is fleeting
Mine is fleeting too
That magic walk that's in your sky
I'll give you all my guts
You make me still
You make me blush
You make me go out my own mind
I'll give you all my guts
You make me still
You make me blush
You make me go out my own mind
Be happy
Come on let's go get it on!
Be happy
Be happy
Come on let's go get it on!
Be happy
Everybody let's go have some fun
I don't want to waste my time on simple little things
I'd rather stay here all the night with happy boys who sings
Come on let's go get it on, everybody let's go have some fun
I got a feeling you could use a little smile
Hoping it would stay there for just a little while
Making a lot of noise up there, throw your hands up in the air
I don't want to waste my time on simple little things
I'd rather stay here all the night with everyone who sings
Happy boys and happy girls, we'll be
We are the happy boys and girls
Happy boys and happy girls, we'll be
So happy, yeah!, so, so happy, yeah!
Happy boys and happy girls, we'll be
We are the happy boys and girls
Happy boys and happy girls, we'll be
Oh yeah, so happy!
Try with a giggle it will make you look so nice
And if you start to warm, you could further break the ice
Come on let's go get it on, everybody let's go have some fun
I've got a feeling you could use a little smile
Hoping it would stay there for just a little while
Making a lot of noise up there, throw your hands up in the air
I don't want to waste my time on simple little things
I'd rather stay here all the night with everyone who sings
Happy boys and happy girls, we'll be
We are the happy boys and girls
Happy boys and happy girls, we'll be
So happy, yeah!, so, so happy, yeah!
Happy boys and happy girls, we'll be
We are the happy boys and girls
Happy boys and happy girls, we'll be
Oh yeah, so happy!
Young and old, be happy
Everyone, be happy

'Cause happy boys and happy girls around the world
Be happy 
Come on let's go get it on!

Everybody let's go have some fun
Be happy
Come on let's go get it on!
Be happy
So happy!
I'm missing out
I've been completely shut down
And while awake submerged
I flow through this feeling
Like chairmen Mao's
Wake up song
The words from you ring on and on
I want to just hold you
I can't explain
This feeling treats me so strange
But where are you these days?
I need you near me
We're Moments away, Moments away
From making up again hey hey
Moments away
Just seconds too late
Seconds away, Seconds away
We're leaving the house just for the day
Seconds away, Seconds away
All this just to go out for the day
I'm missing out
I've been completely shut down
When we're at home
It seems your nowhere near me
We try our best
It's our big test
Your looking east
And I'm lost out west
Can't you hear me?
We're Moments away, Moments away
Lets burn the house and run away
Moments away
Just seconds too late
Seconds away, Seconds away
We're leaving the house just for the day
Seconds away, Seconds away
All this just to go out for the day
Moments away, Moments away
We're leaving the house just for the day
Moments away, Moments away
I wouldn't have it any other way
Many years since I was here
On the street I was passin' my time away
To the left and to the right, buildings towering to the sky
It's outta sight in the dead of night
(Ooh) Here I am, and in this city
(Ooh) With a fistful of dollars 
And baby, you'd better believe 
I'm back, back in the New York Groove 
I'm back, back in the New York Groove 
I'm back, back in the New York Groove 
Back in the New York Groove, in the New York Groove 
In the back of my Cadillac 
A wicked lady, sittin' by my side, sayin' "Where are we?"
Stop at Third and Forty-three, exit to the night
It's gonna be ecstacy, this place was meant for me
(Ooh) I feel so good tonight
(Ooh) Who cares about tomorrow
So baby, you'd better believe 
I'm back, back in the New York Groove 
I'm back, back in the New York Groove 
I'm back, back in the New York Groove 
Back in the New York Groove, in the New York Groove
I'm back, back in the New York Groove
I'm back, back in the New York Groove
I'm back, back in the New York Groove
I'm back, back in the New York Groove
I'm back, back in the New York Groove
I'm back, back in the New York Groove
I'm back, back in the New York Groove
I'm back, back in the New York Groove
I'm back, back in the New York Groove
I'm back, back in the New York Groove
You're digging deeper
Love is a creeper
I know the reaper
On a first name basis
It ain't Steven
It isn't Adam
I got some apples if you want 'em
You can grab 'em
And what I really want to do tonight
Is toughen you up
Harder you get
Caught in my sweat
Never to wet
To want it all
Beatin' my drum
Faster you're done
Can't have one
You want them all
Hell is my heaven
A loaded weapon
Don't point that thing at me
Unless you plan to shoot
My room is darker
Than any colour
I'm not your baby and I'll never be
You mother
And what I really want to do tonight
Is toughen you up
Harder you get
Caught in my sweat
Never to wet
To want it all
Beatin' my drum
Faster you're done
Can't have one
You want them all
You're sensitive to light
We're conjuring the night
You stand up with pride
Attempting to walk
You won't escape alive
Of what's become your life
Stop crying like a child
You got what you want
And what I really want to do tonight
Is toughen you up
Harder you get
Caught in my sweat
Never to wet
To want it all
Beatin' my drum
Faster you're done
Can't have one
You want them all
I sit in the window watching my days from a safe distance
Clock towers toll and I am frozen every instant
Backward I brood and forward I dream for figments of existence
It can't be saved. It's already lost, it thrives on my resistance
We are bound and marching to an ever static distance
I sit in the window watching my days from a great distance
Clock towers toll and I am frozen every instant
Backward I brood and forward I dream for figments of existence
It can't be saved. It's already lost, it thrives on my resistance
My persistence, that's just my existence
Backward I brood and forward I dream for figments of existence
We are bound and marching to an ever static distance, static distance
Another lesson has been learned,
In this days' modern times,
Strangers in the mist appear,
Now there's war, all the time,
Systematically go and destroy,
Commit another atrocity,
Aggressors are in their places,
Man-made catastrophe.
I'm not looking for a fight now,
And I don't care who's wrong or right now,
So release the dove into flight now,
So we can start right now,
We can start right now.
A small key's gonna open the door,
Across the border to a new land,
And in the new land a sand storm roars,
Under spell and the ghost of a man,
A pack of men, they're yours to stay,
Their prayers fall upon deaf ears,
Machiavelli owns a machine gun now,
And I see it in the mask and a puppeteer.
I'm not looking for a fight now,
And I don't care who's wrong or right now,
So release the dove into flight now,
So we can start right now,
We can start right now.
Humanity has no blame in this case, this big game of chess for us all,
Hostility explodes in the mess, now your arm got blood all over the wall,
And clarity turns to dark, blindfolding prisoners of war,
And solidarity, on the razor's edge, boy, what? You're a big puncher now, right?
Yeah?... Ha!... Nah... I don't fucking think so!
Ha ha ha!
I'm not looking for a fight now,
And I don't care who's wrong or right now,
So release the dove into flight now,
So we can start right now,
We can start right now.
Quand tu
Quand tu me prends dans tes bras
Quand je regarde dans tes yeux
Je vois qu'un Dieu existe
Ce n'est pas dur d'y croire
Before I met you I wasn't terribly lucky
Every Prince Charming lost charm after twelve
But then you came and made the past look so funny
Put my old sadness to sleep on a shelf
If this was meant to be
Don't condemn me to be free
And even if we never marry
I will always love you, baby
Childishly
'Cause something
You've got something I can't resist
Things are what they will be
When I look into your eyes
They say to me that God's do exist
And there's something
You've got something I can't resist
Things are what they will be
When I look into your eyes
They say to me that God's do exist
You make me believe
You make me believe
I love the temperature and smell of your body
The shape of your lips and the size of your nose
I love that everything you say is so funny
Plus you're the best kisser that I've ever known
You see the way I am
Without make-up, without clothes
And you accept me like nobody
And I will always love you, baby
With eyes closed
'Cause something
You've got something I can't resist
Things are what they will be
When I look into your eyes
They say to me that God's do exist
And there's something
You've got something I can't resist
Things are what they will be
When I look into your eyes
They say to me that God's do exist
You make me believe
You make me believe
Quand tu
Quand tu me prends dans tes bras
Quand je regarde dans tes yeux
Je vois qu'un Dieu existe
Ce n'est pas dur d'y croire
There's something
I believe...
There's something
I believe...
There's something
I believe
I do
You make me believe...
... Je te desire ...
They say we look pretty good together,
Well, don't you wanna find out, don't you wanna find out,
I know you think you're oh so clever,
Well, soon you're gonna find out, soon you're gonna find out.
That when the sun comes up, there'll be nothing wrong,
'Cause I will be away from you,
When the sun comes up there'll be nothing wrong,
'Cause I will be away from you.
I'm trying hard to make you listen,
But you don't wanna find out, you don't wanna find out,
If you could see what you were missing,
I'm sure you'd wanna find out, don't you wanna find out.
That when the sun comes up, there'll be nothing wrong,
'Cause I will be away from you,
When the sun comes up there'll be nothing wrong,
'Cause I will be away from you.
When the sun comes up there'll be nothing wrong,
'Cause I will be away from you.
When the sun comes up there'll be nothing wrong,
'Cause I will be away from you.
They say we look pretty good together,
Well, don't you wanna find out, don't you wanna find out
All right
Here it comes
Well I can tell you for the money
The simple life honey is good
Uh-huh
Well if you ask me how you made it
Secure life, baby, you should
Oh, yes you should
'Cause if you're doing all the best that you can
But you're still runnin' just as fast as the man says
Well I can tell you for the money
The simple life honey is good
Uh-huh, now
Yes it's good
Now when you're movin' to the city
You worry on your mental health
Yes you do, now
Oh, you gentlemen and ladies
You've got to be good to yourself
Mm-hmm
So get yourself into a ranch-style home
When the neighbor's never more than a stone's throw
Well I can tell you for the money
The simple life honey is good
Yes it is
Yes it's good
That's right
Yeah
But oh, no
All the money
Still you just can't please everybody
How bad do
Do you want it?
Cause the money
It looks so good, good, good
Oh
Yeah
Whoo!
Yeah
So now you're chasin' the American dream
Just like the dollar's gonna make everybody scream
But I can tell you for the money
The simple life sure looks good
That's right, now
Yes it's good
Oh yeah
Oh, no
All the money
Looks so good, good, good
To everybody
How bad do
Do you want it?
Cause the money
It looks so good, good, good
Now there's a whole lot of faking
And takin'
And shakin' my hand
And when they tell you they love ya
They love ya like a one night stand
Mm-hmm
So if you're playin' in a rock and roll band
But still you're doing whatever the man says
Well I can tell you for the money
The simple life honey is good
That's right
Yes it's good
Uh-huh
Take care
Moving forward using all my breath
Making love to you was never second best
I saw the world crashing all around your face
Never really knowing it was always mesh and lace
I'll stop the world and melt with you
You've seen the difference and it's getting better all the time
And there's nothing you and I won't do
I'll stop the world and melt with you
(We should know better) Dream of better lives the kind which never hate
(We should see) Trapped in a state of imaginary grace
(We should know better) I made a pilgrimage to save this human's race
(We should see) Never comprehending a race that's long gone by
(Let's stop the world) I'll stop the world and melt with you
(Let's stop the world) You've seen the difference and it's getting better all the time
And there's nothing you and I won't do
(Let's stop the world) I'll stop the world and melt with you
The future's open wide
I'll stop the world and melt with you
(I'll stop the world) You've seen some changes and it's getting better all the time
And there's nothing you and I won't do
(I'll stop the world) I'll stop the world and melt with you
The future's open wide
Hmmm hmmm hmmm
Hmmm hmmm hmmm hmmm
Hmmm hmmm hmmm
Hmmm hmmm hmmm hmmm
I'll stop the world and melt with you
(I'll stop the world) You've seen the difference and it's getting better all the time
And there's nothing you and I won't do
(I'll stop the world) I'll stop the world and melt with you
I'll stop the world and melt with you (I'll stop the world and melt with you)
I'll stop the world and melt with you (I'll stop the world and melt with you)
You're not the type 
Type of girl to remain 
With the guy, with the guy too shy 
Too afraid to say, he'll give his heart to you forever
I'm not the boy that will fall to his knees 
With his hands clenched tight 
Begging, begging you please 
To stay with him for worse and for better 
But I'm staring at you now 
There's no one else around 
I'm thinking you're the girl for me 
I'm just saying it's fine by me 
If you never leave 
And we can live like this forever 
It's fine by me 
In the past I would try 
Try hard to commit to a girl 
Wouldn't get too far 
And it always somehow seemed to fall apart 
And with you, you, you 
I can see what I need 
I can dream realistically 
I knew that this was different from the start 
And it seems that every time 
We're eye to eye 
I can find another piece of you 
That I don't wanna lose 
And I'm staring at you now 
There's no one else around 
I'm thinking you're the girl I need 
I'm just saying it's fine by me 
If you never leave 
And we can live like this forever 
It's fine by me 
I'm just saying it's fine by me 
If you never leave 
And we can live like this forever 
It's fine by me 
And it's never easy 
Darling, believe me 
I'm as skeptical as you 
When I think of life without 'us' 
She's like "What we supposed to do?" 
But I don't wanna come on too strong 
I'm just saying it's fine by me 
If you never leave 
We can live like this forever 
It's fine by me 
It's fine by me if you never leave 
And we can live like this forever 
It's fine by me
I'm just saying it's fine by me 
If we never leave 
And we can live like this forever 
It's fine by me
Here's wishing you the bluest sky
And hoping something better comes tomorrow
Hoping all the verses rhyme
And the very best of choruses to
Follow all the doubt and sadness
I know that better things are on the way
Here's hoping all the days ahead 
Won't be as bitter as the ones behind you
Be an optimist instead
And somehow happiness will find you
Forget what happened yesterday
I know that better things are on the way
It's really good to see you rocking out and having fun
Living like you just begun
Accept your life and what it brings
I hope tomorrow you'll find better things
I know tomorrow you'll find better things
Here's wishing you the bluest sky
And hoping something better comes tomorrow
Hoping all the verses rhyme
And the very best of choruses to
Follow all the doubt and sadness
I know that better things are on the way
I know you've got a lot of good things happening up ahead
The past is gone, it's all been said
So here's to what the future brings
I know tomorrow you'll find better things
I know tomorrow you'll find better things
I hope tomorrow you'll find better things
I know tomorrow you'll find better things
I hope tomorrow you'll find better things
One two three four...
Here, the future is ever so near
Why should we all be alone
Every night on the way home
This time, we should be starting again
Get up and counting to ten
Seeing you combing your hair
Pretending that no one is there
You know it could be better than that
But wait until tomorrow morning
Learning to be you is what hurts most
Close your eyes and hold your terror close
Out here,
I hear you come in loud and clear
I carried you till it got dark
And then walked you home through the park
You're right, strangers are easy to like
Thunder and lightning will strike
Make a move, you'll get that mac
Echoes who don't answer back
Just please, give me a chance to say no
But wait until tomorrow morning
Learning to be you is what hurts most
Close your eyes and hold your terror close.
Your western homes are locked forever
The new frontier is not that near
Magnetic screens that fold in backward
Will only bring you years of fear
This is what I always wanted,
A new home with a place to breathe
Bring your congregation someday
And you will never...
Never see what I want
I can't see what I want
Can't see what I want
I can't see what I want
What I want
Can't see
A-can I get get get to know kn-know know you better better baby (x2)
A-can I, can I get get get to know kn-know know you better better baby (x2)
Oh baby girl in those baby pants

But you say

Away the key, are you coming with me?
So fancy free, hey, but you say?
I don't do that kind of thing!
And you say
I don't do that kind of thing!
Say what?

Took a trip on a houseboat, it was fun, you and me
I know you're really in love with him, are you up to your knees?
Oh, I'm always in decline, always changing my lines
Always changing my mind to be a friend is fine
I won't go sinking this houseboat, it's so hard to believe
He made you smile so easy, so make a smile for me
Will I always be denied, I thought about it last night
Could we baby, honey try to put it right this time?
Oh, how I've wanted to change
Let you take me home, let you rearrange
To find opportunity you should give yourself to me
You should give yourself to me
Oh, how I've wanted to change
Let you take me home, let you rearrange
To find opportunity you should give yourself to me
You should give yourself to me
If you knew what you do
When no one's in the dark room
But me and you, our brilliant disguise
It's the taste of the chase, I do confess
It's the mess that feels so right
Call on a Monday, come on a Tuesday
They'll never know, pop off a cork for a
Wednesday, play with me Thursday
But she'll always be his girl
Call on a Monday, come on a Tuesday
They'll never know, pop off a cork for a
Wednesday, stay with me Thursday
But she'll always be his girl
His girl Friday
His girl Friday
His girl Friday
His girl Friday
His girl Friday
His girl Friday
Just a kiss, he won't miss
You know you're gonna miss this
As long as you live, when you were mine
Bite your lip, pull me in, it's not the sin
It's the mess that feels so right
Call on a Monday, come on a Tuesday
They'll never know, pop off a cork for a
Wednesday, play with me Thursday
But she'll always be his girl
Call on a Monday, come on a Tuesday
They'll never know, pop off a cork for a
Wednesday, stay with me Thursday
But she'll always be his girl
His girl Friday
His girl Friday
His girl Friday
His girl Friday
His girl Friday
His girl Friday
If he knew what I knew
He'd thank God it's Friday
He's out of luck, I'm with you
Call on a Monday, come on a Tuesday
They'll never know, pop off a cork for a
Wednesday, play with me Thursday
But she'll always be his girl
Call on a Monday, come on a Tuesday
They'll never know, pop off a cork for a
Wednesday, stay with me Thursday
But she'll always be his girl
His girl Friday
His girl Friday
His girl Friday

His girl Friday
His girl Friday
His girl Friday
His girl Friday
His girl Friday

The teacher had you write a letter, you were eight years old
About the man that you'd become and the positions you'd hold
But this was long before you and Jackie Geronimo
Met in the Prelude Park at midnight
Now when it came to bells and whistles, Jackie did not lack
And when she kissed you on the kisser, boy, you kissed her back
Now you tell her that you love her and she cuts you slack
When you drink with your buddies on the weekend
And the weeks fly by and the years roll on
You spend your whole life dropping nickels in the bucket, wakin' up at dawn
And while Jackie bestowed the joys of finger-lickin'
The clock up on the wall was tickin'
You got yourself a job cleaning hospital floors
But Jackie had a baby, then she had five more
They'd pay you just enough to drag your ass to the store
To buy bread, milk and better homes and gardens
Jackie flips the pages and she dreams little dreams
A cottage in the country built with real wood beams
There's a baby in the bedroom, he's starting to scream
She holds him, though, he probably won't remember it
And the weeks fly by and the years roll on
Sometimes dreams are all you got to keep you going when the day gets long
And you gave up so many just to make a livin'
That clock up on the wall was tickin'
Now the kids are all grateful when they left the nest
And Jackie wasn't perfect but she did her best
You seize the opportunity to get you some rest
But you can't sleep on account of screaming grandkids
The golden years are meant to leave a gleam in your eye
You're starting to discover it's a great big lie
They'll work you like a dog 'til you quit or you die
But you can't quit cause Jackie needs the benefits
And the weeks fly by and the years roll on
They say patience is a virtue, but the doctor says she don't have long
You stood up and tried your damnedest not to listen
But that clock up on the wall was tickin'
When they told you to clear the room, that's when it hit you
You watched as the caravan took your sweetheart away
The arguments and fights and money troubles seem so worthless
As the kids throw yellow roses on her grave
And the weeks fly by and the years roll on
The house is quiet now and everything inside, it seems to know she's gone
There's a picture of you both sixteen years old just kissing
And that clock up on the wall was tickin'
You always thought she had a chance and it was somewhere hidden
Now you've come to the conclusion that she never did
Not a chance, that is
I love you, ONO
Diamond ring, CHA CHA

I've been heading home
I've been going wrong
It's been this way for so long
Let me hear you say it
(I've been heading home)
Let me hear you say
(I've been going wrong)
It's been this way for so long
(It's been this way for so long)
You do what you wanna do
And say what you wanna say
So, come on and be my light
Come on and lead the way
And people speak I hear them saying
You won't last another day
You keep me hanging on
I won't ever be gone
We know that something is wrong
Let me hear you say it
(I've been heading home)
Let me hear you say
(I've been going wrong)
It's been this way for so long
(It's been this way for so long)
You do what you wanna do
And say what you wanna say
So, come on and be my light
Come on and lead the way
And people speak I hear them saying
You won't last another day
You do what you wanna do
And say what you wanna say
So, come on and be my light
Come on and lead the way
And people speak I hear them saying
You won't last another day
You won't last another day
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh yeah, oh!
Oh oh oh, ooh ooh
Oh oh oh, ooh ooh ooh
Landlord's knocking at my door 
Cussing me out
Got laid off my job the night before 
Can't figure how
I'm gonna fix tomorrow when 
Yesterday's still a mess
Can you tell me what's the point, man?
It all seems meaningless
Wish that I could step away and breathe
This world's trying to swallow me
Clear away the clouds inside my head
Someone just tell me that it's okay now
What are you whining about?
Got my dreams, got my life, got my love
Got my friends, got the sunshine above
Why am I making this hard on myself
When there's so many beautiful reasons I have to be happy?
Oh oh, oh oh oh 
People lie, people hide
People cry, people fight
And they don't know why
If fear is all that we should fear
Then what are we so afraid of?
'Cause fear is only in our heads
Someone please say that it's okay now
What are you whining about?
Got my dreams, got my life, got my love
Got my friends, got the sunshine above
Why am I making this hard on myself
When there's so many beautiful reasons I have to be happy?
Oh oh, oh
Any day I'll come back thinking that if one is against me
And the world wants to fight me
Preparing to battle an enemy unseen
During my stressing I'm blinded to the lessons
That could be a blessing if I'd be confessing
That the enemy
I'm trying to beat is hiding in me, oh 
But it's okay now
What are you worrying about?
Got my dreams, got my life, got my love
Got my friends, got the sunshine above
Why am I making this hard on myself
When there's so many beautiful reasons I have to be happy?
Keep your pride, don't go
So many reasons to be happy
It's your life, it's your world
That it's okay now
Keep your pride, don't go
It's your life, it's your world
Got my dreams, got my life, got my love
Got my friends, got the sunshine above
Why am I making this hard on myself
When there's so many beautiful reasons I have to be happy?
I left the house left the room with the foxy on my back
And my supplies in a magic pack
And I followed the sound of music
Not up a hill ... but down to an old wharf shack
Inside I heard the trumpets call
I salute to the champions on the wall
And in the jazz of squalls and impassioned brawls she danced
And the night she looked so fine to me
Oh I am a man on an Odyssey
And so tie me to the mast I must believe!
Wow didi didi I just had to look
I said wow didi didi how those hips they shook
Eye patch tongue ring little black book
Welcome fishies to my hook
And the tiny chefs they waved their giant knives
And the dark goumas they flicked dynamite
Still I kept the sight of my desire
And this one thing's sure I made no apologies
Lights dimmed but she shone like mythology
And I must admit she felt so alive
She waves for everybody down on the floor
As if to pray to the gods of the festival
And there we were in the depths of the wild below
Her face so close I could taste the distant shores
She whispered 'wait for the trumpet's call'
It's not exactly love it's to adore
A whirlwind came into my life and he tried to rescue me
Will you come, will you go
Will you tell me seriously
Twisting burning, my thoughts turning, back to you again
Sweet thing, take me to the end
You'd better dig and take a look inside yourself
So the story goes, and so I've heard it said,
That you left your land, to trade for a place, so far away,
So out of date, that only you could understand
And at the ceiling of my feeling, backed up against the wall,
Sweet thing, you know I'd fall in line
You'd better dig and take a look inside yourself
She wants to be free
I want to know
She wants to be free
I want to know
Yeah
A whirlwind came into my life and he tried to rescue me
Will you come, will you go
Will you tell seriously
Twisting burning, my thoughts turning, back to you again
Sweet thing, take me to the end
She wants to be free
I want to know
She wants to be free
I want to know
Yeah (uh huh yeah yeah)
When you said to me
You are not so old
Did I know it then?
'Cause I had just been told
I didn't think I'd find you
Perfect in so many ways
But I've been waiting (Waiting)
And I want to (Have you)
I've been waiting (Waiting)
And I want to
The secret on your lips
That nobody knows
Gentle in your eyes
You can wear my clothes
I didn't think I'd find you
Perfect in so many ways
But I've been waiting (Waiting)
And I want to (Have you)
I've been waiting (Waiting)
And I want to (Have you)
I've been waiting (Waiting)
And I want to
When you said to me
You are not so old
Did I know it then?
'Cause I had just been told
You know I didn't think I'd find you
Perfect in so many ways
But I've been waiting (Waiting)
And I want to (Have you)
I've been waiting (Waiting)
And I want to have you (Have you)
I've been waiting
Nothing new to say
(Nothing new to say)
Nothing to report
'Cause the future happened yesterday
If I could tell the truth
(If I could tell the truth)
I could make you stay
But forever seems so far away
I fell apart in your arms for the last time
And I felt free to do what I want
Because of the things you told me
Because of the things you told me, you told me
I felt free
You could be the end of me
(You could be the end of me)
Too many shades of gray
It's just another pointless game we play
I couldn't tell the truth
(I couldn't tell the truth)
I'll never make you stay
Because tomorrow always happens yesterday
I fell apart in your arms for the last time
And I felt free to do what I want
Because of the things you told me
Because of the things you told me, you told me
I felt free
I felt free
I will learn to live again, for now I'm breaking
All the things I couldn't mend without escaping
I will learn to love again
I will learn to love
I will learn
I fell apart in your arms for the last time
And I felt free to do what I want
Because of the things you told me
I felt free
I felt free
Because of the things you told me, you told me
Because of the things you told me, you told me
Friday, Friday [several times throughout the song]
Your head, come on, is dead and gone
It might as well be said so long
It's suds and soda, a brain decoder
And can I wait for my decoder
Get off, get up, you son of pop
The light below is bright on top
It's suds and soda, a smile decoder
And can I get, yeah, what I ordered?
And there's always something in the air
Sometimes suds and soda mix okay with beer
Can I, can I break your sentiment?
Oh, you're just reminding me
Can't see no person there
Just wanna shout "What the fuck?"
Jimmy ean is halloween
Like kerosene for dee dee scene
It's suds and soda, a brain decoder
And can I skip this thing I ordered?
Get off, get up, you son of pop
The light below is bright on top
It's suds and soda, a vibe decoder
And can I get, yeah, what I ordered?
There's always something in the air
Sometimes suds and soda mix okay with beer
Can I, can I break your sentiment?
Oh, you're just reminding me
Can't see no person there
Just wanna shout "What the fuck?"
There's always something in the air
Your face, come on, is dead and gone
You might as well be said so long
It's suds and soda, a brain decoder
And can I wait for my devoter?
Get off, get up, you son of pop
The light below is bright on top
It's suds and soda, a smile, decoder
And can I skip, yeah, what I ordered?
And can I break your sentiment?
So can I break your sentiment?
So can I break your sentiment?
In tired paths of light
You circle me and try to pin me down
And all the forward thoughts
Of emptiness are moving to the sound
On such a perfect night
The moonlight lingers softly in the air,
And to the moon's delight,
It shimmers slightly dancing in your hair.
And so when you're down
I'll lift you up I'll be the one
Who's always sure of where you are
And all the things you need to know,
And when you're tired and think the moon
Forgot to shine on you you'll see,
Just wait for me to show you.
The pockets in the air
That float and turn and hold the flecks of light,
The sound of happiness
Will show in motions rendered by the night
And dreams of splintered sounds
Which played before you silent as a thought,
And you'll remember these
Are better than the reasons you had lost.
And so when you're down
I'll lift you up I'll be the one
Who's always sure of where you are
And all the things you need to know,
And when you're tired and think the moon
Forgot to shine on you you'll see,
Just wait for me to show you.
And so when you're down
I'll lift you up I'll be the one
Who's always sure of where you are
And all the things you need to know,
And when you're tired and think the moon
Forgot to shine on you you'll see,
Just wait for me to show you.
I wanna hold you but you're out of reach
Somewhere searching for your inner peace
I'm just looking for a little squeeze
Face to face and cheek to cheek
It's in your blood but not in mine
What's in your blood is in my mind
Something's broken in the way we smile
It is within us all the time
You're well acquainted with the So- o- o-Ho
And all the "Ello" and "Ow are 'u?"
And we both have to get it on before the summer's gone
We gotta hurry in our worry to get done today
Cause one of us is gonna die young
Let's put our money where our mouth is and get out today
Cause one of us is gonna die young
Ooh, Ooh, One of us is gonna die young
Ooh, Ooh, One of us is gonna die young
That's right
Ah, ah, ah, ah
And don't you take this the wrong way
I'm not looking for a way to replace what love can give
Cause you can't do that!
I'm only saying that where I come from
People find it very fashionable
To burn like a flame
Never get tame Grown-up and lame Yeah! Yeah!
You're looking beat but you say: "no, oh, no, no"
"I'm all messed up and I'm ready to go!
We ain't gonna go it alone no more So let's get on
With the show..."
There's a lot to be said and to be done today
Cause one of us is gonna die young
Before they put us in a coffin I've got things to say
One of us is gonna die young
One of us is gonna die young
Ooh, Ooh, One of us is gonna die young
Ooh, Ooh, One of us is gonna die young
And there's a lot to be said and to be done today
Cause one of us is gonna die young
And you're chim-chim-chammy and
Your're wealthy and you're whammy
'Cause one of us is gonna die young
One of us is gonna die young
One of us is gonna die young
Even after all these years
I miss you when you're not here
I wish you were here my dear Yoko
Even if it's just a day
I miss you when you're away
I wish you were here today dear Yoko
Even if it's just one night
I miss you and it don't feel right
I wish you were here tonight dear Yoko
Even if it's just one hour
I wilt just like a fading flower
Ain't nothing in the world like our love dear Yoko
Oh Yoko
I'll never, ever, ever, ever, ever gonna let you go
Oh Yoko
I'll never, ever, ever, ever, ever gonna let you go
Even when I'm miles at sea
And nowhere is the place to be
Your spirit's watching over me dear Yoko
Even when I watch T.V.
There's a hole where you're supposed to be
There's nobody lying next to me dear Yoko
Oh Yoko
I'll never, ever, ever, ever, ever gonna let you go
Oh Yoko
I'll never, ever, ever, ever, ever gonna let you go
Even after all this time
I miss you like the sun don't shine
Without I'm a one track mind dear Yoko
After all is really said and done
The two of us are really one
The goddess really smiled upon our love dear Yoko
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart, now?
Why would you wanna make the very first scar?
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
Maybe I should've seen the signs
Should've read the writing on the wall
And realised by the distance in your eyes
That I would be the one to fall
No matter what you say
I still can't believe
That you would walk away
It don't make sense to me, but:
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart, now?
Why would you wanna make the very first scar?
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
It's not unbroken anymore
How do I get it back the way it was before?
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart, now?
Why would you wanna make the very first scar?
Why would you wanna break, would you wanna break a:
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart, now?
Why would you wanna make the very first scar?
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
She seemed like an alright girl
And I was thinking just one night wont hurt
And I remember saying to her
I don't want to get much older.
So Long
So Long 
So Long
Always seem to be on the run
We haven't spoken in so long
We can't get past the how are you
We're not talking like we used to
So Long
So Long 
So Long
Always seem to be on the run
We haven't spoken in so long
We can't get past the how are you

Girl, I say, if only life would lean our way,
Well, you and me, we'd run away to be wherever our adventure awaits,
And time would be a distant memory, nobody could tell us to stay,
Well, I've been dreaming ever since I've seen your heaven when you came my way.
I heard your heart say love, love, love
I heard your heart say love, love, love
I heard your heart say love, love, love
I heard your heart say love, love, love
Oh, it's seems awfully far for us to find it all,
Oh, all this years will wash away and we'll be claimed but we'll have nothing more,
Well I can't say there'll come another day where money and time will fall,
And on our hands, our wrinkles understand we never really wanted more.
I heard your heart say love, love, love
I heard your heart say love, love, love
I heard your heart say love, love, love
I heard your heart say love, love, love
And all the life about to go is in my mind,
Cause all the loudest voices in the world whenever I...
I heard your heart say love, love, love
I heard your heart say love, love, love
I heard your heart say love, love, love
I heard your heart say love, love, love
Wo-oh-oah, love, love, love
Wo-oh-oah, love, love, love
Wo-oh-oah, love, love, love
Am I dimmer every day?
Am I just a little glimmer
Like a tiny bobbing head
Of an ocean swimmer?
Olly olly oxen free
Can you see me?
Do I slowly get erased
As I slowly eat my dinner?
Though my stomach might agree
I'm hardly getting thinner
Olly olly oxen free
Can you see me?
I would choose the darkest horse
That's the horse I'd ride
The stables would be shadowy
And we'd start the race behind
They'd take their feet
And toss their hats
And yell out in surprise
You wouldn't need binoculars
You'd see it with your own two eyes
Am I dimmer every day?
Am I shrinking, am I shrinking?
Can you recognize my thoughts?
Do you care what I am thinking?
Olly olly oxen free
Can you see me?
You see me now
But it takes a lot of squinting
And there isn't any shade
And the sun is unrelenting
Olly olly oxen free
Can you see me?
I would choose the darkest horse
That's the horse I'd ride
The stables would be shadowy
And we'd start the race behind
They'd take their feet
And toss their hats
And yell out in surprise
You wouldn't need binoculars
You'd see it with your own two eyes
Louie
I just got a warning and I know and I know
Louie
I know I'm always drunk as drunk as can be
But I wonder, Louie, have you got room for me
I just wonder Louie, have you got room for me
Louie
I just got a warning and I know and I know
Louie
I know I'm always drunk as drunk as can be
But I wonder, Louie, have you got room for me
I just wonder Louie, have you got room for me
Louie
I just got a warning and I know and I know
Louie
They gonna throw me out when the morning comes
And I wonder Louie - have you got room for me
I just wonder Louie - have you got room for me
Oh, nobody know
Why some are born
With empty holes
Like twisted souls
Louie
I just got a warning and I know and I know
Louie
I know I'm always drunk as drunk as can be
But I wonder, Louie, have you got room for me
I just wonder Louie, have you got room for me Louie
Louie
I just got a warning and I know and I know
Louie
I know I'm always drunk as drunk can be
But I wonder, Louie, have you got room for me
I just wonder Louie, have you got room for me Louie
I used to change my accent, change my stance
My phone number, the way I dance
Some people change lovers like they change their sheets
But I won't change you honey, you're for keeps
I used to think I had to change the way I am
To feel better, to get a man
But once I stopped trying I fell for you
You fell for me so I'll stay the same for you
Oh yeah I know that I'm not perfect baby
Oh yeah it's no reason to go crazy
Oh yeah boy you can always count on me
For better or for worse I will always put you first
Now that I have found you
You've changed my life
'Cause you're the one who showed me
I have everything right
We're never gonna differ 'cause we know it's true
So don't change me and I won't change you
I used to change my style like I changed my mind
I tried to change a tire but I'm not that way inclined
Tried to change my figure my diet too
I'll still change my underwear if that's okay with you
Oh yeah the world can sometimes make you feel bad
Oh yeah but don't forget the things you have
Oh yeah boy you can always count on me
In sickness and in health baby always be yourself
I put that record on just to make a sound
The rhythm hit, it got my movement off the ground
Soundtrack of what I want to be
If I want to change the world, it's gotta start with me
I put the needle on the record
I put the needle on the record and play that song again
I put the needle on the record
I put the needle on the record and play that song again
And in the end what have we learned?
Are we just faces in the crowd?
I died and was reborn again today
Hold fast to myself, make these good feelings stay
We laughed, we cried
The music shaped our lives
So tell me why our movement's out of time?
Are we so out of line?
I put the needle on the record
I put the needle on the record and play that song again
I put the needle on the record
I put the needle on the record and play that song again
A movement with no leaders
We stand tonight, hearts in our hands
La da da da, la da da da, da da da
Carousels make laps each night 
Like drunks we spin until we're sick 
Creepy clowns from one-horse towns 
Can make their livings on a trick 
Night covers all our tracks 
To break some fragile backs 
So we tell some lies 
And then we hide from light 
One night I fell asleep 
I woke up on that sunny street 
At first I thought I couldn't, but now I see 
That the shadows kept me hidden 
From the light that calls my name 
All the creatures stirred above me 
Now I'm crawling towards the sun 
Candy lips that taste too sweet 
Were sour in the summer heat 
As the night fell, I heard church bells 
Say it's time to leave 
Out on the town we went 
To carry out missions 
Neither you or I would ever know sunlight 
One night I fell asleep
I woke up on that sunny street 
At first I thought I couldn't, but now I see 
That the shadows kept me hidden 
From the light that calls my name 
All the creatures stirred above me 
Now I'm crawling towards the sun 
In the night light, we still shine bright
In the night light, we still shine bright
In the night light, we still shine bright
In the night light, we still shine bright
One night I fell asleep 
I woke up on that sunny street 
At first I thought I couldn't, but now I see 
That the shadows kept me hidden 
From the light that calls my name 
All the creatures stirred above me 
Now I'm crawling towards the sun
This wasn't supposed to happen
I was happy by myself
Accidentally you seduced me 
I'm in love again 
I lie in my bed, totally still
My eyes wide open, I'm in rapture
I don't believe this, I'm in love again
This wasn't supposed to happen
I've been hit with your charm
How could you do this to me?
I'm in love again
I lie in my bed, totally still
My eyes wide open, I'm in rapture
I don't believe this, I'm in love again
This wasn't supposed to happen
This wasn't supposed to happen
Eg og hann, ég og hann...
A small story which never happened
I said, "Ouch, this really hurts."
That can't be, this has been
Practiced for millions of years
Therefore we are
Yes, but I, I'm a boy
A small story which always happens
I said, "Ouch, this really hurts."
This could well be but this has
Been practiced for millions of years
Therefore we are
Yes, but, you're a girl
I lie in my bed, totally still
My eyes wide open, I'm in rapture
I don't believe this, I'm in love again
This wasn't supposed to happen
I lie in my bed, totally still
My eyes wide open, I'm in rapture
I'm in rapture
(You've put a seed inside me)
Oh, and while you're away (seed)
It's growing silently (to be a life)
Starts in my stomach
Embraces my insides (inside)
And about to reach my heart
This wasn't supposed to happen
This wasn't supposed to happen
Eg og hann, ég og hann...
This really hurts
I hid myself from failure and fear
O my dear you're a threat to the bad in us all
They tell themselves that each word from your lips
Or the grace in your eyes overcomes any fall
Over the twilight you're listening for me
Darling, go to sleep
Cradled by moonlight, I'm dreaming we'll be
Loved so deep
Floating and fighting, like a kite on a string
Till you cut through my tether and changed everything
From the sky you looked small, but I loved you the same
So I darted back quickly to spell out your name
And when they say that I'm just a terrible kite
You'll tell them you're proud of my marvelous flight
Don't hide yourself inside till I'm old
O my dear you're a threat to the bad we all see
I'm beside myself for the touch of your lips
Or the grace of your eyes that can see good in me
Over the twilight you're listening for me
Darling, go to sleep
Cradled by moonlight, I'm dreaming we'll be
Loved so deep
Floating and fighting, like a kite on a string
Till you cut through my tether and changed everything
From the sky you looked small, but I loved you the same
So I darted back quickly to spell out your name
And when they say that I'm just a terrible kite
You'll tell them you're proud of my marvelous flight
When will you ever recognise?
You see, you push it in the corners
Keep it in the background
Work it out
Rather stick it in the background
Dead weight to carry around
Nothing to believe in
Keep it in the background
Raise a doubt
They try to pull the wool over our eyes And tell us everything's all right
Why don't you keep it in the background?
You've got me to worry about tonight
Why don't you keep it in the corners?
Why don't you see it's beaming in the sunshine?
I guess you might as well try
Guess you might as well try
Oh no, I say, you got it wrong
Oh no, I say, you got it wrong
Oh no, I say, you got it wrong
I say
There's no more keep it in the background
Dead weight to carry around
Nothing to believe in
I tell you something
You've got the wrong idea
You've got the wrong idea
What would you say was the matter
When we all laughed at each other
When we all cried together
I was right
If we could all say we're sorry
Give up all awkward tomorrows
Finding nothing more to argue
I was right
Anywhere you looked was
Anywhere you looked was
Anywhere you looked was
Anywhere you looked was
Anywhere you looked was
Anywhere you looked was right 
Anything you said to me was lost in ether overseas
And timing changes everything when I was right
We discovered one another stumbling through another summer
Worrying we start to wonder, what was right
Anywhere your luck was
Anywhere your luck was
Anywhere your luck was
Anywhere your luck was
Anywhere your luck was
Anywhere your luck was right 
Anywhere you wanted to be someone else was talking to me
Wave lengths pull magnetically and I was right
And we knew when we tried harder there would be another offer
Knowing, as we're falling under, what was right
Anyone you've loved once
Anyone you've loved once
Anyone you've loved once
Anyone you've loved once
Anyone you've loved once
Anyone you've loved once was right
Anyone you've loved once
Anyone you've loved once
Anyone you've loved once
Anyone you've loved once
Anyone you've loved once
Anyone you've loved once was right
Friends sing together, la la la la
Friends do things together, la la la la
Friends laugh together, Ha Ha Ha Ha
Friends make graphs together, la la la la
Friends help you when you're in danger
Friends are people who are not strangers
Friends help you shift into a new place
Tell you if you've got food on you're face
Friends are the ones, on who you can depend
He's my friend, He's not my friend
Friends are the ones who are there at the end
He's my friend, They're not my friends
If you trip over I'll catch you're fall
If you break my dick, I won't break you're balls
If you get drunk and vomit on me
I'll make sure you get home safely
If you cross the road and a drunk struck you
And scrape you up and reconstruct you
I'll cheer you up if you're depressed
If you get murdered I'll avenge you're death
Friends walk together, la la la la
Pop and lock together, ZZt brrt zzt brrt
Me and him together, la la la la
Me and Jim forever...
Friends go jogging at the track
Friends borrow money, never pay It back
Friends do not let friends do crack
Friends go out and grab a snack
Friends drink beer in the sun
Unlike girlfriends they don't mind if you have more than one
Friends tell you when your fly's undone

My dad is so cool
He is the coolest dad in dad school
He does not break any dad rules
He would pick you up if I asked him to
One two three four give me more
'Cause I think we're going down
What you need it for?
Pass the wealth around
We're going right back to the borderline
Now you should save yourself
I'm on my own
No use to no one else
'Cause I--every time I think I'm fine
You keep on dreaming up
A hundred different ways to cause hysteria
Am I insane, am I blind?
I just can't seem to trust
Too many regulations coming back at you
We're running out
Of money
Of love
Of luck
We're running out
Of language
Of fame
Of bread
We're running out
Something tells me that I'm fine
But when I get enough
Another one--wouldn't be too much
And still I chew it up and spit it out
It's too big to swallow
Got enough for everyone
So here we go
Ooh, let's see how far that we have run
Before this gig is over
I hear the warning sign
On everybody's stereo
Do you love, what you like
What would you do for more?
You kept on dancing underneath the burning floor
We're running out
Of money
Of each other
Of confidence
We're running out
Of drugs
Of patience
Of air
We're running out
We're running out
Of money
Of love
Of luck
We're running out
Of fame
Of language
Of bread
We're running out
Of money
Of each other
Of confidence
We're running out
Of dugs
Of patience
Of air
We're running out

(Woo! Peter you did do well!)
(Oh no I was just cleaning my throat)
(How do you do? Welcome to the human race... You're a mess.)
I was born on the day the music died
In essence and in excellence
You can get it any time so yes but unless
You can ride downtown and stay warm by the fire
(...Good time to make an annoucnement)
(Yaaa?)
(This June... Erica and myself are gonna have a little baby)
(*Laughter*)
(You're father pointed out that you said copy)
I was born on the day the music died
In essence and in excellence
You can get it any time so yes but unless
You can ride downtown and stay warm by the fire
I know where to go but I don't know where to stand
Moving in boredom but I'm sitting around
You can hop on down and stay warm by the fire
I was born on the day the music died
For the longest time
Walking on the golden line
My body's never been so light
Must have been the first time
For the longest time
Walking on the golden line
My body's never been so light
Must have been the first time
For the longest time
Walking on the golden line
My body's never been so light
Must have been the first time

Tell everybody I'm on my way
New friends and new places to see
With blue skies ahead
Yes I'm on my way
And there's nowhere else that I'd rather be
Tell everybody I'm on my way
And I'm lovin' every step I take
With the sun beating down
Yes I'm on my way
And I can't keep this smile off my face
Cause there's nothing like seeing each other again
No matter what the distance between
And the stories that we tell will make you smile
Oh it really lifts my heart
So tell them all I'm on my way
New friends and new places to see
And to sleep under the stars
Who could ask for more
With the moon keeping watch over me
Not the snow, not the rain can change my mind
The sun will come out wait and see
And the feeling of the wind in your face can lift your heart
No there's no where I would rather be
'Cause I'm on my way now
Well and truly
I'm on my way now
I'm on my way now
I'm on my way now
I'm on my way now
Tell everybody I'm on my way
And I just can't wait to be there
With the blue skies ahead
Yes I'm on my way
And nothing but good times to share
So tell everybody I'm on my way
And I just can't wait to be home
With the sun beating down
Yes I'm on my way
And nothing but good times to show
I'm on my way
Yes, I'm on my way
I had a golden ring
And I kept it with golden things
In the bank of a million dreams
That was bursting at all the seams
I had a golden ring
It was such an important thing
That I kept it beneath my bed
And I carried it in my head
I had a golden dream
And the way it came down to me
Was through captains of alchemy
Who came up through a steely sea
And I dreamt through the rainy night
And I managed to sleep alright
And my body became so light
That I managed to give it flight
'Cause I know gold is just a trick of light
And lead is light as a feather
So leave me where the kids are alright
And we will all go down together
I had a golden dream
And they took it away from me
And they pulled it out of my head
And they showed me that it was lead
But I know gold is just a trick of light
And lead is light as a feather
So leave me where the kids are alright
And we will all go down together
And that's the way
It's gonna be
And there's water in wine
And there's nickel in dimes
And they knew all the time
But gold is just a trick of light
And lead is light as a feather
So leave me where the kids are alright
And we will all go down together
Gold is just a trick of light
And lead is light as a feather
So leave me where the kids are alright
And we will all go down together
And that's the way
It's gonna be
That's the way
It's gonna be

I feel the need to go
And distance is the goal
If memory serves me right
I've done this before
I used to close the door when everything went wrong
You don't need to call I ignore everyone
Nothing against you but you dragged me for too long
Too long
This is me in my sorrow
This is me at eighteen
This is me at my greatest
All my friends begin to weep
Well there's a house on the block that's empty now that Dominique's gone
Well there's a house on the block that's empty now that Dominique's gone
Now her dogs are alone and there's no one to watch her TV
Dear Dominique I wrote to tell you you're delightful
Still I know want a strangle or a mouth full
Of gasoline or to be tied up and stoned
I wrote to tell you that I hope you're feeling better
Self addressed stamped envelope stuffed with your own death letter
Written in blood and in your own handwriting
There's a house on the block that's empty now that Dominique's gone
Well there's a house on the block that's empty now that Dominique's gone
Well there's a house on the block that's empty now that Dominique's gone
Now her dogs are alone and there's no one to watch her TV
Well 13524 Park and East Boulevard
Your last stroll down the block was in the trunk of a car
I must admit that we never thought you'd go this far
Dear Dominique well I hope you're feeling better
You look so cute writing out your own death letter
Well now there's no one to watch your TV
Well there's a house on the block that's empty now that Dominique's gone
Dear Dominique you have a bold imagination
The countless ways you thought to die no hesitation
Fantasize long enough, you know it just might come true
Well there's a house on the block that's empty now that Dominique's gone
Well there's a house on the block that's empty now that Dominique's gone
Well there's a house on the block that's empty now that Dominique's gone
Well there's a house on the block that's empty now that Dominique's gone
Well there's a house on the block that's empty now that Dominique's gone
Well there's a house on the block that's empty now that Dominique's gone
Well there's a house on the block that's empty now that Dominique's gone

He started the day with a mood and a shake, he was finally arranged
Then someone said with a cold hearted chest, "You're a mess"
He woke up at nights, he thought he was twice, he was moving away
Cause everyone thinks that it goes away with age
Hold me now, don't start shaking
You keep me safe
Don't ever think you're the only one
When times are tough in your new age
Hold me now, don't start shaking
You keep me safe
Don't ever think you're the only one
When times are tough in your new age
You better be cool at the time
He's walking along with a soul in his lungs
You stare at him long, you can find a new song
Cause everyone thinks they've got a new phrase
But you're still miles away
You're still miles away
I said, "You're still miles away"
Hold me now, don't start shaking
You keep me safe
Don't ever think you're the only one
When times are tough in your new age
Hold me now, don't start shaking
You keep me safe
Don't ever think you're the only one
When times are tough in your new age
Hold me now, don't start shaking
You keep me safe
Don't ever think you're the only one
When times are tough in your new age
Hold me now, don't start shaking
You keep me safe
Don't ever think you're the only one
When times are tough in your new age
Well I shouldn't sleep all day
And waste the afternoon
'Cause I know if I'm up all night
You'll be going to bed soon
So wipe the sleep from your eyes
And I'll wipe them out of mine, too
And if we try to hold on
Then I'll try to hold on to you
Well I shouldn't sleep all day
But it's half past noon
'Cause I know we're taking a break
And I know you're leaving me soon
So if you try to be nice
Then I'll try to be nice to you
And if you try to hold on
Then I'll try to hold on to you
So wipe the sleep from your eyes
And I'll wipe them out of mine, too
So if you try to be nice
Then I'll try to be nice to you
And I shouldn't sleep all day
And waste the time with you
'Cause I know we're taking a break
And I know we both need room
So wipe the sleep from your eyes
And I'll wipe them out of mine, too
And if you try to hold on
Then I'll try to hold on to you
It's hard to let the miles pass me by
Yellow lines they blend together in my eyes
And when the seasons change again then I will too
But I just wanna be closer to you
And I'm staring out at endless rows of green
There are miles of hay like I've never seen
But just when you think you've had enough and your dreams come true
I just wanna be closer to you
Oh my mind wanders through all that I've been hiding from
I tried not to let you down
Now I wonder if I've been doing something wrong
Help me get my feet back on the ground
Tomorrow I'll be lying under you
With a heart of gold and arms to fall into
I know that there might come a day my life is through
But I just wanna be closer to you
Oh my mind wanders through all that I've been hiding from
I tried not to let you down
Now I wonder if I've been doing something wrong
Help me get my feet back on the ground
Someday we might learn to tell the truth
We might even find the fountains of our youth
And we all needed something real we all need proof
But I just wanna be closer to you
I only wanna be closer to you
I'm gonna pack up my troubles in my old kit-bag, I'm gonna run a mile from here
'Cause the ASBO generation make this a terror nation full of loathing and fear
All the bleary-eyed boys getting high on the low street
While the girls lift clothes down the high street and they say,
"Yeah I know, I know it's wrong but I can't be bothered to pay,
I got the money but I need it for my dealer today."
And her friends are all the same and they know it's not right
But they were promised more from this life
And they will steal and they will fight
Because there's nothing for the kids to do today
And they will haunt the streets at night
Because there's nothing for the kids to do today
Shaun has an ASBO, he's only fourteen, he's tired and he's bored with the local police
"They're pricks," he says, "I didn't get a second chance,
They didn't ask why I did it"
The pigs ...
The paedophiles playing his neck of the woods,
He's got no safety numbers, his ASBO won't allow him to be hanging around in gangs
What is he to do? He's been kicked out of school
What a way to fix a fool, we are failing our youth
Parents and governors can you handle the truth?
And they will steal and they will fight
Because there's nothing for the kids to do today
And they will haunt the streets at night
Because there's nothing for the kids to do today
There's nothing for the kids to do
Who's to blame? The mainstream media?
Our rulers and idols get greedier and seedier
They're an embarrassment, they should be shamed
For misguiding our youth, they're the ones to blame
They sit back and watch the evil grow from the youth club ruins where the kids used to go
Take parts of Salford in Manchester, dying on its feet
While the players at United get a hundred grand a week
The kids love them anyway, it don't make sense
When you have a go at me for the sake of fifty pence
Especially when some of you so called "poor kids" have got the money for a digital camcorder
And the time to film a girl whilst you spit-roast her
You hang about the park but you don't play football
You trouble me for money 'cause you've got to make a drug call (?)
You've got time, you've got money but you wrap it in a joint 'cause you don't see the point in using your time for making your dreams come true
You're all too busy trying to lose our respect for you
Why're you proud to be rude?
You're just trying to be cool in front of your mates
That's all that really matters when you're living in hate
And they will steal and they will fight
Because there's nothing for the kids to do today
And they will haunt the streets at night
Because there's nothing for the kids to do today
Why do you wanna grow up, why do you wanna grow so fast and throw your youth away?
Don't throw your youth away and don't let me hear you say
That there's nothing for the kids to do today
There's plenty for the kids to do today
There's so much for the kids to do
The night air breathes
But not so easy as before
Did you notice
Did you take the time to listen
To my breath or to my words
When I spoke I explained my feelings
And my reasons for the way I love you
I'm getting to the point
And I feel like I do
Even more now that I'm leaving
Well, I feel just like I do when I'm with you
And she's so sweet and
I'm leaving thinkin'
How I'm barely breathin'
Notice how your every look gives me tingles
And I wonder if your listening to what I'm thinking
We won't fade away
And I feel like
I do even more now that I'm leaving
Well, I feel just like I do when I'm with you
And I feel like I do even more now that
I'm leaving you, I'm leaving you
So what am I to do
My feelings have not fallen away
You're my every thought yeah
Everything will go on it's own way
Everything is ok we can try to make it
Everything will go, it's all right baby
It's all right baby, it's all right baby girl
My feelings have not passed away
You're my every thought here, everything will
Well, she crept back in the house at half past three
Shook her head to see him snoring in his sleep
"If he really loved me," she said
"I wouldn't have to be so mean..."
He's a heap of junk that pours from his top drawer
He sometimes likes to spread it out around the floor
It's evidence of what he was like
He likes to remember when...
Sha la li, sha la li, la la li
The end is growing near
And we're treading water now
And holding back our tears
And the day is rising
We're sinking
Sha la, la la li
In a minute it will all be coming down
And they know it now but no one makes a sound
It's such a shame to ruin this bright
Lazy sunny day...
Sha la li, sha la li, la la li
The end is growing near
And we're treading water now
We're holding back our tears
And the day is rising
We're sinking
Sha la, la la li
My, my... the cruelest lies are often told without a word
My, my... the kindest truths are often spoke but never heard
She said, "You've been pushing me like I was a sore tooth.
You can't respect me 'cause I've done so much for you."
He said, "Well I hate that it's come to this
But baby I was doing fine. How do you think
That I survived the other 25 before you?"
Sha la li, sha la li, la la li
The end is growing near
And we're treading water now
And holding back our tears
And the day is rising
We're sinking...
Sha la, la la li
Merry Christmas baby

Merry Christmas baby

Tonight we're gonna sing with the power of a thousand tongues
Tonight we're gonna blast with the power of a thousand guns
Tonight we're gonna shine with the power of a thousand suns
Because tonight we're singing the songs, busting these rhymes,
Singing these words to everyone
Oh why would I deceive you
I'd never ever try to mislead you
You've got to have eyes in the back of your head
The next man he might try to cheat you
Tonight we're gonna climb the ladder of a thousand rungs
Tonight we're gonna take the breath of a thousand lungs
When you gonna see it doesn't matter if we're the only ones
Because tonight we're singing the songs, busting these rhymes,
Singing these words to everyone
Oh why would you deceive me
Don't do it if you're just trying to please me
The world is made up of so many opinions
The thought of this is never gonna leave me
Tonight we're gonna sing with the power of a thousand tongues
Tonight we're gonna blast with the power of a thousand guns
Tonight we're gonna shine with the power of a thousand suns
Because tonight we're singing these here songs to everyone
To step out of your cradle is like coming down
I just had somebody tell me I was introspective to a fault
I'll be a doozer if I can
But I will contented be right now if we could keep our secret
You could tell me all your secrets
All you ever do is run and hide
You can keep it inside
If you tell me all your secrets
All I have to do is let it ride
I can keep it inside
But if it's as it seems, and I keep having dreams
About the two of us, then it's obvious
You should stop treating me like I was just a child
You should start treating me like I was just the same as you.
To step out of your cradle is like coming down
I just had somebody tell me I was introspective to a fault
I'll be a doozer if I can
But I will contented be right now if we could keep our secret
We could be a little closer
The mystery you're trying to preserve
You don't need in reserve
We should be a little closer
Intimacy has the greater charm
And it would do no harm
To give a little way, oh please stop holding sway
You could even read me your poetry
If you would stop treating me like I was just a child
You should start realising that I'm just as wild as you
Stop treating me like I was just a child
Song and melodies change and change
And sway
But they still stay the same
The songs that we sung when the dark days come
Are the songs that we sung when we chased them away
If I ever found a pot of gold
I'd buy bottles untold of the nectar of the vines
I'm going to die with a twinkle in my eye
'Cause I sung songs spun stories loved laughed and drank wine
Tomorrow is another day
The cats are out to play, to play
That old rusty spaceship wants to sail
Into the milky way again
On a river of red red wine
Run...
(Let's have some)
Fun...
(We'll)
Drink...
(A toast to the)
Sun...
Run...
(Let's have some)
Fun...
(We'll)
Drink...
(A toast to the)
Sun...
In summer the bushfires rage and rage
And rage
On such beautiful days
And we fight them with water that runs through the cracks
Water we're desperately trying to save
So I'll just live on wine and water my vines
And sleep on the wind with the fires right behind
And sing on the beaches and swing through the night
Oh we'll cry 'pass the wine, pass the wine, pass the wine'
Tomorrow is another day
The cats are out to play, to play
That old rusty spaceship wants to sail
Into the milky way again
On a river of red red wine
Run...
(Let's have some)
Fun...
(We'll)
Drink...
(A toast to the)
Sun...
Run...
(Let's have some)
Fun...
(We'll)
Drink...
(A toast to the)
Sun...
Oh what a beautiful day today!
Today's a day to celebrate
Grab your bucket, grab your spade
We're heading down to Half Moon Bay
I saw a plane go into a cloud
I'm drunk, I'm singing, I'm happy and loud
Two o'clock in the arvo, but hey that's allowed
I'm having a good time and of that I am proud
I love making you believe
What you get is what you see
But I'm so fake happy
I feel so fake happy
And I bet everybody here
Is just as insincere
We're all so fake happy
And I know fake happy
I been doing a good job of makin' 'em think
I'm quite alright
Better hope I don't blink
You see, it's easy when I'm stomping on a beat
But no one sees me when I crawl back underneath
Hey, if I smile with my teeth
Bet you believe me
If I smile with my teeth
I think I believe me
Oh please, don't ask me how I've been
Don't make me play pretend
Oh no, oh what's the use?
Oh please, I bet everybody here is fake happy too
And if I go out tonight, dress up my fears
You think I look alright with these mascara tears?
See, I'm gonna draw up my lipstick wider than my mouth
And if the lights are low they'll never see me frown
Hey, if I smile with my teeth
Bet you believe me
If I smile with my teeth
I think I believe me
Oh please, don't ask me how I've been
Don't make me play pretend
Oh no, oh oh, what's the use?
Oh please, I bet everybody here is fake happy too
I know I said that I was doing good and that I'm happy now
Ooh ooh
I shoulda known that when things were going good
That's when I'd get knocked down
Oh please, just don't ask me how I've been
Don't make me play pretend
Oh no, oh no
Oh, what's the use?
Oh please, I bet everybody here is fake happy too
Oh please, I bet everybody here is fake happy too
Carlos
Well, the fall hit me hard 
I was on my back staring at stars 
But it was daylight outside 
So I stared up at those leaves 
And I felt them underneath 
And I watched as Summer turned quiet 
And somehow it made sense
How it all comes to an end only to begin again 
Summer's pile of regrets 
Was only Spring's lost bets 
And if it wasn't Fall outside, it was in
So just button up your coat 
Here it comes, here we go 
Just remember, tomorrow never knows 
And the colors are going to be 
Ones like you've never seen 
So say goodbye to green 
Because here it comes in incredible yellows 
Inevitable orange 
And you can just get on down 
To the feel good hit of the Fall
Seasons come and go 
And the next thing you know 
You're right back where you started 
But a whole lot smarter
All that matters is right now 
So breathe in and breate out 
All that matters is right now 
So come on and get down 
To the feel good hit of the fall 
Well, there's a few things in this world 
Sadder than the end of Summer 
But there's a few things more beautiful than Fall
And I never much liked Winter 
But I guess that's the price you pay 
Because there's a few more things beautiful than Spring 
Changes this Fall are going to last forever
Two lost cousins, 
And one new watch.
A chauffeur-driven dream, 
Told us where to drop. 
All of our feelings, 
They're in the Porsche. 
So no one could avoid, 
So no one could avoid.
Hold on, 
To where you're from.
It's where your heart goes, 
When you're done.
So let's say, 
"I'll come another day." 
And maybe you'll understand, 
I look into your eyes, 
And you don't know who I am.
Did you scream it? 
Honey, from the gal.
My day just got misted, 
And the purple's talking down.
Meetings in the desert, 
We want him to hear about, 
We want him to hear about, 
But I guess it's too late now.
Hold on, 
To where you're from.
It's where your heart goes, 
When you're done.(x4)
First it wasn't easy, 
But seconds coming back.
I've got a third upon my shoulder, 
And look it's on my back.(x4)
Hold on, 
To where you're from.
It's where your heart goes, 
When you're done.(x4)
So let's say, 
"I'll come another day." 
And maybe you'll understand. 
I look into your eyes, 
You don't know who I am.
I'll come another day, 
And maybe you'll understand. 
I look into your eyes, 
You don't know who I am.
Will & Puck:
Oooh...
Somewhere over the rainbow
Way up high
There's a land that I dreamed of
Once in a lullaby 
Oh, somewhere over the rainbow
Skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream
Really do come true
Oh, someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me
Where troubles melt like lemon drops
High above the chimney tops, that's where you'll find me
Oh, somewhere over the rainbow
Bluebirds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why, then, oh why, can't I...?
One day my prayers are gonna be answered
So long I been hungry for something else
Where there's a will, there's a way
I work hard cause at the end of the day
The lord helps those that help themselves
Hey, hey I keep my head down but I keep on swingin'
Hey I keep my head down but I keep on swingin'
Hey I keep my head down but I keep on swingin'
Hey I keep my head down but I keep on swingin'
Right now somebody's counting my money
So much they can't see the top of the stack
Where there's a will, there's away
My moneys gonna find my hand one day and
When it does, I ain't looking back
Hey, hey I keep my head down but I keep on swingin'
Hey I keep my head down but I keep on swingin'
Hey I keep my head down but I keep on swingin'
Hey I keep my head down but I keep on swingin'
Aurélies Akzent ist ohne Frage sehr charmant
Auch wenn sie schweigt, wird sie als wunderbar erkannt
Sie braucht mit Reizen nicht zu geizen
Denn ihr Haar ist Meer und Weizen
Noch mit Glatze fräß' ihr jeder aus der Hand
Doch Aurélie kapiert das nie
Jeden Abend fragt sie sich
Wann nur verliebt sich wer in mich
Aurélie, so klappt das nie
Du erwartest viel zu viel
Die Deutschen flirten sehr subtil
Aurélie, so klappt das nie
Du erwartest viel zu viel
Die Deutschen flirten sehr subtil
Aurélie, die Männer mögen dich hier sehr
Schau, auf der Straße schaut dir jeder hinterher
Doch du merkst nichts, weil sie nicht pfeifen
Und, pfeifst du selbst, die Flucht ergreifen
Du musst wissen, hier ist weniger oft mehr
Ach, Aurélie, in Deutschland braucht die Liebe Zeit
Hier ist man nach Tagen erst zum ersten Schritt bereit
Die nächsten Wochen wird gesprochen
Sich aufs Gründlichste berochen
Und erst dann trifft man sich irgendwo zu zweit
Aurélie, so klappt das nie
Du erwartest viel zu viel
Die Deutschen flirten sehr subtil
Aurélie, so einfach ist das eben nicht
Hier haben andere Worte ein ganz anderes Gewicht
All die Jungs zu deinen Füßen wollen dich küssen, auch die Süßen
Aber du merkst das nicht
Weil er dabei von Fußball spricht
Ach, Aurélie, du sagst, ich solle dir erklären
Wie in aller Welt sich die Deutschen dann vermehren
Wenn die Blumen und die Bienen in Berlin nichts tun als grienen
Und sich 'nen Teufel um die Bestäubungsfrage scheren
Aurélie, so klappt das nie
Du erwartest viel zu viel
Die Deutschen flirten sehr subtil
I remember watchin'
All the once upon a times
Remember thinkin'
Who's content and who's for rent
And you said don't you want to be like that man!?
Oh No--No--No!
But then he cracks that smile
And that don't look so bad to me...
Happy, I'm happy
But that ain't good enough for you
Happy, I'm happy
I remember thinkin'
How they thought that we should be
Remember feelin'
That might be you but that ain't me
And you said don't you want to be like that man!?
Oh No--No--No!
But then he cracks a smile
And that don't look so bad to me...
The suns that rise
A young girl's sighs
A baby cries
An old man's eyes
I remember watchin'
All the once upon a times
Remember thinkin'
Who's content and who's for rent
And you said don't you want to be like that man!?
Oh No--No--No!
Then he cracks that smile
And that don't look so bad to me...
My head's been lying dormant like a sleepy little mouse
What I have inside me it's enough to fill a house
Don't get maudlin on me 'cause I'm not fit for it
I'd make you another offer will it do the trick
All my days inactive will be justified
Awaken from a slumber to a rollercoaster ride
Don't get wise to everyone and everything
Leave a little room for some naiveté
To say that we will never part
And you will always have my heart
Is something that I can't deny
And you must never ever try
To go and lead a separate life
It's something I will never do without you
To say that we will never part
And you will always have my heart
Is something that I can't deny
And you must never ever try
To go end lead a separate life
Is something I will never do without you
Don't get wise to everyone and everything
Just leave a little room for some naiveté
Swimming in a pool of all clear
Swimming in a pool of all clear, of all clear
Swimming in a pool of all clear, of all clear
(I was fine before I met you)
I was broken but fine
I was lost and uncertain
But my heart was still mine
I was free before I met you
I was broken but free
All alone in the clear view
But now you are all I see
Hey, wait a minute
No, you can't do this to me
Hey, wait a minute
No, that's not fair
Hey, wait a minute
You're running back to me
I really like you, but I'm so scared
Why'd you have to go and make me like you?
Yeah this is a feeling I'm not used to
Why'd you have to go and make me like you?
I'm so mad at you cause now you got me missing you
Cause now you got me missing you
Something I could get used to
I could get used to this
It's getting harder to leave it
Your lips on my lips
Oh, I can't believe it
How good it could be
Didn't wanna believe it, but now you are all I see
Hey, wait a minute
No, you can't do this to me
Hey, wait a minute
No, that's not fair
Hey, wait a minute
You're running back to me
I really like you, but I'm so scared
Why'd you have to go and make me like you?
Yeah this is a feeling I'm not used to
Why'd you have to go and make me like you?
I'm so mad at you cause now you got me missing you
'Cause now you got me missing you
Why'd you have to go and make me like you?
Yeah this is a feeling I'm not used to
Why'd you have to go and make me like you?
I'm so mad at you cause now you got me missing you
'Cause now you got me missing you
Oh God, thank God I found you
Oh God, cause now you got me missing you
Oh God, thank I found you
I'm so mad at you cause now you got me missing you
Thank God
Thank God that I found you, oh
Now you got me missing you
Now you got me missing you
Why'd you have to go and make me like you?
Yeah this is a feeling I'm not used to
Why'd you have to go and make me like you?
I'm so mad at you cause now you got me missing you
Cause now you got me missing you
Oh God, thank God I found you
Oh God, cause now you got me missing you
Oh God, thank I found you
(I'm so mad at you cause now you got me missing you)
Ever ever after...
Storybook endings, fairy tales coming true 
Deep down inside we wanna believe they still do 
And a secret is taught
It's our favorite part of the story 
Let's just admit we all want to make it too 
Ever ever after 
If we just don't get it our own way 
Ever ever after 
It may only be a wish away 
Start a new fashion, wear your heart on your sleeve 
Sometimes you reach what's realest by making believe 
Unafraid, unashamed 
There is joy to be claimed in this world 
You even might wind up being glad to be you 
Ever ever after 
Though the world will tell you it's not smart 
Ever ever after 
The world can be yours if you let your heart 
Believe in ever after 
No wonder your heart feels it's flying, your head feels it's spinning 
Each happy ending's a brand new beginning 
Let yourself be enchanted, you just might break through 
To ever ever after 
Forever could even start today 
Ever ever after 
Maybe it's just one wish away 
Your ever ever after, yeah
Ever, ever ever after
I've been dreaming of a true love's kiss... 
Ohhh, for ever ever after
You've gotta hold, hold open my eyelids
If you're gonna shake, shake, shake till the morning
I'm gonna put, put things in perspective
And it's gonna take, take, take my precious time
All we need is a reason
For us to dance, dance, dance till the break of dawn
All I need is a hook now
For us to shout, shout, shout these words out
'Cause we're all, all, all
We're all...
You know we're all a part of the world, of course
If you know it sing out
Yeah, sing it out
I'm gonna snap back into formation
And get to work, work, work till the job gets done
Everyone's getting ready
'Cause they've been wait, wait, waiting for Friday night
All we need is a chance now
For, for us to get, get down in the after hours
All you need is a voice now
For us to shout, shout, shout these words out
'Cause we're all, all, all
We're all...
You know we're all a part of the world, of course
If you know it sing out
Yeah, sing it out
'Cause we're all a part
You know we're all a part of the world, of course
If you know it sing out
Yeah, sing it out
Work, work, work
Should, should, should
Good, good, good
I'm gonna keep it up, keep it up
Gonna keep it up, keep it up
Work, work, work if you
Should, should, should and you're
Good, good, good, all right now
Keep it up, keep it up, keep it
'Cause we're all, we're part
You know we're all a part of the world, of course
If you know it sing it out
Yeah, sing it 'cause we're all, all, all
We're all
You know we're all a part of the world, of course
And if you're feeling me sing it out
Yeah, sing it 'cause we're all
We're part
You know we're all a part of the world, of course
If you know it sing it out
Yeah, sing it out

Hello buddies
Empty arms
And half a soul to go
And all I wanted
Was you here next to me
A little sunshine sympathy
Now everybody knows
That I been hanging down so low
'Cause now I feel it all
Soon I'll be feeling out so cold
Wondering will you call?
And now I'm feeling high
Soon I'll be feeling left for dead
Sometimes someone's saying "yes"
Changes what you meant
And all I wanted
Was just to hold you close
A little sunshine
Just to butter my toast
And your love next to mine
I have to let you know
That we were meant to be just right
Heaven sent, not sympathized
But everybody's lied
And now I'm feeling high
Now I'm feeling left so dead
Kicking up the dust in bed
Wondering, I guess
Sunshine
Sunshine (it's all I wanted)
Sunshine
And some tea
And your love (it's all I wanted)
Your love (it's all I wanted)
Your love
Next to mine
I have to let you know
I had to let you go
So I could see my life
Fade from your eyes
And to my surprise
That's what I wanted
That's all I wanted
That's what I wanted
Me and you
Sunshine (it's all I wanted)
Sunshine (it's all I wanted)
Sunshine
And some tea
That's all I wanted
That's all I wanted
That's all I wanted
That's all I wanted
Ven confía en mi
No hay porque dejar
Para hacer después
Lo que quieras ya
Es el instinto
Deja que te sacuda
El cielo es de los que creen
Y no de los que dudan
Soy un volcán,
En erupción
Entra en razón
Que suba el telón
Cámera, acción
CORO
Esperar
Es un mar
Que aún no sé
Navegar
No te quedes
Años luz
Ya estoy decidida
Y quiero saber si lo estás tú
Ven confía en mi
No hay margen de error
Deja que en mi piel
Brille tu sudor
¿Qué es lo que esperas?
Ya casi es madrugada
Mi cremallera
No está electrificada
No me tengas más consideración
Entra en razón
Que suba el telón
Cámera, acción
CORO
Esperar
Es un mar
Que aún no sé
Navegar
No te quedes
Años luz
Ya estoy decidida
Y quiero saber si lo estás tú
Subiré por tu espalda la seda
Como en el muro la enredadera
Cuando se besen la luna y la arena
Nadie nos mira esta noche es nuestra
No habrá testigos no habrá evidencia
Somos solamente yo y tu conciencia
¿Qué es lo que esperas?
¿Qué es lo que esperas?
No me tengas mas consideración
Entra en razón
Que suba el telón
Cámera, acción
CORO
Esperar
Es un mar
Que aún no sé
Navegar
No te quedes
Años luz
Ya estoy decidida
Y quiero saber si lo estás
Esperar
Es un mar
Que aún no sé
Navegar
No te quedes
Años luz
Ya estoy decidida
Y quiero saber si lo estás tú
Tú
Every time I look at you
You always look so beautiful
Driving on the road again the Chevy's packed
And it is dusk
And I will take some photographs
So I can dream of you
Can't say I've felt such twisting
In my heart this way
We pitch a tent and have one sleeping bag
To stay awake
The fire's burning, softly singing songs
So close to you
Do you believe in love at first sight?
I think you do, we're lying naked under the covers
Those are the best days of my life
Can't take away those times we stayed up and we talked all night
Chain smoking cigarettes and three bottles of red wine
Falling asleep together holding your body, close to mine
Oh, And in the morning your eyes open so innocent
The sun is blazing we are sweating you look lovely
Nothing else matters anymore 'cause you're in my arms again
Do you believe in love at first sight?
I think you do, we're lying naked under the covers
Those are the best days of my
Those are the best days of my
Those are the best days of my life
Oh, I never want to be without you
So, just stay with me, I will love you endlessly
Oh, darlin' darlin' Oh... darlin', darlin'
Do you believe in love at first sight?
I think you do, we're lying naked under the covers
Those are the best days of my life
Do you believe in love at first sight?
I think you do, we're lying naked under the covers
Those are the best days of my
Those are the best days of my
Those are the best days of my life
Keep your head up
The colors are beautiful
When they say give up
Turn up your radio
All the sentimental memories you own
When they say grow up
It's just like a funeral
Keep your head up
The colors are beautiful
Keep your head up
It's all right in front of you
When they say wake up
You're braking ridicule
When all the sentimental memories you own 
Keep you trapped inside your room there all alone
And it feels like
It feels like you're lost
And it feels like
It feels like you're lost
Is there some way you can be out on your own?
Trust yourself
Don't waste another day at all
On your own
Keep your head up
The colors are beautiful
And it feels like
It feels like you're lost
And it feels like
It feels like you're lost
Is there some way you can be out on your own?
Trust yourself
Don't waste another day at all
Watch this fade away
Everything fades away
Keep your head up
The colors are beautiful
Come with me to a place no eyes have ever seen
A million miles from here where no one's ever been
God-given grace and a holy Heaven face
I'm on the edge of something shattering
I'm coming through
"Ok, let's fly", she says, "this carpet's made for two"
This ugly little box, no place for me and you
Our carpet falls on a dew-fresh daffil plain
Take a look around, there's something happening
All the colors fade
I don't want you now, bang, bang, bang, gone
Ooh, I don't need you now, the seeds are sown
Ooh, bang-bang, pretty-pretty, bang-bang
I don't think so, no, no
I don't think so, no, no
Bang-bang, bang-bang
Below, the country rolls like a mighty boiling sea
The warm, red Sun gives up and sinks into the trees
But I'm no fool, I can't stand here betrayed
Take a look around, there's something happening
All the colors fade
I don't want you now, bang, bang, bang, gone
Ooh, I don't need you now, the seeds are sown
Ooh, bang-bang, pretty-pretty, bang-bang
I don't think so, no, no
I don't think so, no, no
Bang-bang, bang-bang
Come on
Oh yeah
Come on, come on
Come on, come on
Shout
Ooh, ooh
Come on in, hang your coats
Eat our chips, come on, we've got loads
Shake your coconuts, coco boys
Until the nut comes out, come on coco girls
Just keep on dancing now
Just keep on getting down
Just keep on having fun
The party's just begun
Just keep on dancing now
Just keep on getting down
Just keep on having fun
The party's just begun
All dress up, and dress-to-kill
Doctor says, come on, eat your pills
Shake your coconuts, coco boys
Until the milk comes out, come on, coco girls
It's Junior/Senior time to show us you care, hey
Just feel the power put your hands in the air, hey
Hey boys and girls we want to see what you got, hey
We wanna see you shaking coconuts
Shake it
We'll get up, to sing some music
We'll get down, to pass the time
Shake your coconuts, come on, coco boys
Shake you coconuts, come on, coco girls
Just keep on dancing now
Just keep on getting down
Just keep on having fun
The party's just begun
As I was walking 'round Grosvenor Square
Not a chill to the winter but a nip to the air
From the other direction, she was calling my eye
It could be an illusion, but I might as well try, might as well try
She had rings on her fingers and bells on her shoes
And I knew without asking she was into the blues
She wore scarlet begonias tucked into her curls
I knew right away she was not like other girls, other girls
In the thick of the evening when the dealing got rough
She was too pat to open and too cool to bluff
As I picked up my matches and was closing the door
I had one of those flashes I'd been there before, been there before
Well, I ain't often right but I've never been wrong
It seldom turns out the way it does in this song
Once in a while you get shown the light
In the strangest of places if you look at it right
Well there ain't nothing wrong with the way she moves
Or scarlet begonias or a touch of the blues
And there's nothing wrong with the look that's in her eyes
I had to learn the hard way, I had to let her pass by, let her pass by
Wind in the willow's playing "Tea for Two"
The sky was yellow and the sun was blue
Strangers stopping strangers just to shake their hand
Everybody's playing in the Heart of Gold Band, Heart of Gold Band
Will somebody wear me to the fair? 
Will a lady pin me in her hair? 
Will a child find me by a stream? 
Kiss my petals and weave me through a dream.
For all of these simple things and much more a flower was born
It blooms to spread love and joy faith and hope to people forlorn
Inside every man lives the seed of a flower
If he looks within he finds beauty and power
Ring all the bells sing and tell the people that be everywhere that the flower has come
Light up the sky with your prayers of gladness and rejoice for the darkness is gone
Throw off your fears let your heart beat freely at the sign that a new time is born
And it's bigger than everything I have ever done before
And it's bigger than everything I have ever done before
I found a reason for staying home tonight
Just by self tonight, all by myself
I'm gonna loop duplicate my heart into a million songs
I've found a reason for not going out tonight
I'm making out tonight, with my computer
I'm putting guitars on hold when my multi-track comes around
And is it really so
So many interesting effects
I wanna try
I wanna try them all on you
And it's bigger than everything I have ever done before
Can't get no sleep tonight, feels so good tonight
Damn it feels so sweet tonight, all by myself
The neighbors can't complain, 'cause I've got my headphones on
Can't get no sleep tonight, damn it feels so good tonight
Everything is all right, now (My computer)
I'm gonna save a million songs for you, so I hope you enjoy it
And is it really so
So many interesting effects
I wanna try
I wanna try them all on you
And it's bigger than everything I have ever done before
And it's bigger than everything I have ever done before
And it's bigger than everything I have ever done before
Today
Today
I saw a man
Today
I saw a man
Using an empty whiskey flask
As a walkie talkie
Today
Today
I saw a man
Today
I saw a man
With a flaming eight ball
Tattooed on his arm
Today
Today
Today
I saw a man
Today
I saw a man
Using an empty whiskey flask
As a walkie talkie
Today
I met a man
Who threw his arms around me
And you give in...
Today...
We laughed
We laughed waiting for a train
For a few into the city
Seconds today
That great stuff
That great stuff
That stuff
That stuff makes me feel waiting for a train
Feel into the city
Feel today
Happy today
It's a casual goodbye, goodbye
Off the mountainside
Seen but not for long, too long
As our lights look down the road
Casual we ride, we ride
To the mid day light
Casual we drive, we drive
Off the mountainside
And the ground, it's closing down
Out run it
It's a casual goodbye off the mountainside
Seen but not for too long, too long
As our lights look down the road
Casual we ride through the big blue sky
And the ground, it's closing down
Out run it
Out run it
Out in our place filled with lost existence
You'll fall forward because...
Oh no, my friends
I think we've turned into a big mistake
But those are the breaks
For having fun
Turning away from the high road
We should find a flock of birds big enough
To pull us up
From the low road
Come on
Come with us
We are falling straight down, so turn us up
Loud and clear
Before we crash in the ground
Turning away from the high road
We should find a flock of birds big enough
To pull us up
From the low road
Come on
Come with us
We are falling straight down, so turn us up
Loud and clear
Before we crash in the ground
I found my...
She's so far...
She makes my head...
I found my soldier girl.
She's so far away.
She makes my head spin around.
I found my soldier girl.
She's so far away.
She makes my head spin around.
I found my soldier girl.
She's so far away.
She makes my head spin around.
I found my soldier girl
She's so far away.
She makes my head spin around.
I found my soldier girl
She's so far away.
She makes my head spin around.
I found my soldier girl
She's so far away.
She makes my head spin around.
There's a bad reason
She just can't stay home anymore
Expectations rising
Life's too short
It's too cliché
And you say, and you say
And you say, and you say
And you say, and you say
And you say, and you say
She knows when things are happening
Into the night, she's lost again
It's like no other feeling she says
"Here I am to save the day"
Wishing for the time of my life, she says
Wishing for the time of my life
Wishing for the time of my life, she says
Wishing for the time of my life
Wishing for the time of my life, she says
Wishing for the time of my life
Wishing for the time of my life, she says
Wishing for the time of my life
And you say, and you say
And you say, and you say
And you say
Light and day
Is more than you'll say
Cause all my feelings
Are more than I can let by
Or not
It's more than you've got
Just follow the day
Follow the day and reach for the sun
You don't see me fly into the red - one more you're done
Just follow the seasons and find the time
Reach for the bright side
You don't see me fly into the red - one more you're nuts
Just follow the day
Follow the day and reach for the sun
Just follow the day
Follow the day and reach for the sun
You don't see me fly into the red - one more you're done
Just follow the seasons and find the time
Reach for the bright side
You don't see me fly into the red - one more you're nuts
Just follow the day
Follow the day and reach for the sun
Just follow the day
Follow the day and reach for the sun
Just follow the day
Follow the day and reach for the sun
All my life I've been fall- fall- falling apart,
Been tumbling down quick first right from the start
I never learned just get up and go on
Until I'm just knocked right off of my feet
But it's not the fall that hurts
It's when you hit the ground
'Cause it's not the fall that hurts
It's when you hit the ground
Stumblin' with every step I take
And it seems I can't get a grip
I'm soon gonna slip
And then I look down
I see the fur ground
Is closening fast again
And then boom
But it's not the fall that hurts
It's when you hit the ground
'Cause it's not the fall that hurts
It's when you hit the ground
Sailing silver waves, through the skies and round your eyes
And in the pockets of the tide, a meeting place by night
Sequin covered swans, that are used to make their own mosaics
A ceremony comes: An exponential fate
The dance of the cosmos shows
The stitches of space that slowly come and go
The dance of the cosmos shows, as above, so below
A whippoorwhill in flight, turns east towards westphalia
In search of lost time, with the magic of true light
Tone zodiac in tune, with the fossil of our themepark
And falling from the seams, is a steeple swarmed in light
The dance of the cosmos shows
The stitches of space that slowly come and go
The dance of the cosmos shows, as above, so below
Galloping galloping beams faster... x4
Joining together and still faster... x4
Onwards past never and still faster... x2
Always past never and still faster...
Da-da-da-da, da da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da, da da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da, da da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da, da da-da-da-da
Jackie Wilson said it was Reet-Petite
Kinda love you got knock me off my feet
Let it all hang out
Oh, let it all hang out
And you know I'm so wired up
Don't need no coffee in my cup
Let it all hang out
Let it all hang out
Watch this

When you smile

When you smile
And when you walk across the room
You make my heart go boom-boom-boom
Let it all hang out
Baby, let it all hang out
And every time you look that way
Honey child, you make my day
Let it all hang out
Like the man said, let it all hang out
Watch out
Ding-a-ling-a-ling, ding-a-ling-a-ling-ding

Do-do-doop, do-do do-do-doop
Do-do do-do-doop, do-do-do-doop
Do do-doop
When I sail back home to you
I know exactly just what to do
And when I take these winds to home
I know I won't be alone
When I hang my trousers dry
I know it won't just be you and I
'Cause there'll be Ma and Pa and Grandmama
And all the children I have fathered
You know I have, I have a knack
For anything that uses my back
And I will work, will work these fields
'Cause it's the only thing, I think, that's real
And when I raise, raise my hands up high
I know it won't just be you and I
'Cause there'll be sun and snow and a horse Jethro
And all the children I have fathered
And I will learn to cook for you
It's one thing that I plan to learn to do
And I will make sweet dandelion wine
And there'll be no search for time
Spend all our lives just having lives
And there'll be no time for any lies
There's just mares-eat-oats
And no more lows
And all the children I have fathered
There'll be Ma and Pa and Grandmama
And all the children I have fathered
Baby's got a praise like a willow in the wind
Baby's got a praise like a lover, like a friend
It's a long way, Nehalem, to let the water in
And that's a slow-rolling country caravan of many sons
Baby's got a worship like a river on the cusp
Crashing through the levy moving with a mighty rush
It's a long way, oh, joker, to let the fire burn
And that's a slow-rolling country caravan of many sons
Baby's got a praise like a scarecrow in the corn
Kicking up a blaze, moving over like a storm
It's a long way, Nehalem, to let the water in
And that's a slow-rolling country caravan of many sons
Baby's got a praise like a willow in the wind
Baby's got a praise like a lover, like a friend
It's a long way, Nehalem, to let the water in
And that's a slow-rolling country caravan of many sons
Yeah, that's a slow-rolling country caravan of many sons
Oh, that's a slow-rolling country caravan
Of many sons, many sons
Today could be the day you might make a change
Lock yourself indoors and plan a getaway
Take a walk outside in the heavy weather
The British Summer time's just great whatever
Join a local gang and get a cool nickname
Make your lifelong sweetheart your ball and chain
Convert your self belief for a new Religion
Or leave the TV on make a decision when you're
Waiting for the day you're not looking for something else
Go put your last £5 on the lottery
If you're not in it to win it well then you won't receive
Then maybe place all your winning on an outsider
And if it wins you'll be grinning and you can celebrate
Six months of our lives are at a red light
And there's a thousand chances to get it right
So put your foot in the door because it's free admission
Or leave the TV on make a decision when you're
Waiting for the day you're not looking for something else
Break away your ties and find a new squeeze
Show a local scheme your generosity
Stand back in the shadows and be a right hand man
Buy a brand new semi next door to the Taliban
Who knows what's around the bend
Stay up get drunk with all your best friends
Celebrate your side to a new division
Or leave the TV on make your own decisions
Waiting for the day you're not looking for something else
Don't let your day grow long before it comes a week
Go and make a change before the Big Sleep
I watched you through your window
I was wearing that dumb sweatshirt
I looked like a goon
I was dressed for winter
Even though it was the middle of June
I watched you get undressed
I must have turned bright red
'Cause I couldn't stand to face you
'Cause I like what I saw
Maybe we should just stay friends
Tell me how you feel about me
Do you like or like like me
Tell me what you really feel
Do you like me?
Just say you do
I climbed up your front porch
And I doorbell ditched you
And I felt so bad
Couldn't cop to what I did
So I laughed myself sick
All the way to my car
New York City N.Y.C.
Pretty mean when it want to be
Black leather, kneehole pants,
Can't play no highschool dance,
Fuzz tone, hear'em go, hear'em on
The radio

Your beauty took my breath away,
In awe all day,
Your company was so relaxing,
Easy going ways,
We saw the first signs of summer and springtime change,
Walking barefoot along the sand,
I hadn't planned to stay
Yeah we've been walking barefoot
All summer
It'll be sad my friend
To see it come to an end
Why can't we just quit
You are broke all summer
But you still sing
Don't need money when it's sunny,
Don't need anything
Just need music and sun and laughter
And no currency
The sun on your bare shoulders,
Comes for free
Yeah we've been walking barefoot
All summer
It'll be sad my friend
To see it come to and end
Why can't we just quit
Yeah we've been walking barefoot
All summer
Why can't we just design
To live like this all the time
Why can't we just quit
Sand ran through my fingers
And the land was hot
Anointed by appolo
And his chariot
Disarmed by your charm,
That night I felt it again
Addictive and consuming,
Love's sweet pain
Yeah we've been walking barefoot
All summer
It'll be sad my friend
To see it come to an end
Why can't we just quit
Our days are as the wind blows us,
We are free
You've a quiet life out of town
Of coastal ease
The wind it has no pattern,
We take life slow
And when the night has fallen,
Our cup overflows
When the summer's gone
And the room is cold
When you're looking at the rain
And it just won't go
Remember when the sun was hot
And high above
Remember when the days were long
And we were in love
Yeah we've been walking barefoot
All summer
It'll be sad my friend
To see it come to an end
Why can't we just quit
Yeah we've been walking barefoot
All summer
Why can't we just design
To live like this all the time
Why can't we just quit
She's got you wrapped up in her satin and lace
Tied around her little finger
She's got you thinkin' you could never escape
Don't you know your heart's in danger
There's a devil in that angel face
If you could only see the love that you're wasting
I can love you better than that
I know how to make you forget her
All I'm askin' is for one little chance
'Cause baby, I can love you, baby, I can love you better
I'm gonna break the spell she's got on you
Your gonna wake up to find
I'm your desire, my intentions are true
Hey babe, I know in time
Your gonna see what you mean to me
So open up your eyes, 'cause seein' is believin
I can love you better than that
I know how to make you forget her
All I'm askin' is for one little chance
'Cause baby, I can love you, baby, I can love you better
I can love you better than that
I know how to make you forget her
All I'm askin' is for one little chance
'Cause, baby, I can love you, baby, I can love you
I can love you better than that
I know how to make you forget her
All I'm askin' is for one little chance
'Cause baby, I can love you, baby, I can love you better
I can love you better than that
I know how to make you forget her
All I'm askin' is for one little chance
'Cause baby, I can love you, baby, I can love you 
I can love you better than that
I can love you better
I can love you better than that
Baby, I can love you, baby, I can love you better
Oh, Valerie Plame, if that really is your name
I will shout the same to the world
Dear Valerie Plame, so they made a wreck of you
Well, give me the rest of you, and I'll get the world
But you were just some silly girl
Taking in the sights of your empire's colony
So I took you into my confidence without a thought of consequence
To my heart or to my mind
But Valerie Plame, if that really is your name
I will shout the same to the world
Oh, Valerie Plame, if that really is your name
I will shout the same from on high
Dear Valerie Plame, I'll look for that long exchange
Outside of the bureau de change in Shanghai
I was just some stupid boy on a bus
When your nom de guerre was codename Caroline
So my vespa became your chariot from the green zone Marriott
To be etched upon my mind
But Valerie Plame, if that really is your name
I will shout the same to the world
And when they flashed your picture cross the screen
How my heart seemed to leap out of me
And they attached a list of your identities
But the one you'll always be
Is Valerie Plame, if that really is your name
I will shout the same to the world
Dear Valerie Plame, if that really is your name
I will shout the same to the world
Hey, Valerie Plame
Hey, Valerie Plame
Hey, Valerie Plame
Hey, Valerie Plame
The road is long and winding like a good mystery unfolding
It twists and turns in colorful subplots and sunburns and fake out endings
And sometimes my patience in the whole process starts bending
As I attempt to unravel the web by traversing and rehearsing and perversing along the doubt-laden extension chord thread of my life
And in this life we're free to dream whatever we want to
But that doesn't mean that your dreams are gonna come true
Instead as a way of getting us to move
Life dangles your dreams in front of you
And unable to resist the temptation, we continue
And it's clear to me that this life is gonna be
All about the dangling possibilities that keep turning in and turning out
Yes it's clear to me that this life is gonna be
All about the dangling possibilities
The road is long and winding
Full of twists and turns
But before you can rise from the ashes
You've got to burn baby burn
Welcome to your barbeque
Where we roast all the dreams
That never came true 
Welcome to your barbeque
Pig out and dream a new
(Fake, fake flowers)
(Fake funeral)
x4
This room is a, a fluorescent tomb: it's brazen bulbs mimic death's heina croon.
He pulls on her wires, she jerks to attention, she's animated again,
She's talking to a hypodermic reflection.
We've watched it all from the window ledge,
The nurses offer their condolences,
Tongues flapping I can't make out your tone,
Our hearts beat in slow motion.
If we make it to the final scene (fake flowers!)
Show me to the sapphire pit (fake tomb)
Peel the candy crust of my body (fake flowers)
Throw in the brittle skeleton (fake tomb)
Can you inject love's tender touch back into the gang bang?
Can you knit the stiletto back into the bloodstain?
Can you put the bite back into the beast you've broke, and tied and tamed?
Can you crease the wrinkles back into the cracked and open brain?
So doctor won't you pull the fucking plug? Won't you cut the cord?
'Cause you can't put the life back into this hospital ward.
Say won't you pull the plug!
Say won't you cut the cord!
x4
Now she's gonna make it out ok, but she's shaking like a revolution!
And she stares at the fire all day, mumbling to herself:
Every hole has a snake in it,
And every crotch is a siamese gun.
Every sunshine hides a cancerous chime
And every breath is a bomb.
I'd like to wrap my arms around you like a flesh canopy
I'd like to take your head, place it
Somewhere between my shoulders and neck
But, I'm afraid your brittle bones would break
We can hear the black out orchestra singing...
Can you hear them singing?
Can you hear them?
Can you?
Can you inject love's tender touch back into the gang bang?
Can you knit the stiletto back into the bloodstain?
Can you put the bite back into the beast you've broke, and tied and tamed?
Can you crease the wrinkles back into the cracked and open brain?
So doctor won't you pull the fucking plug? Won't you cut the cord?
'Cause you can't put the life back into this hospital ward.
So doctor won't you pull the fucking plug? Won't you cut the cord?
'Cause you can't put the life back into this hospital ward.
(It's only one more day)
Can you wait
My plane will be arriving shortly
Right there at the gate
I pray that you'll be waiting right there for me
This time could be what
We've both been searching for
Our whole lives waking up
I'm coming back for more
(Leave your baggage behind, you won't need it tonight, enjoy your flight)
J-E-T (J-E-T)
You are so good for me (You are so good for me)
You are my jetstream lover
You're how I wanna be (Just how I wanna be baby)
J-E-T (J-E-T)
You are so good for me (You are so good for me)
You are my jetstream lover
You're how I wanna be (Just how I wanna be baby)
We're so high
I'm watching all the clouds drift by below me
We should try
It's been so long since I made you cry
Long live love
I just can't get enough of you
I need that engine's push
It's gonna take me home to you
J-E-T (J-E-T)
You are so good for me (You are so good for me)
You are my jetstream lover
You're how I wanna be (Just how I wanna be baby)
J-E-T (J-E-T)
You are so good for me (You are so good for me)
You are my jetstream lover
You're how I wanna be (Just how I wanna be baby)
You were
You were meant to be
(We will be dimming the lights for this evening's entertainment. Enjoy, enjoy, enjoy, enjoy...)
Home with me
Da da da...
J-E-T (J-E-T)
You are so good for me (You are so good for me)
You are my jetstream lover
You're how I wanna be (Just how I wanna be baby)
J-E-T (J-E-T)
You are so good for me (You are so good for me)
You are my jetstream lover
You're how I wanna be (Just how I wanna be baby)
You are so good for me (You are so good for me)
You are so good for me (Just how I wanna be baby)
But you're gone
But you're gone
Don't let it go
Don't let it go
If you don't try
If you don't try
How will you know
How will you know
Da da da da...
Oh girl, look at yourself
What have you done?
What have you become?
Well, I couldn't say
Slow down and think of your heart
Where do you go?
Now how am I supposed to know
I'm always looking away
Give me your eyes
So I can see me straight
Give me your eyes
I can't tell night from day
Give me your eyes
So I can see me straight
Give me your eyes
And watch me walk away
Yeah, yeah
I took a look at myself
Nothing inside
Except for cigarettes and wine
When I should be alive
You've been watching me for a while
And you like what you see
It's in the eyes of the beholder
Now give them to me
Give me your eyes
So I can see me straight
Give me your eyes
They seem to like my face
Oh, mirror mirror upon the wall
Who is the fairest of them all?
Mirror mirror made no reply
Mirror went black and cracked
From side to side
Oh girl, look at yourself
What have you done?
What have you become
You know the camera don't lie
Give me your eyes
So I can see me straight
Give me your eyes
I can't tell night from day
Give me your eyes
So I can see me straight
Give me your eyes
And watch me walk away
Give me your eyes
Give me your eyes
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Know that I been waiting for so long!
You're all that I see
I can't stop this feel oh no
It's taking over me
Feel the mercury rising
I feel your baseline bumping
Hear it in your rhythm
You got my heart beat pumping
Oh I can't stop it
No I can't control it
Can you feel it overloading
Oh overloading heh
You can't stop it
No you can't control it
Can you feel it overloading
Oh overloading heh
Know that I been waiting for so long,
You're all that I see
I can't stop this feel oh no
It's taking over me
Feel the mercury rising
I feel your baseline bumping
Hear it in your rhythm
You got my heart beat pumping
Oh I can't stop it
No I can't control it
Can you feel it overloading
Oh overloading heh
You can't stop it
No you can't control it
Can you feel it overloading
Oh overloading heh
I play centerfield for the home team
You might not see me from the nosebleeds
I'll stand up on top of the dugout
And shout out and wave my arms and hold my tongue
'Cause it's not me
I wondered how fast is light speed
Would life itself stay or follow me?
And coach look at me now
Look at me now
And team look at me now
Look at me now
Look at me now
Foul ball deep in centerfield
Ninth inning, two outs
Look at me now
Look at me now
Look at me now
Look at me now
I wondered how fast is light speed
Would life itself stay or follow me?
If I caught that one
Would it be the same?
It's a good thing this is just a game
From the time I fall asleep till the morning comes I dream about you baby
And I feel alright, 'cause I know tonight I'll be with you baby
And who makes me feel like smiling when the weary day is through
(Who?) You baby, you. (I'm talking about my baby yeah)
No one but you, you baby---nobody but you
(Who?) You baby, you. (Baby, yeah)
No one but you, you baby--nobody but you
They say candy is sweet, but it just can't compete with you, baby
You've got everything I need and nobody can please like you, you baby
And who believes that my wildest dreams and my craziest schemes will come true
(Who?) You baby, you! (I'm talking about my baby yeah)
No one but you, you baby---nobody but you
(Who?) You baby, you! (Baby, yeah)
No one but you, you baby---nobody but you
A little ray of sunshine, a little bit of soul, 
Add just a touch of magic, it's the greatest thing since rock n' roll
Yeah, baby
(You) You baby, you! (I'm talking about my baby yeah)
No one but you, you baby---nobody but you
(You) You baby, you
No one but you, you baby---nobody but you
Living with no reason, dwarfed, alone, imprisoned
Wonder why I'm here at all
Why I'm even trying, destined to be filing
The higher you reach the harder you fall
And then you say
We're all the same
All got our dreams
Loose at their seams
We all spit at stars
Unifying fact however we act
We feel we've not made our true goal
Something we can see but not reach or be
Can leave you dead in a hole
And then you say
We're all the same
All got our dreams
Loose at their seams
We all spit at stars
You don't get what you don't deserve
Don't expect the world with no work that's absurd
Learn to spit up towards the stars
Who knows soon your spit will land on Mars
And then you say
We're all the same
All got our dreams
Loose at their seams
We all spit at stars
And if I ever had a wish in the whole world
I would've listened to my brother when he spoke to me
And I never would've played with my conscience
In the fields where I was in their company
But you gave me wings and I used them
I used them, I used them on my youth
And you gave me wings and I used them
I used them, and I won't lose them
Now I found my feet
Count to one, two, three
And I'm taking off tonight, now I'm free
As I walk my feet on the cold concrete
And I, and I, and I
I can feel my dreams when I'm in my city, eh eh eh
I fall on my knees for my, for my city, eh
We go on every dream in my, in my city, eh eh eh
And that's where I'll stay
And that's where I'll stay
In my city, eh eh eh
I wandered down the streets with my new town
With the lights blinding and my heart weighed down
I think I'll get a job receiving people's thunder
For the folks back home, I will make them proud
But you gave me wings and I used them
I used them, I used them on my youth
Yeah, you gave me wings and I used them
I used them, I don't wanna lose them
I don't wanna lose them
I can feel my dreams when I'm in my city, eh eh eh
I fall on my knees for my, for my city, eh
We go on every dream in my, in my city, eh eh eh
And that's where I'll stay
And that's where I'll stay
In my city, eh eh eh
Shoulders ache for want of wings
My city shakes the fear in me
I can feel my dreams when I'm in my city, eh eh eh
I fall on my knees for my, for my city, eh
We go on every dream in my, in my city, eh eh eh
And that's where I'll stay
And that's where I'll stay
In my city, eh eh eh
We're caught in a landslide, the minutes come tumbling down
And into an hour's time, within which a day's worth of work
Must be planned out and pan out for every week to be worth
The weekends of downtime and months of an ennui that kills
And years of resentment
Of everyone's contentment and you
Can't justify it still
I tell you my reasons, you don't tell me your inside jokes
Until I've gone bitter on every word that you've spoken
And all of your kind words amounting to naught but a token
And all their inaction will tumble away with the days
And nights of together
As we're really not together at all
But parallel
Now I'm walking on downtown in a town that is not my home
And shopping for breakfast to be eaten all alone
And dreaming of houses, none of them that I own
But that's not my province, that's not for what I am known
So I gather around me all the little pieces of a song
And fit them where they belong
So go to your downtown and bring what you've brought back home
You never should worry, your hours will now be as long
As the days that you hurried and months when it all seemed wrong
In all of the action will tumble away with the years
And parallel evenings
And parallel tracks of our tears
And nights of together are where?
So I gather around me all the little pieces of a song
And fit them where they belong
And fit them where they belong
And fit them where they belong
And fit them where they belong
And fit them where they belong
And fit them where they belong
And fit them where they belong
And fit them where they belong
And fit them where they belong
The years have been turning on
You left me at home
To carve my own stone
I cried picking up pride
Oh granite won't lie
We all got along
Well it's true
Build this for you
A house fit for two
Is too small for you
Our son is losing his mind
His drugs that he hides
You can see in his veins
The steps he's needing to take
His back it might brake
We both need you here
It's true
I build this for you
A house fit for two
Is too small for you
It's a shame
Leave you to blame
Changing your name
And left him insane
Return like a prodigal sheep
It's cold in the keep
But I have you here
I work hard then watch some TV
You staring at me
What are you doing there?
Get up
Lay down your crown
What are you doing now?
Say I'm tired as hell
Yeah I'm broke
Ain't got as much as you
To tell you the truth
Still am your man
It's true
I build this for you
A house fit for two
Is too small for you
It's a shame
Leave you to blame
Changing your name
And left me insane
The words on the tip of your tongue
Like a song I once sung
And you threw it away
That tune
Old melody
Had hope in its ring
Those years never came
Misty morning in the springtime
Close your eyes, crystal eyes
On the darkside let the light shine
Please, please stay with me tonight
These lips will find strawberry wine
I was looking at your window
Lurking there beneath my feet
Cherry apples, long grass meadows
(Searching) I, for dreams in sleep
These lips will find strawberry wine
Misty morning in the springtime
Lurking there beneath your feet
On the darkside let the light shine
Think of me, don't let me keep
These lips will find strawberry wine
If you seek a pillow for your head
Or a fitted sheet for Christmas bed
If you see your shadow on the snow
Is it from the baby Jesus glow?
He's going to the country
Find a tree and put in your house
Put a mistletoe upon your mother's blouse
If you see a woman dressed in black
Give her up a song and then ask for it back
We're going to the country
We're going to the country
You're mom's going to the country
We're going to the country
The country
Dark years brought endless rain
Out in the cold I lost my way
But storms won't last, they clear the air
For something new...
The sun came out and brought you through...
A lifetime full of words to say
A hope that time will slow the passing day
I've been wrong times over
And I've been shamed with no words to find
But if the sun will rise, bring us tomorrow
Walk with me, crimson day...
Don't speak, no use for words
Lie in my arms, sleep secure
I wonder what you're dreaming of, lands rare and far?
A timeless flight to reach the stars...
A lifetime full of words to say
A hope that time will slow the passing day
I've been wrong times over
And I've been shamed with no words to find
But if the sun will rise, bring us tomorrow
Walk with me, crimson day...
I've come so far to meet you here
To share this life with one I hold so dear
And I won't speak but what is true
The world outside created just for you
It's for you, for you
I've been wrong times over
And I've been shamed with no words to find
But if the sun will rise, bring us tomorrow
Walk with me, crimson day...
(Outta control)
You're gone, now, I feel fine
17 months, yeah I feel fine
What about you? I betcha been cryin'
I bet ya been goin' around town lyin'
I'm drivin' fast, I feel so fine
I got Prince singin' Hot Thing to me
I know every line
So I pulled up to the red light, sittin' here in my car
I look up to my right, and there you are
Sat there with some new girl, what is this?
(Don't panic, panic, Mutya don't drive erratic)
That's who has replaced me, what a diss
(Don't panic, panic, don't act too manic, manic)
It's a sure fine way to ruin my day
Just as soon as I'm on top of my life, there you are again
But don't react now, you can't go back now
Don't panic, panic, Mutya, just look ahead now
(Outta control)
Let's cut to it, my girl for lunch
I was feelin' on top of the world, and I just got a hunch
That you were sat behind my back, didn't need to turn 'round
I felt sick at the thought, you're laughing loud
Sat there with some new girl, what is this?
(Don't panic, panic, Mutya don't drive erratic)
That's who has replaced me, what a diss
(Don't panic, panic, don't act too manic, manic)
It's a sure fine way to ruin my day
Just as soon as I'm on top of my life, there you are again
But don't react now, you can't go back now
Don't panic, panic, Mutya, just look ahead now
(Outta control)
It's a sure fine way to ruin my day
Just as soon as I'm on top of my life, there you are again
But don't react now, you can't go back now
Don't panic, panic, Mutya, just look ahead now -->

His man you love, this boy you hate
The hills are his in all embrace
Enchanted and not soon lost
This man you call with lover's draw
So coarse in kind it can't be sought
For leaving is what I do
I declare myself
Declare myself of faith
I declare myself
Declare myself of faith
Ever wonder why they kill the weak ones, baby
There's no one here to care
Someone always thought a good reason, baby
Just why we're really here
Affirm my power to spend my dollars, to get us home, yeah
I've got no money, got no secrets
Maybe we were born to kiss another
Maybe we were born to run forever
Or maybe we were born to come together, or whatever
Kiss me alone
This boy you chance, this man you'll find
Will dry the tears behind your eyes
So stop laughing and play the muse
This heartache rots that which spills
From my heart into your will
So give in to the rivers wind
I declare myself
Declare myself of faith
I declare myself
Declare myself of faith
Every wonder why they kill the weak ones, baby
So they can to testify
For every single ghost on that freeway, baby
Has got to give a mild holler to spend my dollars
We've got to get away
I've got no money, got no secrets
Maybe we were born to love each other
Maybe we were born to run forever
Or maybe we were born to come together, or whatever
Kiss me alone
Kiss me alone
Kiss me alone
Kiss me alone
Maybe we were born to love
Maybe we were born to love
Maybe we were born to love
Maybe we were born to love each other
Kiss me alone
Kiss me alone
Kiss me alone

There's this one word, it's called comfort
It's the strangest, most dangerous place I could hide
It's a wonder this cold comfort
Hasn't hollowed and swallowed you and I from inside
You're my first want on the worst nights
My gut knots up, my heart bursts like
A pinata pops, this has gotta stop
Watch the water drop from clouds, it sure rains a lot
And I've felt how a heart melts down
I'm so burnt out; I'm a shell now
It's the worst of lows, it's the first to go,
It's the last to come back when the sun melts the snow
What I'm giving you is taking
Lots of lying and some faking
Have I gone too far? Am I too far gone?
I've been up all night and fight to keep out the dawn
And we've felt how our hearts melt down
We're so burnt out; we're a shell now
It's the worst of lows, it's the first to go,
It's the last to come back when the sun melts the snow
Everybody's hurting.
Everybody knows it.
Are you trying to stop it?
Everyone's watching.
What are you gonna do?
Are you trying to stop it? Everyone's watching.
Everyone is conversing. Everyone's listening.
Oh, they were apart.
He was apart and she was a part of it
Oh, falling apart, is anyone watching?
Is anyone listening? Are we listening?
And all I have, is all of me.
And it's all that I can give.
Our disappointed hearts will heal.
Our hearts will spill, over you, over me, over this.
They never knew, they never knew, what you're going through.
'Cause you've got everybody thinking,
There's nothing wrong with you.
And you fall apart, cause you felt apart.
And they were a part of it.
Oh, falling apart, is anyone watching?
Is anyone listening? Are we listening?
And all I have, is all of me.
And it's all that I can give.
Our disappointed hearts will heal.
Our hearts will spill, over you, over me, over this.
On dark and stormy days, somewhere it's glowing.
And even though I know I'm here, I know I'm going.
Oh you never stop, you just collide.
Collapse onto your side.
Surprise and make it right.
Yeah!
And all I have, is all of me.
And it's all that I can give.
Our disappointed hearts will heal.
Our hearts will spill, over you, over me, over this.
And all I have, is all of me.
And it's all that I can give.
Our disappointed hearts will heal.
Our hearts will spill, over you, over me, over this.
And all I have, is all of me.
And it's all that I can give.
Our disappointed hearts will heal.
Our hearts will spill, over you, over me, over this.
Here comes Mary
All dressed in black
Her heart so heavy
A love attack
Her dying cigarette in the rain
The gangs are out
And here comes Mary
They rave and shout
Her love to bury
Her dying cigarette in the rain
Go home and cry to your mama tonight
Go home and bury your love tonight
Young love dead
Lost forever
Young love dead
Lost forever
A dying cigarette in the rain
A shiny gun
To her head
Here comes Mary
Forever dead
A wet cigarette in the rain
Went home and cried to her mama tonight
Went home and buried her love tonight
Went home and cried to her mama tonight
Went out and killed herself tonight
If you ever make it back to Nashville
Remember you have still got a friend
I'll meet you at the Parthenon
That's the place we always went
It's been so dull since you left Nashville
I've read the same books again & again
It makes me wish I wasn't bashful
When it comes to other men
But if I could have my way
Darling you'd come home
Remember when you moved to Nashville
And the first time that we kissed
Remember when your mother found us
Remember that you're sorely missed
And when you make it back to Nashville
We'll forget all of your sins
And I still buy two pairs of everything
So when you come home you & I'll be twins
Because if I could have my way
I wouldn't be alone

Go ahead with your dreamin'
For what it's worth
Or you'll be stricken bound 
Kickin' up dirt
For when it's dark
You never know what the night it may bring
Go ahead with your schemin'
And shop at home
You'll find treasure
While cookin' up bones
But the knife is sharp
You'd better watch that you don't cut your hands
And they covered up the sun
Until the birds had flown away
And the fishes in the sea 
Had gone to sleep
And they covered up the sun
Until the birds had flown away
And the fishes in the sea 
Had gone to sleep
Go ahead with your dreamin'
For what it's worth
Or you'll be stricken bound 
Kickin' up dirt
For when it's dark
You never know what the night it may bring
Go ahead with schemin'
And shop at home
You'll find treasure
While cookin' up bones
But the knife is sharp
You'd better watch that you don't cut your hands
And they covered up the sun
Until the birds had flown away
And the fishes in the sea 
Had gone to sleep
And they covered up the sun
Until the birds had flown away
And the fishes in the sea 
Had gone to sleep
Holy Moses our hearts are screaming
Souls are lifting only dreaming
We'll be waiting some are praying
For a time when no one's cheatin'
The sunlight rising over the horizon
Just a distant memory the dawn chorus
Birds singing bells ringing
In our hearts in our minds...
And they covered up the sun
Until the birds had flown away
And the fishes in the sea 
Had gone to sleep
And they covered up the sun
Until the birds had flown away
And the fishes in the sea 
Had gone to sleep

One banana two banana three banana four
All bananas make a split so do many more
Over hill and highway the banana buggies go
Come along to bring you the banana splits show
Four banana three banana two banana one
All bananas playing in the bright warm sun
Flipping like a pancake popping like a cork
Fleagle bingo drooper and snork
Making up a mess of fun
Making up a mess of fun
Making up a mess of fun
Lots of fun for everyone
Four banana three banana two banana one
All bananas playing in the bright warm sun
Flipping like a pancake popping like a cork
Fleagle bingo drooper and snork
1,2!
1,2,3,4!
It's a fact printed stained
Burned deep into my brain
It keeps turning in my mind
Like nuts and bolts so long
2!
1,2,3,4!
Hold that pose
Get the feel
Seal the deal
One twist
One tie
I'm closing up a bag of air and wire
2!
1,2,3,4!
Yes! yes!
No no no no!
Yes! yes!
No no no no!
Yes! yes!
No no no!
Yes! yes!

Yes! yes!
No no no no!
Yes! yes!
No no no!
It's a fact printed stain
I was just singing in the rain
On a partially cloudy afternoon
You've been called here today
I just sigh and cry hooray
My friends and family
2!

Yes! yes!
No no no no!
Yes! yes!

Står i din port, står bara still
För en minut sen var du min
En tredjedel av den jag var går hem
För en är krossad, en är din
Det här är slutet på vår film
Från och med nu, mm
Från och med du
Jag ser dig på blåa i April
I telefon, i nya jeans
Men jag har samma trasor
Går och röker samma Marlboro
Jag minns varenda scen ifrån vår film
Mm, från och med nu, hör på mig
Från och med du
Jag blir aldrig samma, från och med du
(Från och med då, från och med du)
Från och med du
(Somliga ljus brinner aldrig ut)
Står inte ut, står inte ut
Ett år försvinner utan ljus
Även om ett sekel går så ska jag alltid vänta på vår tur
Från och med då
Från och med du, du, du, du, du, du
Mm, från och med du, mm, du, du, du
Från och med du
Jag blir aldrig mer densamma, nej
Jag blir aldrig densamma som förut
Somliga ljus brinner aldrig ut
Och i din port har ingenting
Förändrats utom just på din
För bredvid ditt namn står ett namn till
Oh, Mr. Pleasant, how is Mrs. Pleasant?
I hope the world is treating you right 
And your head's in the air
And you're feeling so proud
'Cause you're such a success
And the whole wide world is on your side, hey hey
How are you today? 
People say Mr. Pleasant is good
Mr. Pleasant is kind
Mr. Pleasant's okay
Mr. Pleasant don't mind
As long as Mr. Pleasant's alright, hey hey
How are you today?
How's your father, how's your mother? 
How's your sister, how's your brother? 
How's your brand, new limousine
Twenty-four inch TV screen? 
Did you like prosperity 
More than you liked poverty? 
Life is easier, so much easier 
Life is easier now
Oh, Mr. Pleasant, how is Mrs. Pleasant? 
Did you know she was flirting around 
With another young man
And he's taking her out 
When you have to work late? 
And it's not so pleasant after all, hey hey
How are you today? 
People say Mr. Pleasant is good
Mr. Pleasant is kind
Mr. Pleasant's okay
Mr. Pleasant don't mind
As long as Mr. Pleasant's alright, hey hey
How are you today? 
Mr. Pleasant is good
Mr. Pleasant is kind 
Mr. Pleasant's okay
Oh lord, I'm so bored
Living on my own
You're devilish and dirty
They say your pushing thirty
Well pushing thirty stone
Oh Christ, I'm enticed
I want you in my sack
Your potty mouth is pushy
You're anything but classy
I've just got to get you back
It's been a while,
Since I've seen that smile
Is the old magic still there?
I just love what you've done with your hair... oh yeah!
I just love what you've done with your hair... oh yeah!
Oh!
Oh crumbs, I'm all thumbs
Lying here with you
You're beautiful and busty
But I'm a little rusty
I've forgotten what to do
It's been a while
Since I made you smile
Is the old magic still there?
I just love what you've done with your hair... oh yeah!
I just love what you've done with your hair... oh yeah!
Oh yeah!
(Piano and guitar solos)
I love what you've done with your hair... oh yeah!
I really love what you've done with your hair... oh yeah!
I love what you've done with your hair... oh yeah!
I really love what you've done with your hair... oh yeah!
Pushing through the topsoil,
I'm blinking in the light,
Shading my eyes from the morning sun.
I just wish that I could still
See the world sometimes
The way I saw the world when I was young.
Sleeping with a gun,
Sleeping with a gun,
Sleeping with a gun under my pillow.
Sometimes it gets lonely
Being valiantly alone.
Sometimes I wish I was there with you.
I get sad just thinking
Of all the little things
I never ever had the heart to do.
Sleeping with a gun,
Sleeping with a gun,
Sleeping with a gun under my pillow.
If I looked out of a
Different window would the
Snow still fall as beautiful?
I ain't no architect 
Ain't got the intellect 
I gotta get away 
My time will fade away
I'm gonna spend it in the dust 
Yes, it's true 
I got a selfdestructo bust 
I ain't no fireman 
I lost it in the can 
I gotta get away 
My time will fade away
I'm gonna spend it in the dust 
Yes, it's true 
I got a selfdestructo bust
I got a steel machine 
I got a mongo's dream, yeah, yeah
I gotta get away 
My time will fade away 
I'm gonna spend it in the dust 
Yes, it's true
I got a selfdestructo bust 
I gotta get away 
My time will fade away
I'm gonna spend it in the dust 
Yes, it's true 
I got a selfdestructo bust
Yes, it's true
Ain't gonna ride that yellow bus 
Yes, it's true
I got a selfdestructo bust

And if one day I should become
A singer with a Spanish bum
Who sings for women of great virtue
I'd sing to them with a guitar
I borrowed from a coffee bar
Well, what you don't know doesn't hurt you
My name would be Antonio
And all my bridges I would burn
And when I gave them some they'd know
I'd expect something in return
I'd have to get drunk every night
And talk about virility
With some old grandmother
That might be decked out like a christmas tree
And though pink elephants I'd see
Though I'd be drunk as I could be
Still I would sing my song to me
About the time they called me "Jacky"
If I could be for only an hour
If I could be for an hour every day
If I could be for just one little hour
Cute in a stupid ass way
And if I joined the social whirl
Became procurer of young girls
Then I would have my own bordellos
My record would be number one
And I'd sell records by the ton
All sung by many other fellows
My name would then be handsome Jack
And I'd sell boats of opium
Whisky that came from Twickenham
Authentic queers
And phony virgins
If I had banks on every finger
A finger in every country
And every country ruled by me
I'd still know where I'd want to be
Locked up inside my opium den
Surrounded by some china men
I'd sing the song that I sang then
About the time they called me "Jacky"
If I could be for only an hour
If I could be for an hour every day
If I could be for just one little hour
Cute in a stupid ass way
Now, tell me, wouldn't it be nice
That if one day in paradise
I'd sing for all the ladies up there
And they would sing along with me
And we be so happy there to be
'Cause down below is really nowhere
My name would then be Junipher
Then I would know where I was going
And then I would become all knowing
My beard so very long and flowing
If I became deaf, dumb and blind
(Was: If I could play deaf, dumb and blind)
Because I pitied all mankind
And broke my heart to make things right
I know that every single night
When my angelic work was through
The angels and the Devil too
Would sing my childhood song to me
About the time they called me "Jacky"
If I could be for only an hour
If I could be for an hour every day
If I could be for just one little hour
Cute in a stupid ass way
Instrumental
A chorus of car alarms, shoes on the powerlines
Young kids stealing cars and having switchblade fights
Two little kids out selling lemonade in the sun
If you want them raised right you I guess you start them young
A homeless woman walking around in the snow
Tired father at the bus stop hey bus driver take him home
Boy down at the corner store copping some smokes
In a sea of perfect stripes it's hard to stay afloat
Well the urgency
Oh man I feel it in the streets
All the people they're rhyming
They're stomping their feet
Got the shake of the grass roots beat
There's a preacher down on 24th and farnam street
Where the shattered glass is lying always glittering
And a prostitute with money spilling out her hands
Both screaming about some high tide rising
A protester's sandwich board in the park
Said you know the world is big and got a loose heart
You've only got what you've just polished clean
So you either start screaming or start singing
Do ya, do ya, do ya love me?
Do ya need a little time?
Do ya, do ya, do ya want me?
Oh, to hold you when you cry
Do ya, do ya, do ya, do ya love me?
Don't wanna hear you say may-hey-hey-be
Won't you tell me, do you love me
'Cause I wanna know
I'm making a list
Of things that I miss
Whenever we're far apart
The way that you kiss
Tha taste of your lips
I'm telling you from the heart
'Cause baby I just wanna know
Do ya, do ya, do ya, do ya love me? (do ya love me, 'cause I wanna know)
Do ya feel it's in your bones
Do ya, do ya dream about me
Oh, when you're sleeping on your own
Do ya, do ya, do ya, do ya love me?
Don't wanna hear you say may-hey-hey-be
Won't you tell me, do you love me
'Cause I wanna know
I'm making a list
Of things that I miss
Whenever we're far apart
The way that you kiss
Tha taste of your lips
I'm telling you from the heart
'Cause baby I just wanna know
Do ya, do ya, do ya love me? (Do ya love me 'cause I wanna know)
Do ya need a little time? (Do ya love me 'cause I wanna know)
Do ya, do ya, do ya want me? (Do ya love me 'cause I wanna know)
Oh, to hold you when you cry (Do ya love me 'cause I wanna know)
Do ya, do ya, do ya, do ya love me? (Do ya love me 'cause I wanna know)
Don't wanna hear you say may-hey-hey-be (Do ya love me 'cause I wanna know)
Won't you tell me, do you love me
'Cause I wanna know
I'm making a list
Of things that I miss
Whenever we're far apart
The way that you kiss
Tha taste of your lips
I'm telling you from the heart
'Cause baby I just wanna know
Do ya, do ya, do ya, do ya love me? (Do ya love me 'cause I wanna know)
Just tell me do ya love me (Do ya love me 'cause I wanna know)
Oh show me you love me (Do ya love me 'cause I wanna know)
'Cause I wanna know (Do ya love me 'cause I wanna know)
Do ya, do ya, do ya, do ya love me? (Do ya love me 'cause I wanna know)
Don't wanna hear you say may-hey-hey-be (Do ya love me 'cause I wanna know)
Won't you tell me, do you love me
Wohow
Do you really love me (tell me)
Do ya, do ya, do ya, love me
'Cause I wanna know
Do ya love me 'cause I wanna know
Do ya love me 'cause I wanna know!
Ancient walls of flowers tumblin' down,
Black cat petals and a smiling clown.
I like to keep them in a jar beside,
Just enough to mess my mind inside.
But I never heard you callin' from the sun.
Did you ever care to shoot your silver gun?
No, I never heard you callin' from the moon.
Did you ever care to sing your free love tune?
Ancient walls of whispers falling low,
Murmur simmer and I'm feeling slow.
Keep me up, but keep me in my head.
I'll ping a pound of posies 'til I'm dead.
But I never heard you callin' from the sun.
Did you ever care to shoot your silver gun?
No, I never heard you callin' from the moon.
Did you ever care to sing your free love tune?
Ancient walls of flowers tumblin' down...
Ancient walls of flowers tumblin' down...
Ancient walls of whispers tumblin' down...
Ancient walls are tumblin' all over this town.
I call you
From the comet's cradle
I found you
Trembling by yourself
When the night falls
Lightly on your right-wing shoulder
Wonderful know-it-all
Slightly where the night gets colder
Oh, conscience,
Where will you carry me?
I found you
Star of terrifying effigies
When the night falls
I carry myself to the fortress
Of your glorious cost
Oh, I may seek your fortress
When the night falls
We see the star of wonder
Wonderful night falls
We see you
We see you
I see the stars coming down there
Coming down there to the yard
I see the stars coming down there
Coming down there to my heart
When can we do this again?
When can I see you again?
When can we do this again?
When can I see you again?
When can we do this again?
When can I see you again?
Switch on the sky and the stars glow for you
Go see the world 'cause it's all so brand new
Don't close your eyes 'cause your future's ready to shine
It's just a matter of time before we learn how to fly
Welcome to the rhythm of the night
There's something in the air you can't deny
It's been fun but now I've got to go
Life is way too short to take it slow
But before I go and hit the road
I gotta know, till then,
When can we do this again?
Oh oh oh oh
When can I see you again?
Oh oh oh oh
When can we do this again?
Oh oh oh oh
I gotta know, when can I see you again?
(When can I see you again?)
Joined at the hip, yeah your sidekick needs you
Life is a trip and the roadmap leads you
Look all around at the mountains you haven't climbed
It's just a matter of time before we learn how to fly
Welcome to the rhythm of the night
There's something in the air you can't deny
It's been fun but now I've got to go
Life is way too short to take it slow
But before I go and hit the road
I gotta know, till then,
When can we do this again?
Oh oh oh oh
When can I see you again?
Oh oh oh oh
When can we do this again?
Oh oh oh oh
I gotta know,
When can I see you again?
Don't close your eyes 'cause your future's ready to shine
It's just a matter of time, before we learn how to fly
Welcome to the rhythm of the night
There's something in the air you can't deny
So let me know before I wave goodbye
When can I see you again?
Oh oh oh oh
When can we do this again?
Oh oh oh oh
When can I see you again?
Oh oh oh oh
When can we do this again?
Oh oh oh oh
Yeah, it's been fun but now I've got to go
Life is way too short to take it slow
But before I go and hit the road
Tell me when
When can I see you again?
When can I see you again?
Tell me when
When can I see you again?
She's not quite like the
Conventional sister no she's not
I've never seen her frown
Or hold her head down
I've never heard her say
"I'm bored" or "get away"
I tip top topple over for my fun loving nun
'Cause she has so much fun has so much joy
And so much wonderful love for everyone
She's not like an ordinary person no she's not
She turns a lonely room into a happy place
Transforms a grumpy look into a smiling face
I tip top topple over for my fun loving nun
'Cause she has so much fun has so much joy
And so much wonderful love for everyone
Some of us get covered up by the world
Become bitter from our loneliness
And forget our dreams
But she takes notice of the beauty everywhere
And wherever she finds herself
She feels peaceful there
I tip top topple over for my fun loving nun
'Cause she has so much fun has so much joy
And so much wonderful love for everyone
Boy toy, sure needs to sing
'Cause it's hard to make out running away
And since there's no love, just love for the game
Carry ooh-eeh-ooh-eeh-ooh-eeh-ooh-eeh-ooh
No sense, slipping away, can you wait for me, love, I want you to stay
In my arms, in my head, in my eyes, in my heart
In my lungs, in my lungs, in my lungs, in my lungs
In my lungs, in my lungs, in my lungs, in my lungs
In my lungs, in my lungs, in my lungs, in my lungs
In my lungs, in my lungs, in my lungs, in my lungs
In my lungs, in my lungs, in my lungs, in my lungs
Boy toy, going on a hit
And the man in the sea's got a million-K
And since there's no love, just love for the game
Carry ooh-eeh-ooh-eeh-ooh-eeh-ooh-eeh-ooh
No sense, hiding away when you're already gone, I want you to stay
In my arms, in my head, in my eyes, in my heart
In my lungs, in my lungs, in my lungs, in my lungs
In my lungs, in my lungs, in my lungs, in my lungs
In my lungs, in my lungs, in my lungs, in my lungs
In my lungs, in my lungs, in my lungs, in my lungs
In my lungs, in my lungs, in my lungs, in my lungs
If that's a tear I see
If it's because of me
Then I may well have to
Tell you what I would do
But to play is easier than to set the groove
And to think is more simple than changing the mood
Is it more, is it less?
What's that thing on your chest?
Won't you whisper your blues as heartfelt as you can?
Meet me halfway
By the bedrock
On the tower
If I translate you wrong
When I complete your song
That would be my two feet
Stumbling ahead of me
I could tell you the tricks that I think hurt you best
About the house packed with people and their loneliness
But the hour is so late
Take some weight off your chest
Let's just pray for our fates and then give it a rest
Meet me halfway
By the bedrock
On the tower
Go get yourself up straight
I'll throw a melody
That is as serious as it is simple
On the tower
On the tower
On the tower
Meet me halfway
By the bedrock
On the tower
I've been talking to myself
Oh, I think I need your help
Oh, this love is make believe
Trapped inside a fantasy
And he came running out of the water
In the dead of the night he could see
As his shadow came towards her
She felt what she wanted to see
She whispered use me
What you touch you believe
It's a dangerous scene
When passion turns into greed
Cruel Sexuality
Am I a fool
To let you trouble me?
Cruel Sexuality
I don't even know myself
'Cause I'm becoming someone else
Where is rationality
When I'm lost inside a dream
I say just use me
When you chose to deceive
It's a dangerous scene
When passion turns into greed
Cruel Sexuality
Am I a fool
To let you trouble me?
Cruel Sexuality
Sexuality
Oh, you make me happy in my everyday life
Why must you keep me in your prison at night?
Oh, you make me happy in my everyday life
Why must you keep me, why must you keep me
Oh, you make me happy in my everyday life
Why must you keep me in your prison at night?
Oh, you make me happy in my everyday life
Why must you keep me, why must you keep me
Oh, you make me happy in my everyday life
Why must you keep me in your prison at night?
Oh, you make me happy in my everyday life
Why must you keep me, why must you keep me
Oh, you make me happy in my everyday life
Why must you keep me in your prison at night?
Oh, you make me happy in my everyday life
Why must you keep me, why must you keep me
(Cruel Sexuality)
Oh, you make me happy in my everyday life
Why must you keep me in your prison at night?

To let you trouble me?)
Oh, you make me happy in my everyday life
Why must you keep me in your prison at night?

Last night we had a rendez-vous
How d'you do? Comment allez-vous ?
We went to see a French movie
Mais qu'est-ce qu'il fait ? Mais qu'est-ce qu'il dit ?
You really got a hold on me
I wanna hear you say: oh oui !
Chérie, chérie, j'en rêve la nuit
Chérie, chérie, comment ça va ?
Quelle heure est-il ? Je ne sais pas !
We hang around dans ton quartier
Like walking down Champs-Élysées
You let me get in dans ton lit
Best place in Paris to be!
Chérie, chérie, j'en rêve la nuit
Chérie, chérie, comment ça va ?
Quelle heure est-il ? Je ne sais pas !
Then you said: Stop it! Ça suffit !
Won't let you get in dans ma vie
And anything I said or do
Wouldn't change your mind, non pas du tout
Chérie, chérie, comment ça va ?
Chérie, chérie, j'en rêve la nuit
Comment ça va ? Je ne sais pas !
Last night we had a rendez-vous
How d'you do ? Comment allez-vous ?
We went to see a French movie
Mais qu'est-ce qu'il fait ? Mais qu'est-ce qu'il dit ?
I put my hand dans ton panier
You were not celle que vous croyiez
You really got a hold on me
I wanna hear you say: oh oui !
Chérie, chérie, j'en rêve la nuit
Chérie, chérie, comment ça va ?
Quelle heure est il ? Je ne sais pas !
I've been trapped by love
Bonsoir Jacqueline, bonsoir à toutes et à tous. Pour toutes les zones de la mer du Nord et de la Manche...
People tell me to be cautious
People tell me not to lose my self control
People tell me to be flawless
People tell me not to let myself evolve
And I think I don't really get it
I think it's all just a peculiar game
And soon I'll wake up and I'll forget it
And everyone will know me by a different name
I wanted to be stronger
I wanted to be everything for you
If I could be stronger would you believe
That I could love you like you want me to?
Love me like you want me to
Like you want me to
Love me like you want me to
Like you want me to
I held my breath every time
I tried to keep myself dry
But did I ask too much?
If I could do it again
Would you believe what I said
That I still won that rush
And I think I don't really get it
I think it's all just a peculiar game
And soon I'll wake up and I'll forget it
And everyone will know me by a different name
I wanted to be stronger
I wanted to be everything for you
If I could be stronger would you believe
That I could love you like you want me to?
I want to be strong for you
(Love me like you want me to, like you want me to)
I want be strong for you
(Love me like you want me to)
I want be strong for you
And I can, yes I can
If only you could promise that you will try too
I'll be there, I'll be there
I want to be strong for you
If only you could promise that you will try too
I'll be there, I'll be there
I wanted to be stronger
I wanted to be everything for you
If I could be stronger would you believe
That I could love you like you want me to?
I wanted to be stronger
I wanted to be everything for you
If I could be stronger would you believe
That I could love you like you want me to?
Love me like you want me to
Like you want me to
Love me like you want me to
Like you want me to
Sometimes I feel like I can't move on, nothing in life is turning me on
But I still see clearly when I see you smiling
You know nothing seems to fit, I couldn't see my way through the shit
When every single second of my waking day
Was thinking of you, thinking of you, you never know
That I am alive, I am alive, I wanna grow
There are so many things I can do, just like falling in love with you
Take my hand now, understand me, you can come here too
C'mon people, we're making it now, yeah, yeah, yeah
But today I worked it out, I got something I can shout about
Someone who believes in all the things I'm thinking
But where have you gone, where have you gone, I'll never know
And I am alive, I am alive, I wanna grow
There are so many things I can do just like falling in love with you
Take my hand now, understand me, you can come here too
C'mon people, we're making it now, yeah, yeah, yeah
C'mon people, we're making it now, yeah, yeah, yeah
C'mon people we're making it now if only you could be with us, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, I feel fine now, oh, oh, oh, oh, I feel fine now
Don't stop now, no no no (oh, oh, oh, oh, I feel fine now)
Don't stop now, no no no (oh, oh, oh, oh, I feel fine now)
Don't stop now, no no no (oh, oh, oh, oh, I feel fine now)
Don't stop now, no no no (oh, oh, oh, oh, I feel fine now)
Don't stop now, no no no (oh, oh, oh, oh, I feel fine now)
No no no, no no no, no no no, no no no
Just look through your window, look who sits outside
Little me is waiting, standing through the night
When you walk out through your door, I'll wave my flag and shout
Oh, beautiful baby
My burning desire started on Sunday
Give me your heart and I'll love you till Tuesday
Da da da dum
Da da da dum
Da da da dum
Da da da dum
Who's that hiding in the apple tree, clinging to a branch
Don't be afraid, it's only me, hoping for a little romance
If you lie beneath my shade, I'll keep you nice and cool
Oh, beautiful baby
I was very lonely till I met you on Sunday
My passion's never-ending and I'll love you till Tuesday
Da da da dum
Da da da dum
Da da da dum
Da da da dum
Da da da dum
Da da da dum
Da da da dum
Let the wind blow through your hair, be nice to the big blue sea
Don't be afraid of the man in the moon, because it's only me
I shall always want you until my love runs dry
Oh, beautiful baby
My heart's aflame, I'll love you till Tuesday
My head's in a whirl and I'll love you till Tuesday
Love, love, love, love you till Tuesday
Love, love, love, love you till Tuesday
Da da da dum
Da da da dum
Da da da dum
Da da da dum

Well, I might be able to stretch it till Wednesday
Well I don't know what I'm looking for
But I know that I just wanna look some more
And I won't be satisfied
Till there's nothing left that I haven't tried
For some people it's an easy choice
But for me there's a devil and an angel's voice
Well I don't know what I am looking for
But I know that I just wanna look some more
Well I don't know what I'm living for
But I know that I just wanna live some more
And you hear it from strangers
And you hear it from friends
That love never dies, love never ends
Now I don't wanna argue, no I don't wanna fight
'Cause you're always wrong and I'm always right
Well I don't know what I am living for
But I know that I just wanna live some more
I used to be involved, and I felt like a king
Now I've lost it all and I don't feel a thing
I may never grow old, I may never give in
And I'll blame this world that I live in
I visit hell on a daily basis
I see the sadness in all your faces
I've got friends who have married
And their lives seem complete
Here I am still stumbling down a darkened street
And I act like a child and I'm insecure
And I'm filled with doubt and I'm immature
Sometimes it creeps up on me and before I know it
I'm lost at sea
But no matter how far I row
I always find my way back home
But I don't know what I've been waiting for
But I know that I don't wanna wait anymore
Looking for...
What I'm looking for...
Looking for...
What I'm looking for...
Looking for...
What I'm looking for...
Looking for...
What I'm looking for...
Looking for...
Blood, blood, blood; blood and fire
Blood, blood, blood; blood and fire
There is no more water to stop the fire

Let it burn, let it burn
Let it burn, burn burn
Blood, blood, blood; blood and fire
Blood, blood, blood; blood and fire
I say
Blood, blood, blood; blood and fire
Blood, blood, blood; blood and fire

I promised you the world again
Everything within my hands
All the riches one could dream
They will come from me
I hoped that you could understand
That this is not what I had planned
Please don't worry now
It will turn around
'Cause I need more time
Just a few more months and we'll be fine
So say what's on your mind
'Cause I can't figure out just what's inside
I hoped that you could understand
That this is not what I had planned
Please don't worry now
It will turn around
'Cause I need more time
Just a few more months and we'll be fine
So say what's on your mind
'Cause I can't figure out just what's inside
So say all right
'Cause I know we can make it if we try
'Cause I need more time
Just a few more months and we'll be fine
We're off to new lands
So hold on to my hands
It's gonna be all right
It's a whole lot brighter
So stand by the fire
It's gonna be all right
Yeah, the road gets harder
But it's not much farther
It's gonna be all right
You know that it ain't easy
Please believe me
It's gonna be all right
Please don't worry now
It will turn around
'Cause I need more time
Just a few more months and we'll be fine
So say what's on your mind
'Cause I can't figure out just what's inside
So say all right
'Cause I know we can make it if we try
'Cause I need more time
Just a few more months and we'll be fine
Your Uncle Walter's going on and on
Bout everything he's seen and done
The voice of 50 years experience
Drunk, watching the television
You know he's been around the world
Last night he flew to Baghdad
In his magical armchair
Cigarettes and a six pack, he just got back
Now the spit's flying everywhere
Hey, hey, hey, hey (Your Uncle Walter's going on and on)
You're back so late (Where did you go that you were gone so long)
How could you leave me here so long
With Uncle Walter
Your Uncle Walter saw who fired the shots
He drove his chair in the cavalcade
He's flown from South Africa
To countries where
They beat themselves on the backs with chains
There was a fleet of battleships
And 1 reclining chair
Headed north on the Arabian sea
Now he's back and he'll tell us what
He and his oldest boy Blair
Are getting rich with their mail order scheme
Oh, oh, oh, oh
We're glad you're home
But how could you leave me here so long
With Uncle Walter
Your Uncle Walter told me
Everything he'd do if he was president
Oh what a perfect world
This world would be
If he were President now
But he's not
And he sees the children
Smoking pot
He knows that in a moment
They'll be shooting up heroin
Teardrops in his armchair
A 50 minute lecture
And tobacco juice rolling down his chin
Hey, hey, hey, hey
You're back so late
How could you leave me here so long
With Uncle Walter
Imagine if the life that you thought you shared wasn't really there
It was made up in your mind, could be anyone, anywhere
'Cause you'd be living in a world of your own design, undermined
In another place, other space and time
As the dust clears and it all starts to disappear
It may get harder, cause you just restarted
And wherever you are, land on another star
It may get harder, cause you just restarted
You better get real, real, real and realise that the situation is going nowhere
Because you act so tough, I totally lost control
So please try to understand that if I could, I'd call and I would be there
And if I didn't hurt so much, you know I'd give you it all
You know I'd give you it all
Imagine if the friend that you thought you knew wasn't really true
It just existed in your head, the reflection used wasn't you
Completely unaware, could be anywhere, anytime
Cause there was a shift in the paradigm
As the dust clears and it all starts to disappear
It may get harder, cause you just restarted
And wherever you are, land on another star
It may get harder, cause you just restarted
You better get real, real, real and realise that the situation is going nowhere
Because you act so tough, I totally lost control
So please, try to understand that if I could, I'd call and I would be there
And if I didn't hurt so much, you know I'd give you it all
You know I'd give you it all
It may get harder, cause you just restarted
It may get harder, cause you just restarted
Shake shake shimmy
You know that you soothe the aches
And the troubles within me
Pretending that everythings cool
When I'm twenty seven shades of blue
And my lips are unhappy without you
My lips are unhappy without you
Honey suckle, you're missing
But I make the morning dew glisten
By just hoping and wishing
Pretending that I've got a clue
When I'm twenty seven shades of blue
And my lips are unhappy without you
My lips are unhappy without you
My lips are unhappy without you
Shake shimmy shimmy
Shake shimmy shimmy
Shake shimmy shimmy
Shake shimmy shake shimmy shimmy
Shake shake shimmy shimmy
Shake shimmy shimmy
Shake shimmy shimmy
Shake shake shimmy shimmy
Shake shimmy shimmy

Shake shimmy shimmy
Shake shake shimmy shimmy!
Shake shimmy shimmy
Shake shimmy shimmy
Shake shimmy shimmy
Shake shake shimmy without you
My lips are unhappy without you
My lips are unhappy without you
My lips are unhappy without you
My lips are unhappy without you
Ladies and gentlemen, this is Mambo Number 5.
One, two, three, four, five
Everybody in the car, so come on let's ride
To the liquor store around the corner
The boys say they want some gin and juice
But I really don't wanna
Beer bust, like I had last week
I must stay deep, 'cause talk is cheap
I like Angela, Pamela, Sandra and Rita
And as I continue you know they're getting sweeter
So what can I do? I really beg you, my Lord
To me flirting is just like a sport
Anything fly, it's all good, let me dump it
Please set in the trumpet
A little bit of Monica in my life
A little bit of Erica by my side
A little bit of Rita is all I need
A little bit of Tina is what I see
A little bit of Sandra in the sun
A little bit of Mary all night long
A little bit of Jessica, here I am
A little bit of you makes me your man
Mambo Number 5!
Jump up and down and move it all around
Shake your head to the sound
Put your hands on the ground
Take one step left and one step right
One to the front and one to the side
Clap your hands once and clap your hands twice
And if it looks like this, then you're doing it right
A little bit of Monica in my life
A little bit of Erica by my side
A little bit of Rita is all I need
A little bit of Tina is what I see
A little bit of Sandra in the sun
A little bit of Mary all night long
A little bit of Jessica, here I am
A little bit of you makes me your man
Trumpet!
The trumpet!
Mambo Number 5!
Ha ha ha!
A little bit of Monica in my life
A little bit of Erica by my side
A little bit of Rita is all I need
A little bit of Tina is what I see
A little bit of Sandra in the sun
A little bit of Mary all night long
A little bit of Jessica, here I am
A little bit of you makes me your man
I do all to
Fall in love with a girl like you
'Cause you can't run and you can't hide
You and me gonna touch the sky
Mambo Number 5!
I, I saw a girl in my dreams,
And so it seems
That I will love her.
Oh, you, you are that girl in my dreams,
And so it seems
That I will love you.
And I, I, I, I, I,
Waited for your kiss,
Waited for the bliss,
Like dreamers do.
And I-I-I-I-I-I-I
Oh, I'll be there, yeah,
Waiting for you, you, you, you, you, you,
You came just one dream ago,
And now I know
That I will love you.
I knew when you first said hello,
That's how I know
That I will love you.
And I, I, I, I,
Waited for your kiss,
Waited for the bliss,
Like dreamers do.
And I-I-I-I-I-I-I
Oh, I'll be there, yeah,
Waiting for you, you, you, you, you, you,
You came just one dream ago,
And now I know
That I will love you.

And I, I, I, I,
Waited for your kiss,
Waited for the bliss,
Like dreamers do.
Oh, like dreamers do,
Like dreamers do.
Everything ends
The way it begins.
God takes care
Of the little things.

When I'm in a crowd
Or on an island by myself
Silent or too loud
Wishing I was somewhere else
And I can't believe
You hit me fast and hard
When you turn to me and say
Never change the way you are
Trying to catch your eye
Things will never look the same
Now I can't deny
You're the moth and I'm the flame
There I go again
I should walk before I run
How can I explain
I can't stop what you've begun
I'm
Falling through the door
Flying 'cross the floor
When you look at me
Suddenly it's clear
You're
Burning out my dreams
Crazy as it seems
I don't wanna be
Anywhere but here
Anywhere but here
What goes on inside
Is a mystery no doubt
A roller coaster ride
I may never work it out
Here's the brand new me
Skates around and floats on air
I'm a sight to see
Rainbow colors in my hair
You have set me free
The one who gets me there
I'm
Falling through the door
Flying 'cross the floor
When you look at me
Suddenly it's clear
You're
Burning out my dreams
Crazy as it seems
I don't wanna be
Anywhere but here
Anywhere but here
Here is the place where
My head is spinning
Time is beginning
To race away
You come to throw me
Knock me off my feet
You give me wings to fly
The world goes crashing by
Again
I'm
Falling through the door
Flying 'cross the floor
When you look at me
Suddenly it's clear
You're
Burning out my dreams
Crazy as it seems
I don't wanna be
Anywhere but here
Anywhere but here

I'm playing like shakin' under the coconut tree
Beat beat of the song song

Now listen to the beat
Kingdoms and queens they all bow down to you
Ranches and ranch hands are bowing too
And I'm takin' off my straw hat for you, sinkin'
Here comes the sun again
And the leaves on the trees they all call out your name
Chrome on the freight line shines the same
And the stars in their cars roll their tops down for you, singin'
Here comes the sun again
Oh but if you're gonna stay
Show some mercy today
Blow that breeze on my face
Snow banks and drifts down the hillside for you
Slides inside sandy river before the day is through
And before evenin' falls I may find myself there too, singin'
Here comes the sun again
Here comes the sun again
I get up early when the sleeping pill wakes me
I take a wake up pill and fill with energy
I power on hard and I check my messages
But I don't have any messages
I take a driving pill and head to my car
I drive around a bit 'cause work isn't very far
I call my phone and I check my messages
But I don't have any messages
All I know is driving on drugs feels better when they're prescription
All I know is the world looks beautiful, the world looks so damn beautiful
And I feel fantastic
And I never felt as good as how I do right now
Except for maybe when I think of how I felt that day
When I felt the way that I do right now, right now.
I feel fantastic
And I never felt as good as how I do right now
Except for maybe when I think of how I felt that day
When I felt the way that I do right now, right now, right now.
Work is anything but quiet these days
I try to medicate my concentration haze
I can see the day unfold in front of me
So I take the stairs and hit the gym
The phone is ringing when I get to my desk
What was a stinging's now a sharp pain in my chest
So I take a Calminex and just chill
And then it's time for lunch again
All I know is work is easy when you don't stress out about deadlines
All I know is to take my medicine I always take my medicine
And I feel fantastic
And I never felt as good as how I do right now
Except for maybe when I think of how I felt that day
When I felt the way that I do right now, right now.
I feel fantastic
And I never felt as good as how I do right now
Except for maybe when I think of how I felt that day
When I felt the way that I do right now, right now, right now.
Sometimes I'd like to slow things down
Enjoy the moment
But when I look the moment's gone
Work is over but I can't stay to work late
Got to leave and get ready for my second date
With a pretty girl that I met at the pharmacy
Right in the prescription line
I take a pill for my social anxiety
I get a table and a nice bottle of Chablis
Now it's getting late and there's still no sign of her
I have another glass of wine
All I know is the wine lasts longer when you don't gotta share it with someone
All I know is my steak tastes better when I take my steak tastes better pill
And I feel fantastic
And I never felt as good as how I do right now
Except for maybe when I think of how I felt that day
When I felt the way that I do right now, right now.
I feel fantastic
And I never felt as good as how I do right now
Except for maybe when I think of how I felt that day
When I felt the way that I do right now, right now, right now.
When you're bored and you need a kick
When you're hot and your fingers itch
Don't wanna go to work again ever no more, boy
Every night when I'm on the prowl
My brain is burning then I want it all
Don't ever want to pay for anything anymore, boy
Just grab it 'cause it's yours and the empire's dying
Just grab the stuff and hit the door
And you'll be high on the crime, high on the crime
Come on
So come on, come on
Grab your booty and you're on the run
Come on, come on
Get your buzz on and the heat is on
All you guards that I got out past
Tell your boss he can invoice my ass
The speed slow me down but I'm still smartest in my class, boy
(Whatever)
When your mommy is to cold to buy your pills
And your daddy ain't around to pay your bills
I've been hungry but not enough to kill, boy
Just grab it 'cause it's yours and the empire's dying
Just grab the stuff and hit the door
And you'll be high on the crime, high on the crime
Come on
So come on, come on
Grab your booty and you're on the run
Come on, come on
Get your buzz on and the heat is on
So come, on come on
Grab your booty and you're on the run
Come on, come on
Quick you dirty rat shake your buns

Wake up in tha mornin' and it's hard to live
Hard to live yes it's hard to live
And it will be a long time before shit
Starts to give, every single day
It's getting harder to give
But I would be up for being down with a ho
Lord knows that I got mic control
Do you got mic control?
You notice your stylee is well original
This man, makin' money,
How I know.
It wont be no man of me.
In my bed I watch TV
I'm drunk by noon,
But that's O.K.
I'll be president someday.
Light my cigarette and
I think how Bert Susanka made me drink.
Load the box and then pump that shit.
Got my Greatest... Hits.
Got my Greatest... Hits
Is this band makin' money, I don't know
The writin's on the wall
All my friends drink alcohol
I'm too drunk to light the bong
I'm too stoned to write this song
Light my cigarette and
I think how burt sunzanka made me drink
Load the box and ill pump that shit
Wake up in tha mornin' and it's hard to live
Hard to live, yes, it's hard to live
And it will be a long time before shit starts to give
And every single day it getting harder to give
But I would be up for being down with a ho,
Lord knows that I got mic control
Do you got mic control?
You notice your stylee is well original
This man makin' money, how I know
It wont be no man of me.
In my bed I watch TV I'm drunk by noon,
But that's O.K. I'll be president someday.
Light my cigarette and
I think that Bert Susanka made me drink.
Load the box and then pump that shit.

Safety dance!
We can dance if we want to
We can leave your friends behind
'Cause your friends don't dance
And if they don't dance
Well, they're no friends of mine
I say, we can go where we want to
A place where they will never find
And we can act like we come from out of this world
Leave the real one far behind
And we can dance (Come see!)
We can dance if we want to
We can leave your friends behind
'Cause your friends don't dance
And if they don't dance
Well, they're no friends of mine
I say, we can go where we want to
A place where they will never find
And we can act like we come from out of this world
Leave the real one far behind
And we can dance
(We can dance, we can dance, everything's out of control)
(We can dance, we can dance, we're doing it from wall to wall)
We can go when we want to
The night is young and so am I
And we can dress real neat
From our hats to our feet
And surprise 'em with a victory cry
I say, we can act if we want to
If we don't, nobody will
And we can act real rude
And totally removed
And I can act like an imbecile
I say, we can dance, we can dance, everything's out of control (Out of control!)
We can dance, we can dance, we're doing it from wall to wall (Wall to wall!)
We can dance, we can dance, everybody look at your hands (Look at your hands, yeah...)
We can dance, we can dance, everybody's takin' the chance
It's safety dance
Well, it's safety dance
Yeah, it's safety dance
We can dance if we want to
We've got all your life and mine
As long as we abuse it
Never gonna lose it
Everything'll work out right
I say, we can dance if we want to
We can leave your friends behind
'Cause your friends don't dance
And if they don't dance
Well, they're are no friends of mine
I say, we can dance, we can dance, everything's out of control (Out of control!)
We can dance, we can dance, we're doing it from wall to wall (Wall to wall!)
We can dance, we can dance, everybody look at your hands (Out of control!)

Oh yes, safety dance
Oh well, it's safety dance
Oh, it's safety dance
Oh, it's safety dance
It's safety dance
It's safety dance
It's safety dance!
I've got a key
And a piece of paper in my pocket deep
In my pocket piece of paper and a key
As I wander through the street
War is there a war
Or is there isn't a war anymore?
Somebody told me that nothing is for sure
Can you hear the ocean roar
On each street is a tree
In the distance the desert sleeps
Sometimes a sigh is a song
And a breath is a melody
Oceans rise and oceans fall
So just what does tomorrow mean?
I give smile a give a song
For one moment's eternity
Oh but it's some mob
Some mob that brought me here I know it is my job
To seek my fortune Nanna thank you for this mob
Remember you now you are gone
If I went away
Tropical island somewhere sunny every day
But everyone I ever cared about remained
Would I tan or would I fade?
So every morning he wake
Spend his day at the daybreak
And every spoonful he take
Be of something his own make
Oceans rise and oceans fall
So just what does forever mean?
I give a smile I give a song
For one moment's eternity
Propped up at the pulpit
A speech to please the poles
With Coca-Cola trickling down my throat
Well would you save all of your bottles if I promised a refund?
It's gonna come I swear I swear I swear I swear that it is
If you've got a special interest
There is influence I could sell
Just like water takes the shape of where it's held
I'm overflowing with ambition, but I got to keep in mind
The bottom line... is the dollar signs
And big bright lights: INEQUALITY FRANCHISED
The next location is mine
We're gonna lower costs
It's a work of art: our giant golden arch
I'm gonna start a factory the size of a country
I'm gonna teach them all to work for liberty
Oh but I'm not one for handouts, no they got to pay their dues:
They can make our shoes
And then we'll walk on you
Always on the move-we heard that business will boom if some people are removed
I know there's all-body types but we have just one size
I don't care if its right
It's the dollar signs!
And the big bright lights: INEQUALITY FRANCHISED
Every location is mine
You just do your part, form a line lets march under the golden arch...
March! March! March! march!
One of us
Won't last the night
Between you and me, it's no surprise
There's two of us,
Both can't be right
Neither will move till it's over
I'm the center of attention in the walls inside my head
And no one will ever know it if I keep my mouth shut tight
My own little world is what I deserve
'Cause I am the only child there is
I'm king of it all, the belle of the ball
I promise I've always been like this
Forever the first, my bubble can't burst
It's almost like only I exist
Where everything's fine, if I can keep my mouth shut tight... tight... tight
All by myself, I'm so much better on my own
And way out there, it is the same old place that it always has been
I'm the center of attention in the walls inside my head
And no one will ever know it if I keep my mouth shut tight... tight... tight
My own little world is what I deserve
'Cause I am the only child there is
I'm king of it all, the belle of the ball
I promise I've always been like this
Forever the first, my bubble can't burst
It's almost like only I exist
Where everything's fine, if I can keep my mouth shut tight... tight... tight
One of us
Won't last the night
Between you and me, it's no surprise
There's two of us,
Both can't be right
Neither will move till it's over
I'm the center of attention in the walls inside my head
And no one will ever know it if I keep my mouth shut tight
Yeah, no one will ever notice if I keep my mouth shut tight... tight... tight
My own little world is what I deserve
'Cause I am the only child there is
I'm king of it all, the belle of the ball
I promise I've always been like this
Forever the first, my bubble can't burst
It's almost like only I exist
Where everything's fine, if I can keep my mouth shut tight... tight... tight
All poison and thrills
A handful of pills
Waiting around nails cut to the quick
Broke what you fixed you're so underground
What you waiting for?
What you waiting for?
It's said and done
But it's too late to turn your age around she's no the one you want
One settles a score with a trip to the floor look what we've found
Make sense of the scene
Keep a routine?
Standing on sound
What you waiting for?
What you waiting for?
It's said and done
But it's too late to turn your age around she's not the one you want
Yeah it's too late to turn your age around she's not the one you want
How do you do it?
With your back against the wall
How do you ruin all these promises?
Promises and nothing else done.
What you waiting for?
What you waiting for?
It's said and done.
But it's too late to turn your age around she's not the one you want
So tell me something That I didn't know.
Well I wish I had a parachute
'Cause I'm falling bad for you
I can see the ground approaching now
But I'm not sure what to do
I feel like the piñata
Won't you take a swing at me?
If you could just crack the shell open
I think inside you would find something sweet
Well I hear you like a hunter now
Your footsteps in the leaves
And I would gladly leave my hiding place
Yes I'm hoping to be seen
So let your arrow fly and sing
I'm well within your aim
Lay your traps for a thousand miles
And please don't let me escape
Winter came to Omaha
It left us looking like a bride
A million perfect snowflakes now
And no two are alike
So it's hard for me imagining
The flaws in this design
I know debris, it covers everything
But still I am in love with this life
You don't know what's right anymore
You think your love is just a score
Are you too young or afraid to grow up?
You can work this out if you both try
It's hard to cheat but harder to lie
Is this what you want or just a passing thought?
Maybe you should think about it
Before you go and break her heart
Maybe you need more time to decide
Ask yourself "what for?
What for, what for, what for?"
You painted a picture she wanted to see
You can laugh this one off but it's not funny
She's given you everything she has
Oh oh
Maybe you should think about it
Before you go and break her heart
Maybe you need more time to decide
Ask yourself, "what for?
What for, what for, what for?"
You wanted her and you got her
But you're still so careless with your words
If you let her go, she'll move on
Find someone, she's never coming back
How can you live with that?
Maybe you should think about it
Before you go and break her heart
Maybe you need more time to decide
So you should think about it some more
Ask yourself, "what for?"
(I know it sounds like the same old line)
What for?
(I know it seems like the same old guy)
What for?
(Maybe I don't know how to treat you right)
What for?
(Maybe you'll meet someone to know your life)
What for?
(You said I lied since the day we met)
What for?
(But I meant every word I said)
What for?
(Someday you'll miss every single day we spent)
What for?
Well the first time that I went out on my own
I was a young man almost 17 right down to the day
Well I packed up all my things
Grabbed my bag and kissed my mother
And I told her that I'd be back someday
So I jumped into the back of and eighteen-wheeler head north
Destination didn't even ask
With the wisdom that my father gave me
Ringing in my head so clearly
"Son this world's gonna kick you in the ass"
I wanna go there and I'm not scared
Our time's just begun, oh yeah
Life goes by so damn quickly for me
Wanna have some fun
Now looking back on all the days gone by
I sit and wonder what it would be like if I'd never went away
Would I see the world the way I do
The memories that brought me to
This place that I now call my home today
I wanna go there and I'm not scared
Our time's just begun, oh yeah
Life goes by so damn quickly for me
Wanna have some fun
Life goes by so damn quickly for me
Wanna have some fun
So beat my head (beat my head)
When I feel the whole world falls apart
In the end I'll be all right
Well the first time that I went out on my own
I was a young man almost 17 right down to the day
Well I packed up all my things
Grabbed my bag and kissed my mother
And I told her that I'd be back someday
I wanna go there and I'm not scared
Our time's just begun, oh yeah
Life goes by so damn quickly for me
Wanna have some fun
Life goes by so damn quickly for me
Wanna have some fun
You're out with your friends
And it's feelin' like old times
Standin' in line in the front of the club
You're drivin' around town
Blasting your mixes
Singin' along to the words you don't know
But it makes no difference
What I do, think, or say
There's no way to convince you, girls
That just ain't how you play
You set me up with your girlfriends
But none of them worked out for me
I'm startin' to realize lately
I should've been after you
I should've been after you
I can tell by your shakin' hands that you want me
So baby don't hold back, go with the flow
I know it looks bad 'cause I kissed all your girlfriends
But that's what you get when you live in a small world
It's hard to look at me
When you know where my lips have been
Forgetting makes things easier
Forgive me and let me in
You set me up with your girlfriends
But none of them worked out for me
I'm startin' to realize lately
I should've been after you
I should've been after you
You're gonna have to choose
Is it me or them?
That's the way it goes
Leave it all behind
All the baggage and dreams
I liked you from the start
I'll admit it now
Girl, I gotta have you
We don't have to tell anyone about our
Little secret
I know you feel it too
'Cause you're the only one who understands
You're wastin' all your time with someone else
You need another man
I could've been after you
But it makes no difference
What I do, think, or say
There's no way to convince you, girls
That just ain't how you play
You set me up with your girlfriends
But none of them worked out for me
I'm startin' to realize lately
I should've been after you
But after last night we're through
Run along with your new boy
Don't be a sex toy
I could've been after you
I took this girl out last night and we left around twelve
We walked along lonely streets and got to know ourselves
I like to read, she likes to write
She likes to sleep and I love to stay up all night
My friends say I'm crazy, and I agree.
But that's OK, that the way I like to be.
Hey girl come with me and let yourself go
Hey girl come with me and let yourself go
We went out late last night and we danced through the night.
I was holding on to her and she was gripping me tight, she was.
But she didn't care, and I didn't mind.
I was unaware that she liked to act so kind.
My friends say I'm crazy and I agree
That's OK, that's the way I like to be
Hey girl come with me and let yourself go
Hey girl come with me and let yourself go
Just let yourself go
Hush little baby don't say a word
I'd like to give you everything that you deserve.
I'll give you my heart, give you all my soul.
You can ask for my money. If you like you can have control.
In my mind, I miss you every night that you're not here.
Oh, I just want to sit around your life and breathe your air.
And if I cannot have you, I just don't want to live.
Oh I got so much I'd like to give.
Hey girl come with me and let yourself go
Hey girl come with me and let yourself go
Just let yourself go
My baby, my darling
Just let yourself go
My baby, my darling
I need to know
My sweetie, my lovely
I'd love to let you go
But I'm coming back for you, and I'm walking through your door.
Seven stars in the sky, in the sky
You're feeling sociable
Silver stars in your eyes, in your eye
You feel emotional
And you don't even know my name
And I know every constellation
Simple lives we once left behind
We're so distracted now
Secret lives we have lived inside
We're going backwards now
And you don't even know my name
And I know every constellation
So you know the rhyme, so you know the rhyme
Do you know the reasons, did you wonder why?
So you know the time, so you know the time
Did you know the seasons in your mind?
Going backwards now
Silver scars in your hand, in your hand
I know it's seasonal
Several times I have heard your demand
You're so unreasonable
And you don't even know my name
And I know every constellation
So you know the rhyme, so you know the rhyme
Do you know the reasons, did you wonder why?
So you know the time, so you know the time
Did you know the seasons in your mind?
No, you don't even know my name
And i know every constellation
So you know the rhyme, so you know the rhyme
Do you know the reasons, did you wonder why?
So you know the time, so you know the time
Do you know the seasons in your mind?
So you know the rhyme, so you know the rhyme
Do you know the reasons, did you wonder why?
So you know the time, so you know the time
Do you know the seasons in your mind?
Going backwards now
She's looking beautiful, totally beautiful
You know what I mean
She's looking excellent, totally excellent
All the girls turn green
And she goes down, down, down on Marie
And she goes down, down, down on Marie
She smokes a cigarette, yeah smokes a cigarette
That fag I long to be
She hits the dancefloor, she LIGHTS up the dancefloor with glow-sticks and
Ecstasy
And she goes down, down, down on Marie
Yeah she goes down, down, down on Marie
She's been with every girl in town (she's been with every girl in town)
But not with me!
Been caught without her knickers on (been caught without her knickers on)
But still, you know, I'd long to get some!
Marie is delectable, just turned bisexual, I heard she's into me
A text message she sent to me and her girlfriend, inviting us round for tea
Then she goes down, down, down on Marie
Then she goes down, down, down on Marie
Imagine the rest, I was put to the test
And we made a lovely three
Marie was exciting, you could say inviting and they both took turns with me
Then we went down, down, down on Marie
Yeah we went down, down, down on Marie

We are the kings and the queens of the new broken scene
Yeah, we're alright though

Every night I see you standing on the corner
Shaking that thang like you're playing pop warner
Touchdown turnaround play by play keep the score
Would you turn me down if I'm not what you're looking for
I never knew you (don't give up on me)
I never knew you (don't give up on me)
I never knew you (don't give up on me)
I never knew you
Threw so hard
Touchdown turnaround I never see you around
Anywhere anymore you are what I'm looking for
Touchdown turnaround everything is safe and sound
Everywhere and every time I am yours and you are mine
Little league '93 taught me how to take defeat
Good thing there's no mercy rule in love 'cause I would long be beat
Hit the ground look around but you're nowhere to be found
Accept my loss and head back to the mound

Well c'mon everybody and let's get together tonight
I got some money in my jeans
And I'm really gonna spend it right
Well I've been doin' my homework all week long
Now the house is empty and my folks are gone
Ooh! C'mon everybody
Oh well, my baby's number one
But I'm gonna dance with three or four
And the house will be shakin' from the bare feet
A-slappin' on the floor
Well when you hear the music and you can't sit still
If your brother won't rock, then your sister will
Ooh! C'mon everybody
Oh well, we really gonna party
But we gotta put a guard outside
If the folks come home
I'm afraid, they're gonna have my hide
There'll be no more movies for a week or two
No more runnin' 'round with the usual crew-who cares?
C'mon everybody
When we came inside
You asked me if I'm well
Living like this
It gets you through the night
Sure you can, Mr. Bet's on the prowl again
It gets you through the night
That at least tells the rest of the drawing, king
It gets you through the night
Sure you can, Mr. Bet's on the prowl again
It gets you through the night
As we're doting along
Come out to the west backsides of my eyes
True that's true that's true
You're selling what you own, selling yourself short
Of the life that's teeming in the dirt
Stop selling what you know, suddenly you're so sure
Of the life that's breeding in the dirt
Come out to the west backsides of my eyes 
True that's true that's true
I'm off to the west, it's blinding my eyes
True that's true that's true
Come out to the west backsides of my eyes
You opened up
This is the kind of place I know
Let's add up all the mischief and mercy ruins
'Cause these walls have all worn white
She's pushing 5 6
In her saucony kicks
She got lips like a sofa
And she's strung out on soda
And the devil was a girl
And she wore a yellow tee
It would be a spitting image
But it's ok with me
She says
I got something I think I really wanna tell ya
I got something I think I really wanna show ya
I got something I think I really wanna do right now
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
She bought a 7 inch
It was pressed on white
It was randy described... eternity
It's the flip of her hair
It's the sound of her verbs
It's the shape of her legs
It's the way that she curses
She says
I got something I think I really wanna tell ya
I got something I think I really wanna show ya
I got something I think I really wanna do right now
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
She says
I got something I think I really wanna tell ya
I got something I think I really wanna show ya
I got something I think I really wanna do right now
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
I got something I think I really wanna tell ya
I got something I think I really wanna show ya
I got something I think I really wanna do right now
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
I live in the middle of a combat zone
And I'm too scared to pick up the phone
I went to the market to fill up my heart

This ain't fair (uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh)
I ain't scared (uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh)

Now I'm in a movie seen as a star

Did you think that I've been foolin' around
As I'm wanderin' from town to town
Asking you to wait, wait for me
Don't you know you can't believe all that you've heard
I know it's rough when all you have is my word
Asking you to wait, wait for me
But I've been waiting, I've been waiting, I've been waiting, yeah
I've been waiting, I've been waiting, wanna know if you'll wait for me too
I wanna know if you'll
Wait for me, wait for me
Wait for me, wait for me
Wait for me, wait for me, wait for me
We both know I won't be standing still
But to have your love is such a thrill
That's why I'm asking you to wait, wait for me
Without you by my side I just can't sleep
That's why I'm up all night counting sheep
Hoping and praying you'll wait for me
But I've been waiting, I've been waiting, I've been waiting, yeah
I've been waiting, I've been waiting, wanna know if you'll wait for me too
I wanna know if you'll
Wait for me, wait for me
Wait for me, wait for me
Wait for me, wait for me, wait for me
Wait for me, wait for me
Wait for me, wait for me
Wait for me, wait for me, wait for me
'Cause I've been waiting, I've been waiting, I've been waiting, yeah
I've been waiting, I've been waiting, I've been waiting, yeah
I've been waiting, I've been waiting, I've been waiting, yeah
I've been waiting, I've been waiting, wanna know if you'll wait for me too
I wanna know if you'll
Wait for me
Pale, pubescent beasts
Roam through the streets
And coffee-shops
Their prey gather in herds
Of stiff knee-length skirts
And white ankle-socks
But while they search for a mate
My type hibernate
In bedrooms above
Composing their songs of love
Young, uniform minds
In uniform lines
And uniform ties
Run round with trousers on fire
And signs of desire
They cannot disguise
While I try to find words
As light as the birds
That circle above
To put in my songs of love
Fate doesn't hang on a wrong or right choice
Fortune depends on the tone of your voice
So sing while you have time
Let the sun shine down from above
And fill you with songs of love
Fate doesn't hang on a wrong or right choice
Fortune depends on the tone of your voice
So sing while you still can
While the sun hangs high up above
Wonderful songs of love
Beautiful songs of love
Beautiful songs of love
Beautiful songs of love
Eu já lavei o meu carro, regulei o som
Já tá tudo preparado, vem que o brega é bom
Menina fica a vontade, entre e faça a festa
Me liga mais tarde, vou adorar, vamos nessa
Gata, me liga, mais tarde tem balada
Quero curtir com você na madrugada
Dançar, pular até o sol raiar.

I go humble
You're so curiously pure
Only before you I'm humble
I go humble
You amaze me
Only before you I'm humble
I should be arrested
For my emotional stunts
Only before you I'm humble
I'm queen of provocation
I wake people up
Only before you I'm humble
I go humble
I adore you
Only before you I'm humble
I should be arrested
For my emotional stunts
Only before you I'm humble
Walk by the man who sings a song to the street lights
And turns out everybody claps, they don't believe in cabs
They don't believe in cabs, they don't believe in cabs.
And they all go wild, but they walk instead
They all go wild, but they walk instead.
Now, talk to the man who's laying down by the door of a bank
And people don't rely on the traffic lights, they don't believe in lights
They don't believe in lights, they don't believe it's a confusing situation
They all get run over in petrol stations but they rock.
And there are faces on the six AM working crowds
Who take the subway from their homes to their lonely nights.
The sun is rising up on the east side, a chance for everyone
I've been dreaming of the city for a long time, far from my home town
(You...) I see... (Will see...) My dream... (Your dream...) for real... (Come true...)
(You...) I will... (Will rise...) will rise... (Above...) above... (The room...)
Heart is pure and thoughts are clear (Love, release our mind)
Not going to mess around (You are what you want)
Mum and Daddy would be so proud (Time is taking lies)
City please don't let me down (You are what you mean)
Starlight, can you give me the fame (Star light)
Can you hurl me the game, Oh Starlight? (Has what you need)
Starlight, can you give me the fame (Star light)
Can you hurl me the game, Oh Starlight? (Has what you need)
The time has come for me to be someone, a rich man, a superstar
And faith is all we need to be the one, far from my own ground
(You...) I see... (Will see...) my dream... (Your dream...) for real... (Come true...)
(You...) I will... (Will rise...) Will rise... (Above...) above... (The room...)
Heart is pure and thoughts are clear (Love, release our mind)
Not going to mess around (You are what you want)
Mum and Daddy would be so proud (Time is taking lies)
City please don't let me down (You are what you mean)
Starlight, can you give me the fame (Star light)
Can you help me hurl me the game, Oh Starlight? (Has what you need)
Starlight, can you give me the fame (Star light)
Can you help me hurl me the game, Oh Starlight? (Has what you need)

I was paralyzed
As I opened up my bloodshot eyes
Do I really wanna know
Where I've been or where I've put my nose
I'm in a rut
Keep kicking myself in the nuts
In a stairwell I seek
The lair where I stuck my dirty beak
So I'm back again it's ok
Well be that as it may
Over and over away
Into the fires unknown
Into oblivion through sticks and stones
Pick up the phone - my jacks are all blown
Oh these nights out alone
Come carry me home
A habit hard to break
Take me home good lord for heavens sake
The doctor's not in
Got no cure for the medicine
So I'm back again it's ok
Well be that as it may
Over and over away
Into the fires unknown
Into oblivion through sticks and stones
Pick up the phone - listen to me moan
Oh these nights out alone
Come carry me home
Everytime I make the round I turn around
I'm put upon the rack
Everytime I stand up I fall flat on my face
And break my back - tombstoned
The final phase 
A walk on hayes
A punchbowl argument
The swallowed flames
The drunken dames
That looked like helium
I need this now
Just like you told me not to
I breed this now
Just get me off of the boat for a little while
The war it came 
With fifty men
That stretched out over their graves
Declared a war
And killed some more
And killed some more again 
I need this now
Just like you told me not to
I breed this now
Just get you off of my back for a little while
I got some troubles but they won't last
I'm gonna lay right down here in the grass
And pretty soon all my troubles will pass
'Cause I'm in shoo-shoo-shoo, shoo-shoo-shoo
Shoo-shoo, shoo-shoo, shoo-shoo Sugar Town
I never had a dog that liked me some
Never had a friend or wanted one
So I just lay back and laugh at the sun
'Cause I'm in shoo-shoo-shoo, shoo-shoo-shoo
Shoo-shoo, shoo-shoo, shoo-shoo Sugar Town
Yesterday it rained in Tennessee
I heard it also rained in Tallahassee
But not a drop fell on little old me
'Cause I was in shoo-shoo-shoo, shoo-shoo-shoo
Shoo-shoo, shoo-shoo, shoo-shoo Sugar Town
If I had a million dollars or ten
I'd give to ya, world, and then
You'd go away and let me spend
My life in shoo-shoo-shoo, shoo-shoo-shoo
Shoo-shoo, shoo-shoo, shoo-shoo Sugar Town
La-la-la-la to end
Oh, I remember you said can I fight and breathe
So now I always, always hold my breath you see
You're my heaven, you're my spaceman in your shiny shiny suit
I'll send up all my prayers and hope they're understood
Love started making sense
I always make mistakes at my expense
Love has placed a seed
And you're the sun that shines down upon me
Yeh when we are together
And when we are apart
There is no space in our hearts
I've got these feelings
It's been too long since I've tried to take the time
So now I'm fallin', fallin' into the sublime
When you brush against a stranger
And you both apologise
And when you see in them something you recognise
Love started making sense
I always make mistakes at my expense
Love has placed a seed
And you're the sun that shines down upon me
Yeh when we are together
And when we are apart
There is no space in our hearts
I've got these feelings
Yeh when we are together
And when we are apart
There is no space in our hearts
I've got these feelings
Yeh when we are together
And when we are apart
There is no space in our hearts
I've got these feelings
Yeh when we are together
And when we are apart
There is no space in our hearts
I've got these feelings
Yeh when we are together
And when we are apart
There is no space in our hearts
I've got these feelings
I was wrong about Bobby, I admit
He's not the dumbest angry, young nitwit
No he can cut it with the best
And you'd better get out of his way
His girlfriend keeps him living in
A world where fear will always win
And if you see him out tonight
Well, you'd better get out of his way
You gotta give it up for the new modern man
He's gonna have a ball, give it all that he can
Someday he's gonna show us all, I bet
Out in the sun while we're all soaking wet
If it's a dry life that you want
Then you'd better get out of his way
You gotta give it up for the new modern man
He's gonna have a ball, give it all that he can
I was wrong about Bobby, don't you know
He's had it tough and he had to make a go
But if he doesn't stop fucking with me
Well, he'd better get out of my way
Yeah, he'd better get out of my way
He'd better get out of my way
Festival varje dag
Festival varenda dag gör mig glad
Tågen går varje år
Tågen går varenda år i samma spår
Sköna [...], veckoslut
Du kan sova på min arm tills det blir ljust
Allting lunkar på
det känns mycket mer än du och jag har lust att mäkta med
Eftermiddagen går
och vi har långt, långt kvar innan natten rullar in
Imorgon då blir det regn
Då får man aja baja imse vimse spö för man är inne
Imorse var det kallt
och man kan var dom andra eller du och jag har festival
I am somewhere in the city, I am climbing up a fire escape
I am somewhere in the city, I am climbing up a fire escape
I have gotta save my baby from a mess this world has made
I arrive through a window, I leave through a hole in the wall
I arrive through a window, I leave through a hole in the wall
And I scramble down the stairwell with my baby, cradle and all
Helicopter, helicopter let your long rope down
Let us sway into the sunset
I have done all I can do in this town
Tell 'em violence has taken the wind out of my sail
Tell 'em violence has taken the wind out of my sail
Helicopter has taken to breaking this dreaming spell
My mind is a-racing, my heart is prepared somehow
My mind is a-racing, my heart is prepared somehow
For that searchlight come shining and finds me under a cloud
Helicopter, helicopter let your long rope down
Let us sway into the sunset
I have done all I can do in this town
Helicopter, helicopter let your long rope down
Let us sway into the sunset
I have done all I can do in this town
Wherever I'm staying, you're going away
I learn to part with a smile on my face
Now I'm too good at letting go
Too easy to say no
Each time we have a quarrel
It almost breaks my heart 
'Cause I'm so afraid 
That we will have to part 
Each night I ask the stars up above 
Why must I be a teenager in love? 
One day I feel so happy 
Next day I feel so sad 
I guess I have to learn 
The good with the bad 
Each night I ask the stars up above 
Why must I be a teenager in love?
I cried a tear 
For nobody but you 
I'll be the lonely one 
If you should say we're through
Well, if you want to make me cry 
That won't be so hard to do 
If'n you should say goodbye 
I'll still go on loving you 
Each night I ask the stars up above 
Why must I be a teenager in love?
I cried a tear 
For nobody but you 
I'll be the lonely one 
If you should say we're through
Well, if you want to make me cry 
That won't be so hard to do 
And if you say goodbye 
I'll still go on loving you 
Each night I ask the stars up above 
Why must I be a teenager in love?
Why must I be a teenager in love?
Why must I be a teenager in love?
Why must I be a teenager in love?
Why must I be a teenager in love?
Why must I be a teenager in love?
Why must I be a teenager in love?
I can't sleep, in the silence, broken
Pitch black in my room I need some
Lights on, some distraction, so I won't move.
And in the middle of the night
When I have, drifted off in sleep
I see a thousand cherry tulips lined up
All on my street.
I want the sea... (all lined up into me)
I want the whole sea (an endless cherry street)
For you and me... (a crimson color tree)
For you and me... (all just for you and me)
And in the middle of the night

Caught up in what's in.
Caught up in the things that everyone wants.
Caught up in what's out.
Caught up in the things that you could do without.
Well what if I was one of them?
So I will say,
If I live for a million years I would be Right there to catch your tears.
Will you get over it this time?
And is this the last time?
On this night we breathe air.
What makes it so different?
What makes you not care?
Well I wish that we could be the same.
And I wish that you could give up this game.
Don't wanna be one of them.

I'm just, I'm just, I'm just a man stuck pushing some wheel
Moving on and down the road to the 303
In the land of summer sun we have just begun
Riding out with my friends in a Mercedes Benz
You can find your way home on the 303
You can let somebody know on the 303
On the 303
Hard times, well all I know is that...
Dark times? Gotta let it go because I got my friends
And I love my friends
Yeah got my friends right to the end
Round the bend, all together now
I've got to, got to get to some place I've not been
Headless guru in the night show me what you mean!
In the land of summer sun we have just begun
Perfect picture card scene, changing all that has been
You can find your way home on the 303
You can let somebody know on the 303
On the 303
Hard times, well all I know is that...
Dark times? Gotta let it go because I got my stash
And I love my hash
Yeah got my stash
Think I'll grow myself a big ol' hairy moustache
I had this perfect dream
-Un sueño me envolvió
This dream was me and you
-Tal vez estás aquí
I want all the world to see
-Un instinto me guiaba
A miracle sensation
My guide and inspiration
Now my dream is slowly coming true
The wind is a gentle breeze
-Él me habló de ti
The bells are ringing out
-El canto vuela
They're calling us together
Guiding us forever
Wish my dream would never go away
Barcelona - It was the first time that we met
Barcelona - How can I forget
The moment that you stepped into the room you took my breath away
Barcelona - La musica vibró
Barcelona - Y ella nos unió
And if God willing we will meet again, someday
Let the songs begin
-Déjalo nacer
Let the music play
-Ahhhhhhhh...
Make the voices sing
-Nace un gran amor
Start the celebration
-Ven a mi
And cry
-Grita
Come alive
-Vive
And shake the foundations from the skies
Ah, Ah, Shaking all our lives
Barcelona - Such a beautiful horizon
Barcelona - Like a jewel in the sun
Por ti seré gaviota de tu bella mar
Barcelona - Suenan las campanas
Barcelona - Abre tus puertas al mundo
If God is willing
-If God is willing
If God is willing
Friends until the end
Viva - Barcelona
I can see
The things she does for me
I'm living in a treehouse
I live in constant fear
Awakening must be near
I'm sleeping in a dreamhouse
Up in a tree
I'm tired of the fork in the road
It's pointing to Heaven
But the sky is old
I'm tired of the fork in the road
It's pointing at nothing
'Cause it's all been sold
I live with you
To die in jamais vu
I love you
But this isn't true
I'm tired of the fork in the road
It's pointing to Heaven 
But the sky is old
I'm tired of the fork in the road 
It's pointing at nothing
'Cause it's all been sold
I can see
The things she does for me
I'm living in a treehouse
I live in constant fear
Awakening must be near
Sleeping in a dreamhouse
Waiting for the end
Do you know who I am?
Good, neither do I
Got nothing to say (I got nothing to say)
But if you pay me, I can play the fool
Go on believe, if it turns you on
Take what you need till your body is numb
Prostitution, is revolution
You can hate me, after you pay me
My submission, is your addiction
So just get out while you can
Do you remember when the only thing that mattered was
Taking time for the things you love?
But now you got to humor, all these fools
Go on believe, if it turns you on
Take what you need till your body is numb
Prostitution, is revolution
You can hate me, after you pay me
My submission, is your addiction
So just get out while you can
If you need me, I'm your man
But you don't want to see me mad
Oh, no, we, don't care!
You're a pro and it's no surprise
Oh, no, we, don't care!
Go on believe, if it turns you on
Take what you need till your body is numb
Prostitution, is revolution
You can hate me, after you pay me
My submission, is your addiction
So just get out while you can
I can see it in your stars
Life is so exciting
Acting so bizarre
Your world is so inviting
Playing really cool
And looking so mysterious honey
Your every day is full of sunshine
But into every life a little rain must fall
No problem
Uh
Be cool now
Anyone who imagines
They can blind you with science
Bully you all over
With property and finance
But you have the position
To call the shots and name the price honey
You found success and recognition
But into every life a little rain must fall
Flo Jo
You lead a fairy tale existence
But into every life a little rain must fall
Be cool
Hah
Kiss kiss
Others seem to think
You are over dramatising
Problems at work
So it's hardly surprising
There's little you can do
To alter their opinions honey
You want a clean reputation
But now you're facing complications
'Cause into every life a little rain must fall
Be cool
Get serious
All right
Play it nice and cool
Play it nice and cool
That's good
One more time
Aha
I like it
You might lose your faith in science.
You might lose faith in wealth.
You might lose your faith in Jesus,
Or lose faith in yourself.
But, when I let you down,
Look past your doubt.
Just, please, please,
Don't lose your faith in me.
You could lose faith in music,
Or lose faith in your friends.
You could lose your faith in breathing,
Feel trapped in your own skin.
Oh, but I'll be right there beside you,
When the walls are caving in.
Oh, I'm not going anywhere.
But, when I let you down,
Look past your doubt.
Just please, please,
Don't lose your faith in me.
Please don't lose your faith in me.
Oh, Oh, oh...
I'm not going anywhere. [3x]
But, when I let you down,
Look past your doubt.
Just please, please,
Don't lose your faith in me.
Please don't lose your faith in me.
I'm not going anywhere.
Well I've had this secret
And I feel it's time that you should know
When I'm in your arms it turns me on
But I've got a conscience too
And it says my heart's never in tune
With anything I do
So this is the last time that I'll hold your hand
I want to kiss you on the mouth and tell you
I'm your biggest fan
I'm your biggest fan
I've had this secret
And now it's time that you should know
I was wrong to string you along
But circulating the streets in the pulsing heat
I scoured your town, completely aroused
And making love to your memory
So this is the last time that I'll hold your hand
I want to kiss you on the mouth and tell you
I'm your biggest fan
This is the last time that I'll hold your hand
I want to kiss you on the mouth and tell you
I'm your biggest fan
Sad minion of mine
Don't be so unkind
I know I stole your coat
You can have this song I wrote
I've just crossed the line
From fashion to crime
It's such a perfect fit
When I am wearing it
Sad minion of mine
Don't be so unkind
I know I stole your coat
You can have this song I wrote
I've just crossed the line
From fashion to crime
So this is the last time that I'll hold your hand
I want to kiss you on the mouth and tell you
I'm your biggest fan
This is the last time that I'll hold your hand
I want to kiss you on the mouth and tell you
I'm your biggest fan
So this is the last time that I'll hold your hand
I wanna kiss you on the mouth and tell you
I'm your biggest fan
I'm your biggest fan
Hello, little girl
Hello, little girl
Hello, little girl
When I see you every day
I say, mm-mm, hello, little girl
When you're passing on your way
I say, mm-mm, hello, little girl
When I see you passing by
I cry, mm-mm, hello, little girl
When I try to catch your eye
I cry, mm-mm, hello, little girl
I send you flowers but you don't care
You never seem to see me standin' there
I often wonder what you're thinkin' of
I hope it's me and love, love, love
So I hope there'll come a day when
You say, mm-mm, you're my little girl
It's not the first time
That it's happened to me
It's been a long, lonely time
And it's so funny, so funny to see
That I'm about to lose my mind, mind, mind
So I hope there'll come a day when
You say, mm-mm, you're my little girl
Mm-mm, you're my little girl
Mm-hm, you're my little girl
Oh yeah, you're my little girl
On your way to the best years of your life
Everyone's banging on their gongs
The sooner you leave the sooner you're home
Back in Massachusetts
To your golden age where they tuck you in at night
You didn't see it coming
Now who you gonna wave to?
This time you're not homecoming king
Did you hear that? 
Have you heard that sound before?
Do you even know where it is coming from?
It's getting too loud it keeps on pushing you out
Into the arms of 1994
You didn't see it coming
Now who you gonna wave to?
You're not homecoming king
You stand on your own
Wasn't what you hoped at all
Do you still recall it?
Giving dead-arms in the hall
Stay right where you are
You'll be half of who you were
When you always would win
So count the days till you give in
Back to Massachusetts
To your golden age where your crown is shining bright
You didn't see it coming
Now who you gonna wave to?
You're not homecoming king
You didn't see it coming
Now who you gonna wave to?
You're not homecoming king
Upon a roof below the moon
Nearby a park-bench in the sun
Upon the stairway to your room
Why won't you wrap your life around
Those certain words I just found
I wear your golden ring inside
Suits me very fine
I wear your golden heart in mine
Suits me very fine
A backseat sofa in the dark
Upon a viewpoint in our town
Nearby a fountain in a park
Why won't you wrap your life around
Those certain words I just found
I wear your golden ring inside
Suits me very fine
I wear your golden heart in mine
Suits me very fine
I wear your golden heart in mine
And life is very fine
The river's running fast right now.
It's the time of year the water cleanses itself.
Running wild, but always in control.
And now's the time to sever the ties.
To habits that we think suck.
Break away this fear,
Until it disappears.
I'm not ready to swim, I'm not going to sink.
I just want to float through the sea.
Are you holding me down?
Are you holding me up?
Or are you slowly drowning me?
There's something to be said for luck.
It's better than being good.
When half of being good is being lucky, anyways.
We're spreading out, we're harder to hit.
Become a moving target,
Drop your burden,
And abandon it.
Break away this fear,
Until it disappears.
I'm not ready to swim, I'm not going to sink.
I just want to float through the sea.
Are you holding me down?
Are you holding me up?
Or are you slowly drowning me?
I remember the day when I could walk right down the streets and feel so confident,
And know everything's okay.
Take my hand, don't let go, but please remember, hearts can grow.
We still have to take it slow.
I love with caution and trust, alone.
I'm not ready to swim, I'm not going to sink.
I just want to float through the sea.
Are you holding me down?
Are you holding me up?
Or are you slowly drowning me?
Man, I just saw something. I'm glad that you are here.
I got to start to thinking, and seeing things so clear.
'Cause now how could I forget what she left?
What happened in November is what I needed.
And I'm sorry that it shows, but life ain't so bad you know?
And now the sky is such a sweet blue,
And you made this come true,
And my heart feels so new.
(Whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa, whoa, whoa-oh)
It's now wonderful to see beautiful views
Like skies that are so blue.
(Whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa, whoa, whoa-oh)
I'll never leave this you know.
I'd turn it off for this.
It looks like we got what we wished.
It snowed in Texas but you missed (first time since '86)
And I can't stop thinking how wonderful this is.
And I'm sorry I sound glad, but why always be so sad?
And now the sky is such a sweet blue,
And you made this come true,
And my heart feels so new.
(Whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa, whoa, whoa-oh)
It's now wonderful to see beautiful views
Like skies that are so blue.
(Whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa, whoa, whoa-oh)
And I know that sometimes oh I might feel alone, so broke, and cold.
But now I'll show that I know
That the sky is such a sweet blue,
And you made this come true,
And my heart feels so new.
(Whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa, whoa, whoa-oh)
It's now wonderful to see beautiful views
Like skies that are so blue.
(Whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa, whoa, whoa-oh)
I'll never leave this you know.
Oh happy birthday, happy birthday
Little Lisa, today is your day
Sing hallelujah, you know they blew ya'
There are too many candles in your cake
But don't you worry, there's no hurry
The Jehovah's are standing by your door
And they are offering eternal suffering
Eternal life, but you say no
Turn on the radio, clean the windows
Do it in slow-mo as the day unfolds
Oh how the sun shines inside you, just like I do these days are gold
The nights are silver, they make you shiver
Tomorrow the Jehovah's will come by
And they will ask you of an excuse
Not to accept eternal life
Aah
But I love you, yes I love you
But I would never kiss your lips
'Cause there's a friendship, a lovely kinship
Here's a tulip to match your eyes
Oh drinking cheap wine to bossa nova
You're a supernova in the sky
The Jehovah's in their pull-overs
Are no Casanovas like you and I
Oh happy birthday, happy birthday
Happy birthday to you
Oh happy birthday, happy birthday
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
Oh happy birthday, little Lisa
Happy birthday to you
Instrumental
From the east to the south
I tongue the roof of my mouth
To new days of doubt without you
First gear, I face the trouble ahead
Final word has been said
Long distance spread between us
I tell myself to
Hold on, won't be long
Till I grow through this struggle
Time to wake up, find my muscle
Happy without you oh (x5)
Not called for weeks now
Six days without sleep means
I am a slave to my early grave
If I do not be brave, behave
Seize myself out of this mess
I have created of myself yet again
Yet again I say
Hold on, it won't be long
Till I grow through this struggle
Time to wake up, find my muscle
Happy without you oh (x5)
Beat go on
Heart be strong
Stay whole
Unbroken
As we divide
Our love goodbye
Thanks for, the time
Time of my life
Happy without you oh (x4)
Time, time of my life
Time, time of my life
(So happy without you)
Time, time of my life
Time, time of my life
Thanks for the time of my life
(Happy without you)
Happy without you oh
Happy without you
Travel the seaside Michigan
Walk on the water with a friend
On the pretty waves
I've been a real bad family man
Sucking the white light Indians
On the mountain
But I'm gonna try
I'm gonna pave the way at night
Singing the gospel in my mind
Walking on blue waves, blue waves
Radiate and drive
All my life
Make me real life hurricane
Follow a straight line to the brink
On the good days
You've been a teenage runaway
Carry the people that you hate
In a suitcase
Well I'm gonna try
I'm gonna pave the way at night
Nothing but gospel in my mind
Walking on blue waves, blue waves
Radiate and drive
All my life
Don't think too hard if you think it hurts that bad
Don't talk about it, don't let it get you down
It's only one part of the story
Just let it go, don't let it bring you down now
Sing the last thing on your mind
The last word on your breath
I'll be the one to keep you, I'll keep you at your best
The last thing on your mind
'Cause I don't need your mess
I'll be the one to keep you one disaster less
Straighten up your tie, take the microphone
Forget about it, don't let it get you down
Now is not the time and you're not alone
Shut up about it, no one can bring you down now
Sing the last thing on your mind
The last word on your breath
I'll be the one to keep you, I'll keep you at your best
The last thing on your mind
'Cause I don't need your mess
I'll be the one to keep you one disaster less
I'll be okay
I'll be okay if you'll
Sing the last thing on your mind
The last word on your breath
I'll be the one to keep you, I'll keep you at your best
The last thing on your mind
'Cause I don't need your mess
I'll be the one to keep you one disaster less
The last thing on your mind
The last word on your breath
I'll be the one to keep you, I'll keep you at your best
The last thing on your mind
'Cause I don't need your mess
I'll be the one to keep you one disaster less
Hey, glad girls only want to get you high
And they're alright
There will be no coronation
There will be no flowers flowing
In the light that passes though me
Hey, glad girls only want to get you high
And they're alright
There will be no graduation
There will be no trumpets blowing
In the light that passes through me
With the sinking of the sun
I've come to greet you
Clean your hands and go to sleep
Confess the dreams
Of good and bad men all around
Some are lost
And some have found
The light that passes though me
I was walking away,
But she's so beautiful it made me stay
I don't know her name,
But I'm hoping she might feel the same
So here I go again,
She got my heart again!
Tonight we'll dance
I'll be yours and you'll be mine
We won't look back,
Take my hand and we will shine
Oh, oh, oh
She needs a wild heart
She needs a wild heart
I got a wild heart
Stay here, my dear,
Feels like I've been standing right here for years
My mind's beat up
Tell me that you feel this, and I won't give up
I won't give up
Tonight we'll dance
I'll be yours and you'll be mine
We won't look back,
Take my hand and we will shine
Oh, oh, oh
She needs a wild heart
She needs a wild heart
I got a wild heart
Oh, oh, oh
She needs a wild heart
She needs a wild heart
I got a wild heart
And I know it's late, I know it's cold
But come right here, I swear I'll never let you go
The way you move-it's wonderful
Let's do it now, 'cause one day we'll both be old
Oh whoa oh
Tonight we'll dance
I'll be yours and you'll be mine
We won't look back,
Take my hand and we will shine
Oh, oh, oh
She needs a wild heart
She needs a wild heart
I got a wild heart
Tonight we'll dance
I'll be yours and you'll be mine
We won't look back,
Take my hand and we will shine
Oh, oh, oh
She needs a wild heart
She needs a wild heart
I got a wild heart
Oh, oh, oh
She needs a wild heart
She needs a wild heart
I've got a wild heart
We can walk in straight lines
We can't see quite right
We've lost the plot
And we can't get it back
So let's lose ourselves
Let's lose ourselves
Can you spot the English here?
Let's pick a fight on whomever we like
'Cause we're never wrong
Nobody likes us
We don't care
So let's lose ourselves
Let's lose ourselves
Can you spot the English here?
We can see it for real
But it doesn't make sense
We're the outsiders
We can see all this speech
Come staggering out
And we can climb its way
To the top of that cloud
I'm away with the fairies now
I'm away with the fairies now
I'm away with the fairies now
I'm away with the fairies now
This familiar environment
Gets my lungs confused
I breathe in every particle
That you drive through
That you drive through
Well can you spot the English here?
We can see it for real
But it doesn't make sense
We're the outsiders
We can see all this speech
Come staggering out
And it can its way to the top
Of that cloud
Oh I'm away with the fairies now
I'm away with the fairies now
I'm away with the fairies now
I'm away with the fairies now
(Verse One)
I understand why you're looking for tears in my eyes
Trust me they were there but now the well has dried
I was in so deep but couldn't get out
I sat on feelings that I buried deep down
I knew there come a day when our paths would cross
And I'm glad it's today 'cause now I am strong
I'm happy and I can thank myself
If it were up to you, I'd be in my bed crying
I'm happy and I know that makes you sad
After all the things you put me through
I'm finally getting over you
I'm happy, I'm happy
(Verse Two)
There's a reason why we met and I'm glad that we did
But when we broke up, I got back a part of me I really missed
Not saying that you brought me down all the time
There were moments I lived without lying on my side
I'm happy and I can thank myself
If it were up to you, I'd be in my bed crying
I'm happy and I know that makes you sad
After all the things you put me through
I'm finally getting over you
(Middle-8)
All the bitterness has passed
And I only wish you someone who can do what I can't
I'm happy and I can thank myself
If it were up to you, I'd be in my bed crying
I'm happy and I know that makes you sad
After all the things you put me through
I'm finally getting over you
I'm happy and I can thank myself
If it were up to you, I'd be in my bed crying
I'm happy and I know that makes you sad
After all the things you put me through
I'm finally getting over you
I'm happy, I'm happy
Ashes to ashes and funks to funky

So have a taste of my bass 'cause the girlies got smiles
You're gettin' on my case like The Rockford Files
Crazy Eddie in the slammer 'cause he's givin' it all away

He's got the sun on his back
Where there are freckles I would die for
Is he a family man?
If I had the chance I would show him all I am
I like the sound of his voice
I did me very best to impress him
Always my first choice
And I'm not ashamed to admit I've been uncool, I've looked a fool
Do you feel lucky tonight? Just go out in the night
Do you feel lucky tonight? Just go out in the night
And I will wear a badge to show my delight
He's got the sun on his back (Just go out, it's alright)
He's got the sun on his back (Just go out, it's alright)
And I will wear a badge to show my delight
And I will wear a badge to show my delight
And I will wear a badge to show my delight
Who's that shadow holding me hostage?
I've been here for days
Who's this whisper telling me that I'm
Never gonna get away?
I know they'll be coming
To find me soon
But I fear I'm getting
Used to being held by you
Baby look what you've done to me
Baby look what you've done now
Baby I'll never leave
If you keep holding me this way
Baby look what you've done to me
Baby you've got me tied down
Baby I'll never leave
If you keep holding me this way
Who's this man that's holding your hand
And talking 'bout your eyes
Used to sing about being free but
Now he's changed his mind
I know they'll be coming
To find me soon
But my Stockholm syndrome
Is in your room
Yeah I fell for you!
Baby look what you've done to me
Baby look what you've done now
Baby I'll never leave
If you keep holding me this way
Baby look what you've done to me
Baby you've got me tied down
Baby I'll never leave
If you keep holding me this way
All my life I've been on my own
I used the light to guide me home
And now together we're alone
And there's no other place I'd ever wanna go
Look what you've done to me
Baby look what you've done, done
Baby look what you've done to me
Baby look what you've done now
Baby I'll never leave
If you keep holding me this way
Baby look what you've done to me
Baby you've got me tied down
Baby I'll never leave
If you keep holding me this way
Can we get away?
Far away...
Let's leave this place
Will you come with me?
Are you down...
To turn your world around
It's you and me tonight...
Leave it all behind
Let's go for a ride...
Say goodnight to gravity
Hold on to me...
The passing stars light the way
The future's here today
It's you and me tonight
Leave it all behind...
Get in my rocketship
We'll leave the light of day
Staying on the turning away
There's no tomorrow
Just today...
Together we will follow
...Fly away
Never mind tomorrow
...Just today
Leave it all behind...
Let's go for a ride
She was feeling yuletide-burn
Cause her family was wearing on her nerves
She was tired of fighting and feeling frustrated
Finding it hard to relate to those of whom she was related
You know we all sometimes, say things we don't mean
But that don't mean that we're not still family
Generation to generation it gets passed on
And then one day, those who would passing well they passed on
Pulling back the covers, her heart will start to shudder when she realizes how deep it all went
Trying to forgive what was said, but was never really meant
Well you know we all sometimes, say things we don't mean.
But that don't mean we're not still family.
Pull out of the shadows and find out that eventually
It's all bad, it's all good baby can't you see
That we all, well we all, well we all are still family
I was there from the moment that you were born
And I've loved you since I heard your first cries
And I know we won't always be getting along
But I promise you that I will always try
You know we all sometimes, say things we don't mean
But that don't mean that we're not still family
You know we all sometimes, say things we don't mean
But that don't mean that we're not still family
You know we all sometimes, say things we don't mean
But that don't mean that we're not still family
Oh language is dead,
So she believes,
I'm looking up,
Socially bereaved,
Just like Carlisle,
She lies on the border,
Disorder surrounds,
Her every noun,
One Night In October,
The clocks go back,
And she attacks me oh,
Grabbing my left shoulder,
Suspects in texts that leave her wrecked-uh-oh,
One night in October,
I sit her down,
And say this must stop,
'Cause all we do,
Is argue then shop,
She goes to Boots,
I go to Argos,
Complete with deceit,
We stalk each aisle,
One night in October,
She throws a towel, the sink, a scowl-uh-oh,
One night in October,
With more invective,
Than the average detective,
Questions me on the lawn,
With doors ajar,
Tonight I will sleep in my car,
One night in October,
Oh intensive care,
Intensively she's aware,
That I, I miss the heat,
Solace and sway of the sheets,
Oh, this dashboard's so hard,
Can't cushion the beats of my heart,
One night in October,
Oh oh,
One night in October,
The clocks go back,
And she attacks me oh,
Grabbing my left shoulder,
With more invective,
Than the average detective,
Questions me on the lawn,
With doors ajar,
Tonight I might sleep in the car,
One night in October,
Maybe not one
Maybe you too
Wonderin'
Wonderin' who
Wonderful you
A-wonderin'
Child - the child
Father of the son
Where is the father, Son
Where is the wonderful me?
Wonderful you
Though I know I'm wont to wonderin'
Never mind wonderful you
I can't stop a-wondering
Never you mind, wonderful you
Child - the child
Father of the son
Child - the child
Father of the son
I know that you're smiling, baby,
I don't even need to see your face
Sunset at the shoreline, we are laughing, breaking up,
Just like the waves
Are you feeling, feeling, feeling like I'm, feeling
Like I'm floating, floating, up above that big blue ocean
Sand beneath our feet, big blue sky above our heads,
No need to keep stressing from our everyday life on our minds
We have got to leave all that behind
Well, I have got a sister,
And she has got a baby with brand new eyes
And her daddy is an engineer,
And they just took her to the sea for the first time
Now they're under, under, underneath a big umbrella
Summer, summer, summer time to help us forget, nine to fives
We have got to leave all that behind
I have worries to give to the sea
We can walk dear the pier is farther than it seems
Midnight at the shoreline, fireworks above us
A screaming bloom
They're sent by some teenager and kid whoever you are
I am thanking you
Now we're dancing, dancing, dancing with no music
What is happening, happening, happening and no feelings
Except this is right
We just had to leave all that behind
You're so fragile tonight
Been up hurting all night
It's not trivial like they think
Yes, you're desperate and hurt
Thought about it so many times
Too afraid to open your eyes
To see the sadness that's inside
Just sit back in and stop time
(Ah) You're tender and you're tired
You can't be bothered to decide
Whether you live or die
Or just forget about your life
But it's too late to be real
No time to be strong enough
Just time to leave it all behind
Memory has become pain
Rebuild the void with flowers
Sad-eyed destruction built around sand and sea
Yes, you can build yourself around
Build yourself around me
Self around me
You're tender and you're tired
You can't be bothered to decide
Whether you live or die
Or just forget about your life
You're tender and you're tired
You can't be bothered to decide
Whether you live or die
Or just forget about your life
You're tender and you're tired
You can't be bothered to decide
Whether you live or die
Or just forget about your life
Oh, you're tender and you're tired
You can't be bothered to decide
Whether you live or die
Or just forget about your life
Drift away and die
Never say goodbye
Drift away and die
Never say goodbye
Drift away and die
I was young, I was surviving the times
Waiting for my moment, I was destined to shine
Little Ray had an NSX, I was hoping I'm next
Wanting bracelets, never had a rope on my neck
Unless I was holding Taiyeh chain--Rest In Peace
Even though that night you flipped on us
You warned us If you came back and we still on the corners,
We goners, moving on to...
Move your arm in your watch To another time on the block
'Cause this 40 Side Where they say Shorty rhyme
Tragedy he used to come through all the time
I'm talking Juice Crew, not what the word define
He had a sister named Erin, for sure was fine
That was my first crush; I bought my first mic
I wrote my first verse, I was about nine
I was about mine, fantasize house-buying
Met Paul, he wore some big glasses
Him and Melquan took me where G Rap lived
I was happy, just getting some answers
I ain't even know what a record advance was
I'm seeing hoes sex in the studio bathroom
With rap dudes, thinking wow she moved me
Same girl then, right now's a groupie
Back then, she was like the star in the movie
Large jewelry and expensive Gucci
Next stop, Paid In Full posse recruits me
Knew they were some millionaires, their ropes were dookie
Eric B man looking like touch-it-he-shoot-me
You see, every time Ra didn't show
I get to record demos at attempts to blow
I wonder could they tell, how did they know
Sixteen years later, here I go
Can it be we've run out of time?
You're alive, Oh-O
In these streets we live in and die, when it's your time
You will know, cause it ain't hard to tell...
I'm with Akinyele in the street, trying to get us a deal
G Rap tried to get us to sign to Cold Chill
But Fly Ty didn't have the contract we wanted
Clark Kent just signed Das, he didn't want us
Russell said I sounded like G, the nigga fronted
Reef and Matty C offered me a little money
Shit a little funny, feel a little laughter
Rebel of Hip-Hop coming through a white rapper
My boy MC Serch nevertheless
Took me to Columbia, back then CBS
Chris Schwartz, RuffHouse, he was the best man
Now bugging because the label had just dropped Def Jam
Could you picture Russell needing a check, man
But he smart, he plotted a plan for Polygram
Life is ill, again life's a movie
Then, the roster's: Cypress Hill, Nas, and Fugees
Before I sold records, no promotion
The rap world like, what's all this commotion
Went plat', mad bottles I'm toasting
20/20 hindsight, but how did they know then
Invincible, lyrical, miracle man, huh
But back to the matter at hand
'Cause ten years ago we all strived to be twenty-five
Some cats didn't make it alive
Dated some stars but respect their privacy
Copped mad cars, laying back in the driver's seat
Held myself down, just steering the wheel
Here I am, completed my whole record deal
You sit outside in the dark
And get nicked by the strobe light
While we're playing indoors
We play in a bar
We play in a basement
We play in a room where the mix isn't right
The help at the door
The age to get in
The artist is smug
They don't sound like they did
We're ready to move
The crowd is a stare
If you've got things on your mind
Shake them off!
That's why we have come to collect you bodies
From your lovers, and pause all the suffering
At least start pacing
You're not on the list
You paid to get in
Your boyfriend is mad
It was something you did
In concert tonight
The bass drum is quick
If you've got things on your mind
Shake them off!
Once there was this girl I knew,
She had all she could want,
But her unhappiness exceeded what she'd flaunt
She says 'everyone around here's wasting my time'
All of her possessions gonna make her feel fine
She wants everyone to sit around, talk about her life
Don't ask her how she feels, 'cause that'd be a lie.
Don't tell me 'cause you know I know it hurts
Don't tell me 'cause you know it's gotten worse
Don't tell me 'cause you think I don't know shit about the way you feel
Tell me 'cause I don't want you to hurt.
She sits around like a vintage queen,
Complains about the world
She says how she's so much better than you,
How she's a "special" girl.
She says 'everyone around here's wasting my time'
All of her boyfriends gonna make her feel fine
Don't tell me 'cause you know I know it hurts
Don't tell me 'cause you know it's gotten worse
Don't tell me 'cause you think I don't know shit about the way you feel
Tell me 'cause I don't want you to hurt.
She says 'everyone around me is wasting all my time'
All of her boyfriends gonna make her feel fine.
Don't tell me 'cause you know I know it hurts
Don't tell me 'cause you know it's gotten worse
Don't tell me 'cause you think I don't know shit about the way you feel
Tell me 'cause I don't want you to-
Don't tell me 'cause you know I know it hurts
Don't tell me 'cause you know it's gotten worse
Don't tell me 'cause you think I don't know shit about the way you feel
Tell me 'cause I don't want you to hurt.
Well I'll follow you wherever
When you lead me by my nose
On another big adventure- I suppose
Then you lay me down in clover
With their petals on my back
I should make some time
To do more things like that... 
Pre chorus/chorus
Won't you sing to me your poetry,
Won't you take me to your home,
Won't you be for me forever
So I'll never be alone
And just one thing...
If you're my queen...
Then it's a beautiful thing... 
Well I'm buried in my bedroom
Under fourteen feet of clothes
I could drown in all this clutter I suppose 
But then you're standing in my doorway 
With a suitcase on your back
And it blows my mind
When you do things like that 
Pre chorus/ chorus 
Yeah, reminding me
Well I might be poor 
But summer's free...
For me, I didn't know I was sleeping 
Pre chorus/ chorus
Cold wind whipping through the windows
Freezing each of the lymph nodes
Maybe we gotta try
To get out of town tonight
Well, I love you
You know you love me and it shows
Maybe we gotta try
Let's crash at your place tonight
Grandpa's passed out on the couch
Take the greenbelt to your house
There's a shortcut through the forest that smells
There's a shortcut through the forest that smells
As we hit the front door
All the clothes hit the floor
Maybe we gotta try
To bike outta town tonight
Well, I love you
You know you love me and it shows
Edmonton's just a four night bike ride outta town
Cold wind whipping through the windows
Freezing each of the lymph nodes
Maybe we gotta try
And I love you
And you know you love me and it shows
Edmonton's just a four night bike ride outta town
I am the only one
Searching for you
And if I get caught
Well, then the search is through
And the stories you hear
You know they never add up
I hear the natives fussin' at the data chart
Be quiet, the weather's on the night news
Empty homes, plastic combs
Stolen rooms are the alloy of chrome
I've got style
Miles and miles
So much style that it's wasting
So much style that it's wasting
So much style that it's wasting
Now, she's the only one
Who always inhales
Paris is stale
And it's war if we fail
And in the migrant hotels
They never sleep, they never will
Their souls are crumblin' like a dirt-clod hold
Your cigarette cuts to the inside
Empty homes, plastic combs
Stolen rooms are the alloy of chrome
I've got style
Miles and miles
So much style that it's leaving
This pattern's torn and we're weaving
This pattern's torn and we'll weave it
And so my soul collapsed into a big guilt wad
Some big thunder law forces me to eat shit
And if I was a word could my letters number a hundred?
More likely coarse and guttural one syllable anglo saxon
I'm a victim of fact let's say I loved a girl
But the world was wrong and I was forced to march in line
But it felt like handcuffs
Machines disregard my pronouns
I am defeated
I am a cool damp clay
I still wear these worn out jeans
I have to wear long-johns undeneath
Down by the harbour there's a cool cool breeze
Have you ever wondered if oceans can freeze
Strings on my fathers old guitar
The position of the northern star
The clock-like beat of the budgies heart
Tick-tick-tick now they know where you are
I try the light therapy from the Xerox-machine
The gentle beat of a tambourine
And it's not like I can't stand
To see you with another man
I just don't wanna see good love
Fall into the wrong hands
Behind the craze there's a pretty sunset
Water shines like tiny bells
I feel the warmth in the cigarette
But everything else
And it's not like I can't stand
To see you with another man
I just don't wanna see good love
Fall into the wrong hands
I try the light therapy from the Xerox-machine
The gentle beat of a tambourine
And it's not like I can't stand
To see you ruin our plans
I just don't wanna see good love
Fall into the wrong hands
Fall into the wrong hands
Walk out,
Girl don't you walk out
We've got things to say
Talked out, let's have it talked out
Things will be okay
Girl
I don't want to find
That I'm a little bit wrong
And you're a little bit right
I said girl
You know that it's true
It's a little bit me, (a little bit me)
And it's a little bit you... too
Don't know... just what I said wrong
But girl I apologize
Don't go... here's where you belong
So wipe the tears from your eyes
Girl
I don't want to find
That I'm a little bit wrong
And you're a little bit right
I said girl
You know that it's true
It's a little bit me
And it's a little bit you... too
Oh girl
I don't want to find
I'm a little bit wrong
And you're a little bit right
I said girl
You know that it's true
It's a little bit me
And it's a little bit you... too
It's a little bit me
It's a little bit you
Girl don't go
No no no no no
Girl don't go
No no no no no
Hey girl
There's too much sky, not enough blue 
There's too many questions to why I love you 
There's too many clouds, not enough sun 
The rain must fall on everyone 
I'm fire-you're the ocean 
I'm energy-you're the rhythm 
Love is somewhere in between 
What you believe and what you dream 
I'm just trying to make you mine 
You're the ocean 
There's too much doubt and not enough dare 
There's too much decision everywhere 
There's too much decision everywhere 
There's too much talk and not enough time 
Let's close our eyes and not our minds 
I'm fire-you're the ocean 
I'm energy-you're the rhythm 
Love is somewhere in between 
What you believe and what you dream 
I'm just trying to make you mine
You look for leads, I follow clues 
You love to win, I dare to lose 
Mostly you're a mind game in my head 
You are earth, I am water 
I can give you what you're after 
You can be the word I, can be the rhyme
There's really nothing you can do 
You're going where I'm going too 
Stay beside me, stay beside me 
I want you 
I'm fire-you're the ocean 
I'm energy-you're the rhythm 
Love is somewhere in between 
What you believe and what you dream 
I'm just trying to make you mine 
You're the ocean
Someone is smiling, someone cries 
Whatever it is it's alright
Someone is born and someone dies 
Something is holding the light 
It's standing in the light now 
Standing in the light now 
Standing here right now
For you 
Everything you do now 
Everything you are now
Creating it right now
For you
It's a beautiful day 
The sun's coming up 
The sun's going down for you 
It's a beautiful day 
And everyone says 
The world's turning 'round for you 
There is no need to be afraid
There is no need to deny 
That everything is on its way 
And life is going on in your mind
It's standing in the light now 
Standing in the light now 
Standing here right now 
For you 
Everything you do now
Everything you are now 
Creating in right now
For you 
It's a beautiful day 
The sun's coming up 
The sun's going down for you 
It's a beautiful day 
And everyone says 
The world's turning 'round for you
It's standing in the light now 
Standing in the light now 
Standing here right now 
For you 
Everything you do now
Everything you are now 
Creating in right now
For you
It's a beautiful day 
The sun's coming up 
The sun's going down for you 
It's a beautiful day 
And everyone says 
The world's turning 'round for you
Well I think the time has come
To tell you how I feel about everything
That's been inside my mind since the day we crossed
The line into this real life fantasy
'Cause I've poured my heart into
The last three years of wondering what I should do
Should I cash this check and trade in what I thought I knew
Your promises don't help to make it easier
Because the last thing that I need is somebody like you
To push me around and tell me what to do
I know there's a time and a place where you can call the shots but it's not here
'Cause I've poured my heart into
The last three years of wondering what I should do
Should I cash this check and trade in what I thought I knew
Your promises don't help to make it easier
Because the last thing that I need is somebody like you
To push me around and tell me what to do
I know there's a time and a place where you can call the shots but it's not here
'Cause I think this whole life is just overrated
This whole life is too complicated
This whole life is just overrated now
This whole life is just overrated
This whole life is too complicated
This whole life is just overrated now
I don't remember what you said to me that night
So I just sign the dotted line
Cause now I find out
This whole life is just overrated
This whole life is too complicated
This whole life is just overrated now
This whole life is just overrated
This whole life is too complicated
This whole life is just overrated now
Musical ladders
Leaning on mountains
Bathed in white laughter
Under the sun
Somebody's birthday
Came stumbling toward us
Wrapped in green gladness
Under the sun
We're gonna make it through this war tonight
Someone hold this child up to the light
Prostitute fingers
Fumbling with matches
Tucked in red couches
Under green moons
Mexican waitress
Got caught in the crossfire
Of militant families
Bursting with Jews
We're gonna break it to your folks tonight
Kind of hope your Pops don't hear me right
Oh, yes.

I'll love a girl someday 
She'll nourish me in sympathy 
But now I'm shoved through subways 
Selling subtleties, it sickens me 
I'll love the earth someday 
She'll nourish me in pity 
But now I'm shoved through subways 
Selling subtleties in cities 
And I will try to wonder why 
I never heard her cry 
And I will try to wonder why 
I never saw her die 
And I will find her in skies 
Behind my eyes 
And I will find her in the skies 
Behind my eyes 
The skies behind my eyes 
I'll love a girl someday 
And she'll nourish me in pity 
But now I'm shoved through subways 
Selling subtleties in cities 
I'll love the earth someday 
And she'll nourish me in sympathy 
But now I'm shoved through subways 
Selling subtleties, it sickens me

We're so ahead of this
Got this she wolf appetite that keeps me up all night
You know the way it works don't be afraid to ask
Aim high when the target is low
FYI I am ready to go
People say men are just like kids
Never saw a kid behave like this
What you give is exactly what you receive
So put me in a cage and lock me away
And I'll play the games that you want me to play
You can have it all
Anything you want you can make it yours
Anything you want in the world
Anything you want in the world
(Give it up to me)
Nothing too big or small

Damn, your dad's basement feels like '98
Same sad Starks poster
Same sweet fate
Your jangly jewelry shook
Took my gum... in your hand...
You make me feel like natural man
Boombox intones like a greek chorus
It sang of being nobody's baby
Zima Saturday sunsets, watching the world
See how sad the real fun gets with the morrissey girls
At the spiral with lila
Just watching the world
Zima Saturday sunsets, watching the world
See how sad the real fun gets with the morrissey girls
At the spiral with lila
Feeling feelings unfurl
At the spiral with lila
Just watching the world
When I was only seventeen 
My head was full of brilliant dreams
My heart would call and I would gladly go
At twenty one the world was mine
And I was yours and you're divine
And nothing else would matter to us so
I don't believe in destiny
I don't believe in love
I don't believe that anything will ever be enough...
Man you should have seen us
On the way to Venus
Walking on the milky way
It was quite a day hey hey...
Walking on the big stuff
Acting like we're real tough
Baby we were on our way
So what do you say hey hey.
As time goes by reality
Destroys your hope and dignity
There's nothing left but shadows on the wall
But just remember who you are
And where you've been you've come so far
And never ever let them see you fall
I don't believe in miracles
I don't believe in truth
I don't believe that anything can recreate your youth
Man you should have seen us
On the way to Venus
Walking on the milky way
It was quite a day hey hey...
Walking on the big stuff
Acting like we're real tough
Baby we were on our way
So what do you say hey hey
Man you should have seen us
On the way to Venus
Walking on the milky way
It was quite a day hey hey...
Walking on the big stuff
Acting like we're real tough
Baby we were on our way
So what do you say hey hey
Man it's you to seen us this way we runaway with you (x3)
Dance until we just can't
Keep clappin our hands to the songs and
Keep dancin around to the joyful sound that the band plays
As his smiling face just shines away
It's moving through town as big as a train
April, May, June and July we'll hang outside
August through February all the time
Talking our way through March
Hanging out always till this starts
Over and over again you promise that it won't end
So I will try to find a rhyme to thank you again
And how I, I am not into the idea of living without you
And I, I am not into the idea of being without you
And no this won't be a sad song
There's going to be claps and singing along
Cause sad songs about now, well that would just feel wrong
Beautiful colors that came from you
So this ones goes out to the reds and yellows and blues
And of course I can't forget all the beautiful colors on the day that we first met
So I will never know the right way to say thanks
For all those nights and days you spent hanging out
But that's what this is about
How I, I am not into the idea of living without you
And I, I am not into the idea of being without you
And no, this won't be a sad song
There's going to be claps and singing along
'Cause you're there when to talk and you're there not to stop and you're with me
Around the clock... You are! You are!
Around the clock - Yes you are around the clock...
And just so y'all know everyone else is not
So I, I am not into the idea of living without you
And I, I am not into the idea...
And no, well this won't be a sad song
There's gonna be claps and singing along
'Cause you're there when you talk and you're there not to stop
And you're with me... around the clock, all around the clock.
Yeah, I got busted
So I used my one phone call to dedicate
A song to you on the radio
Yeah, I got busted
In custody, I imagined our melody
Being played on a grand piano
I saw your face in front of me
It was perfect clarity
I saw a light at the end of the tunnel
And it was here
'Cause you are the light by which I travel into this and that
You are the light
You are the light by which I travel into this and that
Yeah, I got busted
I painted a dirty word on your old man's Mercedes-Benz 'cause you told me to do it
Yeah, I got busted
But soon they released me 'cause the cops were sad
And they didn't know how to prove it
Oh, I saw your face in front of me
It was perfect clarity
I saw a light at the end of the tunnel
And it was here
'Cause you are the light by which I travel into this and that
You are the light
You are the light by which I travel into this and that
It's all so obvious, so obvious
Why would anyone need a map or a compass?
It's so beautiful
To be guided by you
'Cause you are the light
You are the light by which I travel into this and that
You are the light
You are the light by which I travel into this and that
You are the light, light
You are the light, light
I'm counting the days since I began to live without you
I'm covered in rain but it feels just like it's the sun
And it don't get me down, don't come around
You're better off leaving town
I'm fine here alone now without you
Hey!
I'm screaming at you
Hey!
Don't care enough to write you a letter now that I'm doing better alone
Hey!
I'm screaming at you
Hey!
Don't care enough to write you a letter now that I'm doing better,
Better off without you
You're stuck in a world of make-believe and I can see it
I gave it a chance, she must be crazy not to leave
You're never gonna bring me down, don't come around
You're better off leaving town
I'm fine here alone now without you
Hey!
I'm screaming at you
Hey!
Don't care enough to write you a letter now that I'm doing better alone
Hey!
I'm screaming at you
Hey!
Don't care enough to write you a letter now that I'm doing better,
Better off without you
Giving it up, now you're taking away
All of the time, now get out of my way
Never been lost in anyone, it's me they want
Without you I'm insane
So hear me now, screaming out your name
Hey!
I'm screaming at you
Hey!
Don't care enough to write you a letter now that I'm doing better alone
Hey!
I'm screaming at you
Hey!
Don't care enough to write you a letter now that I'm doing better,
Better off without you
Better off without you
'Cause I'm better off without you
I'm screaming at you
Hey!
Don't care enough to write you a letter now that I'm doing better,
Better off without you
I think we can fly and swallow fire
Blow smoke and hold our breath for as long as it takes
Every hello is goodbye
As we exchange strangers and lies
For estranged lovers and time all love ones get held up
So I can stop running and the air can hum
The busy sister's stunning, won't she be stunned
By the infinite parade of punk rock t-shirts on
When you can't break through
With the one that you want
If we survive, are we free of the dumb luck
That surrounds us and we get stuck between the places I messed up
So I can stop running and the air can hum
The busy sister's stunning, won't she be stunned
By the infinite parade of punk rock t-shirts on
When you can't break through
With the one that you want
No you can't you can not know you can't
You can not
Should I feel flattered that you hate everything but me.
When you can't break through
With the one that you want
No you can't, you can not know.
I was moving forward
From the point I've come from
I was rolling lowly
This is our song now
I was moving forward
From the point I've come from
I was rolling lowly
This is our song now
Gotta see it
Nothing means I gotta gotta
Feel it
Everything is out I gotta
Hold out
Everything is out I gotta
Day out
Just invite them
Gotta
Bore them
Till I take us out
I gotta feel like
Every single line
I gotta
Clean it out to the side
When we're not down and out
Put it back together
Put it back together
Put it back together
Put it back together
Put it back together (yeah yeah yeah x3)
Burning down the city
Warning out of something
But I need to find it
'Cause I got no sun down
Dug a whole was so fun
And a taste that's floating
What it doesn't meet no
Place to silent sleep now
I gotta feeling
Doesn't mean I sad because I
Love me
Everything around it isn't
Better
If you sing it loud and I
Jam myself to dawn
I got
So much dissing at the side and
When its
Just another ride and you
Sow yourself to the cat
Bet it
Put it back together
Put it back together
Put it back together
Put it back together
Put it back together (yeah yeah yeah x3)
The kids were shouting "Let us out!"
And their parents did
Then 2 years, then 3 years
Then show time and now they're making rock 'n' roll
Those kids are making progress now
They say "Hear us out!" in every town
They do it 1 mile by 1 mile at a time
Though it seems like every time I get a little bit closer
To what I want I land further away from where and when I was a little bit younger
If you still don't know how the cadence goes
We say:
This parade still marches on
Louder than it ever was
Right, left, right, c'mon
C'mon get up and just follow the tempo
Where streets filled with people
Sing on and on and on through the town
The beat goes on
The kids are yelling "Play the song
That I heard that once!
I don't know what it's called or how it goes
But it's all the same to me."
The girls are screaming "Let us in
Because we're what you want to solve all your problems for tonight
Because you're just so rock 'n' roll."
Though it seems like every time I get a little bit closer
To what I want I land further away from where and when I was a little bit younger
If you still don't know the way we roll
We go:
This parade still marches on
Louder than it ever was
Right, left, right, c'mon
C'mon get up and just follow the tempo
Where streets filled with people
They sing on and on and on through the town
The beat goes on
(Whoo)
Let's get back to tearing this place a new floor
Left, right, left, c'mon
C'mon get up and just follow the tempo
Streets filled with people
They sing on, on, they sing and on and on and on
The beat goes on
Well, you were there when the wall came down
A baby king with a grown man's crown
And we played in the sun as the curtain was tumbling
Well I was young and I could not see
That if you go won't you please take me
And you told me that I would forget you eventually
Yeah, yeah
I thought it was over but it's not
I thought it was over but it's not
I'm spinning in circles I can't stop
I thought it was over but it's not
I'm in love
With a fool
And you don't know what you've lost
It hurts from the bottom to the top
I thought it was over but it's not
Yeah
Another year and the job was done
The old republic was dead and gone
And the new way of living would be a reality
But it's a while since you shut that door
I lie awake ain't asleep no more
Though the nightmare is gone now I don't have a dream
I thought it was over but it's not
I thought it was over but it's not
I'm spinning in circles I can't stop
I thought it was over but it's not
I'm in love
With a fool
And you don't know what you've lost
It hurts from the bottom to the top
I thought it was over but it's not
Does anybody know?
Does anybody know?
Does anybody know?
I'm spinning in circles I can't stop
I thought it was over but it's not
I'm in love
With a fool
And you don't know what you've lost
It hurts from the bottom to the top
I thought it was over but it's not
All you have to do is touch my hand
To show me you understand
And something happens to me
That's some kind of wonderful
At any time my little world seems blue
I just have to look at you
And everything seems to be
Some kind of wonderful
I know I can't express
This feeling of tenderness
There's so much I wanna say
But the right words don't come my way
I only know when I'm in your embrace
And this world seems a better place
And something happens to me
There's some kind of wonderful
And it's wonderful, baby
It's wonderful
Oh, so divine
Hmmmm, yeah
I know I can't express
This feeling of tenderness
There's so much I wanna say
But the right words don't come my way
I only know when I'm in your embrace
And this world seems a better place
And something happens to me
You're like some kind of wonderful
And it's wonderful, baby
Whoaoaoooh
Oh, so divine
Whoaoh, baby
And it's wonderful baby, baby, baby, baby
I understand
And it's some kind of wonderful
And it's wonderful baby, baby, baby, baby, please
You know you're some kind of wonderful
Whoaoh, baby
So much I wanna say
Shimmering travellin' light, echoing love at first sight
Glimmering, Glistening, banishing the darkest night
Waiting for travellin' light
Though the sun has yet to appear
Inkling faint perception is near
Bloodied, battered in the dew
Leaves and trees are calling you
Waiting for travellin' light
Shimmering, travelling by
Magical waves just under the sky
It knows no time, it knows no bounds
Coming clear beneath the clouds
Destination here and now
I behold travellin' light
Shimmering, travelling by
Magical waves just under the sky
She knows no time, she knows no bounds
Waves of light are travelling
Cloak of night unravelling
I believe in travellin' light
Shimmering, travellin' light, echoing love at first sight
Glimmering, glistening, I'll see her tomorrow night
Waiting for my travellin' light
Shimmering travellin' light, echoing love at first sight
Glimmering, Glistening, banishing the darkest night
Waiting for travellin' light
Though the sun has yet to appear
Inkling faint perception is near
Bloodied, battered in the dew
Leaves and trees are calling you
Waiting for travellin' light
Shimmering, travelling by
Magical waves just under the sky
It knows no time, it knows no bounds
Coming clear beneath the clouds
Destination here and now
I behold travellin' light
Shimmering, travelling by
Magical waves just under the sky
She knows no time, she knows no bounds
Waves of light are travelling
Cloak of night unravelling
I believe in travellin' light
Shimmering, travellin' light, echoing love at first sight
Glimmering, glistening, I'll see her tomorrow night
Waiting for my travellin' light
You are a book for me to read
Line after line I read on and on
You are a film for me to see
A string of frames that just goes on and on and on
And of all the places that I've been
Name after name, it just goes on and on
You are a song for me to sing
A string of verses that goes on and on and on
You look like someone
Tongue-tied
Finding the word
Goodbye.
Baby, I hope that you get a clue,
Soon before you die.
You're only good when you're on your back.
You, evening virgin cotton nymph.
Then we'll see who's kiddin' who now.
You're an overpaid actress...
And it feels so down.
Yeah, I feel so down...
I'm an anthropophobic.
A wolf from the steps,
With pills in my coat
And wine on my breath.
A goodnight's rest on the floor,
Near the bed,
Where I rest my head.
Through the door, someone says,
"Let the dead bury the dead."
Unplugged the phone.
I stopped eating and sleeping.
Can't get over your love,
(Your love...)
I bought some drugs,
That I never heard of,
And asked what the damage was.
And it feels so down.
Yeah, I feel so down.
Yeah, I feel so down...
You're lost in your mind.
I believe that anyone can see it.
For only one time,
We can be together, if you want it.
(Evening virgin cotton nymph)
I know what you want,
But, baby, what you want I just don't got it.
(Through the door, someone says,
"Let the dead bury the dead.")
Get away from the door.
I heard you sell the truth but I don't buy it...
(And asked what the damage was)
And it feels so down.
(Unplugged the phone.
I stopped eating and sleeping.
Can't get over your love...)
Yeah, I feel so down.
(I bought some drugs
That I never heard of.
You're an overpaid actress...)
Yeah, I feel so down...
(Unplugged the phone.
I stopped eating and sleeping...)
Well, I don't want a thing to do with you kind
And I ain't got no time to kill on your dime
Strung up, hanging 'round
Looking like you're upside down
Well, I ain't wanting to shed no blood, that's your crime
And I ain't wanting to sling no mud, I clean it up
You ain't what I'd call a friend
I wouldn't even if I could pretend
Man, you ain't like anybody else
As night becomes the sun to rise
As dirt becomes the butterflies
As sure as though it always seems to stay the same
And I'll be waiting anxiously 
And I'll be falling fast asleep
And I'll be dreaming of the day the dream died
Uh huh
No sticks, no stones could break my bones like you can 
If I knew hate, I'd call it love for you, man
High up on the hill, cheaper than a dollar bill
Man, you ain't like anybody else
Should we pretend that it's the end?
Are you my curse or are you my friend?
And if we got hit to the end of the road
Will you be there to carry my load?
I'm getting it back with that terrible feeling 
My vision is cracked, but it looks like it's healing
I'm getting it back like it's four in the morning
When the sun only shines as if it's giving a warning
I'm getting it back with the rest of the leap year
I'm keeping the rabbit, the bat, and the reindeer
I'm getting it out, whatever I've gotta keep in
I'm telling the truth, said it don't win with pretend 
Should we pretend?
Should we pretend?
Should we pretend?
You've denied me baby,
The satisfaction of your love.
So I've been walking home alone,
Cause you left me out in the cold.
(He left you out, now I'll take you home)
I'll be here after midnight, wearing my beliquent frown.
But you know it won't be long before
I have to put your picture down.
(Just take it down, you gave her up)
I can't hear you baby,
When you tell me you don't want me now.
So I'll be hanging by the phone,
Though I know you'll never make the call.
(Don't make that call, he'll put you down)
Call me in the daylight, speaking of a future plan
But when you make demands
I know that I could never be your man
(They're not demands, they're just the plans)
One day baby, you'll realize that I know,
(Repeat 3x) 
I know, I know, I know, I know ...
Before I knew you baby,
I could have guessed that you'd be this way.
But it wouldn't stop my love,
Now I'm in a familiar place.
(He lost the scene, there's something wrong)
Feeling without re-costs,
Wish I could undo the time.
I was walking home alone,
So dejected by my own design.
If it's not over baby,
For me boy this is just the start.
I still got all my love to give,
Enough love to fill your empty heart.
(He emptied it, now fill it up)
Caring without pretense, a picnic on the hillside,
Clothes of many colors lying on the bedside,
Tokens of a lifetime
Memories I wanted
Wanted, wanted, wanted, wanted ...
Hear if you try, I'll tell you what you wanna
(Repeat 3x)
Wanna, wanna, wanna
Hear if you try, I'll tell you what you wanna
(Repeat 3x)
Wanna, wanna, wanna
One day baby, you'll realize that I know,
(Repeat 3x)
I know, I know, I know, I know.
Tore it up and walked away
Why'd you wanna go do that for?
Threw your Lego in
The lake
Why'd you wanna go do that for?
And you're a long time coming
A long time
Coming home
Do you see me reeling off the lines
I've seen your, I've seen your
Eyes
How can you grow old
You were my triumph?
How can you grow old
You were my
Triumph?
Turned your face into the squall
Why'd you wanna go do that for?
You carved
Your name into the wall
Why'd you wanna go do that for?
And you're a long time
Coming
A long time coming home
Do you see me reeling off the lines
I've seen your, I've
Seen your eyes
How can you grow old
You were my triumph?
How can you grow old
You were
My triumph?
Long ago in days of yore
It all began with a god named Thor.
There were Vikings and boats
And some plans for a furniture store.
It's not a bodega, it's not a mall
And they sell things for apartments smaller than mine
As if there were apartments smaller than mine
Ikea: just some oak and some pine and a handful of Norsemen
Ikea: selling furniture for college kids and divorced men
Everyone has a home
And if you don't have a home you can buy one there
So rent a car or take the bus
Lay your cash down and put your trust
In the land where the furniture folds to a much smaller size
Billy the bookcase says hello
And so does a table whose name is Ingo
And the chair is a ladder-back birch but his friends call him Karl
Ikea: just some oak and some pine and a handful of Norsemen
Ikea: selling furniture for college kids and divorced men
Everyone has a home
And if you don't have a home you can buy one there
Ikea: plywood, brushed steel
Ikea: meatballs, tasty
Ikea: Allen wrenches
All of them for free
All of them for me
I'm sorry I said Ikea sucks
I just bought a table for 60 bucks
And a chair and a lamp
And a shelf and some candles for you
I was a doubter just like you
Till I saw the American dream come true
In New Jersey, they got a god damned Swedish parade
Ikea: just some oak and some pine and a handful of Norsemen
Ikea: selling furniture for college kids and divorced men
Everyone has a home
But if you don't have a home you can buy one there
Vai no cabelereiro
No esteticista
Malha o dia inteiro
Pinta de artista
Saca dinheiro
Vai de motorista
Com seu carro esporte
Vai zoar na pista
Final de semana
Na casa de praia
Só gastando grana
Na maior gandaia
Vai pra balada
Dança bate estaca
Com a sua tribo
Até de madrugada
Burguesinha, burguesinha, burguesinha, burguesinha, burguesinha
Só no filé
Burguesinha, burguesinha, burguesinha, burguesinha, burguesinha

If you're down and confused
And you don't remember who you're talking to
Concentration slip away
Because your baby is so far away
Well, there's a road with a distant glow
And the eagle flies with the dove
And if you can't be with the one you love, honey
Love the one you're with
Love the one you're with
Love the one you're with
Love the one you're with
Don't be angry, don't be sad
And don't sit crying over good times you had
There's a girl right next to you
And she's just waiting for something to do
And there's a road with a distant glow
And eagle flies with the dove
And if you can't be with the one you love, honey
Love the one you're with
Love the one you're with
Love the one you're with
Do-do, do do, do do, do-do
Do-do, do do, do do, do-do
Do-do, do do, do do, do-do
Do-do-do, do-do-do
Love the one you're with
Love the one you're with
Love the one you're with
Love the one you're with
Turn your heartache right into joy
She's a girl and you're a boy
Get it together, make it nice
Ain't gonna need any more advice
And there's a rose in a fisted glove
And eagle flies with the dove
And if you can't be with the one you love, honey
Love the one you're with
Love the one you're with
Love the one you're with
Love the one you're with
Do-do, do do, do do, do-do
Do-do, do do, do do, do-do
Do-do, do do, do do, do-do
Do-do-do, do-do-do
I know you know, we don't see
And so our truths wait patiently
I walk the streets with a song in my head
(We ebb and we flow so)
Got my toes on my pup at the foot of my bed
(My heart always seems to know)
Now take the glitz back, I want the soul instead
'Cause I found some kind of fairytale
I used to hover outside my truth
Always worried 'bout what I'd lose
Take away my record deal
(Go on, I don't need it)
Spent the last two years getting to what's real
(And now I can see so clear)
I hope you feel just like I feel
I found some kind of fairytale
Want a garden by the ocean tide
'Cause I lose my way searching for stage lights
Well, Stevie knows and I thank her so
'Cause it's your seeds I sow
And now I know
Nolita flat on rent control
(That's the life I choose)
And you drag me to the fashion show
(The poses that I see through)
Ruby's in the afternoon
'Cause I found some kind of fairy... tale!
Hey!
A Nolita fairytale (Ba da da da da da, Ba da da da da da)
A Nolita fairytale (Ba da da da da da, Ba da da da da da)
A Nolita fairytale
A Nolita fairytale
A Nolita fairytale
Hey, we're coming out
Dancing downtown
Free like whatever we dream about
And we're moving through the night
Cruising across town,
Lost in the endless sound
And the sea's all right
But the streets are all safe
And you know deep down
You can find a better way
Tired of feeling bad
So don't you wonder why
You keep telling yourself it's all right
When the stars are shining on you
When the street lights are far beyond you
When the dream lights are turning on
Then you know where you are
When the stars are shining brighter
When your heart is beating lighter
When you love without desire
Then you know who you are
Hey, we're coming out!
Kids across town!
Dream like there's nothing to scream about
And we're riding through the night
Trying to get around
In love with the electric sound
But it never feels right
And it's never okay
'Cause we know that every night's gonna end some day
Tired of feeling bad
But don't you wonder why
You keep telling yourself it's all right
When the stars are shining on you
When the streetlights are far beyond you
When the dream lights are coming on
Then you know where you are
But the stars are feeling colder
If you believe in what they told you
You get older, and it's over
Do you know who you are?
When the stars are shining on you
When the streetlights are far beyond you
When the dream lights are turning on
Then you know where you are
And the stars are shining brighter
And your heart is feeling lighter
You could love without desire
Then you know who you are
Tell me something, do you love him, does he love you too
Like I love you
I know nature is beside me, when he's inside you
I feel it too
Here's a picture of my mother, there's no one like she
Bist du Fleischermeister?
studierst du Medizin?
Bist du ein Zugereister
oder kommst du aus Berlin?
Bist du Dominatrix
oder doch eher devot?
Bist du Pianistin
oder Hubschrauberpilot?
Es ist egal, was du bist
Hauptsache ist
es macht dich glücklich.
Es ist egal, was du bist
Hauptsache ist
es macht dich glücklich.
Bist du süchtig nach Liebe
oder bist du Misanthrop?
Bist du vielleicht ein Model
oder eher ein Zyklop?
Bist du gern im Schatten
oder immer tief gebräunt?
Bist du ein Gourmet,
bist du Imbissbudenfreund?
Es ist egal, was du bist
Hauptsache ist
es macht dich glücklich.
Es ist egal, was du isst
Hauptsache ist
es macht nicht dicklich.
Lass dir bloß keinen Scheiß andrehn
Das Leben ist schön
Es ist egal, was du bist
Hauptsache ist
es macht dich glücklich.
Es ist egal, was du fährst
Solang du nur klärst
es hat ein Rücklicht.
Und falls du mal kein Rücklicht hast
Dann nimm meine Taschenlampe
For six weeks I had this job
Cleaning the local hospital
The pay was o.k. but I didn't like to swab
So I changed it for a bass guitar
Bordedom was my companion
Stuck to me like glue
But I broke the bond
To make some dreams come true
Like a street to a hustler, a face to the soul
It's the one and the only place we control
It's our reality, not just a poem
It's a place that we call home
For some time I went to school
Tried to learn what's right and wrong
I didn't like their schemes, I couldn't buy their rules
So I went back to where I belong
You gotta love the sound
Of that guitar and the bass
The snare it sounds like a gunfire
It's like a thousand decibel punch in the face
Like a street to a hustler, a face to the soul
It's the one and the only place we control
It's our reality, not just a poem
It's a place that we call home
Like a street to a hustler, a face to the soul
It's the one and the only place we control
It's our reality, not just a poem
It's a place that we call home
East or West? well home is the best!
Though I sometimes feel like a clown
But I've also had the feeling. Yes!
That I'm unstoppable and that no one can bring me down
Like a street to a hustler, a face to the soul
It's the one and the only place we control
It's our reality, not just a poem
It's a place that we call home
Like a street to a hustler, a face to the soul
It's the one and the only place we control
It's our reality, not just a poem
It's a place that we call home
Step right in
Erase what's on your mind
Step right in
Leave everything behind
Leave it behind
Leave it behind
Leave it behind
I hear the bells 
Down in the canyons
It's snow in New York 
Some blue December
And I'm gone to the moon 
About you, girl
And I'm calling to you 
Throughout the world
And, well, I can (I can)
Hear the bells are ringing joyful and triumphant
And I can (I can)
Hear the bells are ringing joyful and triumphant and
I hear the bells
They are like emeralds
And glints in the night 
Commas and ampersands 
Your moony face 
So inaccessible 
Your inner mind 
So inexpressible 
I can (I can)
Hear the bells are ringing joyful and triumphant
And I can (I can)
Hear the bells are ringing joyful and triumphant and
Dum, dum, dum, dum-be-dum-dum
Dum, dum, dum, dum-be-dum-dum
I'm seeking girls 
In sales and marketing 
Let's go make out 
Up in the balcony 
Your business dress 
So businesslike
And I'm tossing the blouse 
Over a chairback
And I can (I can)
Hear the bells are ringing joyful and triumphant
And I can (I can)
Hear the bells are ringing joyful and triumphant
I can (I can)
Hear the bells are ringing joyful and triumphant
And I can (I can)
Hear the bells are ringing joyful and triumphant and
Dum, dum, dum, dum-be-dum-dum
Dum, dum, dum, dum-be-dum-dum
You snooze, you lose 
Well, I have snost and lost 
I'm pushing through 
I'll disregard the cost 
I hear the bells 
So fascinating
And I'll slug it out 
I'm sick of waiting
And I can (I can)
Hear the bells are ringing joyful and triumphant
And I can (I can)
Hear the bells are ringing joyful and triumphant
And I can (I can)
Hear the bells are ringing joyful and triumphant
And I can (I can)
Hear the bells are ringing joyful and triumphant
And I can (I can)
Hear the bells are ringing joyful and triumphant and
Dum, dum, dum, dum-be-dum-dum
Dum, dum, dum, dum-be-dum-dum
Dum, dum, dum, dum-be-dum-dum

Dum, dum, dum, dum-be-dum-dum
Dum, dum, dum, dum-be-dum-dum
Dum, dum, dum, dum-be-dum-dum
Dum, dum, dum, dum-be-dum-dum
Shed me from the universe, carry me from lies
It's been beautiful to find this point, I'm sure it will when it ends
Step into the corners, the darker colder corners fit best
Hang me from the ceilings, little mobile constellation lights
When the war ends, yeah
We'll wonder what it was about
And when we grow old, yeah
We'll all wonder how we missed out
I've got soulful days to counter evil ways
Will we need it, will we need it?
When the war ends, yeah
We'll wonder what it was about
And when we grow old, yeah
No one will ever miss you, so you know that you'll not be missed
Closer to the clouds than all the people ever cared to see
Closer to the mountains, woods, oceans, and rivers and trees
Closer to the soulful days that counters all our evil ways
I've got soulful days to counter evil ways
Will we need it, will we need it?
When the war ends, yeah
We'll wonder what it was about
And when we grow old, yeah
We'll all wonder how we missed out
I'll bring you all along with me
Bring you all along with me
Bring you all along with me
Bring you all along with me
When the war ends, yeah
We'll wonder what it was about
I've got soulful days to counter evil ways
Will we need it, will we need it?
When the war ends, yeah
We'll wonder what it was about
And when we grow old, yeah
We'll all wonder how we missed out
You can walk my path
You can wear my shoes
Let her talk like me
And be an angel too
But maybe
You ain't never gonna feel this way
You ain't never gonna know me
But I know you...
Teach you now that
Things can only get better
Can only get, can only get
They get on from here
You know, I know that
Things can only get better
I sometimes lose myself in me
I lose track of time
And I can't see the woods for the trees
You set them alight, burning the bridges as you go
I'm too weak to fight you
I got my personal health to deal with
And you say
Walk my path
Wear my shoes
Talk like me
I'll be an angel and
Things can only get better
Can only get better
Now I've found you
(That means me)
(Will you teach me now)
Things can only get better
Can only get better
Now I've found you
And you and you...
You... show me prejudice and greed
You show me how
I must learn to deal with this disease
I look at things now
In a different light than I did before
I found the cause
And I think that you could be my cure
And you say
Walk your path
Wear your shoes
Talk like that
I'll be an angel too
Things can only get, can only get
Things can only get, can only get
Things can only get, can only get
Things can only get, can only get
Witchcraft, voodoo
Love experiments and face burning
Potions, lotion, perfume to find you
Good men come to those who wait
I think I've found my baby
Good men come to those who wait
I think I've found my baby
Oh, my heart ached, but I know fate
Would send you my way
And when you came my heart was saved
I've known you for lifetimes, baby
I've fallen for you
I'm feeling a déjà vu
(Déjà vu)
I've fallen for you
Now I've got nothing to lose
(Déjà vu, déjà vu
Déjà vu, déjà vu)
Moments in time
I'm yours and you're mine
Two souls, one heart
Two souls, one heart
Good men come to those who wait
I think I've found my baby
Good men come to those who wait
I think I've found my baby
I've fallen for you
I'm feeling a déjà vu
(Déjà vu)
I've fallen for you
Now I've got nothing to lose
(Déjà vu, déjà vu)
In love you'll always find
Two of a kind, baby
And in your lovin' arms
Here we are, livin' the dream
In love you'll always find
Two of a kind, baby
And in your lovin' arms
Here we are, livin' the dream
I've fallen for you
I'm feeling a déjà vu
(Déjà vu)
I've fallen for you
Feeling the love and I'll set it loose
(Déjà vu)
I've fallen for you
Now I've got nothing to lose
Déjà vu
When your working is done
And you have nothing left to lose
Why don't you just roll away
That stone that's locked you up?
When your pattern is full
And it feels like there's no place to land
When will you all run out of gas?
Yeah, it happened so fast
Leaving town for sell to pal
I recall only nights that we built
With our hands and feet, making peace
With the voice in our head
That ghost just stop
Won't lie dead, it just bleeds
Let the prophet rebound
Let his riddle rub on to my pride
I'm just to hollow inside
Let it echo in time just to get it
Through my head and mouth
Through the gorgeous light of the sun
And which I could never outrun
Even if my perdition were just in front
The sun's got my shine
The sun's got my pride
I could run but I'd never
Live without your light
The sun's got my shine
The sun's got my pride
I could run but I'd never
Live without your light
Live without your light
Live without your light
Live without your light
When your working is done
And you've got nothing left to lose
Why don't you just roll away
That stone that's locked you up in your blues?
The room calls to me, says we're all strung out
(And the beat we both stomp on the floor)
While outside the leopard frogs sing sweetly
These are the hymns that today we've ignored
And all across the desert, and all up in the mountains:
A wind so loud that we might never mention
And heres to my lovers hands and feet
They are the roots that will weave through the floor
And down in the dirt, in her wandering
Find the snail to give us breath, to give us words
He asks us for our patience, he asks us for our patience
And he asks us what we have done for our souls lately
Down by the bur oak tree, I had lost your locket in the loam
And there fell to my knees, neath the coil and the brush of the fern
The candles light dances across the table
And will burn at the tip of my pen
And lures all the moths into the kitchen
To spin tales and bend truths through the evening
And scribe for them their stories; we scribe for them their stories
While they wax and wax of their lives in the country
Down by the bur oak tree, I had lost your locket in the loam
And there fell to my knees, neath the coil and the brush of the fern
A slaveship
Lost at sea
A slaveship
Lost at sea
And I'm drownin'
Your water's deep
I'm drownin'
Your water's deep
The spaceship
In the country
A spaceship
In the country
And we're flying
Into green
We're flying
Into green
I told you a thousand times
(I told you a thousand times)
I sold you a thousand lines
(I sold you a thousand lines)
I love you
Will you marry me?
I love you
Will you marry me?
City
There's an empty street
The city
There's an empty street
And we're dancin'
To the lonely beat
We're dancin'
To the lonely beat
Your building
Is where we meet
Your building
Is where we meet
And I'm hungry
Let's get something to eat
I'm hungry
Let's get something to eat
I told you a thousand times
(I told you a thousand times)
I sold you a thousand lines
(I sold you a thousand lines)
I love you
Would you marry me?
I love you
Would you marry me?
Your daddy
He ain't like me
Your daddy
He ain't like me
I'm striving
Someone to be
I'm striving
I got a degree
One day girl
You will be my queen
One day girl
I will be your king
And we'll reign in
Our castle supreme
We'll reign in
Our castle supreme
'Cause I told you a thousand times
(Told you a thousand times)
I sold you a thousand lines
(Sold you a thousand lines)
I love you
Will you marry me?
I love you
Will you marry me?
I told you a thousand times
(I told you a thousand times)
I sold you a thousand lines
(I sold you a thousand lines)
I love you
Will you marry me?
I love you
Will you marry me?
I talk a lot of (shh) when I'm drinking, baby,
I'm known to go a little too fast.
Don't mind all my friends, I know they're all crazy,
But they're the only friends that I have.
I know I don't know you,
But I'd like to skip the small talk and romance, girl.
That's all I have to say so, baby, can we dance?
Here we go again, another drink I'm caving in,
And stupid words keep falling from my mouth.
You know that I mean well,
My hands were meant for somewhere else.
Your eyes are doing naughty butterflies
Oh, oh, one more drink and I should go,
Oh, oh, but maybe she might like me though.
Oh, oh, I just can't think of what to say,
Should I go, should I stay?
Just can't let her slip away.
I talk a lot of (shh) when I'm drinking, baby,
I'm known to go a little too fast.
Don't mind all my friends, I know they're all crazy,
But they're the only friends that I have.
I know I don't know you,
But I'd like to skip the small talk and romance, girl.
That's all I have to say so, baby, can we dance?
I was nearly in, but then came the pushy friend,
Killed the vibe and took my perfect ten away.
You know I need you, girl,
My heart's not made for someone else.
So save me here 'cause I can barely stand.
Oh, oh, one more drink and I should go,
Oh, oh, but maybe she might like me though.
Oh, oh, I can't take this any more,
Should I stay? Should I go?
It just can lead back to her door.
I talk a lot of (shh) when I'm drinking, baby,
I'm known to go a little too fast.
Don't mind all my friends, I know they're all crazy,
But they're the only friends that I have.
I know I don't know you,
But I'd like to skip the small talk and romance, girl.
That's all I have to say so, baby, can we dance?
I've been a bad, bad boy
Whispering rude things in her ear,
Please say she'll break,
Please say she'll change
Her mind and bring me back to her place.
I talk a lot of (shh) when I'm drinking, baby,
I'm known to go a little too fast.
Don't mind all my friends, I know they're all crazy,
But they're the only friends that I have.

I know I don't know you,
But I'd like to skip the small talk and romance, girl.
That's all I have to say so, baby, can we dance?
I never saw you up there
'Cause you never made a sound
If I knew what you were up to
I would've shot you down
Hey, wouldcha say
I'm on the rebound
Watch me fall
At the speed of sound
Your trigger finger's cocked, and I'm feeling weak
Open wide, I'm paralyzed
You were working on the inside
Disconnecting the alarm
I was messing up your signals
Trying to turn me off
Hey, wouldcha say
I'm on the rebound
Watch me fall
At the speed of sound
Your trigger finger's cocked, and I'm feeling weak
Open wide, I'm paralyzed
Over the hills the frequency's breaking down
Don't wanna guess, but I think it's time we turned around
I'm soft, but I'll be all right
Soft, yeah, I'll be all right
Soft, yeah, I'll be all right
Soft...
Hey, wouldcha say
I'm on the rebound
Watch me fall
At the speed of sound
Your trigger finger's cocked, and I'm feeling weak
Open wide, I'm paralyzed
We're getting high, but we're still feeling down
Gravity has a way of pinning us to the ground
I'm soft, but I'll be all right
Soft, yeah, I'll be all right
Soft, yeah, I'll be all right
Soft, yeah, I'll be all right
Lonely
I'm just lonely
I'm just lonely
I'm just lonely
Je m'baladais sur l'avenue le coeur ouvert à l'inconnu
J'avais envie de dire bonjour à n'importe qui
N'importe qui et ce fut toi, je t'ai dit n'importe quoi
Il suffisait de te parler, pour t'apprivoiser
Aux Champs-Elysées, aux Champs-Elysées
Au soleil, sous la pluie, à midi ou à minuit
Il y a tout ce que vous voulez aux Champs-Elysées
Tu m'as dit "J'ai rendez-vous dans un sous-sol avec des fous
Qui vivent la guitare à la main, du soir au matin"
Alors je t'ai accompagnée, on a chanté, on a dansé
Et l'on n'a même pas pensé à s'embrasser
Aux Champs-Elysées, aux Champs-Elysées
Au soleil, sous la pluie, à midi ou à minuit
Il y a tout ce que vous voulez aux Champs-Elysées
Hier soir deux inconnus et ce matin sur l'avenue
Deux amoureux tout étourdis par la longue nuit
Et de l'Étoile à la Concorde, un orchestre à mille cordes
Tous les oiseaux du point du jour chantent l'amour
Aux Champs-Elysées, aux Champs-Elysées
Au soleil, sous la pluie, à midi ou à minuit
Il y a tout ce que vous voulez aux Champs-Elysées
Aux Champs-Elysées, aux Champs-Elysées
Au soleil, sous la pluie, à midi ou à minuit
Il y a tout ce que vous voulez aux Champs-Elysées
Aux Champs-Elysées, aux Champs-Elysées
Au soleil, sous la pluie, à midi ou à minuit
Il y a tout ce que vous voulez aux Champs-Elysées
Sancho brought a message from the Fat Man
"Sorry, boy, to leave you high and dry,
But I went to see my mom in Ensenada,
And I left a little something to help the time go by
Just a little something to help to keep you high"
Bananas and Blow (oh - oh), Bananas and Blow
Stuck in my cabana, living on Bananas and Blow
Now the rainy season reminds me of Maria
The way she danced, the color of her hair
Now I'm locked inside a stall at the cantina
Eating the bananas and the cocaine off the mirror
Looking for a ticket to take me away from here
Bananas and Blow (oh - oh), Bananas and Blow
Stuck in my cabana, living on Bananas and Blow
(Guitar solo)
Bananas and Blow (oh - oh), Bananas and Blow
Stuck in my cabana, living on Bananas and Blow
Hey, hey
Hey, hey
Hey
Hey, hey
Hey, hey
If you leave,
Where will you go?
Before the regret you hold in your heart,
Will start to show
If you leave,
How will you know?
If our ever after ever had a chance to grow.
Do you dream or do you sleep?
Do you pick and choose amongst the jewels for one to keep
Do you wish upon a star?
Or does everything just out of reach seem just too far away
Nothin' seems to change
Let alone you won't forget my name
Just don't lose what you know
Just don't lose what you know
When you're so far away
So deep you say
And no matter where you go
It all ends up the same
Do you wish upon a star
Or does everything just out of reach seem just too far away
Nothin' seems to change
Let alone you won't forget my name
Just don't lose what you know
Just don't lose what you know
When you're so far away
What you lose is what you know
Where you go is where you grow
How near we've come is yet to show
We've come so close yet so far away
So far away
What did I do to you?
What did I do to you?
What did I do to you?
What did I do to you?
Nothin' seems to change
Let alone you won't forget my name
Just don't lose what you know
Just don't lose what you know
When I'm so far away.
What did I do to you?
So far away
What did I do to you?
So far away
What did I do to you?
So far away
What did I do to you?
So far away
What did I do to you?
So far away
Vous etiez l'evidence, vous n'etes plus que l'enigme
Vous etiez l'evidence, vous n'etes plus que l'enigme
Vous etiez l'eternite, vous n'etes que du passe
Vous etiez l'eternite, vous n'etes que du passe
Vous etiez l'evidence, vous n'etes plus que l'enigme
Vous etiez l'evidence, vous n'etes plus que l'enigme
Vous etiez l'eternite, vous n'etes que du passe
Vous etiez l'eternite, vous n'etes que du passe
To all the people underground
Listening to the sound
Of the living people walking up and down the graves
Well one of them is mine
I visited my Fraulein
She's only one step away
To all the people underground
Listening to the sound
Of the living people breathing the air today
Well one of them is mine
I'm visiting my Fraulein
She's only one breath away
And I say...
Too all the people underground
Listening to a sound
Of the living people living their lives away
Well one of them is mine
I visited my Fraulein
She's only one life away
She's only one life away
Didn't I tell you everything is possible in this déjà vu?
Try the river boat, the carousel, feed the pigeons, Bar-B-Q
Look at all the people, happy faces all around.
Smiling, throwing kisses, busy making lazy sounds.
It's a bright June afternoon, it never gets dark.
Wah-wah! Here come the sun
Get your green green tambourine, let's play in the park.
Wah-wah! Here comes the sun
Some folks are on blankets, slowly daydreaming and reaching for their food
Let's go buy an ice-cream and a magazine with an attitude and put on a cassette,
We can pretend that you're a star 'cause life's so very simple just like la-la-la
It's a bright June afternoon, it never gets dark.
Wah-wah! Here come the sun
Get your green green tambourine, let's play in the park.
Wah-wah! Here comes the sun
There's a painter painting his masterpiece
There are some squirrels jumping in the trees.
There's a wide-eyed boy with a red balloon.
All my life I've longed for this afternoon.
It's a bright June afternoon, it never gets dark.
Wah-wah! Here come the sun
Get your green green tambourine, let's play in the park.
Wah-wah! Here comes the sun
It's a bright June afternoon, let's play in the park.
Wah-wah! Here come the sun
Get your green green tambourine, it never gets dark.
Wah-wah! Here comes the sun
Forget all your politics for a while
Let the color schemes arise
Come on board, it's a curious sight
Absorbing sound that's never been right
Never ahead of, never behind it
Occasionally guarded, just keeps us surrounded
In its love
Everything's gonna get lighter, even if it never gets better
I propose a less serious vote
Don't mistake for a party of jokes
You are never ahead of, never behind us
Floating in circles, there's more to remind 'em of less
Everything's gonna get lighter, even if it never gets better
Forget all your politics for a while
Let the color schemes arrive
Whenever God shines his light on me
Opens up my eyes so I can see
When I look up in the darkest night
I know everything's going to be alright
In deep confusion, in great despair
When I reach out for him he is there
When I am lonely as I can be
I know that God shines his light on me
Reach out for him, he'll be there
With him your troubles you can share
If you live the life you love
You get the blessing from above
He heals the sick and heals the lame
Says you can do it too in Jesus name
He'll lift you up and turn you around
And put your feet back on higher ground
Reach out for him, he'll be there
With him your troubles you can share
You can use his higher power
In every day and any hour
He heals the sick and heals the lame
Says you can do it too in Jesus name
He'll lift you up and turn you around
And put your feet back on higher ground.
You'll take me on a journey
And be there till the end
It won't be an uphill struggle
On you I can depend
You promised me a dream home
With roses round the door
You'll cover me in diamonds
There's nothing I want more and
You'll be strong and you'll turn me on
But I've got my doubts and what if I'm right?
You'll be true and be faithful too
But I've got my doubts and what if I'm right?
What if I'm right?
'Cause if the rain starts falling
You'll protect me with your coat
And you'll always tape the football
And let me watch my soap
You'll always be as handsome
And your weight will never gain
And when I give birth to our children
I will feel no pain and
You'll bring me flowers and you'll bring the showers
But I've got my doubts and what if I'm right?
You'll say I'm thin and bring the washing in
But I've got my doubts and what if I'm right?
What if I'm right?
You'll always keep the magic
The tender love and care
And when you need to change the light bulb
You won't hand me the chair
And when we're tired of the city
And we find a country home
You'll sell your vinyl records
And go get us a loan
You'll be my sympathetic lover and won't steal the covers
But I've got my doubts and what if I'm right?
You won't forsake me, your mother won't hate me
But I've got my doubts and what if I'm right?
You'll be strong and you'll turn me on
But I've got my doubts and what if I'm right?
You'll be true and be faithful too
But I've got my doubts and what if I'm right?
What if I'm right?
City sounds are floating around
I'm sitting on my doorstep
Watching the world go 'round
When the crowd is dragging you down
I'll give you my street address
We'll take a ride downtown
The sun is out
The sun is out
So come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, check it out
The sun is out
The sun is out
So come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, check it out
The sun is out
The sun is out
So come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, check it out
The sun is out
The sun is out
So come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, check it out
The sun is out
The sun is out
So come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, check it out
There I was, it happened fast
I was tired, out of gas
Talk about, taking breaks
Life's too short to play it safe
And in every way, you know I just want you to stay
Beats something else, you know I never worry about myself
And in every way, I know that you still want to stay
And that's got to be the way it is
For awhile (for awhile)
I was stuck (I was stuck)
I'll admit I was short on luck
You were bright, like a new day
All my troubles, went away
And in every way you know I just want you to stay
Beats something else, you know I never worry about myself
And in every way, I know you still want to stay
And that's got to be the way it is
I am your love
There is no other voice
I want to hear but yours
Whispering vocal chords
In a dream that I had
I was cruel, I was truly mad
I woke up filled with fear
I went away, 'cause you were near
But in every way you know I just want you to say
Beats something else, you know I never think about myself
And in every way, I know that you still want to stay
And that's got to be, because I never even think of making it
In every way, you know I just want you to stay
And that's got to be the way it is.
I'm not harmonic
I can't reach self-esteem
That's quite ironic
'Cause I thought I'd be living my dream
I don't feel supersonic
I don't drive in the lane of whipped cream
I'm more like a chronic
Ignorantly swimming upstream
What can I do to be happy?
I have problems to decide
When it looks to me the grass is greener on the other side
On the other side, on the other side, on the other side
How do I live for the moment
When I always wanna be else where?
How do I reach fullfilment
When I'm crashed and got parts to repair?
Why is my only amusement
Giving other people my despair?
Why do I give jealous judgement
On another's affair?
What can I do to be happy?
I have problems to decide
When it looks to me the grass is greener on the other side
On the other side, on the other side, on the other side
I wanna get satisfaction
Just like the Stones and Manu Chao
Gotta ignore all rejection
I gotta keep trying anyhow
I wanna be close to the action
I wanna live my life now
For this correction I need direction
Gotta find it within myself somehow
So maybe one day I'll be happy?!
But until then I have to realize
That the grass is not always greener
It's only up to me to recognize
That the grass is not always greener
It's in your head it might look grenner
'Cause the grass will never be greener on the other side
On the other side, on the other side, on the other side
Too much patience, no resistance.
Within shouting distance, you can hear a blind man's bluff.
Dragging names through the mud, instead of biting his tongue.
The devil's in the air and I'm spitting out prayers,
While the rubbernecks all get their fill.
Tell me, tell me a story.
Tell me not to worry,
Or pick up the phone.
So I'm turning, turning a deaf ear,
So that I don't hear,
Them throwing stones.
Too much hogwash, not enough hearsay.
Always made the front page,
He could use a fine tooth comb.
To get a word from the wise,
Would be a welcome surprise.
Keep an ear to the ground so to drown out the sound,
Cause the dead air is what makes me whole.
Tell me, tell me a story.
Tell me not to worry,
Or pick up the phone.
So I'm turning, turning a deaf ear,
So that I don't hear,
Them throwing stones.
These walls don't talk,
Even when somebody knocks.
These walls don't stand,
For anyone else but themselves.
These walls won't fall,
Even when gravity's failing us all.
Tell me, tell me a story.
Tell me not to worry,
Or pick up the phone.
So I'm turning, turning a deaf ear,
So that I don't hear,
Them throwing stones.
There's a town I know called Nevers.
No nevers,
Never wasn't was what it weren't
When it wasn't once. Knew Nevers,
Knew Nevers.
Nothing never I'll ever learnt.
There's a village I visit, that's Vaguely.
Sorta vaguely...
Vaguely!: yes I seem to recall.
Though it's unclear, clearly: Vaguely.
Very vaguely
Can't say it's been there once and for all.
I put back on my overshoes
And got in my Renault
The trips reset so I'm unsure
How far it is to go
But then it hits me (slap):
I've left it off my map.
There's a city I saw signed Something.
Must be something,
Something never quite so defined.
So much so how somewhere something
(Though some sing)
So to speak's the uncertain kind.
In an index looked up Where-it-Was.
Exactly where it was,
Just in fact to make sure I can't
Set a course straight through to Where-It-Ain't.
And Where-It-Ain't:
Ain't gotten to except at a slant.
I put on my new black boots
And pack up my citroen.
And out of town it huffs and puffs
I set off there alone.
And then it hits me (slap):
I've left it off my map
There's a place I passed called Once-Upon-a-Time,
Tiny Once-Upon-a-Time.
Never wasn't weren't what it was.
Set the clock back twice or once upon a time,
In Once-Upon-a-Time,
Never knew when it wasn't there because.
Go down to the sea
And tell me what it is that you wanna be
I said go, down to the sea
And tell me what it is that you wanna be
Gonna' take this boat and drive it out into the sea
Gonna' fly this place so high that I won't know what's real
Gonna' paint the sky so red that I won't wanna feel
What my mama and my daddy said was real
'Cause I can feel it, I can see it,
Yeah I wanna show anybody who wants to see it
'Cause I can feel it,
And I won't be there to see
Got something, got something to say
Got something, got something to say
Can you see it in your thoughts?
Can you reach it does it make you wanna walk
Can you taste it any feeling that you got
Tell me something over nothing ain't so wrong
'Cause I can feel it, I can see it,
Yeah I wanna show anybody who wants to see it
'Cause I can feel it,
And I won't be there to see
What you, don't know
Is that I'm feeling strong
I'll have my eyes set on you
Forever
Got something, got something to say
Got something, got something to say
Got something, got something to say
Got something, got something to say
Got something if you only, only, only stay
I know I've got to try
To look to better days
Well I don't feel right
Yeah, you know it's not the same
The weather here was nice
But the sun has gone away
Tell me why those clear skies so suddenly have changed
I don't know where I am going
I just hope I'm not alone
Oh I hope I'm not alone
Cause there is space
There is room for me
To sheltered from the cold, who really knows
Who really knows
Lets forget about the rain
Don't let your worries wash you away
Lets forget about the rain
Hold onto the calm before the storm came
When the sky is overcast
The clouds the darkest gray
I remember what I had
Oh I dream of yesterday
So caught up in the past
The memories don't fade
I know this wont last, in the past I can't stay
I don't know where I am going
I just hope I'm not alone
Oh I hope I'm not alone
Cause there is space
There is room for me
To sheltered from the cold, who really knows
Who really knows
Lets forget about the rain
Don't let your worries wash you away
Lets forget about the rain
Hold onto the calm before the storm came
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Soon the sky will clear
And dry up all your tears
And the sun will come to shine on you again
They will disappear
And so will all your fears
And the storm that you've been hiding from will end
End
Lets forget about the rain
Don't let your worries wash you away
Lets forget about the rain
Hold onto the calm before the storm came
Lets forget about the rain - x6
Oh, oh, I love you so
Uh, uh, can't let you go
Ooh, ooh, don't tell me no

Oh, gee, the way you kiss
Sweedee, too good to miss
Wow-whee, want more of this

Oh, wow, you better stay
Pow, pow, don't run away

Flowers grow through my window and I love you again

Flowers in the love of my arms
Its God shining through to me I guess
Its God shining through to me I guess

I am out here looking for you
Sometimes I pretend
Oh I miss you oh

Into your beautiful garden
Flowers and the love in my arms
Is God playing evil tricks on me
Is God playing evil tricks on me
Oh I love you Amy
Do you still love me

The only thing that he has left
The only thing at all
The only thing at all
In later hours when the packed
Bars start spitting cowards
They're picking scars
Cell phones clenched along
Along the sidewalk
They usually stay out of our way
The bridge and tunnel just seems to escape near our home
Near our home
In later hours when the packed
Bars start spitting cowards
They're picking scars
Cell phones clenched along
Along the sidewalk
They usually stay out of our way
The bridge and tunnel just seems to escape near our home
Near our home
There is no one else around
Been waiting for countless hours
Oh, you never, you never measure up
C-c-c-'cause, baby, it will all soon come to an end
C-c-c-'cause, baby, it will all soon come to an end
In later hours when the packed

I'm gonna be round my vegetables
I'm gonna chow down my vegetables
I love you most of all
My favorite vega-table
If you brought a big brown bag of them home
I'd jump up and down and hope you'd toss me a carrot
I'm gonna keep well my vegetables
Cart off and sell my vegetables
I love you most of all
My favorite vega-table
I tried to kick the ball but my tennie flew right off
I'm red as a beet 'cause I'm so embarrassed
(Mom and daddy says) Sleep a lot, eat a lot, brush 'em like crazy
Run a lot, do a lot, never be lazy (boy)

I threw away my candy bar and I ate the wrapper (wink, wink)
And when they told me what I did I burst into laughter

Run a lot, do a lot, never be lazy (boy)
Sleep a lot, eat a lot, brush 'em like crazy

We sailed up a river wide as a sea
And slept on the banks
On the leaves of a banyan tree
And all of these spirit voices rule the night
Some stories are magical, meant to be sung
Song from the mouth of the river
When the world was young
And all of these spirit voices rule the night
By moon
We walk
To the brujo's door
Along a path of river stone
Women with their nursing children
Seated on the floor
We join the fevers
And the broken bones
The candlelight flickers
The falcon calls
A lime-green lizard scuttles down the cabin wall
And all of these spirit voices
Sing rainwater, sea water
River water, holy water
Wrap this child in mercy - heal her
Heaven's only daughter
All of these spirit voices rule the night
My hands were numb
My feet were lead
I drank a cup of herbal brew
Then the sweetness in the air
Combined with the lightness in my head
And I heard the jungle breathing in the bamboo
Saudac~oes                      		(Greetings!)

Que amanh~a                     		(That tomorrow)
Ser'a tudo ou ser'a naoa        	        (It will be all or it will)

Na for,ca do amanh~a            	        (In the power of tomorrow)
Lord of the earthquake
My trembling bed
The spider resumes the rhythm
Of his golden thread
And all of these spirit voices rule the night
If you wanna be happy for the rest of your life
Never make a pretty woman your wife
So from my personal point of view
Get an ugly girl to marry you
If you wanna be happy for the rest of your life
Never make a pretty woman your wife
So from my personal point of view
Get an ugly girl to marry you
A pretty woman makes her husband feel small
And very often causes his downfall
As soon as he marries her then she starts
To do the things that will break his heart
But if you make an ugly woman your wife
You'll be happy for the rest of your life
An ugly woman cooks meals on time
She'll always give you peace of mind
If you wanna be happy for the rest of your life
Never make a pretty woman your wife
So from my personal point of view
Get an ugly girl to marry you
Don't let your friends say you have no taste
Go ahead and marry anyway
Though her face is ugly, her eyes don't match
Take it from me, she's a better catch
If you wanna be happy for the rest of your life
Never make a pretty woman your wife
So from my personal point of view
Get an ugly girl to marry you
Say man!
Hey baby!
I saw your wife the other day!
Yeah?
Yeah, an' she's ugly!
Yeah, she's ugly, but she sure can cook, baby!
Yeah, alright!
If you wanna be happy for the rest of your life
Never make a pretty woman your wife
So from my personal point of view
Get an ugly girl to marry you
If you wanna be happy for the rest of your life
Never make a pretty woman your wife
So from my personal point of view
Get an ugly girl to marry you
If you wanna be happy for the rest of your life
Never make a pretty woman your wife
So from my personal point of view
Get an ugly girl to marry you
If you wanna be happy for the rest of your life
Never make a pretty woman your wife
So from my personal point of view
Get an ugly girl to marry you
Back in the days of depression

Hey, there's nothing in my art
I'd rather be cool than be smart
Hey, what I'm thinking of
I'd rather be cool than be loved
Here's what I feel, ba ba ba ba
Just want a girl as cool as Kim Deal
Hey, I thought that you were tough
Well I've had it too, had it rough
Hey, I don't care if I'm wrong
'Cause right always takes too long
Here's what is real, ba ba ba ba
Just want a girl as cool as Kim Deal
Oh

Drank the dark wine of the New York night
My shattered mind across the borderline
Spent the night in someone else's arms
Shed your love, shed your love
Shed your love, shed your love
On a subway train before the dawn
The ride was short but my thoughts were long
Couldn't figure what got in to me
Shed your love, shed your love
Shed your love, shed your love
Headed out to leave it all behind
Escape it all to see what I could find
Told you on the phone across the sea
Shed your love, shed your love
Shed your love, shed your love
Fell off of the plane in Amsterdam
Shop the streets to find out who I am
Come on back to me, reality
Shed your love, shed your love
Shed your love, shed your love
Home again to find that you were gone
On a subway train before the dawn
Said that you couldn't stay and wait for me
Shed your love, shed your love
Shed your love, shed your love
Drank the dark wine of the New York night
My shattered mind across the borderline
Spent the night in someone else's arms
Shed your love, shed your love
Shed your love, shed your love
Shed your love, shed your love
Oh I love this house, I love this house
Gives me the greatest peace I've ever known
Oh I love to hear those conkers fall
Smash on morning Southwark stone
And I love that here you live with me
Gives me the greatest peace I've ever known
'Cause I've been too long a lonely man
Yes I've been too long a rolling stone
So let seasons turn
Grow paradise gardens
End to my migration
The native has returned
Oh I love the curling of your hair
Gives me the greatest peace I've ever known
I see Dylan Thomas in your face
Recite Butler Yeats there in your grace
So let seasons turn
Grow paradise gardens
End to my migration
The native has returned
And if I had to die today
Scatter my ashes on this place
And I'll live on in your grieving heart
But until that day that we depart
Oh, this is the greatest peace I've ever known (x3)
Only your love makes house a home
(Primo mixing - Noreaga talking)
(CNN, CNN, Capone and Noreaga, you know what I'm sayin')
(The invincible, untouchable, CNN)
For all the niggas who keep askin, when CNN gonna do a joint with Premier
Ha, we did it, we here now, y'all niggas can stop askin
Go cop the fuckin' album, The Reunion
(The invincible, untouchable, CNN)
(The invincible, untouchable, CNN)
But right now, CNN and Premier nigga, do it like this nigga
(Noreaga)
Yo, yo Melvin Flynt drop, my whole collasso stop
I can't believe I fucked up and made a half-ass album
My excuse is, my pops just died, and I ain't wanna make music
My pops just died
My fans stuck with me, my shit still went gold
I got a habit just to drive, gettin' head and I roam
CNN, we like the Grand Royal, I write rhymes with the Coke oil
Yo, Apollo heat
See me, sell ??? right with ??? creep
Got out the club, seen the police, ??? deep
I'm like Frank Mathis, see me blow my dough
And any bitch givin' head, if she blow I know
Oh no, we had to go see Premo
Taped it up, The Reunion, a brand new cut
Up in D&D, stayin with some rats and some sluts
From the projects, she know we need our welfare cut
(Chorus - Primo mixing CNN)
CNN, Network Channel 10
Yo, it's all reality
I'm in it to win it, sit back picture that
Yo respect it, the legacy'll never end
CNN, Network Channel 10
Yo, it's all reality

Yo respect it, the legacy'll never end
(Capone)
Premo, what up man
Yo, I'm not rowdy but I bang niggas and I pop collas
I grind for the top dollars, fight rotweilers
Put my hand on the Bible, tell it to the judge
I'm a lie for my dunn, take it in blood
I'm dot com, I drop bombs, kill ya squad
Live like I'm still in the yard till I pop ya god
For my niggas in the Bridge, with the 50 dollar Panasonics and the blank 8's
Who rap chronic collab jake
Whether we have not or have cake
We got gas to get that straight, we movin at a fast rate
My last case I got bail
My first one, man did indicted, how I write it, sister can't stand it
I smoke bud, get pissy, who could flow with me
Staggerin, bang like the wild Aficans
Spit gutter on a Premo beat, for the love of the street
The only child, my little brother was he
(Noreaga)
Yo, yo, my thugs is bilingual
You see my shit speak Spanish
Disappearing acts make your whole team vanish
From coast to coast I got them things
Badda-boom-badda-bing, he the glorious king
Another album, another plaque, another ounce and another mac
Another chromed out gat
Another place to face where I lace you at
I put all type a wholes in ya face black
(Capone)
Yo, yo, who think I don't got it?
I'm like workin with a bird, I got long product
Give it to you raw, won't chop it
New York niggas is foul, we body sling shit in the val'
Them pregnant fiends, killin' they child
I'm the next best thing to "X", oral sex
Brand new tecs, food stamps and welfare checks
I'm the messiah, recognize it, political prisoner
From the projects, I send shots where the cops is, nigga
The invincible, untouchable, CNN

Last night the weekend caught us up
We fell in fits across the floor
Scattered diamonds through your dress
And curses through your door
Ooh ooh ooh
You want it you got it all
And it's the last time I sit by
Saving face with all your friends
'Cause it's one thing to remember
And another thing to live again
Ooh ooh ooh
You want it you got it all
Ooh ooh ooh, Ooh ooh ooh
You want it you got it all
Six sorry years and now the gloves are off
Would it be easier if it was all my fault
Ooh oh, whoa oh oh, whoa

I've got one week behind me,
Just six more to go.
If I could see you I'd take off your clothes,
And we'd lie in the garden and watch the weeds grow.
And the grass is so high.
I can't see over.
And the moon is so full.
It's setting the stars all on fire.
If they build the dam
Any higher
They're gonna back up
The creek
And set this whole place under water.
The city is a million miles away.
The city is a million miles away.
I lie awake and think of you.
The floods and fires might be coming through,
But you know just what to do.
Yeah, you know what just to do.
I lie awake and think of you.
The floods and fires might be coming through,
But you know just what to do.
Yeah, you know what just to do.
"'ere mum - got any mandies?"

Make friends with you
Because you look so lonely
So we're going to make friends with you
We're not supposed to 
Talk to you
Because we know you're stranger
'Cause you're no stranger

But everybody's going away
And everybody wants us to stay with you
And everybody's coming to say
And everybody wants us to stay with you
We're not supposed to
Make love to you

Could you believe it
Those sapphire eyes
The brilliant girl with the famous thighs
Then the cameras click then we are stars
Laughing in the back of chauffeured cars
Phone call rings and your voice is desire
Then winter moves into summer fires
I promised you what's ours is ours
Somewhere backstage with Sean and Lars
I go crazy when you walk in the room
I laugh at myself with the girl in bloom
And the taste of sex couldn't be too soon
All afternoon then
LA parties in the phony lands
Phony grabs with the manicured hands
I always thought you were pretty like a whip
Should have watched my step
'Cause I keep on forgetting myself
And I keep on forgetting myself
I keep on forgetting myself
And I keep on forgetting myself
I keep on forgetting myself
And I keep on forgetting myself
Who am I we both don't know
Time ticks by, where did you go
You always knew
Where you were going to
So sweetly you said
Please come with you
The biggest fear running through my head
You said you loved me you know what you said
I was floating, did it go to my head
We always sleep with the dogs on the bed
LA parties and the vodka fizz
This is not my life or maybe it is
I keep on forgetting myself
And I keep on forgetting myself
I keep on forgetting myself
And I keep on forgetting myself
I keep on forgetting myself
Who am I, we both don't know
Time ticks by, where did you go
Oh I made you doubt me
Oh I, you're better off without me
Think I am looking over your shoulder
Cause there's someone younger and you're feeling older
You're crazy and you never faded
I don't want to be so complicated
See my life come undone
Watch it go and let the damage run
And I'd change the song now if I could
In the slickness of your blood
(Yo, yo, this ain't the end, this ain't the end)
I keep on forgetting myself
And I keep on forgetting myself
I keep on forgetting myself
And I keep on forgetting myself (where did you go?)
I keep on forgetting myself
And I keep on forgetting myself
Whose that guy, I don't know
Where did you go
Where did you go now
Where did you go
Where did you go now (where did you go?)
Where did you go
(Where did you go)
(Where did you go)
Time, where did you go?
Why did you leave me here alone?
Wait, don't go so fast
I'm missing the moments as they pass
Now I've looked in the mirror and the worlds getting clearer
So wait for me this time
I'm down,
I'm down on my knees
I'm begging for all your sympathy
But you, (I'm just an illusion) you don't seem to care (I wish that I could)
You humble people everywhere (I don't mean to hurt you)
Now I've looked in the mirror and the world's getting clearer
I'll take what you give me
Please know that I'm learning
So wait for me this time
I should've know better
And I shouldn't have wasted those days
And afternoons and mornings
I threw them all away
Now
This is my time
And I'm going to make this moment mine
(I shouldn't have wasted those days)
I'll take what you give me
Please know that I'm learning
I've looked in the mirror
My world's getting clearer
So wait for me this time
This time, this time, this time
Oh, this time
This time
This time
Enough for me is not much for you
Won't you forgive me, that's all I can do
Can you feel my heartbeat when I'm close to you, oh-oh, oh-oh?
Can you feel my heartbeat when I'm close to you, oh-oh, oh-oh?
Enough for me is not much for you
Won't you forgive me, that's all I can do
Can you feel my heartbeat when I'm close to you?
Can you feel my heartbeat when I'm close to you?
I'll never find another way to say, I love you more each day
It's quite romantic, I know, that's how I wanna feel today
I wanna feel this way
Can you feel my heartbeat when I'm close to you, oh-oh, oh-oh?
Can you feel my heartbeat when I'm close to you, oh-oh, oh-oh?
I'll never find another way to say, I love you more each day
It's quite romantic, I know, that's how I wanna feel today
I wanna feel this way today
Can you feel my heartbeat? Can you feel my heartbeat?
Can you feel my heartbeat? Can you feel my heartbeat?
Can you feel my heartbeat? Can you feel my heartbeat?
Can you feel my heartbeat when I'm close to you?
I'll never find, no I'll never find another way to say
I love you more each day
If I lay my head down on you
Would it be, would it be too late?
'Cause you were my protection from the rain outside
You made me feel love like the old days
But I can't blame you, baby
It's me that's done wrong
'Cause I broke the skies that shined above
I can't live without you, without you
And it's hard to breathe when you're not near
But I can't lie here beside you, beside you
'Cause you steal my soul when you leave
Set me free, babe
Set me free
Set me free, babe
I need someone to hold me
Wrap their arms and embrace the air I breathe
'Cause you were my shelter
Now the heart you hold is somebody else's, baby
Now I can't make you love me, baby, if you don't
But I'll stay in love, in love with you
'Cause I can't live without you, without you
And it's hard to breathe when you're not near
But I can't lie here beside you, beside you
'Cause you steal my soul when you leave
Set me free, babe
Oh, set me free
Set me free, baby
Set me free
Don't you know that I can't live without you, without you
And it's hard to breathe when you're not near, oh yes it is
But I can't lie here beside you, beside you
'Cause you steal my soul when you leave
Set me free, babe
Set me free, babe
Set me free, baby
You set me free, baby
On my knees
You set me free, baby
On my knees
You set me free, baby
On my knees
You set me free, baby
On my knees
You set me free, baby
On my knees
You set me free, baby
On my knees
We all know the girls that I am talking about
Well they are time bombs and they are ticking
And the only question's when... they'll blow up!
And they'll blow up, we know that without a doubt
'Cause they're those girls, yeah, you know those girls
That let their emotions get the best of them
Go!
And I've contrived some sort of a plan
To help my fellow man...
Let's get emotional girls to all wear mood rings
So we'll be tipped off to when they're ticked off
'Cause we'll know just what they're thinking
Just what they're thinking...
She's so pretty but she doesn't always act that way
Her moods are swinging on the swingset almost everyday
She said to me that she's so happy it's depressing
And all I said was "Someone get that girl a mood ring!"
If it's drama you want, then look no further
They're like the Real World meets Boy Meets World
Meets Days of Our Lives
And it just kills me how they get away with murder
They'll anger you then bat their eyes
Those pretty eyes that watch you sympathize
Go!
And I've contrived some sort of a plan
To help my fellow man...
Let's get emotional girls to all wear mood rings
So we'll be tipped off to when they're ticked off
'Cause we'll know just what they're thinking
Just what they're thinking...
She's so pretty but she doesn't always act that way
Her moods are swinging on the swingset almost everyday
She said to me that she's so stressed out that it's soothing
And all I said was "Someone get that girl a mood ring!"
'Cause when it's black means "watch your back" because you're probably
The last person in the world right now she wants to see
And when it's blue it means you should call her up immediately
And ask her out because she'll most likely agree
And when it's green it simply means that she is really stressed
And when it's clear it means she's completely emotionless
And that's all right, I must confess
We all know the girls that I am talking about
She likes you Wednesday, but now it's Friday
And she has to wash her hair
And it just figures that we'll never figure them out
Well, first she's Jekyll and then she's Hyde...
At least she makes a lovely pair
Mood ring, oh mood ring
Oh tell me will you bring the key
To unlock this mystery?
Of girls and their emotions
Play it back in slow motion
So I may understand
The complex infrastructure
Known as the female mind
Who's next?
It's gonna be
It's gonna be
Trouble
And tonight I'm telling you honestly
Yes, Honestly.
By the time you get on the bus
Love is no more
And you'll turn your head
Away from everything you've loved before
I am always right
Yes, I am always right
When I saw the reflection in the mirror
I knew it would be tonight
And I'm so happy
Oh so happy
Then again I'm always sad
And I can't hide the tears in my eyes
From the night we never had
And over the seas
It's gotta be at least a hundred degrees
And in my room
Its gotta be at least a thousand degrees
And where am I? (woaho)
I know it sounds stupid but it sounds about it
And in my room its gotta be at least a hundred
A hundred degrees
I know everything
Yes, I know everything
When I saw you behind the corner you asked me
Yes, I saw everything
And I'm so happy
Oh so happy
Then again I'm always sad
And I can't hide the tears in my eyes
From the night we never had
And over the seas
It's gotta be at least a hundred degrees
And in my room
Its gotta be at least a thousand degrees
And where am I? (woaho)
I know it sounds stupid but it sounds about it
And in my room (woaho) its gotta be at least a hundred
A hundred degrees
And over the seas
It's gotta be at least a hundred degrees
And in my room
Its gotta be at least a thousand degrees
And where am I? (woaho)
I know it sounds stupid but it sounds about it
And in my room (woaho) its gotta be at least a hundred
A hundred degrees
Oh Silvia
I was dancing to Michael Jackson, oh Silvia
When I heard your German accent, oh Silvia
And I went down on my knees for her majesty
Your royal highness
Is that how you shall be adressed? Oh her highness
I'm always at your service, oh her highness
Will you listen when I now confess
I've been hurting again, a cold black diamond
The same kind of pain that I had when I was seven
Do you remember when I shook your hand?
Oh Silvia
I took my bike to the cemetery, oh Silvia
And I claimed my territory, oh Silvia
Smoked a cigarette, blew smoke rings in the face of Death
And this town will be cold when it gets hit by a comet
By the harbor, we found a boat with your name written on it
And I had blood in my mouth when I spit
Oh Silvia
Oh her highness
I heard you say in some interview that "feminist"
Was something that didn't suit you--a lack of interest perhaps
Or maybe you're just stupid and inbred
But I still remember when I saw you as a goddess
Your picture on my wall so gentle and modest
Do you see these tears in my face?
I thought we had a deal
That the one who falls from grace
Would be the one to kneel
Now it's just you and me, Silvia
Don't shed no useless tears
Oh Silvia, no one will care in a hundred years
No one will ever forget your name
They'll look after your grave
"But it's not the same," you say
Now it's just you and me, Silvia
It's just you and me
It's just you and me
We've got our feet on the wire, talking 'bout flying
Maybe we're diving in over our heads
Scared of what I'm feeling
Staring at the ceiling here tonight
Come on lay down these arms, all our best defenses
We're taking our chances here on the run
The fear is an anchor, time is a stranger
Love isn't borrowed, we aren't promised tomorrow
We'll never be ready if we keep waiting
For the perfect time to come
Won't be steady, we'll never be ready
Where we don't know, though we can't see
Just walk on down this road with me
Won't be steady, never be ready
You're okay, you're with me here in the silence
With all of the violence crashing around
Saying we can't go, saying we don't know
This road that is narrow is the one we should follow
We'll never be ready if we keep waiting
For the perfect time to come
Won't be steady, we'll never be ready
Where we don't know, though we can't see
Just walk on down this road with me
Won't be steady, we'll never be ready
Steady my hands, this one can turn around
Steady my heart, it's beating faster
Steady my hands, this one can turn around
Steady my heart, it's beating faster, beating faster now
We'll never be ready if we keep waiting
For the perfect time to come
Won't be steady, we'll never be ready
Where we don't know, though we can't see
Just walk on down this road with me
Won't be steady, never be ready
Won't be steady, never be ready
Won't be steady, we'll never be ready
Won't be steady, never be ready
Hello, hello, I know it's been a while but baby
I got something that I really want to let you know
Yeah, something that I want to let you know
You say, you say to everybody that you hate me
Couldn't blame you 'cause I know I left you all alone
Yeah, I know that I left you all alone
Yeah, now I'm back at your door
You're looking at me unsure
I should have seen it before
You're all I think about, baby
I was so stupid for letting you go
But I know you're still the one
You might have moved on but girl you should know
But I know you're still the one
I know I say it too much
But I won't ever give up
I was so stupid for letting you go
But I know you're still the one
I know you're still the one
Hello, hello, I'm really hoping you'll forgive me
I keep talking, begging, tell me what I want to hear
Yeah, girl just tell me what I want to hear
I tried, I'll try to start again and find somebody
But I remember all the times and all the words we said
Yeah, I can't get it out of my head
Yeah, now I'm back at your door
You're looking at me unsure
I should have seen it before
You're all I think about, baby
I was so stupid for letting you go
But I know you're still the one
You might have moved on but girl you should know
But I know you're still the one
I know I say it too much
But I won't ever give up
I was so stupid for letting you go
But I know you're still the one
Hey you, you're still the one
Hey you, you're still the one
Hey you, you're still the one
Hey you, 
You're still the one!
I know I say it too much
But I won't ever give up
I was so stupid for letting you go
But I know you're still the one
I know you're still the one
Let me riddle you a ditty
It's just an itty-bitty little thing on my mind
About a boy and a girl
Gonna take on the world, one kiss at a time
Now the funny thing about it
Ain't a story without it
But the story is mine
And I wish I could say that it ended just fine
We all wanna know how it ends
Oh, happily ever after
Wouldn't you know? Wouldn't you know?
Oh, skip to the ending
Who'd like to know? I'd like to know
Author of the moment
Can you tell me?
Do I end up, do I end up happy?
End up happy
Inhale, breathe steady, exhale
Look ready if you're ready or not
Just a boy and a girl gonna take on the world
And we wanna get caught
In the middle of a very happy ending
Let's see what we've got
Let's give it a shot, let's give it a shot
We all wanna know how it ends
Oh, happily ever after
Wouldn't you know? Wouldn't you know?
Oh, skip to the ending
Who'd like to know? I'd like to know
Author of the moment
Can you tell me?
Do I end up, do I end up happy?
End up happy
We all have a story to tell
Whether we whisper or yell
We all have a story of adolescence and all its glory
We all have a story to tell
Oh, happily ever after
Wouldn't you know? Wouldn't you know?
Oh, skip to the ending
Who'd like to know? I'd like to know
Author of the moment
Can you tell me?
Do I end up, do I end up happy?
End up happy
We all have a story to tell
We all have a story to tell
We all have a story to tell
We all have a story to tell
We all have a story to tell
We all have a story to tell
I got the magic in me
Every time I touch that track it turns into gold
Everybody knows I've got the magic in me
When I hit the flow the girls come snappin' at me
Now everybody wants some presto magic, magic, magic
Magic, magic, magic
Magic, magic, magic
I got the magic in me
These tricks that I'll attempt will blow your mind
Pick a verse, any verse, I'll hypnotize you with every line
I'll need a volunteer, how about you, with the eyes?
Come on down to the front, and stand right here and don't be shy
I'll have you time travelin', have your mind babblin'
People tryna inherit the skill so they askin' me
Even David Blaine had to go and take some classes, and
I see Mindfreak like, "What's up man, what's happenin'?"
So come one, come all, and see the show tonight
Prepare to be astounded, no ghost or poltergeist
You know I'm no Pinocchio, I've never told a lie
So call me Mr. Magic Man, I float on Cloud 9
I've got the magic in me (I got the magic, baby)
Every time I touch that track it turns into gold (Yes, it turns to gold)
Everybody knows I've got the magic in me (I got the magic, baby)
When I hit the flow the girls come snappin' at me (They be snappin' baby)
Now everybody wants some presto magic, magic, magic
Magic, magic, magic
Magic, magic, magic
I got the magic in me
Well take a journey into my mind
You'll see why it's venom I rhyme
Stay on the road, so I call my mama when I got time
I hit the stage, go insane, then jump into that crowd
See, see, when I rhyme I flow on the beat like pidda-dow-dow
See I deceive you with my intergalactic ether
I sing just like Aretha, so respect me like I'm Caesar
I kick it like Adidas, flowin' sticky like adhesive
Be cautious, 'cause what I be on'll leave you with amnesia
I break all the rules like Evel Knievel
It's a spectacular show, 'cause my heart pumps diesel
So whatever you saying, it don't entertain my ego
I do this every day, hocus pocus is my steelo
I've got the magic in me (I got the magic, baby)
Every time I touch that track it turns into gold (Yes, it turns to gold)
Everybody knows I've got the magic in me (I got the magic, baby)
When I hit the flow the girls come snappin' at me (They be snappin' baby)
Now everybody wants some presto magic, magic, magic
Magic, magic, magic
Magic, magic, magic
I got the magic in me
Crumb by crumb in this big black forest
Crumb by crumb in this big black forest
Maybe in you I'll believe
Maybe I'll believe in you
The future of my understanding of love
Many a time I've before
Before I've many a time
Knocked a stranger's door
Discretion hardly I'm known for
Probably has nothing to
Nothing at all in the world to do with you
Just your lower lip on the floor
Baby I gotta get through
Crumb by crumb in this big black forest
Maybe in you I'll believe 
Maybe I'll believe in you
Suddenly I'm not myself
Behind the facade is a lonely fountain here
Suddenly you are the one
Who opens the gates to this unruly garden
Come and let this man go
You
'Cause baby I gotta get through
Crumb by crumb in this big black forest
Maybe in you I'll believe
Maybe I'll believe in you
Suddenly you're not yourself
Behind the facade is a lonely angel still
Suddenly I am the one
Who opens the gates to this now gloomy garden
Come and let this man go
Crumb by crumb in this big black forest
You I'll believe
Crumb by crumb in this big black forest
You I'll believe
Crumb by crumb in this big black forest
You I'll believe...
I wrote some songs 'cause I love her
Then played some shows in the suburbs
It was the middle of summer in Texas
I was feeling pretty good then
Everything worked out at school then
I was feeling like a champ then, in summer
This this could be the summer, the summer of love
And this this could be the summer when I grow up
I wanted to be just like him
He looked just like all the cool kids
I wanted to wear what he wore in summer
I was feeling pretty good then
Everything worked out at school then
I was feeling like champ then, in summer
Ok
This, this could be the summer, the summer of love
And this, this could be the summer when I grow up
This, this could be the summer, the summer of love
And this this could be the summer when I grow up
It's never been like this
I am just starting over
It's never been like this
I am just starting over
This, this could be, the summer the summer of love
And this, this could be the summer when I grow up
This, this could be the summer, the summer of love
And this, this could be the summer when I grow up
This, this could be the summer, the summer of love
And this, this could be the summer when I grow up
What makes gold look like rust
What turns diamonds into dust
Like oxygen to you and me
We need it more than the air we breathe
Too much push and shove
With not enough love to go around
There must be enough love to go round the world
There must be enough love to go round the world
There must be enough love to go round the world
There must be enough love love love
What hurts but feels so fine
What turns water into wine
It runs so deep in you and me
From a fountain to a river to the seven seas
Too much push and shove
With not enough love to go around
I finally found
There must be enough love to go round the world
There must be enough love to go round the world
There must be enough love to go round the world
There must be enough love love love
Whoo-ooh
There must be enough love to go round the world
There must be enough love ooh
There must be enough love to go round the world
There must be enough love around the world
When you gonna do some damage, little brother?
Now that half your life is over, if you're lucky
Looking at the trends of men down through your family
Boom there go the treetops
Once more 'round the sun dried
Just in case you were not listening
I'm for damage
Sweet damage
Oh damage
Sweet damage
Oh damage
Come on tell us
What we've won
Little brother's
Doing well
With his cave
Paintings selling
To the ballots and their brides
Little brother
You're inside
You're a nat-
Ural we joke
In the early ABCs
Little brother
Couldn't see
Crossed his eyes
Once again
He thought you
Were in love
He's just glad
To be free
To have come
So highly
Recommended

Of his van

Cap in hand
For the turn
Of events
Unexpected

Introductions

The girl's a fool, she broke the rule, she hurt him hard
This time he will break down
She's lost his trust and so she must know all is lost
The system has broke down
Romance has broke down
This boy is cracking up
This boy has broken down
This boy is cracking up
This boy has broke down
She plays it hard, she plays it tough
But that's enough, the love is over
She's broke his heart and that is rough
But in the end he'll soon recover
The romance is over
This boy is cracking up
This boy has broken down, yeah yeah

There's a reason for the sunshine sky
And there's a reason why I'm feelin' so high
Must be the season when that love light shines
All around us
So let that feelin' grab you deep inside
And send you reelin' where your love can't hide
And then go stealin' through the moonlit nights
With your lover
Just let your love flow like a mountain stream
And let your love grow with the smallest of dreams
And let your love show and you'll know what I mean
It's the season
Let your love fly like a bird on a wing
And let your love bind you to all living things
And let your love shine and you'll know what I mean
That's the reason
There's a reason for the warm sweet nights
And there's a reason for the candle lights
Must be the season when those love rites shine
All around us
So let that wonder take you into space
And lay you under its loving embrace
Just feel the thunder as it warms your face
You can't hold back
Just let your love flow like a mountain stream
And let your love grow with the smallest of dreams
And let your love show and you'll know what I mean
It's the season
Let your love fly like a bird on a wing
And let your love bind you to all living things
And let your love shine and you'll know what I mean
That's the reason
Just let your love flow like a mountain stream
And let your love grow with the smallest of dreams
And let your love show and you'll know what I mean
It's the season
Let your love fly like a bird on a wing
And let your love bind you to all living things
And let your love shine and you'll know what I mean
That's the reason
Just let your love flow like a mountain stream
And let your love grow
When I'm hosed and they're closing in
Maybe only then
Really, I'll try to get right with myself
But I'll grope down that ladder again
'Til I'm tumbling
But really, I just want to slide
I want to crash-land
While my friend, my associate
He's a regal man
Bindles and he twists and ties
Gives the reckoning
Then it's back on the road again
With maybe thirteen grand
Moralize all you might like
I don't believe in it
(You've never earned your soul)
I know
(You've never earned your soul)
I know
(You've never earned your soul)
I know
But I'm gonna try
Oh
I'm a rich young sophisticate
I've got girls and friends
I'm doing what I really like and getting paid for it
There is no key, there's no plan
Well I discovered that
And truly I don't think you'll find a happier man
(You've never earned your soul)
I know
(You've never earned your soul)
I know
(You've never earned your soul)
I know
But I'm gonna try
Oh
I'm gonna try
You float up high and it isn't a sin
And there isn't a hell where we'll be sent
There's only now
There isn't then
So just breathe it in
Oh, the sinking spell;
Got to tiny heals.
Pin the notice to posts;
And then crawled in my mouth.
There is a feeling I love;
Buried in my brow.
I have no reason to run;
I see no reason.
Are you with me now?
Are, are you with me now?
Are...
It's not impossible.
It's not unfathomable.
It's not unusual, Baby;
To feel the shadow and cry.
There is a feeling I love;
Buried in my brow.
I have no reason to run;
I see no reason.
Are you with me now?
Are, are you with me now?
Are...
As she knows me now.
As she knows me now.
As she knows me now.
As she knows me...
Are you with me now?
Are, are you with me now?
Are, are you with me now?
Are, are you with me now?
Are, are you with me now?
I knew no vices and I knew no sins
I knew the words but they didn't sink in
Stayed out those tunnels that pull people down
There's more of those tunnels in your home town
Fell far from grace, so far I couldn't see
And oh, underground, I wasn't that far from the tree
We're all digging if you wanna know
Fixing, digging far too slow, far too slow
We dug for money, we shoveled four tons
And the end wasn't funny though we'd all had fun
Limping and broken the tunnel fell in
I've been limping from tunnels since my original sin
Birthright's a trouble, my father dug too
He got where he was going at the age of sixty two
We're all digging if you wanna know
Fixing, digging far too slow, far too slow
A new pair of boots and a chisel in your name
Says we could be in the same hole attracting the same blame
If I knew the way to the ornamental tree
I would tell you, we'd be jailbirds, I'd be winking twice for free
Don't call on your brother, odds are he's here and all
Being gentle with the people who were knock-kneed from the fall
We're all digging if you wanna know
Fixing, digging far too slow, far too slow
We're all digging if you wanna know
Fixing, digging far too slow, far too slow
With my toes dangling into the sea
Into a fog, into a lonely drink
Don't lift me up
I'm a wreck, I know
Still, I've got miles to walk from the cape along the coast
And we'll play helicopter in the sand
And bite our thumbs at the acquaintances
And make it known we're on par for the evening
And take the butcher's knife through my words again
Then in walk the mannered men
With their smokescreen yes
And the sequined girls
With their skirts hemmed high
And you will know from this
That it's all to start
Our glasses clink
And our plastic swords stab our olive hearts
All night like a friendly ghost
We haunt the ins and outs of this house of our gracious host
And give thanks, but not much helps
And so here is where we give the toast:
Cheers to the wives of the drunks
Cheers to the husbands that tag along for good luck
Cheers to the miles it took to get here
Cheers to the the nerve it takes to forget who we are
Then in walk the mannered men
With their smokescreen yes
And the sequined girls
With their skirts hemmed high
And you will know from this
That it's all to start
Our glasses clink
And our plastic swords stab our olive hearts
Neon black tanks grope the skyline.
Neon black cocks rot into poison wine.
Neon black flowers on the mass grave.
Neon black corpses, stacked, eclipse the horizon.
Neon black whip, war gang hiss;
While Devastator sips from the crystal chalice.
Neon black lemonade drip drips from his grin crammed with cool charm,
Culture and opulence.
The bayonets clamor on all night, hemming scars into the hillside.
Devastator sleeps under satin sheets.
"Death campaigns are a fucking gold mine."
And all the swine at the cabaret lick their lips as they clap along.
Devastator, in a negligee, does a strip tease while he sings this song:
"Everybody needs a little Devastation!"
Neon black dirt in the garden.
All the roses blossom into skulls this season.
Neon black branches hanging from the trees.
Every limb is empty, robbed of pleasant memories.
The fields are throbbing fresh cut bruises.
Devastator violates with dirty fingers.
Neon black flames cook the calm air.
The party's over, what was your favorite gift?
Neon black future charging like a bull with a funeral bouqet ready to explode.
Oh yeah
(La-la-la-la, lalalalalala)
Yo, what's the deal, nigga?
Ain't nuthin' pa, we just here and all that
Trynna get our head rights, get this money right
You know what I'm sayin', you know how it go
Just another day in the hood (la-la-la-la, lalalalalala)
Yo, yo
Aey-yoh, what a night, New York City, heard it goin' down
Friday night, midnight, Atlantic City
Slot machines, ding-ding-ding-ding-ding, when they ring off
Lock the doors, that's when Ghost just g'd off
Cigars, paisley robes
Four bitches guardin' me safely as we walk to the window
The cashier was scared, she asked for my info
The manager arrived with two guards, that's an insult
That's the cause, just because
We talkin' bout 5 million dollars here, this ain't Play-doh dough
And your horoscope read, you gon' slay those hoes
We got scribbes, Anthony Acid, rockin' the show
Special guest: Starks / Mark Ronson
First five hundred bitches went crazy we he let 'em ons in
All he did was plug me in, I got the chargin'
Got they bras and ran through they whole apartment (la-la-la-la, lalalalalala)
Oooooh weee, ooh wee, (la-la-la-la, lalalalalala)
Oooooh weee, ooh wee, (la-la-la-la, lalalalalala)
When I step into the party, all the ladies wanna know
I'm hangin' wit the ballers, yeah, or my nigga Ghost
I can tell you what they say, haters, if you wanna know
They say ooooooh wee
When I'm roll in my Mercedes, all the ladies wanna roll
Be my Juliet and I can be your Romeo
If you actin' menace I can pick another hoe
Oooooooooh weee (la-la-la-la, lalalalalala)
In the middle of the summer, or even twenty below
I'm a bad muthafucka, I'm way too fuckin' co'l
Let me tell you what they say, when I'm pullin' off my drawers
They say ooooooooooh weeeee
Aey-yoh 
Aey-yoh, I came here to party
Just to cut up a rug
Don't make me have-to cut up a thug
Man, play something for me D.J., cuz there's nothin' but love
Hosted by the ladies who lookin' for somethin' to rub
When we roll out, we roll on dubs, rollin' up bud
The Theodore Unit, we controllin' the club
Mamies, shakin' they ass, they throwin' it up
Like a B.E.T. commercial, I'm "wrappin' em up"
Oooooh weee, ooh wee, (la-la-la-la, lalalalalala)
Oooooh weee, ooh wee, (la-la-la-la, lalalalalala)
Oooooh weee, ooh wee, (la-la-la-la, lalalalalala)
Oooooh weee, ooh wee, (la-la-la-la, lalalalalala)
When we hear that song, we will dance
When we're with all our friends, we will drink and laugh
When we're driving in our cars, we will sing
If you're lost and you look, you will find me
But what I couldn't do is figure out how you
You jumped into my heart, now I couldn't start
To think of life without you, my world would stop
And fall down again, all black and blue again
I want to know everything about you
What makes you feel alive?
And I want to know everything that you do
So let's drive through the night
When you show me your world, I just smiled
And then I sit with you now, I can remember
That when we forget about everything that hurts us
How nothing in the world seems to be
'Cause nothing can hurt us
Like Wilson Bentley found on black velvet
A beauty so strange, something he didn't expect
It's a unique find that only some people get
And you are mine
'Cause I want to know everything about you
What makes you feel alive?
And I want to know everything that you do
So let's drive through the night
Put your hands on my heart
Spray paint verses on a cold blue wall
Write our names in the burning sand
Watch as snowflakes melt inside our hands
'Cause I want to know everything about you
What makes you feel alive?
And I want to know everything that you do
So let's drive through the night
Well, he says he's got a big boat
A high roller
And everybody knows its name
Oh, it's a big boat and it pumps up the poor boys pride
Says he's got a big boat, but it's just a fairy boat and that makes for a short, short ride
Says he's got a big boat
A wide load
Enough to bring the party down
Oh yeah a big boat,
It ain't no carnival cruise
Says he's got a big boat but it's just a fairy boat, enough to fit an extra one or two
Says he's got a big boat, but it's just a fairy boat and that makes for a short, short ride
Says he's got a fast boat, talk about high speed
But everybody knows the truth
Oh hey, a big boat
Get your oars back in the water, kid
Says he's got a fast boat, but it's just a fairy boat it ain't to faster than a goldfish
Says he got a big boat but it's just a fairy boat and that makes for a short, short ride
I don't have to leave anymore
What I have is right here
Spend my nights and days before
Searching the world for what's right here
Underneath and unexplored
Islands and cities I have looked
Here I saw
Something I couldn't over look
I am yours now
So now I don't ever have to leave
I've been found out
So now I'll never explore
See what I've done
That bridge is on fire
Going back to where I've been
I'm froze by desire
No need to leave
Where would I be
If this were to go under
It's a risk I'd take
I'm froze by desire
As if a choice I'd make?
I am yours now
So now I don't ever have to leave
I've been found out
So now I'll never explore
I am yours now
So now I don't ever have to leave
I've been found out
So now I'll never explore
See what I've done...
Look at me now
I'm all dressed up in your words today
Do you think about me, do you think about me?
If it comes down, it's still about the sweet little things you say
After all that I've run from, where the fuck did you come from
Butterfly, baby I still have my doubts about you cause
Butterfly, 'cause I can't find nothing bad about you and
Butterfly, you messed me up, you make my heart double beat and
Butterfly, I don't know how it is you got inside of me
Cause, you're in me now, oh you're in me now, you're in me now
You've made me yours, with your lovely cures
Life is like; I don't know why I do things like this
After all that I've come from, you're the woman I should run from
Butterfly, baby I still have my doubts about you cause
Butterfly, 'cause I can't find nothing bad about you and
Butterfly, you messed me up, you make my heart double beat and
Butterfly, I don't know how it is you got inside of me
You could be waiting for a day that won't come
And you could be so much more than you've become
And I have found my feet, 257 weeks
But you could be waiting for a day that won't come
You could be waiting for your life to begin
And you could be so much more than, than you've been
And I have found my feet, 257 weeks
But you could be waiting for your life to begin
And it's so sad
You're so good, and I'm so bad
But you won't see me wasting the best thing I ever had
And it's such a shame
That I can't tell you anything
You won't hear me, still you endear me now
Hard to see past the window, facing forward, looking back
Over years spent tracing, wondering how you left your track
Underwater breathing burns your lungs and breaks your back
But you could be waiting right here for a day that won't come
And it's so sad
You're so good, and I'm so bad
But you won't see me wasting the best thing I ever had
And it's such a shame
That I can't tell you anything
You won't hear me, still you endear me now, yeah
Yeah, yeah...
You could be waiting for your life to begin
And you could be so much more than, than you've been
And I have found my feet, 257 weeks
But you could be waiting for your life to begin
And it's so sad
You're so good, and I'm so bad
But you won't see me wasting the best thing I ever had
And it's such a shame
That I can't tell you anything
You won't hear me, still you endear me

Yeah, still you endear me now
Yeah, still you endear me now
She'd walk through the door and she'd set up the drinks on the house.
She played a good game of darts, and the men slapped her back,
And never took her out.
She wore a trench coat, khaki.
Her hobnail boots were full of holes.
She's got medals.
Her mother called her "Mary," but she changed her name to "Tommy,"
She's a one... oh.
She went and joined the army,
Passed the medical; don't ask me how it's done.
They sent her to the front line,
Fighting for her country's name.
She's got medals.
She got very tired of picking up girls,
Cleaning her gun, and shaving her curls.
Then the enemy dropped a bomb.
Survivors there were none.
People say that when the moon is full and all the stars have gone to bed,
You can see her ghost, but that's a lie, because the naughty woman isn't dead.
She'd deserted on the previous morning.
Replaced her uniform with dresses, silk and green.
Called herself Eileen.
Came to London town.
Now she's settled down.
She's got medals.
Something's been going on and I don't know what it is
You don't mind the taking girl, but you don't know how to give
You drove me crazy, but I don't know, baby
You're thinking that it's me you're fooling?
Where's the right in all of our fighting?
Look at what you're doing
Where's the love?
It's not enough
It makes the world go 'round and 'round and 
Where's the love?
Give it up
It makes the world go 'round and 'round and 'round
Can you tell me what you see whenever you look around?
We're tripping all over ourselves and pulling each other down
We're separating, consciousness is fading
You thinking that it's me you're fooling?
Where's the right in all of our fighting?
Look at, look at, look at what we're doing
Where's the love?
It's not enough
It makes the world go 'round and 'round and 
Where's the love?
Give it up
It makes the world go 'round and 'round and 'round
Dark clouds all around
Lightning, rain pouring down
We're waiting for the bright light to break through
Face down on the ground
Pick us up at the lost and found
We've got to change our point of view if we want the sky blue
We're segregating, consciences are fading
You're thinking that it's me you're fooling?
Where's the right in all of our fighting?
Look at what we're doing
Where's the love?
It's not enough
It makes the world go 'round and around and around and around
Where's the love?
Just give it up
It makes the world go 'round and 'round and 'round
Where's the love? It's not enough
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Give it up, just give it up
Give it up, give it up
'Round and 'round and 'round
Where's the love? It's not enough
Not enough, not enough
'Round and around and around and around
Where's the love? Just give it up
Won't you, won't you give it up?
I've been ghosting, I've been ghosting along
Ghost in your house, ghost in your arms
When you're tossing, when you turn in your sleep
It's because I'm ghosting your dreams
And this is why I have decided
To pull these old white sheets from my head
I'll leave them folded neat and tidy
So that you'll know I'm out of hiding
I've been ghosting, I've been ghosting along
Ghost in the world, ghost with no home
I remember, I remember the days
When I'd make you oh-so afraid
And this is why I have decided
To leave your house and home unhaunted
You don't need poltergeists for sidekicks
You don't need treats
And you don't need tricks
You don't need treats
You don't need tricks
You don't need no Halloween
You don't need treats
You don't need tricks
And you don't need me
Me
Hey, would it be so bad if I stayed
I'm just a ghost out of his grave
And I can't make love in my grave
I won't put white into your hair
I won't make noises in your stairs
I will be kind and I'll be sweet
If you stop staring straight through me
And this is why I have decided
To pull these old white sheets from my head
I'll leave them folded neat and tidy
So that you'll know I'm out of hiding
And this is why I have decided
To leave your house and home unhaunted
You don't need poltergeists for sidekicks
You don't need treats
And you don't need tricks
You don't need treats
You don't need tricks
You don't need no Halloween
You don't need treats
You don't need tricks
You don't need treats
You don't need no Hallows Eve
You don't need treats
You don't need tricks
And you don't need me
Love me, leave me
Take my possessions and go
Wine me, dine me
Wreck all the things that I know
I'm enchanted I've fallen under your spell
How can I resist when you cast them so well
Baby Lee I'm only trying to remind you
They had me in mind oh yeah when they designed you
And Baby Lee I'm always watching from a distance
Oh marry marry me oh baby now I am insisting
Wake me, shake me
Put my emotions on show
Make me suffer
Tell everyone that you know
I'm enchanted I've fallen under your spell
How can I resist when you cast them so well
Baby Lee I'm only trying to remind you
They had me in mind oh yeah when they designed you
And Baby Lee I'm always watching from a distance
Oh marry marry me oh baby now I am insisting
Why am I weary and why does my head feel so light?
Should I tear up the letters signed signed from my black knight who thrills me?
If love doesn't kill me I'll be lonely as a king with everything
Wild as a flower, true love carries on anywhere
Out of the concrete or from window ledges
Just tell them we could be building something out of our despair
Don't make this so complicated
So complicated
I did not mean to keep you waiting
But I still want your love
I miss your touch
I squandered my daydreams
Don't tell me, I already know
Something so beautiful and chilled to the bone
I could have killed him
I'd tell the children
"Send your heart out for repair"
Don't make this so complicated
So complicated
I did not mean to keep you waiting
But I still want your love
I miss your touch
Don't make this so complicated
It's getting so complicated
I didn't mean to frustrate you
But I still want your love
Guess I miss your touch
Don't make it so complicated
'Cause it's getting so complicated
I did not mean to frustrate you
But I still want your love
I miss your touch
It's getting so complicated
So complicated
Suddenly - you and me
I still want your love
That special touch
Instrumental
Am I wrong for thinking out the box from where I stay?
Am I wrong for saying that I choose another way?
I ain't trying to do what everybody else doing
Just 'cause everybody doing what they all do
If one thing I know, I'll fall but I'll grow
I'm walking down this road of mine, this road that I call home
So am I wrong
For thinking that we could be something for real?
Now am I wrong
For trying to reach the things that I can't see?
But that's just how I feel,
That's just how I feel
That's just how I feel
Trying to reach the things that I can't see
Am I tripping for having a vision?
My prediction: imma be on the top of the world
Walk your walk and don't look back, always do what you decide
Don't let them control your life, that's just how I feel
Fight for yours and don't let go, don't let them compare you, no
Don't worry, you're not alone, that's just how we feel
Am I wrong (Am I wrong?)
For thinking that we could be something for real?
(Oh yeah yeah yeah)
Now am I wrong
For trying to reach the things that I can't see?
(Oh yeah yeah yeah)
But that's just how I feel,
That's just how I feel
That's just how I feel
Trying to reach the things that I can't see
If you tell me I'm wrong, wrong
I don't wanna be right, right
If you tell me I'm wrong, wrong
I don't wanna be right
If you tell me I'm wrong, wrong
I don't wanna be right, right
If you tell me I'm wrong, wrong
I don't wanna be right
Am I wrong
For thinking that we could be something for real?
Now am I wrong
For trying to reach the things that I can't see?
But that's just how I feel,
That's just how I feel
That's just how I feel
Trying to reach the things that I can't see
So am I wrong (Am I wrong?)
For thinking that we could be something for real?
(Oh yeah yeah yeah)
Now am I wrong (Am I wrong?)
For trying to reach the things that I can't see?
(Oh yeah yeah yeah)
But that's just how I feel,
That's just how I feel
That's just how I feel
Trying to reach the things that I can't see
I cracked my knuckles, and I said grace
And gave thanks for being a hundred and still feeling amazed
Out where the waves wrestle with the dirty brine
This is a lonely place. This was a home of mine
After the struggle, Id watch the sand settle
Over the quiet reef. It's my oldest memory
And I don't know whose land were on
Is this an island that plots like a villain
Or an old ghost friend we don't believe in?
I don't know
I curse the weapon we stub our toes on
It's the land of make believe, can't you see, can't you see?
Now in the dirt where I put my feet, and in the trunk of my body
I'm only shy, here, when I want to be, my head between my cypress knees
And in the top of the canopy of the trees I am climbing
The morning sun here, you will see. It's my oldest memory
And I don't know whose land were on
Is this an island that plots like a villain
Or an old ghost friend we don't believe in?
Is this an island that plots like a villain
Or an old ghost friend we don't believe in?
I don't know
Gonna be
Up to the
Pumpkin
And if they come for us,
We'll hide in my jar
You and me
We've braided our
Hands together
Hold till my blues fade
If they bawl
I feel like a ghost who's got a skeleton face
I'm gonna run behind you in the shadow's place
And I can feel your rhythm if you feel my rhythm
It's a pie
And it's berries in my heart bread
Berries in my heart bread
You and me
Chained to the
Thumb piano
Walk down streets
With red in our clothes
You and me
Under clear
Umbrellas
I said that once an eve
I'm drying your
Bones
I feel like a ghost, I've got the skeleton face
And I'll live in a house with a bunch of people
And I can feel your rhythm if you feel my rhythm
It's a pie
And it's berries in my heart bread
Said it's berries in my heart bread
You and me
Pushing a
Thumb pin
When we're good and ready
We can swim in the flood
I feel like a ghost, I've got the skeleton face
I own a secret tomb and I'll never be late
And I can feel your rhythm if you feel my rhythm
It's a pie
And it's berries in my heart bread
Said it's puts berries in my heart bread
Tikwid
It glows
I know
You know
It glows
It glows
I know
You know
It glows
You and me
We're hooking our
Eyes a little
In a tree
Where the arches gleam
Below
Our highs sing
While familiar creams
Swap around a little stall
Lean on me
And we can watch the sun
Build home
I feel like a ghost who's got a skeleton face
I crawl around behind you in the shadows place
And I can feel your rhythm if you feel my rhythm
It's a cry
And it's berries in my heart bread
Said it's berries in my heart bread
I feel like a ghost who's got a skeleton face
But now I live in a house with a country gate
And I can feel your rhythm if you feel my rhythm
It's a cry
And it's berries in my heart bread
Said it's berries in my heart bread
Tikwid
Right at the front door I recognised the perfume
The scent was perfect in the dusk by the moon
There must be many ways to ask her to my room
Why didn't I dare?
Well every hour I try to get somethin' done
Out on the weekend when I'm just havin' some fun
I'm windin' up with none, just zeroes, no 1's, just space with no air
- I get: "Bye-bye baby-baby bye baby-baby bye-bye..."
Real sugar, I don't wonna climb the walls
Real sugar, that's what I want or none at all
Real sugar, sweet as a sweet can be
Real sugar, that's what I want and what I need
That's what I need
Yeah, every Friday I'm getting ready to roll
I want her blue eyes start sayin' "Hi" and "Hello"
But I can always tell she'd rather be allone with some other guy
(Real sugar)
- I get: "Bye-bye baby-baby bye baby-baby bye-bye..."

- I get: "Bye-bye baby-baby bye baby-baby bye-bye..."

Girl, you remind me of summertime
But now you need time to clear your mind
You're tripping over what is wrong and right
Just decide, I've been waiting all night
Think back, think back, to the summertime
I would cross through these state lines
You were always on my mind
It should not be this hard to see
How to get from point A to B
Without losing sleep, without losing sleep
I will follow the electric lines
With my electric heart I then will find
A way through all these damn street signs
But I'll be there, I'll wait by your side
Ooh, by your side
Think back, think back, to the summertime
I would cross through these state lines
You were always on my mind
It should not be this hard to see
How to get from point A to B
Without losing sleep, without losing sleep
We spin, we spin
And fall onto the floor
You're such a lovely lady
We spin, we spin
And circle round once more
Though it's making me crazy, yeah
Think back, think back, to the summertime
I would cross through these state lines
You were always on my mind
It should not be this hard to see
How to get from point A to B
Without losing sleep, without losing sleep
Think back, think back, to the summertime
I would cross through these state lines
You were always on my mind
It should not be this hard to see
How to get from point A to B
Without losing sleep, without losing sleep
Hello big family who's gonna cook the noodles today
I found a pair of broken glasses and finally I can see clearly
From Falsterbo to Kiruna, from Göteborg to Djursholm
And even one lost guy from Arizona
Home sweet home, I've
Been away for too long
Home sweet home,
This is where I belong
Going to bed wondering if winter come early this year
Waking up on the line of equator bathing in my own sweat
Jumping out of someone's tent and I don't recongnize a face
Still I know them all well so see you later
Let's get nice and friendly, join us for a surfride in the mud
We're out for beerhunt, look out for our razzia, hands up, hit and run
Playing football with a can, Mr J lost his shoe
Suck my menthol feeling fresh all night long
There is an empty space in the chair tonight
'Cause he don't feel right
There are stormclouds brewing at the back of his mind
As he steps outside
He will be twenty in a week
But he's old for his years
He's had many of those
To confront his own fears
Cause his father's not the man he'd like to grow up to be
And his mother isn't growing old gracefully
He says times like these I don't want to be a superstar
Cause reality TV killed them all in America
So the sun always shines in the magazines
Tonight can we be free to be who we really are
There is an empty space between the lines tonight
And it burns so bright
And the angry silence that he throws on the floor
Says he don't care anymore
He had money for the truth
But love's a lot more
And the answer's is not the one he was looking for
And his father's not the man he'd like to grow up to be
And his mother is his mother reluctantly
He says times like these I don't want to be a superstar
Cause reality TV killed them all in America
So the sun always shines in the magazines
Tonight can we be free to be who we really are
He says times like these I don't want to be a superstar
Cause reality TV killed them all in America
So the sun always shines in the magazines
Tonight can we be free to be who we really are
He says times like these I don't want to be a superstar
Cause reality TV killed them all in America
So the sun always shines in the magazines
Tonight can we be free to be who we really are
Bravely I look further than I see,
Knowing things I know I cannot be, not now.
I'm so aware of where I am, but I don't know where that is,
And there's something right in front of me and I...
Touch the fingers of my hand
And I wonder if it's me
Holding on and on to Theories of prosperity
Someone who can promise me
I believe in me
Tomorrow I was nothing, yesterday I'll be
Time has fooled me into thinking it's a part of me
Nothing in this room but empty space
No me, no world, no mind, no face
Touch the fingers of my hand and tell me if it's me
Holding on and on to Love, what else is real
A religion that appeals to me, oh
I believe in me
Can you turn me off for just a second, please
Turn me into something faceless,
Weightless, mindless, homeless Vacuum state of peace
On and on and on and on and on and on and on and on
I believe in me
On and on and on and on and on and on and on and on
I believe in me
Wait for me I'm nothing on my own,
I'm willing to go on, but not alone, not now
I'm so aware of everything, but nothing seems for real
As long as you're in front of me then I'll,
Watch the fingers of my hands,
And I'm grateful that it's me,
Holding On and on and on and on and on and on and on and on
I believe in me.
I'm willing to go on, but not alone, not now
I'm willing to go on, but not alone, not now (I believe in me).
I'm so aware of everything, I'm still aware of where I am...
The princess in her flower bed
Pulled the jungle underground
Where cherry bombs stain the blackbirds red
And explosions never make a sound
(O comet come down!)
Kamikaze over me
(And I come alive)
My midnight melody
(O comet come down)
My captain on a snowy horse
Is coming back to take me home
He'll find me fighting back a terrible force
'Cause I'm not afraid to die alone
(O comet come down!)
Kamikaze over me
(And I come alive)
My midnight melody
(O comet come down!)
Kamikaze over me
(And I come alive)
My midnight melody
(O comet come down!)
(O comet come, comet come down!)
(Brave down the open road)
Maybe I'll ride
(And fight back the undertow)
To save my life
(Breathe in the amber glow)
Maybe I'll fly
(And go where you wanna go)
With the eagle eye
(Brave down the open road)
Maybe I'll ride
(And fight back the undertow)
To save my life
(Breathe in the amber glow)
Maybe I'll fly
(And go where you wanna go)
With the eagle eye
Eagle eye, eagle eye
Eagle eye, eagle eye
Pale, pubescent beasts
Roam through the streets
And coffee shops
Their prey gather in herds
Of stiff knee-length skirts
And white ankle socks
But while they search for a mate
My type hibernate
In bedrooms above
Composing their songs of love 
Young, uniform minds
In uniform lines
And uniform ties
Run round with trousers on fire
And signs of desire
They cannot disguise
While I try to find words
As light as the birds
That circle above
To put in my songs of love 
Fate doesn't hang on a wrong or right choice
Fortune depends on the tone of your voice
So sing while you have time
Let the sun shine down from above
And fill you with songs of love
Take me
Fate doesn't hang on a wrong or right choice
Fortune depends on the tone of your voice
So let's sing while we still can
While the sun hangs high up above
Wonderful songs of love
Beautiful songs of love
Darling, you're mistaken; I don't like what's going on
But tell you too much conversation won't get you off
You said, "Blackie's dead... Blackie's dead," and then run the other way
I don't want to tell you that you're not there on my list
And what's with all that shit you're saying; No, you're not interested in this

Everybody knows you're a liar

Spinning webs too big to climb

(I know a nigga seen me and how my change is laning kid
Nigga prolly thought, man, I had...
I got cursed or something man but
Wasn't even like that kid
It's... it's just the trials and tribulations you go through in life
It ain't nothing, kid
It ain't nothing a soldier can't handle, ya know what I mean?)
Cause yo
Who knew my luck would change?
Who knew my luck would change?
I thought a year from now
It'd be like hearing now
And no one would hear me now, hear me now
Listen
I used to have to stay in this locked up basement
Now I'm getting calls just for product placement
They say that song Spaceship gave my career a facelift
Now I'm on a comeback trail to make a statement
Cause who I put my faith in it ain't no four leaf clover
Or if your birthday fall between June and October
So I don't read no horoscopes or go to astrologists
Or clutch a rabbit's foot when I'm twisted like Oliver
While others grab terror, call me shuffle a deck
I'd rather hit it road hard than go hustle a check
It wasn't nothing for 'Quence
When I'm hated, damn, wish me well
Cause now they all throw me they money like a wishing well
And when I slipped and fell it ain't make me superstitious
It proved a rare change is, now I got that true predition
But they all figure the only way he make a fortune cruise
Is if I ate blue diamonds, pink hearts, and horse chews (?)
Now those who knew my situation prolly thought a mirror shattered
And why they even said that I had war beneath flatters
Till I made them envy me like the initials for Nevada
But once you turn the car none of that shit even matter
But to see how niggas scatter when I lost my cash
You would have sworn a black cat had crossed my path
They either lost my math or I miss they call
But now I see right through 'em like a crystal ball
If it was up to y'all I would never get discover
But I chose to evolve and got myself from out the gutter
But they tryin' to pull me back
The way they did to others
Who chose to split to poll
And then say bread and butter
Well you tell those motherfuckers
So much for the jeans
Cause now I wear Louis Vuitton and dress cherry (?) from pink
And if they had the nerve to think I would ever give up
Well homie let 'em know that they shit out of luck
Sing it.
Who knew that my luck would change?
Who knew that my luck would change?
I got cars, I got cribs among other things
But the tears from the heart of my love won't change
Who knew that my luck would change?
Who knew that my luck would change?
I thought a year from now
No one would hear me now
Who knew that my luck would change?
Who knew that my luck would change?
I got cars, I got cribs among other things
But the tears from the heart of my love won't change
Cause who knew that my luck would change?
Who knew that my luck would change?
I thought a year from now
No one would hear me now
Instrumental
When you're overly confident,
Then it's over before beginning the good part.
Everybody fades away.
Waves... waves carrying them away.
Wait... wait,
O'Malley, O'Malley, O'Malley...
O'Malley, O'Malley, O'Malley,
Sing with me, sing with me, sing with me
Or I won't even sing.
Hooray, hooray,
O'Malley, run.
Hooray, hooray,
O'Malley, fun.
Used to be the underdog,
Hooray, O'Malley, run.
But you're overly confident.
So it's over before beginning the good part.
Everybody fades away;
We got carried away.
Lets go fishing for a dream
Lets find some place new
Somewhere we can be ourselves
Some of the time
Lose your heart, I lose my mind
We'll make quite a pair, dazzling all the time
Celebrity parties, the red carpet mile
Nothing is too good there for my girl
All of this world, is gonna see you shine
Do-do-do-dodo-do-do-do
Dododo-dodo-do-do-do-do-do-do
Dododododo-do-doooo
Let's do loneliness in style
Lets put on moonlight mile
And feel those radio waves flow
And don't say you won't
Lose your heart, I lose my mind
We'll make quite a pair, dazzling all the time
Celebrity parties, the red carpet mile
Nothing is too good there for my girl
All of this world, is gonna see you shine
Do-do-do-dodo-do-do-do
Dododo-dodo-do-do-do-do-do-do
Dododododo-do-doooo
I lose your heart, and I'll lose my mind
We'll make quite a pair, dazzling all the time
Celebrity parties, the red carpet mile
Nothing is too good there for my girl
All of this world
Nimm den Becher von dem Voodoo-Priester.
Ach, die Medizin ist ungenießbar?
Die Wirkung wird immer intensiver.
Kunterbunte Farben wie bei KiKa.
Hast du Fieber?
Du kommst nie dahinter,
was im Drink war.
Stimmung ist finster.
Primitive Trommeln und Geklimper.
Leute kommen mit Stelzen und Zylinder.
Ein kleines Rendezvous mit den Geistern.
Willst du deinen Horizont erweitern?
Du tanzt um das Feuer und verbiegst dich
wie ein Beatnik
mit Energie-Kick.
Oh, deine Wahrnehmung verschiebt sich.
Kennen sie den Zauber der Karibik?
Dein Bewusstsein ist neblig.
Du drehst dich im Kreis und verstehst nicht
was geschehen ist.
Voodoo! 
(Ein bisschen Voodoo.)
Akanama Voodoo! Voodoo!
(Lass dich befreien!)
Akanama Voodoo! Voodoo!
(Das wird dir gut tun.)
Akanama Voodoo! Voodoo!
(Das macht dich high.)
Akanama Voodoo! Voodoo!
(Die Spirale dreht sich.)
Akanama Voodoo! Voodoo!
(Was ist passiert?)
Akanama Voodoo! Voodoo!
(Ist da etwa jemand...)
Akanama Voodoo! Voodoo!
(...hypnotisiert?)
Komm und koste
diese Früchte des Zorns.
Du wirst blaß doch fühlst dich neugeboren.
Hörst du den Klang der Magie?
Du fällst und schwebst ins Land der Fantasie.
Die Trommeln im Dschungel beherrschen dich.
Verschwommene Bilder wirken wie Nervengift.
Du genießt den Gang über brennende Kohlen.
Nette Skelette wirken vital wenn sich dich holen.
Die Spirale dreht sich,
sie hat dich im Bann und entkommen geht nicht. (Ohh.)
Da kommt der Buschdoktor.
Was hat der gute Mann bloß mit den Puppen vor?
Mit Wahnsinn im Blick kommt er und sticht zu!
Der Schmerz in deinem Bein lässt dich nicht in Ruh'!
Du bewegst deinen Körper vollautomatisch.
Nichts hält dich auf, wenn du erstmal in Fahrt bist. 
Voodoo! 
(Ein bisschen Voodoo.)
Akanama Voodoo! Voodoo!
(Lass dich befreien!)

(Ist da etwa jemand...)
Akanama Voodoo! Voodoo!
(...hypnotisiert?)  
Trete hinein, du bist herzlich willkommen.
Schwebe davon!
Ein Schluck vom Flakon?
Vom leuchtenden Saft mit der feurigen Kraft,
der heute Nacht deine Träume entfacht?
Folge dem Liliputaner ins Dorf.
Hab keine Angst, alle sind dort.
Mach dich bereit doch wart' nicht zu lang,
denn der Teufel bittet dich zum Tanz.
Lass dich drauf ein auf das Spiel mit der Kobra.
Oder ist das Ganze dir vielleicht nicht koscher?
Was machen die Knochen da in dem Topf drin?
Das ist Wahnsinn! Wer die Sachen in dein Kopf bringt...?
Genieß' den Flügelschlag der Fledermaus.
Die Halluzinationen hören später auf.
Entspann' dich.
(Abrakadabra.)
Herzlich willkommen im Nirvana!

Was ist passiert?
There was a time when my world
Was filled with darkness
Then I stopped dreaming now
I'm supposed to fill it up with something
In your eyes I see the eyes of somebody
I knew before, long ago
But I'm still trying to make my mind up
Am I free or am I tied up?
I change shapes just to hide in this place
But I'm still, I'm still an animal
Nobody knows it but me when I slip
Yeah I slip, I'm still an animal
There is a hole and I tried to fill it up with money
But it gets bigger till your horse is always running
In your eyes I see the eyes of somebody
That could be strong
Tell me if I'm wrong
And now I'm pulling your disguise up
Are you free or are you tied up?
I change shapes just to hide in this place
But I'm still, I'm still an animal
Nobody knows it but me when I slip
Yeah I slip, I'm still an animal
We took our first pill when the music was shit
I said fuck dancing all night but then that's just what we did
It felt like floating
It felt like floating
Your body was warm when I laid by your side
I said I'm glad I have found you and I'm glad we're alive
It feels like floating
It seems like floating
It feels like floating
We laid by a river, we looked at the stars
I said how tiny we are? Girl how tiny we are?
It feels like floating
It feels like floating
It feels like floating
A lifetime is short and death is so long
I don't believe in no heaven I just hope that I'm wrong
I hope we're floating
I hope we're floating
There's much in the world I don't understand
It just makes much more sense with my hand in your hand
It feels like floating
It feels like floating
It feels like floating
It feels like floating
It feels like floating
It feels like
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
Don't you know
You can't rewrite
Your own history
Cigarette Barbie
Your love is like a city I visited
Your love is like a city that burnt me good
Oh Las Vegas,
I could only afford one weekend
Don't you know
You're like Pete Best
Bitter after all these years
Just let it go
Your love is like a city I visited
Your love is like a city that burnt me good
Oh Las Vegas,
I could only afford one weekend
There are times every now and then
I forget why I'm breathing out
And why I'm breathing in
And I get so sick with the little things
I can't relax when it's happening
To know what it means
It means
And then I open my eyes
And I know you're beating my heart, beating my heart
Look at the sky
I know you're beating my heart, beating my heart
I go extra miles to show
That you are the one thing that I've got
Look at the sky
I know you're beating my heart, beating my heart
There's a sun coming over the horizon
I wanna know where it's coming from
But doesn't everyone
It's like who am I and why am I here
And then I open my eyes
And I know you're beating my heart, beating my heart
Look at the sky
I know you're beating my heart, you're beating my heart
I go extra miles to show
That you are the one thing that I've got
I look at the sky
I know you're beating my heart, you're beating my heart
This whole world will take me down
Without you standing by my side
My side
You're holding onto me
You're making everything inside
Come alive
And then I open my eyes
And I know you're beating my heart, beating my heart
Look at the sky
I know you're beating my heart, you're beating my heart
I go extra miles to show
That you are the one thing that I've got
I look at the sky
I know you're beating my heart, you're beating my heart
Hey, hey, hey
Your lipstick stains
On the front lobe of my left-side brains 
I knew I wouldn't forget ya
And so I went and let you blow my mind
Your sweet moonbeam
The smell of you in every single dream I dream
I knew when we collided, you're the one I have decided
Who's one of my kind
Hey, soul sister, ain't that Mr. Mister on the radio, stereo?
The way you move ain't fair, you know
Hey, soul sister, I don't wanna miss a single thing you do
Tonight
Hey, hey, hey
Just in time
I'm so glad you have a one-track mind like me
You gave my life direction
A game show love connection we can't deny 
I'm so obsessed
My heart is bound to beat right out my untrimmed chest
I believe in you; like a virgin, you're Madonna
And I'm always gonna wanna blow your mind
Hey, soul sister, ain't that Mr. Mister on the radio, stereo?
The way you move ain't fair you know
Hey, soul sister, I don't wanna miss a single thing you do
Tonight
The way you can cut a rug
Watching you's the only drug I need
You so gangster; I'm so thug
You're the only one I'm dreaming of, you see
I can be myself now, finally
In fact, there's nothing I can't be
I want the world to see you be with me
Hey, soul sister, ain't that Mr. Mister on the radio, stereo?

Tonight
Hey, soul sister, I don't wanna miss a single thing you do

Seek me with your spies
Keep ya head a goin'
Keep ya toes on the lively side
Ooohooo
You can sleep with one eye open
Seek me from afar
I hear you got some new clothes
I even hear you gotta new car
Ooohooo
Well you can keep on laughing behind my back
'Cause I'm waiting for the moment to strike you back
Sit around idle and nod my head
Well it's about the patience and getting revenge
'Cause I'm always right behind you
Always right behind you
Always right behind you
Always right behind you
Always right behind you
I heard you turned a new leaf
Gotta new set of friends, a new kind of business
You've even got money to spend
Ooohooo
Well it ain't about the money
It's all about your rotten lies
It's all about the fact that you're leaving me high and dry
Aaahaaa
Well you can keep on laughing behind my back
'Cause I'm waiting for the moment to strike you back
Sit around idle and nod my head
Well it's about the patience and getting revenge
'Cause I'm always right behind you
Always right behind you
Always right behind you
Always right behind you
Always right behind you

She spins and she sways to whatever song plays
Without a care in the world
And I'm sitting here wearing the weight of the world on my shoulders
It's been a long day and there's still work to do
She's pulling at me saying "Dad I need you!
There's a ball at the castle and I've been invited
And I need to practice my dancin'
Oh please, Daddy, please!"
So I will dance with Cinderella
While she is here in my arms
'Cause I know something the prince never knew
Oh I will dance with Cinderella
I don't want to miss even one song
'Cause all too soon the clock will strike midnight
And she'll be gone
She says he's a nice guy and I'd be impressed
She wants to know if I approve of the dress
She says, "Dad, the prom is just one week away
And I need to practice my dancin'
Oh please, Daddy, please!"
So I will dance with Cinderella
While she is here in my arms
'Cause I know something the prince never knew
Oh I will dance with Cinderella
I don't want to miss even one song
'Cause all too soon the clock will strike midnight
And she'll be gone
She will be gone
But she came home today with a ring on her hand
Just glowing and telling us all they had planned
She says, "Dad, the wedding's still six months away but I need to practice my dancin'
Oh please, Daddy, please!"
So I will dance with Cinderella
While she is here in my arms
'Cause I know something the prince never knew
Oh I will dance with Cinderella
I don't want to miss even one song
'Cause all too soon the clock will strike midnight
And she'll be gone
You love to run
Into the arms Of anyone
Take off your shoes and socks
And stay awhile
You like the adrenaline rush
Just a little too much
You go from day to day
Hand to mouth
And wonder why You're unsatisfied
Cause love is a marathon
That's why you get tired so fast of everyone
Slow down and pace yourself
'Cause when it's good
It's a long open road
You think still
You'll find a soul behind a thrill
You're just a cat chasing your tail
Round and round
What if you relax
Something might last
You're exhausted always coming down
Trying to come up for air
Trying to act like you just don't care
La da da, de da da
What if I led a different life, would you stay?
What if you could only speak the truth, what would you say?
Time doesn't wait for anyone.
There is a part in every day when I lie to myself and say that it's okay.
'Cause if I don't I think I'll go insane
But the truth is I only have myself to blame.
Explain to me how you're so damn naive.
Think I don't see?
Forget what I said, you're only good in bed or on your knees.
Time doesn't wait for anyone.
There is a part in every day when I lie to myself and say that it's okay.
'Cause if I don't I think I'll go insane
But the truth is I only have myself to blame.
Time doesn't wait for anyone.
There is a part in every day when I lie to myself and say that it's okay.
'Cause if I don't I think I'll go insane
But the truth is I only have myself to blame.
There is a part in every day when I lie to myself and say that it's okay.
If you leap awake in the mirror of a bad dream
And for a fraction of a second you can't remember where you are
Just open your window and follow your memory upstream
To the meadow in the mountain where we counted every falling star
I believe a light that shines on you will shine on you forever
And though I can't guarantee there's nothing scary hiding under your bed
I'm gonna stand guard like a postcard of a golden retriever
And never leave 'til I leave you with a sweet dream in your head
I'm gonna watch you shine
Gonna watch you grow
Gonna paint a sign
So you'll always know
As long as one and one is two
There could never be a father
Who loved his daughter more than I love you
Trust your intuition
It's just like goin' fishin'
You cast your line and hope you get a bite
But you don't need to waste your time
Worryin' about the market place
Try to help the human race
Struggling to survive its harshest night
I'm gonna watch you shine
Gonna watch you grow
Gonna paint a sign
So you'll always know
As long as one and one is two
There could never be a father
Who loved his daughter more than I love you
I'm gonna watch you shine
Gonna watch you grow
Gonna paint a sign
So you'll always know
As long as one and one is two
There could never be a father
Who loved his daughter more than I love you
I think we're going somewhere.
We're on to something good here.
Out of mind, out of state.
Trying to keep my head on straight.
I think we're going somewhere.
We're on to something good here.
There's only one thing left to do.
Drop all I have and go with you.
Somewhere back there I left my worries all behind.
My problems fell out of the back of my mind.
We're going and I'm never knowing (never knowing) where we're going.
To go back to where I was would just be wrong.
I'm pressing on.
Pressing on, all my distress is going, going, gone. (pressing on, pressing on)
And I won't sit back, and take this anymore.
'Cause I'm done with that, I've got one foot out the door.
And to go back where I was would just be wrong
I'm pressing on.
I think we're going somewhere.
We're on to something good here.
Out of mind, out of state.
Trying to keep my head on straight.
I think we're going somewhere.
We're on to something good here.
Adversity, we get around it.
Searched for joy, in you I found it.
Somewhere back there I left my worries all behind;
My problems fell out of the back of my mind.
We're going and I'm never knowing (Never knowing) where we're going.
To go back to where I was would just be wrong;
I'm pressing on.
Pressing on, all my distress is going, going, gone
(Pressing on, pressing on).
And I won't sit back, and take this anymore.
'Cause I'm done with that, I've got one foot out the door.
And to go back where I was would just be wrong
I'm pressing on.
And to go back where I was would just be wrong
I'm pressing on ...
On, pressing on, all my distress is going, going, gone
(Pressing on, pressing on).
And I won't sit back and take this anymore
'Cause I'm done with that; I've got one foot out the door,
And to go back to where I was would just be wrong.
I'm pressing on.
You look down on me, but you don't look down on me at all.
You smile and laugh, and I feel the love you have for me.
I think we're going somewhere.
We're on to something good here, and we're gonna make it after all.
I been sitting in the darkness
But the sunlight's creeping in
Now the ice is slowly melting
In my soul and in my skin
All the good times my friend
Are coming around again
Oh yeah
I been thinking reminiscing
Of better nights and better days
Hiding in a refuge
Around Of memories I've made
I got a feeling within
It's coming around again
Again
(It's coming around again)
We been so long waiting
For the all time high
We got a damn good reason
To put your troubles aside
And all your winter sorrows hang 'em out to dry
Throw it away
Gotta throw it away
All the colorful days my friend
Are coming around again
That's right
Yeah yeah Mmm
I got someone waiting for me
It's been so long since we met
And I may not be your salvation but I'll offer nonetheless
And if like me you wanna take that chance
It's coming around again
Ooh yeah
Yeah yeah Mmm
I can feel a change of fortune
Simon No more riding on my love
Feel the weight is off my shoulders
Webbe As my feet become unstuck
And all the good times on which we do depend
Coming Oh it's coming around again
Well I know that it's late
But the words wouldn't wait
I'm really sorry that I woke you up
I don't know what's come over me
If I'm wrong, let me know
Do you think I should go?
But before you give an answer
Think of somewhere you'd rather be
All that I have 
Twenty Six dollars and the keys to a Cadillac
All that I know
Drive all night, go anywhere you wanna go
All that I want and all that I need
All I wanna know is do you wanna come with me?
You deserve more than this
Packing guilt for a trip
I never thought that I would get this far
Searching for the words to say
Summer wind, desert stars
All of this could be yours
You know it only takes two words 
And we'll both be on our way
All that I have 
Twenty Six dollars and the keys to a Cadillac
All that I know
Drive all night, go anywhere you wanna go
All that I want and all that I need
All I wanna know is do you wanna come with me?
All I have, all I know, I changed the station and our song is on the radio
All I have, all I know, drive all night go anywhere you wanna go
All I have, all I know, I changed the station and our song is on the radio
All I have, all I know, drive all night go anywhere you wanna go
Drive all night, go anywhere you wanna go
Drive all night, go anywhere you want to
I'm waking up and baking
Watching the parade
'Cause today's the day I got over you
Taking out the trash and the pictures that I stashed
Of the two of us in 1992
You stole my heart when Eddie Vedder was king
I gave you a foot massage
I gave you my ring
You left me for a drummer 'cause you said I couldn't sing
But that's ok
'Cause there'll be no more
Mountain climbing in the rain
No more
Long hair cloggin' up the drain
No more
Life will never be the same
Life after lisa's not so bad at all
Saw you with the dude who gave us
Our first tattoos
Did he cover up my name
That was fast
Can you believe that I'm alive
Still not workin' 9 to 5
And my little band is kickin some ass
So when you ask me if I hated you now
It's not you it's just all of the times I missed out
On sleeping with your roommate
Every time you passed out
But that's okay
And now there's no more
Mountain climbing in the rain
No more
Long hair cloggin' up the drain
No more
Life will never be the same
Life after Lisa's not so bad at all
I bet you're saying to yourself
That you'll find somebody else like me
All I've got to say is there ain't no fucking way
That you're getting me to say I'm sorry
Not today
No more
Mountain climbing in the rain
No more
Long hair cloggin up the drain
No more
Life will never be the same
Cleaning up the house again
Listening to house of pain
Having headaches in my brain
Listening to you complain
Shopping at the mall again
I'm outta rhymes I've gotta say
Life after Lisa's not so bad at all
Not so bad at all
No more
Mountain climbing in the rain
No more
Long hair cloggin up the drain
No more
Life will never be the same
Life after Lisa's not so bad at all
Oh no not so bad at all
City roof top, summer night
In your tank top, rainbow styling
To the beatbox, spinning 'round
And you looked so cute there, rainbow styling
Sun rising, still asleep
Lay beside you, hear you breathing
Last night, girl, like a dream (Hey)
Never felt so good, sleepy smiling
All this love saved up for nothing
I've never felt so blue
And all this love, rainbow styling
All this love saved up for nothing
And this will do me no good
And all this love, rainbow styling
Everyday that summer by your side
And it all just seemed everlasting
But then you told me you would move away
And you looked so cute there, you were crying
All this love saved up for nothing
I've never felt so blue
And all this love, rainbow styling
All this love saved up for nothing
And this will do me no good
And all this love, rainbow styling
All this love saved up for nothing
I've never felt so blue
And all this love, rainbow styling
All this love saved up for nothing
And this will do me no good
And all this love, rainbow styling
There is a map in my room on the wall of my room and I've got big, big plans
But I can see them slipping through almost feel them slipping through
The palms of my sweaty hands
And I move slow
Just slow enough to make you uncomfortable
You say I hate you, you mean it
And I love you sounds fake
It's taken me so long to figure that out
I used to love the taste, I would do anything for it
Now I would do anything to get the taste out of my mouth
And you're so confident
But I hear you crying in your sleeping bag
But you were broken bad yourself
And you were mad as hell, you felt
If you had done anything with anyone else
It would have worked out so well
But you are an artist
And your mind don't work the way you want it to
One day you'll be washing yourself with hand soap in a public bathroom
And you'll be thinking, how did I get here?
Where the hell am I?
If the roles were reveresed, you could have seen me sneaking up
Sneaking up from behind
She sees these visions, she feels emotion
She says that I cannot go
She sees my plane in the ocean
And what about your friends
Don't you love them enough to stay?
And I say if I don't leave now
Then I will never get away
Let me be a blue raft
On the blue sea I'll blend right in
There is a map in my room on the wall of my room
I've got big big plans
And I can see them falling through, almost feel them slipping through
The palms of my sweaty hands
But you were broken bad yourself
And you were mad as hell, you felt
If you had done anything with anyone else
It would have worked out so well
But you are an artist
And your mind don't work the way you want it to
One day you'll be washing yourself with hand soap in a public bathroom
And you'll be saying, how did I get here?
Where the hell am I?
If the roles were reveresed, you could have seen me sneaking up
Sneaking up from behind
You know, All of you know
To grow, what to feel
And so, follow me low
You are what you lean on
Come out of the cold
And drift, into water
Ooh
And the light shines on
While we all ride on
When the days come and gone
You know we all ride on
Lines thicker than ground
You surf and its real
To soar over and down
To bend and to breathe on
Ooh
And the light shines on
While we all ride on
When the days come and gone
You know we all ride on
Through water when
We are falling
The sounds of bells are ringing out
We'll ride on
Slipped over
The blue lighting
Springs alive to circle down
Ooh
And the light shines on
While we all ride on
When the days come and gone
You know we all ride on
Now the light shines on
While we all ride on
When the days come and gone
You know we all shine on
Two sisters,
Ever so inseparable.
One saw right through me
One I handed an apple.
I tried to change their chemistry,
I tried to make one stick to me.
She can make your tongue, 
She can make your tongue, 
Make your tongue stick to the sun.
And maybe if I lay low,
Love will fall around my door.
The dogs will let me know.
So suck it up, Sharon, maybe it's time
You and your sister finally severed the line.
Don't pass me over again.
Your fickle heart's unwavering.
Maybe if I lay low,
Love will fall around my door and
Maybe I won't, but your cold eyes baby
Tell me I should be looking for love with some other girl.
C'mon girls this isn't funny.
Got my head tied to the sun.
Should I choose not to run?
Heard you laughing behind your friend.
Getting in the car again
Now you're acting like she was pretending.
We can walk the road, kicking up the dust.
We can take it slow, stop me if you want.
Let me in your love, that's all that I want.
Let me in your love- it's sticky when we touch.
Whoa- whoa- whoa-whoa.
Calm that wicked wind,
To pick you up
And carry you off eastward,
Though I did release you
For to seek a warmer sky
Should you be blown back
Know that I will always run to greet you,
Still surprised to catch you
Every time
Armed with this small butterfly net
I will face the world alone
And never be lonely
So calm that wicked wind,
And if you go, you could be gone forever
I will play awhile here
By and by and by and by -
Armed with this small butterfly net
I will face the world alone
And never be lonely
Up and up you go
For to steal the secrets of the heavens
Will you share them with me
My bright and brilliant spy?
Should you be blown back
Know that I will always run to greet you
Still surprised to catch you
Every time
Still surprised to catch you
By and by and by and by -
What makes you think that it won't grow back
In a day or two
Husbands in winter, they know the truth
But what can they do
I don't like girls the way they are
So shave their legs, and make them look like movie stars
Then we can pretend it's natural
Put on whatever makes you attractive
If it's not you, then do it for the sake of fashion
If your friends like a certain you, that's who you've got to be
Junior high legs; blond hair gone brown
From removing it
Waxing since thirteen - wisdom from a beauty queen
Her tiara digging deep in her head
Put on whatever makes you attractive
If it's not you, then do it for the sake of fashion
If your friends like a certain you, that's who you have to be
That's who you've got to be
I'm starting to think that I'm kinda shy or at least I'd like to be
Winter legs give me heart attacks so take it off with laser, so it never comes back
So we can pretend it's natural
Sometimes I can be up like that, when I don't cross myself with you
Sometimes I can be down like that, when I don't cross myself with you
I'm dysmorphic in doses
Imagine trying to
Shit out
Twelve red roses
It's how I do but not everybody knows it.
Imagine how I'd feel to be called a promotionalist, a mitt man, an emotionalist.
When I don't cross myself with you
Sometimes I can be up like that, when I don't cross myself with you
Sometimes I can be down like that, when I don't cross myself with you
It's some kind
Psychosis, don't what you call it, oneness might be the closest.
A psychotropic segment so tasteless,
It tastes sweet.
And then it changes,
When I don't cross myself with you
Sometimes I can be up like that, when I don't cross myself with you
Sometimes I can be down like that, when I don't cross myself with you
You'll be the song of the last bird calling
Over the crest of the last wave falling
From the point of loving thunder
Let our dreams grow out together
Woah, oh oh oh, woah
From the center, from the center up
(Woah, I say so)
To the light
(Yeah, oh)
([A flick of light] and wonder)
Expand, expand your circle
(We hope to find enough outstanding)
Dream what that means
(Did we, will act out, weak [reality])
You walked right in and brought the gift
You always brought it among dreams
Join the [blood that flows] between us
Join the voices of our soul
Let the song be sung to teach us
Of the love and laughter yo
Woah, oh
I wanna come home
To the only place I know
Where the trees I planted grow
I wanna come home
Once I get up I feel better
Then I pull myself together
I remember those two letters
It will be ok
Everyone says now or never
I say only if it's better
Be a night like this forever
Will we know better
I want the whole world to celebrate
I want the whole world to celebrate
I want the whole world to celebrate
I want the whole world to celebrate
I'll be just fine
When I see you at the finish line
Doesn't matter if I take my time
I'm coming home
Once I get up I feel better
And I pull myself together
I remember those two letters
It will be ok
Everyone says now or never
I say only if it's better
Be a night like this forever
Will we know better
I want the whole world to celebrate
I want the whole world to celebrate
I want the whole world to celebrate
I want the whole world to celebrate
I'm not mad at you at all
But I want the whole world to celebrate
Yeah
Right about now it's time for everybody to stand up
Stand up
Stand up
And have fun
'Cause we just begun
I want the whole world to celebrate
Let's go
Once again if I feel better
Then I pull myself together
I remember those two letters
It will be ok
Everyone says now or never
I say only if it's better
Be a night like this forever
I want the whole world to celebrate
I wanna go home
I wanna go home
I wanna go home
And celebrate
I'll get the whole world to celebrate
I want the whole world to celebrate
I want the whole world to celebrate
Listen baby
Thoughts has crossed my mind
And it's clear now
You are not my kind
Oh! I've tried boy
Better ways to say
What I feel now
It seems you plan to stay
But I won't waste a day
So I say...
Hey! get out of my way
Hey! hey! hey!
You've always been in my way
Hear now honey
I'll be good to you
If you stay gone
Far out of my view
I'm sick and tired
Of your dramatic ways
And when I think of
All those wasted days
I shake loose of your laces
And say...
Hey! get out of my way
Hey! hey! hey!
You've always been in my way
This is all that I will say
This is all that I will do
I'm not in love with you!
I stayed in last night
I wasn't feeling all right
I knew it couldn't last
I started thinking of you
Oh and I wished we could be dancing in the dark
Really slow
Oh it's good to know, tomorrow you are coming home
I won't be so alone
I feel heaven in you, don't you know I feel heaven in you
Don't you know I feel heaven in you
Oh its true
I can't let go
I miss you, oh you know
Sitting alone, with the TV on
I fell asleep, I was hoping you'd call
And I dreamed we were dancing in the dark
Really slow
Oh it's good to know, tomorrow you are coming home
I won't be so alone
I feel heaven in you, don't you know I feel heaven in you
Don't you know I feel heaven in you
Oh it's true
I can't let go
I miss you, oh you know
Angel Interceptor, Apollo 21, Yuri Gagarin
Flew into the sun
The angels in heaven look down where he lay
Well tomorrow you're coming home
I feel heaven in you, don't you know I feel heaven in you
Don't you know I feel heaven in you
Oh it's true
I can't let go
I miss you, oh you know
Instrumental
You look away, you're speaking with your back turned.
Summer's gone and it left me with a sunburn
Whatever happened to our afternoons?
Just assumed that you lost me like a left turn
I spent my childhood lookin' at the stage
Waiting for the day it would be me and I could say
"Slow down..."
That's my philosophy
I get by
Making the best of what was mine
If you think this could be what you want
Then you just gotta try
You won't mind
Playing a victim of the time
'Cause I swear it's getting better yeah
That's my philosophy
It could be over in a moment
The curtain falls before you know it
Looking forward towards the next scene
Remember back when we were young and still above?
We're falling in and out of love and then again before the bell rings
If you take a trip through my mind
Who knows just what you'll find
Stop dead in your tracks from her eyes
Then put it all together
That's my philosophy
Remember the look upon her face
Remember the way she loved the chase
If we ever go back there someday
I'd never, ever, let her get away
It's drinking away the summer days
A moment in time we can't replace
I won't let my life go to waste
That's my philosophy
Sun through the curtains
I gave you a sign
The birds all were quiet
You were so quiet
Some hear a call
Some are the messengers
I thumb through the pictures
And know them all
They said, do you remember where you saw her last
I said, her skin is cinnamon, her skin is cinnamon
Do you remember where you saw her last
I said, her skin is cinnamon, her skin is cinnamon
I have too many stories
Keeping it serious
Some are collectors
Keeping it straight
It was a hospital
I was delirious
I clung to the stretcher
I drew them a heart
They said, do you remember where you saw her last
I said, her skin is cinnamon, her skin is cinnamon
Do you remember where you saw her last
I said, her skin is cinnamon, her skin is cinnamon
Her skin is cinnamon
Her skin is cinnamon
Two gondolas to carry us
Grand view was hilarious
St. paul was there to marry us
We lied, we're already married
'Cause, here's proof, we have suntans
And I spoke up with my new hands
Listen to my car
What's it telling us
Start... please start... please start
Do you remember where you saw her last
I said, her skin is cinnamon, her skin is cinnamon
Do you remember where you saw her last
I said, her skin is cinnamon, her skin is cinnamon
Is it spring where you are
I waited all winter
Chasing the lampcords back to the wall
It's a plausible scenario
I clung to the stretcher
I drew them a heart
They said, do you remember where you saw her last
I said, her skin is cinnamon, her skin is cinnamon
Do you remember where you saw her last
I said, her skin is cinnamon, her skin is cinnamon
Her skin is cinnamon
Her skin is cinnamon
Her skin is cinnamon
Her skin is cinnamon
We should spend the night in a small hotel like this
Drinking champagne in it
We could drive your car through the east end streets to the city
And still make a day of it
Take all I have I've no secrets left to steal
What would you give me for a trip behind your steering wheel
I need high heels just to stand up
Got to carry some stairs to get near enough
I need some wheels to move you around
I've borrowed some tools to chisel you down
Tie me up and I'll confess
A thousand ways that make you statuesque
And it won't last for long better do your worst
While I'll forgive you of anything
Oh you're so rehearsed
'Cause some wise guy built you pretty
So you'd get away with it
Take all I have I've no secrets left to steal
What would you give me for a trip behind your steering wheel
I need high heels just to stand up
Got to carry some stairs to get near enough
I need some wheels to move you around
I've borrowed some tools to chisel you down
Tie me up and I'll confess
A thousand ways that make you statuesque
Take all I have I've no secrets left to steal
What would you give me for a trip behind your steering wheel
I need high heels just to stand up
Got to carry some stairs to get near enough
I need some wheels to move you around
I've borrowed some tools to chisel you down
Tie me up and I'll confess
A thousand ways that make you statuesque
I need high heels just to stand up
Got to carry some stairs to get near enough
I need some wheels to move you around
I've borrowed some tools to chisel you down with
Statuesque
Statuesque
Guiding you, a voice is coming from behind the stage
Finding you, a voice is found on a missing page
Winding through, a plot controller from another age! 
Pulling the cord of mystery 
Cheating a clock
Meeting a team from history
A stranger's face is seen - but was he on our team? 
The lights go out and everybody screamed - team! 
A friend who was a foe
The quarter whistle is about to blow
Then I go
Tunnel under, tunnel under, underground
Enter sideways, reaching all around
In the darkness I will not be found
Invisible people doing the wave
Invisible people doing the wave
Invisible people doing the wave
Cold hands, warm heart
We just need some time apart
And everything will be okay
Oh no, not again
Why does it always happen?
It seems like every other day
You're too quiet, I'm too loud
Now we've rid a storm cloud
I'll see you on the other side
Old habits, young ways
Maybe we're just a phase
But we can say we really try
And it really shouldn't be this hard
You know it really shouldn't be
And if we can only see it this far
Well then I hate to say it, but it's obvious
I'm telling you, girl, there's no future for us
All talk, no action
So what's the big attraction?
And don't tell me it's "just because"
All work, no play
Don't wanna go on this way
I wanna go back to the way it was
And it really shouldn't be this hard
You know it really shouldn't be
And if we can only take it this far
Well then we've got to end it before it's too late
The love that is left turns quickly to hate
Cold hands, warm heart
We just need some time apart
You are so rarely
Rarely removed
Just left to move
With these tones misunderstood
Fresh tears leaving nervous on me
Time to repay
Back those eyes
Take those waters and settle 'em down
Just maybe
Next to you
See those tears clear as we separate
All this noise that you remove just
Calm your ears
Calm your ears baby
Music will not last
Even music music music will not last
I said
No no no
Music will not last
Said no no no baby music cannot last
Four of these fingers set to see
A clear ground division
Our division
Knows
Knows no lines
Clean these fingers clossing the line
Lines left nervous
Now to see
Can you see
With green removed
Once clear together now one's passing
And it's gone
Gone gone
Music will not last
Even music music music will not last
I said
No no no
Music can not last
No no no baby music cannot last
Read my lips
I'm into you
I'm into you
I can't resist
You're so hot (get me into the shade)
The spotlight's on
You creep into it
You like it, and
Just the way that you dance
Just the way that you dance
(Yeah yeah) Is enough to love you baby
(Yeah yeah yeah) Is enough to send me crazy
(Yeah yeah) Such angelic motion
(Yeah yeah yeah) You know you're made in heaven
The way you walk, the rhythm when you're dancing
Every inch of you spells out desire
You're such a rush, the rush is never ending
Now, You got it, you're wow wow wow wow
You got it, you're wow wow wow wow
The more I try, I try to stop
The more I can feel my antenna just sensing you up
What can I do? I'm into you
I'm into you
Love the way that you move
Just love the way that you move
(Yeah yeah) Such angelic motion
(Yeah yeah yeah) you know you're made in heaven
The way you walk, the rhythm when you're dancing
Every inch of you spells out desire
You're such a rush, the rush is never ending
Now, You got it, you're wow wow wow wow
You got it, you're wow wow wow wow
Whoa-whoa oh oh
Whoa-whoa oh
Whoa-whoa oh oh
Whoa-whoa oh
The way you walk, the rhythm when you're dancing
Every inch of you spells out desire
You're such a rush, the rush is never ending
Now, You got it, you're wow wow wow wow
The way you walk, the rhythm when you're dancing
Every inch of you spells out desire
You're such a rush, the rush is never ending
Now, You got it, you're wow wow wow wow
You got it, you're wow wow wow wow
I put a tag on everything
It lets me know just where I've been
Call out these chains and get me home
I'm coming back but will you show?
Hooray, hooray, it's not over
We have got all day to recover
And I'm on a roll so don't you be late
Too late, too late, run for cover
There is not enough love to offer
And there's more to this than acting my age
I put a price on what you say
It lets me know that I'm O.K.
But I'm a garbage man tonight
And I just don't believe my eyes
Hooray, hooray, it's not over
We have got all day to recover
And I'm on a roll so don't you be late
Too late, too late, run for cover
There is not enough love to offer
And there's more to this than acting my age
Oh you'll never believe what I have
Seen whilst I was lost, I found this
Place next to the ocean
A perfect fit for us, you're in so deep
You cannot move, so let me in
Hooray, hooray, it's not over
We have got all day to recover
And I'm on a roll, don't you be late
Hooray, hooray, it's not over
We have got all day to recover
And I'm on a roll so don't you be late
Too late, too late, run for cover
There is not enough love to offer
And there's more to this than acting my age
Too late, too late
Too late, too late
Too late, too late
Too late, too late
Too late, too late
Too late, too late
Too late, too late
Too late, too late
It doesn't matter what you say
'Cause it's written on the wall
There's no need to exaggerate
But I think this time we spoiled it all
We were heading for at spin
Where we were bound to win
We were dynamite
We would scandalize
And outrage and mesmerize
Others stopped where we'd begin
We were bound to win
But eventually
It turned out to be
A fantasy
You say you wanna walk with me
But you're always on the run
You're sure you wanna talk to me?
'Cause I say one word and then you're gone
Burn this land
Burn this land
Walking in circles around the core
Tell me what it is
That you fear, what makes you withdraw?
Would you care to sit with me
For a cup of English tea?
Very twee, very me
Any sunny morning
What a pleasure it would be
Chatting so delightfully
Nanny bakes fairy cakes
Every Sunday morning
Miles and miles of English garden stretching past the willow tree
Lines of hollyhocks and roses listen most attentively
Do you know the game croquet?
Peradventure we might play
Very gay, hip hooray
Any sunny morning
Miles and miles of English garden stretching past the willow tree
Lines of hollyhocks and roses listen most attentively
As a rule the church bells chime
When it's almost supper time
Nanny bakes fairy cakes
On a Sunday morning
Every one is
Every one is
Every one is addressed to me
Every one is
Every one is
Every one is
Oh fuck
You can't imagine so many monkeys in the daily mail
And all of them coming anonymously, so they leave no trail
Never thought I'd have an admirer from overseas
But somebody's sending me stationary filled with chimpanzees
Some chimps in swimsuits
Some chimps are swinging from a vine
Some chimps in jackboots
Some chimps that wish they could be mine
Starsky and Hutch chimps
A chimp who's sitting on the can
A pair of Dutch chimps
Who send their love from Amsterdam
Another postcard with chimpanzees
And every one is addressed to me
Another postcard with chimpanzees
And every one is addressed to me
If I had to guess, I'd say the monkey-sender thinks its great
He's sending me, maybe she's sending me, just to see me get irate
I'm losing sleep and it's gonna be keeping me up all night
I thought it was funny but now I got money on a monkey-fight
Some chimps in hard-hats
Chimps a-working on a chain gang
Some chimps who love cats
Burning rubber in a Mustang
A birthday wishing chimp
A chimp in black, like a goth
A going fishing chimp
A British chimp in the bath
Another postcard with chimpanzees
And every one is addressed to me
Another postcard with chimpanzees
And every one is addressed to me
Somebody followed me even though I packed and moved my home
No matter what they come and they come, they won't leave me alone
Another monkey in the mail could make me lose my mind
But look at me shuffling through the stack until I finally find
Some chimps in swimsuits
Some chimps in jackboots
Some chimps in hard-hats
Some chimps who love cats
I got some shaved chimps
That's chimps devoid of any hair
I got depraved chimps
Dressed up in a-womens underwear
Another postcard with chimpanzees
And every one is addressed to me
Every one is
Every one is
Every one is addressed to me
Every one is
Every one is
Every one is addressed to me
Another postcard with chimpanzees
And every one is addressed to me
Another postcard with chimpanzees
And every one is addressed to me
Some chimps in swimsuits
Some chimps in jackboots
Some chimps in hard-hats
Some chimps who love cats
I got some shaved chimps
That's chimps devoid of any hair
I got depraved chimps
Dressed up in a-womens underwear
Starsky and Hutch chimps
A chimp who's sitting on the can
A pair of Dutch chimps
Who send their love from Amsterdam
Some chimps in hard-hats

The sky turns to a different shade of blue
After the rain
My mind turns to a different point of view
After the rain
Ooh... my mind
Ooh... my mind
Ooh... my mind
I know...
Like the ocean needs the moon to take the tides away
All we need's a little time to chase the blues away
Sun is out and it feels like it's always gonna stay
Let this last forever
Turn tomorrow into yesterday
Now all those clouds have nothing left to do
After the rain
And all those doubts have drifted out of view
After the rain
Ooh... my mind
Ooh... my mind
Ooh... my mind
I know...
Like the ocean needs the moon to take the tides away
All we need's a little time to chase the blues away
Sun is out and it feels like it's always gonna stay
Let this last forever
Turn tomorrow into yesterday
Like the ocean needs the moon to take the tides away
All we need's a little time to chase the blues away
Sun is out and it feels like it's always gonna stay
Let this last forever
Turn tomorrow into yesterday
Into yesterday
I, I will be king
And you, you will be queen
Though nothing will drive them away
We can beat them just for one day
We can be heroes just for one day
And you, you can be mean
And I, I'll drink all the time
'Cause we're lovers, and that is a fact
Yes we're lovers, and that is that
Though nothing will keep us together
We could steal time just for one day
We can be heroes forever and ever
What d'you say?
I, I wish you could swim
Like the dolphins, like dolphins can swim
Though nothing, nothing will keep us together
We can beat them forever and ever
Oh we can be heroes just for one day
I, I will be king
And you, you will be queen
Though nothing will drive them away
We can be heroes just for one day
We can be us just for one day
I, I can remember (I remember)
Standing by the wall (by the wall)
And the guns shot above our heads (over our heads)
And we kissed as though nothing could fall (nothing could fall)
And the shame was on the other side
Oh, we can beat them forever and ever
Then we could be heroes just for one day
We can be heroes
We can be heroes
We can be heroes
Just for one day
We can be heroes
We're nothing and nothing will help us
Maybe we're lying, then you better not stay
But we could be safer just for one day
Just for one day
Now the clock is striking one
So we might as well begin it,
As there's dancing to be done
And our time is not infinite.
If there's such a thing as love,
If there's such a thing as love,
I'm in it.
So you claim you love me too,
Lloyd's of London guarantee it.
Gaze into these eyes of blue,
You do love me I decree it.
If there's such a thing as love,
If there's such a thing as love,
Give me it.
When I was two and a half,
My momma said to me:
"Love is funny you will laugh
Till the day you turn three."
Like a kitten up a tree
Needs a fireman to rescue it,
So your fireman I will be
And I'll really get into it.
If there's such a thing as love,
(Such a thing as love)
If there's such a thing as love,
Let's do it.
I thought I'd known love before
That was not it but I thought it
So I thought I'd win the war
Or I never would have fought it
If there's such a thing as love,
(Such a thing as love)
If there's such a thing as love,
I've caught it.
If there's such a thing as love,
(Such a thing as love)
If there's such a thing as love,
I've caught it.
If there's such a thing as love,
(Such a thing as love)
If there's such a thing as love,
Love caught it.
I let my guard down
In a momentary lapse of emotion
It just slipped out
And we both know my heart could be broken
I said something that I never intended to say
You stopped laughing and you asked me,
"Do you feel alone in that way?"
Do you trip on love?
Do you run from magic?
When you kiss someone,
Do you make it tragic?
When you feel too much,
Do you start to panic?
When your word comes up
Do you trip on love?
I just stood there
Had expected another reaction
Out of thin air,
Felt the strangest sense of satisfaction
Can you tell me how you see me somewhere
And if you held me, would you let me see that part of yourself?
Do you trip on love?
Do you run from magic?
When you kiss someone,
Do you make it tragic?
When you feel too much,
Do you start to panic?
When your word comes up
Do you trip on love?
Where do we go, do we say,
This means less than we know it does... please tell me
Do you trip on love?
Do you run from magic?
When you kiss someone,
Do you make it tragic?
When you feel too much,
Do you start to panic?
When your word comes up
Do you trip on love?
Don't you wanna love me no more?
That is why I love you so much
This is why I hate you so much
Living your life in the gray
Is the new American way
We're spending what we haven't made
And we save our money in good faith
And we work hard for our living wage
But still the bank's gotta break
'Cause a dream's a lie
And a snake it bit you
When you were awake
And the books are fried
You are bankrupted because
All the loans you take
Big wave
Big wave
Big wave
It's gonna hit you with a big wave
I can't sleep these days
And my blues they won't go away
So there are these little pills I've been takin'
And my doctor she says that they're safe
But I've been sleepwalking down to the lake
And waking up in the water
And the feeling's all right
But the snake it bit me
When I wasn't awake
And the scripts they lie
I have been poisoned from all the things I take
Big wave
Big wave
Big wave
It's gonna hit me with a big wave
Big wave
Big wave
Big wave
It's gonna hit you with a big wave
I know you feel deprived (you don't trust me)
Our love is still alive (you never touch me)
Still it's just that I don't feel like it much these days
And our love's a lie
'Cause a snake it visits me
When you are away
And the dreams don't lie
I've been corrupted 'cause
All the lovers I take
Big wave
Big wave
Big wave
You're gonna hit me with a big wave
Big wave
Big wave
Big wave
It's gonna hit you with a big wave
Big wave
Big wave
Big wave
It's gonna hit you with a big wave
Certain nation bows to the young
Nothing is wicked, everything's fun
You got some money do you right
We are jacking the ball
One tear amazingly
One tear amazingly
We are jacking the ball
Winter is over, what should we do?
Hazing loveless fall into
Tiny breaks for every day
We are jacking the ball
One tear amazingly
One tear amazingly
We are jacking the ball
Fell unto the memory
Just don't stay too long
The last word was meant to be
We are jacking the ball
One tear amazingly
One tear amazingly
We are jacking the ball
[Jay Sean]

Freedom of choice

(x2)
Alegria é olhar pro seu sorriso e
Ter você sempre ao meu lado
Alegria é andar junto a você e
Poder ser o seu namorado
O seu namorado
Meu amor não se vá
Eu sofro tanto sem ter você
Eu sofro tanto sem ter você
Alegria é olhar pra sua boca e
Poder ver sua pele macia
Alegria é poder olhar teus olhos e
Dizer que serás sempre minha
Que serás sempre minha
Meu amor não se vá
Eu sofro tanto sem ter você
Eu sofro tanto sem ter você
Through the screen door your thoughts are quarantined,
By the way you smell I can tell that you're fifteen.
My name is Denver Max, I eat heart attacks.
From your mouth to your hands to the floor you're babbling syntax.
What the crickets see is between you and me.
What scarecrows think would turn your pale cheek pink.
Don't you try to call the cops little girl
Because before you pick up the phone you'll be dead.
Don't you try to call the cops little girl;
Your tongue is withered it's heavier than lead.
Won't you just step into the car little girl;
Your parents don't understand what's in your head.
We're really onto something special little girl,
You're blushing red, your head can't hide those thoughts of dread.
Through the screen door kiss me kiss me like a queen.
It tastes like metal in my mouth like rusty Listerine.
My name is Denver Max please excuse the mask,
Running down my face, bound by tacks and paste.
What the crickets see is between you and me.
What the scarecrows think would turn your eyeballs pink.
With a face like that you'll never ever make it big,
You'll never find a boyfriend unless you get it adjusted.
My name is Denver Max and wont you come sit on my lap?
Because the only thing you own is everything you lack.
By the time we hit Tucson your parents little girl,
Parents little girl will be wondering
Where their pretty little blonde has gone.
By the time we hit Mexico you'll know little girl
Know little girl that Denver Max will always be the only one.
By the time we hit the ocean we'll jump little girl,
Jump little girl down to find the undersea sun.
Oh, I really love it here
Oh, you've thought of it all
Candlelight, coconut ice
And fur on the floor
And I really love the way you wear
Your hair And nothing more
So tell me, what is going on?
I was sure that I'd already gone
But all you say is we're all spinning
It's really not just me
But that doesn't seem to help me figure out how I can be
A prisoner in PVC a minute after three
It didn't used to be like this
Must be all that sleep I missed
Yeah, but I really love it here
You've done everything to please
Stolichnaya, banco de Gaia
Bad timing on TV
And I really love the way you turn
Your smile into striptease
But I'm still not sure what's going on
And I can't help feeling something's wrong
But you just say that we're all spinning
And it's really not just me
But that doesn't seem to help me figure out how I can be
Still wrapped inside your rubber as I wriggle at your feet
No, it didn't used to be like this
Must be something strange I kissed
Maybe when my eyes were closed?
So tell me, what is going on?
I'm sure that I've already gone
But all you say is we're all spinning
And it's really not just me
But that doesn't seem to help me figure out how I can be
Still fixed inside your fantasy
A TV refugee
So tell me, what is going on?
Just can't help feeling something's wrong
Or is it right this way I feel?
Someone get me out of here
I'm waiting on my knees
Saying, I'm looking now at pictures of us.
I remember thinking, oh this will never be lust.
Oh, the songs it spoke for me when I couldn't speak.
Shame the band's broke up I just hope we'll remember these.
Hold it up, hold it tight,
Moments live or moments die.
Hold it up, hold it strong,
Stay right here where you belong.
Hold it up, hold it tight,
The only plans of mine might sound to you cliché.
But I just plan to live the rest of my life.
Saying I'm one, no no these pictures of us,
I don't want to say goodnight to records I love.
I was thinking of not growing old, forgetting and forgot.
I don't want to forget this and I don't want to be forgot
Hold it up, hold it tight,
Moments live or moments die.
Hold it up, hold it strong,
Stay right here where you belong.
Hold it up, hold it tight,
The only plans of mine might sound to you cliché.
But I just plan to live the rest of my life.
Hold it up, hold it tight,
Moments live or moments die.
Hold it up, hold it strong,
Stay right here where you belong.
Hold it up, hold it tight,
The only plans of mine might sound to you cliché.
But I just plan to live the rest of my life.
As the floods of God
Wash away Sin City
They say it was written
In the page of the Lord
But I was looking
For that great jazz note
That destroyed
The walls of Jericho
The winds of fear
Whip away the sickness
The messages on the tablet
Was Valium
As the planets form
That golden cross Lord
I'll see you on
The Holy Cross Roads
After all this time
To believe in Jesus
After all those drugs
I thought I was Him
After all my lying
And a-crying
And my suffering
I ain't good enough
I ain't clean enough
To be Him
The tribal wars
Burning up the homeland
The fuel of evil
Is raining from the sky
The sea of lava
Flowing down the mountain
The time will sweep
Us sinners by
Holy rollers roll
Give generously now
Pass the hubcap please
Thank you Lord
Where do you go after midnight
When all the doors should be closed
Your alibis just don't sound right
I asked but nobody knows
How can you look in the eyes
And make it sound so very nice
With those True Lies
Someone's been sleepin' in my bed
This room don't smell like you and me
Who's that been sneakin' out the window
Do you think I'm too blind to see
When you look me in the eyes
And, make it sound so very nice
With those True Lies
It was a clever disguise
But, girl, I'm gettin' wise
To your True Lies
You been doin' this so long now
You're thinkin' it's the truth
I guess it don't seem so wrong if it
Ain't bein' done to you
Gotta lot to learn, baby,
You can keep it down
Word gets in the wind
Then it's bound to blow back around
Girl, can you give me a reason
Bet you don't even know why
Can't figure out what you're thinkin'
Or what it is you're tryin' to justify
When you look me in the eyes
And make it sound so very nice
With your True Lies
It was a clever disguise
But, girl, I'm gettin' wise
To your True Lies
You can laugh, you can cry
But, girl, I just can't buy
Those True Lies
I can't stop, I can't breathe, I can't think
I'm in love again
I don't need, I don't eat, I don't sleep
I'm in love again
Ooh, and every time I heard you breathe
Well I sighed
Ooh, and every time I saw you bleed
Well I cried
Love is like a song
And if you sing
If you ever need me
I'll be there in a while
I can't stop, I can't breathe, I can't think
I'm in love again
I don't need, I don't eat, I don't sleep
I'm in love again
Ooh, and every time that I'm with you
I'm alive
Ooh, and every time I think of you
There's a light
And I felt it, too
In my heart is a spring
Is a well, if you need
If you drink, if you heal
If you believe in
Every little part of me is a part of you
I can't stop, I can't breathe, I can't think
I'm in love again
I don't need, I don't eat, I don't sleep
I'm in love again
I can't stop, I can't breathe, I can't think
I'm in love again
I don't need, I don't eat, I don't sleep
I'm in love again
The boy, the boy's in love
The boy, the boy's in love
The boy, the boy's in love
The boy, the boy's in love
Holy smoke
A land sakes alive!
I never thought this could happen to me
Mm, yeah! Mm, yeah!
I got stung by a sweet honey bee
Oh, what a feeling come over me
It started in my eyes
Crept up to my head
Flew to my heart
Till I was stung dead
I'm done, uh-uh
I got stung!
Mm, yeah! Mm, yeah!
She had all that I wanted and more
And I've seen honey bees before
Started buzzin' in my ear
Buzzin' in my brain
Got stung all over
But I feel no pain
I'm done, uh-uh
I got stung!
Now, don't think I'm complainin'
I'm might pleased we met
'Cause you gimme just one little peck
On the back of my neck
And I break out in a cold cold sweat
If I live to a hundred and two
I won't let nobody sting me but you
I'll be buzzin' 'round your hive
Ev'ry day at five
And I'm never gonna leave once I arrive
'Cause I'm done
Uh-uh, I got stung!
Donde estas, donde estas, Yolanda ?
Que paso, que paso, Yolanda ?
Te busque, te busque, Yolanda.
Y no estas, y no estas Yolanda.
Tus ojos me miraron
tus labios me besaron
con ese fuego ardiente,
ardiente de mujer.
La luz de tu mirada
el fuego de tus labios
flecharon a mi pecho y de ti me enamore.
Donde estas, donde estas, Yolanda ?
Que paso, que paso, Yolanda ?
Te busque, te busque, Yolanda.
Y no estas, y no estas Yolanda.
Me dicen que paseabas
en un carro Yolanda
muy guapa y arrogante
y todos te silbaban.
Si un dia te encontrara
no se que puedo hacer
no se me vuelvo loco
si ya no te vuelvo a ver.
While there is time
Let's go out and feel everything
If you hold me
I will let you into my dreams
For time is a river rolling into nowhere
We must live while we can
And we drink our cup of laughter
The finer things keep shining through
The way my soul gets lost in you
The finer things I feel in me
The golden dance life could be
Oh, I've been sad
And have walked bitter streets alone
And come morning
There's a good wind to blow me home
So time be a river rolling into nowhere
I will live while I can
I will have my ever after
The finer things keep shining through
The way my soul gets lost in you
The finer things I feel in me
The golden dance life could be
We go so fast, why don't we make it last
Life is glowing inside you and me
Please take my hand, here where I stand
Wont you come out and dance with me
Come see, with me, come see
And lovers try
'Til they get the best of the night
And come morning
They are tangled up in the light
So time be a river rolling into nowhere
They love while they can
And they think about the night so sweet
The finer things keep shining through
The way my soul gets lost in you
The finer things I feel in me
The golden dance life could be
Seems fine, though it ain't no no no no
Seems fine, though it ain't no no
I got to find me a way to flow
Deep in the heart, I'll seek and find it all

He said you're just as boring as everyone else
When you tut and you moan and you squeal and you squelch
He said you're just as boring as everyone else
Nothing ever happens
Things replace things
Days replace days

You cannot run or ever hide it away

Something glorious is about to happen

The reckoning
They go you're just as boring as everyone else
When you tut and you moan and you squeal and you squelch
They go you're just as boring as everyone else
Stuck past timing
The fear and the yearning
The fear and the consumption
The fear and the yearning
It's gonna eat you alive
They go

And you cannot hide or ever, ever escape
(Run, run, run, run, run, run)
And you cannot hide or ever put it away

If you're willing just to take a chance

A new day is rising

Such a big day
It's a mystery
How pieces of me
Can put back together
So easily
You strike me down
From my head to the?
You thought I lost what you have found
You figured me out
You've shaken me down
So won't you tell me what I'm all about
Please ooh-ooh
Please
If I'm easy to read
Won't you tell me what I need
'Cause I'm down on my knees
Begging you baby
Please ooh ooh
Please
I'm hypnotized by this world we live in
But you know which way my pendulum's swinging
With you I'm a loser winning
It's a mystery
How it could be
That you got the look to see right through me
But now I'm complete
Back on my feet
Stepping to the beat
You made so sweet
You figured me out
You've shaken me down
So won't you tell me what I'm all about
Please ooh-ooh
Please
If I'm easy to read
Won't you tell me what I need
'Cause I'm down on my knees
Begging you baby
Please ooh ooh
Please
I'm hypnotized by this world we live in
But you know which way my pendulum's swinging
With you I'm a loser winning
Ordinary thoughts
Ever kind
Got me on a status
That crossed my mind
Possibly in another mind
Won't you come and make up my mind
I'm hypnotized by this world we live in
But you know which way my pendulum's swinging
With you I'm a loser winning
I'm alive - and the world shines for me today
I'm alive - suddenly I am here today
Seems like forever (and a day), thought I could never (feel this way)
Is this really me? I'm alive, I'm alive
I'm alive - and the dawn breaks across the sky
I'm alive - and the sun rises up so high
Lost in another world (far away), never another word (till today)
But what can I say? I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive
Suddenly came the dawn (from the night), suddenly I was born (into light)
How can it be real? I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive
I'm alive - and the world shines for me today
I'm alive - suddenly I am here today
Seems like forever (and a day), thought I could never (feel this way)
Is this really me? I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive
I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive

What I want, you've got
And it might be hard to handle
But like a flame that burns the candle
The candle feeds the flame
Yeah, yeah, what I've got, full stock
Of thoughts and dreams that scatter
If you pull them all together
And a-how, I can't explain
Oh yeah, well, well you (Ooh, ooh, ooh ooh ooh)
You make a-my dreams come true
(You) You (You, you, ooh ooh ooh, you)
Well, well, well you (Ooh, ooh, ooh ooh ooh)
Oh yeah, a-you make a-my dreams come true
(You, you, you, ooh ooh ooh, you)
Well yeah
On a night when bad
Dreams become a screamer
When they're messing with the dreamer
I can laugh it in the face
Twist and shout my way out
And wrap yourself around me
'Cause a-I ain't the way you found me
And I'll never be the same
Oh yeah, well, 'cause you (Ooh, ooh, ooh ooh ooh)
Mmm hmm, you make a-my dreams come true
(You, you, you, ooh ooh ooh, you)
Whoa yeah, well, well, well you (Ooh, ooh, ooh ooh ooh)
Woo woo, you make a-my dreams come true
(You, you, you, ooh ooh ooh, you)
Oh yeah
Well, listen to this
Ow

Oh, that sleepwalk should be over by now, I know
Ah you

Oh yeah, I've been waiting for, waiting for you, girl

Oh Stacey look what you've done,
You think that you're the only one ...
Well, she should've went to school
And she should've made it through
But she never
And she should've studied hard
And she should've played the part
But she never
Oh and she should have kept her head
And got out of bed
More in the mornings
And she should've had her day
Should have done it her way
But she never
Oh Yeah
She made her Father worry till he was sick
Found him on the couch one night cold and stiff
Now she drinks away the will and she's not proud of it
Oh Stacey look what you've done,
You think that you're the only one ...
Oh she should've had more time
To get to know the world
A little better
And she should've had more friends,
To glue her brain and stick it back together
But she had to go around
And disagree with everyone she knew
And now all her friends
They're gonna help her spend the fortune
Oh yeah
She made her Father worry till he was sick
Found him on the couch one night cold and stiff
Now she drinks away the will and she's not proud of it
Oh?.
Wasn't always gonna be this way,
It didn't have to daunt her
But I knew that's what she'd say
I will put the flowers on
And visit every week
But that won't wake your father from his every lasting sleep
She made her Father worry till he was sick
Found him on the couch one night cold and stiff
Now she drinks away the will and she's not proud of it
Oh Stacey look what you've done,
You think that you're the only one ...
Stacey
Oh Stacey
Oh Stacey
Oh Stacey
Oh Stacey
Oh Stacey
Oh Stacey, look what you've done
Stacey,
Oh Stacey

Oh Stacey, you think that you're the only one
Oh Stacey, look what you've done ...
I believe in your purpose, baby
Coming up to the surface
And maybe I'll never see you again
Then again, who knows?
Make me quiver
Hands will shiver
Still got all the things that I woulda give her
Yeah, yeah
But it's slow going
Something showing
Yeah, yeah
They say love is a stream that will find its own course
Making due is a thing, a thing I will do no more
Whenever you come back, I'll be waiting
Trifling the slack, no head gating
This is all pure fiction, you know that's right
Just pure fiction, that's all right
I believe in your purpose, baby
Coming up to the surface
And maybe I'll never see you again
Then again, who knows?
Make me quiver
Hands will shiver
Still got all the things that I woulda give her
Yeah, yeah
But it's slow going
Something showing
Yeah, yeah
Te ver e não te querer
É improvável, é impossível
Te ter e ter que esquecer
É insuportável, é dor incrível
É como mergulhar num rio e não se molhar
É como não morrer de frio no gelo polar
É ter o estômago vazio e não almoçar
É ver o céu se abrir no estilo e não se animar
Te ver e não te querer
É improvável, é impossível
Te ter e ter que esquecer
É insuportável, é dor incrível
É como esperar o prato e não salivar
Sentir apertar o sapato e não descalçar
É ver alguém feliz de fato sem alguém pra amar
É como procurar no mato estrela do mar
Te ver e não te querer
É improvável, é impossível
Te ter e ter que esquecer
É insuportável, é dor incrível
É como não sentir calor em Cuiabá
Ou como ir ao Arpoador não ver o mar
É como não morrer de raiva com a política
Ignorar que a tarde vai vadia e mítica
É como ver televisão e não dormir
Ver um bichano pelo chão e não sorrir
É como não provar o nectar de um lindo amor
Depois que o coração detecta a mais fina flor
Te ver e não te querer
É improvável, é impossível
Te ter e ter que esquecer
É insuportável, é dor incrível

One, two, three!
She got a shack
Floating down the Pontchartrain
With the water rolling in
You gotta swim
Before the levees start to crack
Another day
Another dollar down the drain
You go to town
No one's around
'Cause if you drown
There ain't no hope for coming back
It ain't no big thing if you lose your faith
They kinda like to keep you in your place
You never know what might be coming your way
Oh everybody
Devil take your money
Money's got no hold on me
Oh oh everybody's making love
'Cause love is free
You go to church
And pray to God for no more rain
A Cadillac
A paper sack
Well hey there Jack
You want some bourbon for the pain
Hey tambourine
Ain't no rhythm on the street
With the voodoo
What do you do
When the radio just plays on anyway?
Those crazy fingers in your jelly jar
They'll jack your money
While you sleep in you car
They got the karma
They ain't getting too far
Oh everybody
Devil take your money
My money's got no hold on me
Oh oh everybody's making love
'Cause love is free
Everybody come together
Everybody come together
Everybody come together
Everybody come together
Yeah everybody
Devil take your money
Money got no hold on me
Oh oh everybody's making love
'Cause love is free
Oh everybody
Devil take your money
Money got no hold of me
Oh oh everybody's making love
'Cause love is free
Love is free
They want us to fight, but we just wanna get high
Work all day all night tryin' to get fly
When I get some money imma buy me some time
I can't fight your war, until I'm finished with mine
They want us to fight, but we just wanna get high
Work all day all night tryin' to get fly
When I get some money imma buy me some time
I can't fight your war, until I'm finished with mine
I used to be mad at the government
Redirected some of my anger towards the mother ship
Tryin' to guess which shell living hell sleeps under
When the grand scheme plan keeps all these people wondering
Why we still runnin' in place frustrated?
Pride is mistaken for hate, it's upgraded
I got a little breath left let's suffocate it
Point at the epiphanies and call 'em all drug related
The time I spent with my life on bent
Tryin' to find the friends inside my head
Must have disengaged every phase of the stage
With my I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming of age
My unofficial autobio
Will be accompanied with tips on how to smile
'Cause I found that when they don't see you frown
They never know that you're a threat and they don't sweat you
When you come around
So who's gonna be my next door savior
Step up to your neighbor and do me a favor
Take off the mask let it all collapse
Empty the pack and watch your wings grow back
They want us to fight, but we just wanna get high
Work all day all night tryin' to get fly
When I get some money imma buy me some time
I can't fight your war, until I'm finished with mine
They want us to fight, but we just wanna get high
Work all day all night tryin' to get fly
When I get some money imma buy me some time
I can't fight your war, until I'm finished with mine
Society becomes jealousy
Intimacy becomes intensity
Say it with a smile like it's meant to be
And all of a sudden BOOM American family
And I could tell when you're mad at your past
Because you tend to take them turns just a little too fast
I could tell how you pushed your foot on the gas
That you already knew that you was gonna finish last
Slow it down and take a little time
To look up at them clouds with that fake silver lining
Up in a tree knowin' damn well you'll never reach the top
But you don't stop, you keep climbing
Well okay, it's settled
No more nights in this weed and thorn infested meadow
Uh uh from this day forth only forward I pedal
Get the memo I'm cutting the strings Geppetto
Shuffle the cards and let's argue
Rooted in between the computer games and cartoons
Stop it watch us all get lost
Between God and a shot of scotch, let's get fly
They want us to fight, but we just wanna get high
Work all day all night tryin' to get fly
When I get some money imma buy me some time
I can't fight your war, until I'm finished with mine
They want us to fight, but we just wanna get high
Work all day all night tryin' to get fly
When I get some money imma buy me some time
I can't fight your war, until I'm finished with mine
Uh huh... gon' work all day, work all night
Uh huh... won't fight your war until I'm finished with mine
Uh huh... gon' forward move, gon' buy me some time
Uh huh... I'm cutting your strings and keeping my smile
Uh huh... gon' work all day, work all night
Uh huh... won't fight your war until I'm finished with mine
Uh huh... gon' forward move, gon' buy me some time
Uh huh... I'm cutting your strings and keeping my smile
Uh huh... gon' work all day, work all night
Uh huh... won't fight your war until I'm finished with mine
Uh huh... gon' forward move, gon' buy me some time
Uh huh... I'm cutting your strings and keeping my smile
Go on, do what you've got to do
You've got your dreams, I've got mine too
Be strong, get off at the next stop
Don't worry about a thing
Keep taking it easy
This time it's not personal
The universe will help you now
To find the place you can breathe
And do what you've got to do
Keep taking it easy
Keep taking it easy
Come on,
I'll let you borrow my four leaf clover
Come on
Take it with you; you can pass it on
Come on
You know I'm not the kind to say that it's over
We'll be rubbing shoulders once again in the sun
Come on
Take your dreams where nobody can find them
Come on
You know I won't be happy till you've won
So come on
Come on over, borrow my clover
Is there anything left that you haven't done?
Go on, do what you've got to do
You've got your dreams, I've got mine too
Be strong, get off at the next stop
Don't worry about a thing
Keep taking it easy

Waking up warm in your arms and without a care
Nobody ain't a problem, girl
Just give me the time and the place, and I'll be there Oh oh

Something going on around here 
I could not crawl back if I tried 
I couldn't wait around 
I couldn't wait another second 
Something going on around here 
I left my baby on the side of the highway 
She just couldn't see things my way 
Someday I will treat you good 
Someday I will treat you fine 
Someday I will treat you good 
You know I should 
Everything that's made is made to decay 
Well I'm shrinking bones in the sun 
Won't you tell me why that 
The beautiful ones are always crazy 
She's whispering like Morticia now 
I left my baby on the side of the road 
I left her with a heavy load 
Someday I will treat you good 
Someday I will treat you fine 
Someday I will treat you good 
You know I should 
Something going on around here 
I could not crawl back if I tried 
I left my baby on the side of highway 
She just couldn't see things my way 
Someday I will treat you good 
Someday I will treat you fine 
Someday I will treat you good 
You know I should
He said to only look up
He said to never look down
Down is where we came from
He said to hope for the best
And take a load off our chest
Soon I could be happy
And go all the way up to heaven
And go all the way back home
He thought I might need his help
No one gets high on themselves
I just seem so lonely 
He's just trying to be nice 
And spread around his advice
I could be that happy
And go all the way up to heaven
And go all the way back home
Stay the way I am today is certainement disaster
He can tell a fairy tale, it's happily ever after
Just relax and greener grass will grow here for a change
Maybe then we'll last a million years
Or more or more or more or more
And go all the way up to heaven
And go all the way back home
Yes, I do believe what he says
I want to be happy
I could sure use his help 
No one gets by on themselves
He can make me happy
And I will only look up
(It's a warm summer breeze)
And I will never look down
(It's a weakness in your knees)
Down is where we came from
(It's a perfect place above full of everlasting love)
And I will hope for the best
(Nothing to fear, nothing to hide)
And take a load off my chest
(You just say what's on your mind)
Soon I could be happy
(Needn't think before you speak, this is how it's meant to be)
And I needed his help
(Ever high, never fall)
Now I'm high by myself
(You can do no wrong at all)
I am never lonely
(In this heaven up above filled with everlasting love)
And I will try to be nice
(To the light)
And spread around his advice
You could be this happy
(To the light)
Yes, do you believe what he says?
You could be this happy
Shape shifting city stretches and bends the night 
Figures fly past through space, faces shine with shattered light 
A dream transmigrates its way in the dark 
Twisting its secret course all through the city's heart 
Shine shattered shine 
Shine shattered shadow 
Shape shifting city stretches and bends the night 
Figures fly past through space, faces shine with shattered light 
A dream transmigrates its way in the dark 
Twisting its secret course all through the city's heart 
Shine shattered shine 
Shine shattered shadow

It's all hats off now,
All drum rolls and applause.
By slight of the hand you will turn them into dust.
A face to face you will lead them by the fall
A track fiend and saw dust
You're allowed to stare it out
Ooh ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
It's all good luck charms,
All trying to understand.
Indeed inside me (deep inside) will always hope for worst
You say you keep them close by
They're closer than you think.
A track fiend and the saw dust
You're allowed to stare it out
Ooh ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Next spring will bring you back again
You'll sigh and crack a whip for us
And maybe you will be the one
Who'll draw the line in the sand
For us to crawl
It's all at bats now
All painting gorgeous time.
And maybe when the night comes
You'll open up the cage
You'll open up the cage
I know it's dumb to say
That you are on my mind
I know it's stupid to dream
That you might think of me as a man
I can loose my own tie knot
I can button up my own pants
I can buy my own cigarettes
I can pluck my own mustache
I read it's lame to wish
That you won't walk out on me
But I'm not embarrassed to sing
Plainly the words love and your name
I can pay all my own bills (debts)
I can unroll (rip off) my own tights
I can untuck all I have to untuck
(I can humiliate myself to your face)
I can weep through my own midnights
Un p'tit air et le jour
Ça commence comme un rien
Une brume et d'embrun
Vient frapper ton corps malade
Tu disais y a des matins
J'ai la gueule à côté
Les trottoirs du hasard
Et la pluie dans le cou
Un p'tit air sur trois tours
Et perdu comme un chien
Dans l'écume dans les mains
Et retour à la rade
Tu disais y a des matins
J'ai le plomb qu'a sauté
Dans le soir des brouillards
Les mouvances de nous
Où sont-ils nos deux corps
Celui qu'avance
Celui qui pense d'abord
Quand seront-ils d'accord
Pour s'enivrer encore
Tout bas car il est tard
Ça commence à faire froid ici
Le p'tit air et toujours
Ça s'balade comme un rien
Sur les plumes de satin
De nos peaux un peu fades
Tu disais y a des matins
J'ai la vie en moitié
De mémoire de guitare
Trois accords et c'est tout
Un p'tit air un air d'amour
Si tu veux c'est le tien
La lagune se maintient
Pour jouer cette aubade
Tu disais y a des matins
J'ai le cœur à chanter
Va-t-en voir quelque part
S'il a besoin de vous
Un p'tit air et le jour
Un p'tit air sur trois tours
Un p'tit air et toujours
Un p'tit air un air d'amour
Well they called me once, and they called me twice
Third time they called me was cold as ice,
They say "get to the table, get to the table on time!"
Better make up your mind, if you wanna get to the table on time
Better get to the table, get to the table on time.
And the lord of lords, he laid out a feast,
He said "listen to me boys, this will be last one of these,
So you better get to the table, get to the table on time."
Better make up your mind, if you wanna get to the table on time
Better get to the table, get to the table on time
No matter what has ever come to me
I got my own brand of company
I got da da da inside my head
And I play songs back to back until I got to bed
Wake up by myself inside an empty room
There's no body next to mine to ooh
But my skin is warm and my heart is full
It's the do do do do do do
Walking waking on a crowded street
With my headphones loud
So my hips can swing, so my head can nod
To the rock and roll to the boom boom beat
And I find that I'm never alone
And I find that my heart is my home
And the music within makes me whole
A world that I built on my own
And I know that I'm never alone
And I know that my heart is my home
Every missing piece of me
I can find in a melody
No matter what has ever come to me
I got my own kind of company
I got ba ba ba inside my head
And I sing songs back to back until I go to bed
There's a river in my mind that's never still
Swirling, soothing all the time gives me a thrill
Swimming in the notes that go
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Wandering, waking in an empty wood
It is quiet here, I am powerful
I look down below serenade the world
From inside my soul
And I find that I'm never alone
And I find that my heart is my home
And the music within makes me whole
A world that I built on my own
And I know that I'm never alone
And I know that my heart is my home
Every missing piece of me
I can find in a melody
When the walls begin to creep in
And the sky is fallin' down
When I'm swallowed up in feelings
I get lost inside the sound...
And I find that I'm never alone
And I find that my heart is my home
And the music within makes me whole
A world that I built on my own
And I know that I'm never alone
And I know that my heart is my home
Every missing piece of me
I can find in a melody
And I find that I'm never alone
And I find that my heart is my home
And the music within makes me whole
A world that I built on my own
And I know that I'm never alone
And I know that my heart is my home
Every missing piece of me
I can find in a melody
You've got pollen on your nose
Where've you been
Where've you been
Pretty pretty bunch, I'll take a dozen of those
You've got pollen on your nose
I want love in the afternoon
I want love in the afternoon
I want love in the afternoon
I want love in the afternoon
You've got pollen on your nose
Where've you been
Where've you been
We make the dirt go flying
With our shovels and hoes
You've got pollen on your nose
Aaaaaahhmmm
Aaaaaahhmmm
I'll wait and see if you'll give it to me
I'll wait and see if you'll give it to me
I'll wait and see if you'll give it to me
I'll wait and see if you'll give it to me
Waiiit...
You've got pollen on your nose
I've been leaking like a garden hose
Oh yeah, all of the tension 
Been getting too hard not to mention 
Been getting to hard to imagine 
A time outside this pressure 
Just to take the money 
You've got me running around in circles 
You just can't imagine 
This place were we felt free
Yeah... 
You might be lucky if you try 
Try putting your armour down, oh... 
We'll come again 
We'll come again 
We'll come again 
You might be lucky if you try 
Sometimes it ain't no simple drop in the ocean 
It's getting too hard to imagine 
A time outside this common notion 
I can see you take the money 
You got me running around in circles 
You just can't imagine 
A space where we felt free
Yeah... 
You might be lucky if you try 
Try putting your armour down, oh... 
We'll come again 
We'll come again 
We'll come again 
You might be lucky if you try 
We'll come again
We'll come again
We'll come again
We'll come again
We'll come again
We'll come again
We'll come again
We'll come again
We'll come again
Yeah...
It's got me running around in circles 
It don't sit so pretty when it's looking straight at you in the eye 
You've been down but you been feeling itchy...
We'll come again 
We'll come again 
We'll come again 
You might be lucky if you try
She drives a little white car to the seminar on Modern Romance
Possible possible ideas for a date include... a shooting range
And her chest is full to bursting with thoughts of an evening
Nobody nobody nobody will ever know her longing
She's got a heart that will never melt
She's got a heart that will never never melt
Shields up! Shields up! Bar the door, and keep your dukes up!
Tell lies, tell dirty lies, tell diggory lies, until you're lying in his bed
He has a tendency, a tendency to fall for shining eyes and baby fat
But the quarry don't share his taste for Anne McCaffrey
And he dresses alright but the conversation is wrong, all wrong
Nobody nobody nobody will ever know his longing
He's got a heart that will never melt
He's got a heart that will never never melt
Shields up! Shields up! Bar the door, and keep your dukes up!
Tell lies, tell diggory lies, tell chiggery lies, until you're lying in his bed
Now you can endure the fear now you can endure the hell
Now you can endure the lies now you can endure the fear
So, I've made up my mind
I will pretend to leave this world behind
And in the end, you'll know I've lied
To get your attention
I'm faking my own suicide
I'm faking my own suicide
Because I know you love me
You just haven't realized
I'm faking my own suicide
They'll hold a double funeral
Because a part of you will die
Along with me
I wish you thought that I was dead
So rather than me you'd be depressed instead
And before arriving at my grave
You'd come to the conclusion
You'd loved me all your days
But it's too late
Too late for you to say
Because I'm faking my own suicide
Because I know you love me
You just haven't realized
Oh, I'm faking my own suicide
They'll hold a double funeral
Because a part of you will die
Along with me
I'll write you a letter that you'll keep
Reminding you your love for me is more than six feet deep
You say aloud that you would have been my wife
Right about that time is when I come back to life
And let you know
I'd let you know all along I was...
All along I was faking my own suicide
Because I know you love me
You just haven't realized
I was faking my own suicide
I'll walk in that room and see your eyes opened so wide
Opened so wide
Because you know
Because you know you will never leave my side
Until the day that I die for the first time
And we'll laugh, yeah we'll laugh
And we will cry
So overjoyed at the love that's so alive
Our love is so alive

There are stories in the soil, loose leaves cover the ground
There's volumes in the forest, no one reads out loud
If I could take them down off of that mountain shelf
We used to climb but no one tries to go up that far now yeah
We're all too busy working, entertaining ourselves
Forty hours television and prescription pills
Well I take two a day to make my brain behave
It never does but who's to say at least my doctor gets paid
So that's fine, yeah come by we'll take the afternoon off
We can kiss and undress or if you want just talk
'Cause I've got nothing real, just empty space to fill
And you're my girl I like your style just imagine all the time we could kill
And time's not poison but once you drink it all you'll die
So let's just sip it real slow
Yeah we can nurse it all night
Try to believe that once it's gone
We'll pour another round and come back to life
Come right back
I guess I'm moving faster now or that's what they said
And though some days still take forever I can't disagree
Because it seems to me that I wake up and sleep
Look in the mirror have no idea what happened in between
But I remember counting days down till the year could be done
So I could scatter all my notebooks on the prep school lawn
And disappear again into a summer's bliss
Of staying out sleeping in and getting drunk with my friends
That's gone and I know that it won't ever come back
I accept I won't cling to what I had in the past
But life's a slippery slope, regret's the steepest hill
Hope for the best, plan for the worst and maybe wind up somewhere
In the middle
And I'm not saying that I know what I want
But I know what I don't, don't want to rot in my room
And never know what could have been
Believe what everyone else tells me is true
Yeah, they say 'true'
That's what they say
There are those who understand
That long before this all began
A hammer hit the nail with great sympathy
A clothespin hanging on the line
The cork that bottles up your wine
Strings that bowed in concert, make a symphony
And oh oh, the ancient commonsense of things
And oh oh, the ancient commonsense of things
There are those who know to look
Through all the crannies and the nooks
When I found you dear, what it meant to me
Book to shelf, and foot to shoe
And likewise I belong to you
My heart is pounding loud, just like a timpani
And oh oh, the ancient commonsense of things
And oh oh, the ancient commonsense of things
And oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh...
Oh oh, the ancient commonsense of things
And oh oh, the ancient commonsense of things
And oh oh, the ancient commonsense of things
And oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh...
Oh oh, the ancient commonsense of things
Sometimes I don't feel all right
Keeps me shaking up all night
And there's nothing I can do
But I wanna talk to you
This shit's making me feel bad
I'm so sick of feeling sad
Why can't I shake this mess?
Keeps on running through my head
I can't get out of my bed
Stomach sick, dizzy head
Singing helps all right
But I've been singing all night
Try to open up my eyes
Take some time to realize
Sometime's shit won't feel all right
Got to remember to fight
Off the darkness that comes in sometimes
Turn that sorrow into something that feels right
You're two friends I can count on when I'm blue
You pull me up, you dust me off, you will me through
Sometimes luck's not on my side
Keeps me shaking up all night
And there's nothing I can do
But I wanna talk to you
This shit's making me feel bad
I'm so sick of feeling sad
Why can't I shake this mess?
Always running through my head
Now I can't get out of bed
Stomach sick, dizzy head
Singing helps all right
But I've been singing all night
Try to open up my eyes
Take some time to realize
Sometime's shit won't feel all right
Got to remember to fight
Off the darkness that creeps in sometimes
And turn that sadness into something that feels right
'Cause you're two friends I can count on when I'm blue
You pull me up, you dust me off, you pull me through
You're my love, whoa-oh-oh-oh
It's true, you're my love, whoa-oh-oh-oh
It's true you're my love, whoa-oh-oh-oh
Darling, it's true
I can swear I feel the beating of a cold cold heart
Or there's a chill because it's showing through your clothing
And as far as I can tell there's nothing underneath your v-neck tee
I'm begging I'm begging I'm begging you please now
Tell me that you want me
Tell me that you need me
Tell me 'cause I'd like to know
Won't you stop teasing me?
Won't you take it easy?
Tell me 'cause I'd like to know
You're never gonna go
Drop. Whatcha. Got. Now.
Drop. Whatcha. Got. Now.
Everybody knows the way the eye goes
Moving like a curtain closes over the finale
From your head down to your toes
Up and down checking you out now 
Beyond a doubt make a copy in the office
For the desk with the windows
In the ivory dome you've made it your home
See you in the sills, smiling ear to ear
Never gonna go
Do you want me?
Tell me that you need me
Tell me 'cause I'd like to know
Won't you stop teasing me?
Won't you take it easy?
Tell me 'cause I'd like to know
You're never gonna go
Drop. Whatcha. Got. Now.
Drop. Whatcha. Got. Now.
Drop. Whatcha. Got. Now.
Won't you tell me that you want me?
Tell me that you need me
Tell me 'cause I'd like to know.
Won't you stop teasing me?
Won't you take it easy?
Tell me 'cause I'd like to know.
You're never gonna go
Drop. Whatcha. Got. Now.
Drop. Whatcha. Got. Now.
Drop. Whatcha. Got. Now.
Tell me that you want me
Tell me that you need me
Tell me 'cause I'd like to know
Now!
She's a Wicked Girl
Worst in all the world
A mystery lies in her
She spends her days
In a violent rage
Try as I might
I love her
Everytime the tears run dry
The story goes
What's left behind
Shivers like a leaf
Taciturn and gentle
It's not hard to believe
The Girlshapedlovedrug
Messes with my mind
Don't ask me why,
The Girlshapedlovedrug
Messes with your mind
She likes to fight
The whole world bang to rights
Yours truly, I'd die for her
The growing pains
Dissolve in lemonade
The sweetness flies to her
Every time her temper flares
A storm will blow
What's left's so rare
A fragment of the girl
Soft and sentimental
The side she tries not to share
The Girlshapedlovedrug
Messes with my head
Don't ask me why,
The Girlshapedlovedrug
Messes with your mind
Don't ask me why,
The Girlshapedlovedrug
Messes with my mind
When your song is sung
Don't let me colour your opinion
That girl's my life, I tell ya
Every time my tears run dry
And the moment's flown
And re-designed
My feelings for the girl
How could I be without her?
I would surely still find
The Girlshapedlovedrug
Messes with my mind
Don't ask me why,
The Girlshapedlovedrug
Messes with my mind
Don't ask me why,
The Girlshapedlovedrug
Messes with your mind
Don't ask me why,
The Girlshapedlovedrug
Messes with my mind
It's 6 A-M and the
Sun is getting high
He picks up the mail from the slot
He feels the
Rush of excitement as he holds it in his hand
Another love note no one got
Some postman
Is grooving
To all our love letters
Some postman is gonna cry
Some postman
Is grooving
To all our love letters
Some postman is gonna cry
Gonna cry
Gonna cry
It's noon now
And all the mailboxes have been emptied
And all the letters are inside
He counts them
He checks them
He looks for clues and finds
The ones with hearts on the outside
Some postman

To all our love letters
Some postman is gonna cry

Holding onto a package
Meant for a distant lover

She thinks he does not love her
The postman holds on oh-so tight
Some postman
Is grooving
To all our love letters
Some postman is gonna cry
Some postman
Is grooving
To all our love letters
Some postman is gonna cry
Gonna cry, yeah!
You crushed paper hearts
Stole and sold and ripped to part
Promise with stamps
Deliver, deliver to me
Some postman you turned out to be!
Be it true, you ain't got nothin' to do.
I think I'm better than you. whee whoo.

Explode or capsize
Provide my poet
If you're down
Town the line
You're so fine
Dead wrong
I am driving in my car up Highway 1 
I left L.A. without telling anyone 
There were people who needed something from me 
But I am sure they'll get along fine on their own 
Oh, this state of ecstasy
Nothing but road could ever give to me
This liberty wind in my face
And I'm giggling again for no reason
I am dancing with my friends in elation
We've taken adventures to new levels of fun
I can feel the bones are smiling in my body
I can see the meltings of inhibition
Oh, this state of ecstasy
Nothing but road could ever give to me
This liberty wind in my face
And I'm giggling again for no reason
I'm reeling jubilation
Triumphant in delight
I am at home in this high five
And I'm smiling for no reason
I am sitting at the set of Cali sun
We've gotten quiet for it's last precious seconds
I can feel the salt of the sea on my skin
And we still hear the echoes of abandon
Oh, this state of ecstasy
Nothing but net could ever give to me
This liberty wind in my face
And I'm giggling again for no reason
I can't wait, wanna see
How this night is gonna be
Just a touch, away
From a feelin' that is here to stay
We can make it last forever, baby
Our love will stand the test of time
In the middle of our world, I'll be waiting
For you to be all mine
We're walking on sunshine
In the middle of the night
And it feels like I'm somewhere
Above the sky, I, I, I
We're walking on sunshine
In the middle of the night
And it feels like I'm somewhere
Above the sky, I, I, I
Take my hand, close your eyes
Say the sweet little things that Make me cry
Catch my tears, with a kiss
These special moments do exist
We can make it last forever, baby
Our love will stand the test of time
In the middle of our world, I'll be waiting
For you to be all mine
We're walking on sunshine
In the middle of the night
And it feels like I'm somewhere
Above the sky, I, I, I
Let's take a chance and try love baby
No I'm not giving up
Till you tell me that you'll be in my life
Until the end of time...(I, I, we can make it last)
Until the end of time...(I, I, we can make it last)
We're walking on sunshine
In the middle of the night
And it feels like I'm somewhere
Above the sky, I, I, I
We're walking on sunshine
In the middle of the night
And it feels like I'm somewhere
Above the sky, I, I, I
We're walking on sunshine
In the middle of the night
And it feels like I'm somewhere
Above the sky, I, I, I
We're walking on sunshine
In the middle of the night
And it feels like I'm somewhere
Above the sky, I, I, I
(We can make it last... we can make it last... I, I, I)

How do you do 
What you do to me? 
I wish I knew, 
If I knew how you do it to me 
I'd do it to you. 
How do you do 
What you do to me? 
I'm feeling blue, 
Wish I knew how you do it to me 
But I haven't a clue. 
You give me a feeling in my heart, 
Like an arrow piercing through it. 
I suppose that you think you're very smart, 
But won't you tell me how do you do it? 
How do you do 
What you do to me? 
I wish I knew, 
If I knew how you do it to me

I never wanted to be better than my friends
I just wanted to prove wrong the people in my head
The ones who told me I'd be better off dead
The ones who told me that I would never win
When I delivered newspapers they said I was too slow
When I was a barista they said I made lousy foam
When I worked in retail they said I was a slob
Much too dumb for school and much too lazy for a job
So I rode my bike like lightning
And I made cappuccinos that would make the angels sing
Took two showers a day and I dressed up like a princess
Shook my fist in my own face and said I'll show you who's the best
I wrote the kinds of papers teachers hang up on their walls
I was employee of the month at seven different shopping malls
And one time playing football I pulled the tendons in my leg
To prove that I was tough I hopped on one foot
And finished up the game
I thought if I succeeded I'd be happy and they'd go away
But first thing in the morning I'd still wake up and I'd hear them say
"You're fat, ugly, and stupid, you should really be ashamed
No one will ever like you, you're not good at anything"
And sometimes I'd rise to the challenge
But other times I'd feel so bad that I could not get out of bed
And on the days I stayed in bed I sang and sang and sang
About how crappy I felt, not realizing how many other people would relate
Now people send me emails that say thanks for saying the things they didn't know how to say
And the people in my head still visit me sometimes
And they bring all of their friends but I don't mind
I play my guitar like lightning
When I sing I like it when you sing too loud and clear
Different voices different tones all sayin' "yeah, we're not alone"
I got good at feeling bad and that's why I'm still here
I got good at feeling bad and that's why I'm still here
I got good at feeling bad and that's why I'm still here
Be gone
Be gone
Be gone your olden ways, be gone
Don't be afraid of anyone
Like seasons, just move on
Aorta liver ventricles
And other winter vehicles
From indigo to crystalline
You've one more chance, so get it right
Oh Floreal
Oh guillotine
Oh Floreal
I love your iridescent sheen
As it reflects you and reflects me
Oh don't believe all of your golden memories
They're little more than make believe
So listen carefully
Agonic lines, ascendances and amatory tendencies
From here to heart arrhythmias
Oh don't you know we're not like this
Oh Floreal
Oh guillotine
Oh Floreal
I love your iridescent sheen
As it reflects you and it reflects me
Oh Floreal
Oh guillotine
Oh Floreal
I love your iridescent sheen
As it reflects you and reflects me
When will I get my chance to make the lilacs bloom?
To decorate the tomb with petals from the groom?
Who cried "the circumstance could never be assumed"?
It's hard to say, it's hard to say
When will I get my chance to burn the shoulders of
The women and the men who dance when they're in love
Who give into romance like hands give into gloves?
It's hard to say, it's hard to say
When will I get my chance to watch autumn leaves fall?
To make babies crawl to windowsills and all
To watch the colors change?
And some children are so strange
Some children are so strange
When will I get my chance to watch autumn leaves fall?
To make babies crawl to windowsills and all
To watch the colors change?
And some children are so strange
Some children are so strange
When will I get my chance to put you in a trance?
A-watchin all the snow that's fallin'
Even though it never lets you down
Never makes a sound
It's hard to say, it's hard to say
I... I am just a number
I... hang on to what I got
You... say what you want to
I... I... I... I just try to stay alive
I... put myself together
People say, get away, somebody will turn you in
Life, life without surrender
Togetherness... ecstasy is what I need
I can laugh, but I should cry
When love and understanding are the ultimate crimes
(And I said) Walk it down. Talk it down.
(Oh, oh, oh) Sympathy. Luxury.
Somebody will take you there.
Walk it down. Talk it down.
(Oh, oh, oh) Sympathy. Luxury.
Somebody will take you there.
She... says she remembers.
Time... long time ago.
We... belong together.
I... I... I... I turn up the radio
Lies, lies and propaganda
I... gonna tell you what I need
Life, life, without surrender
Togetherness... ecstasy is what I need
I got yours and you got mine
And I can swim, but I should fly
Ain't no crime to believe
I took my money, I bet my life
What you see is what you get
But it sure ain't what we need.
What's with these homies dissin' my girl
Why do they gotta front?
What did we ever do to these guys
That made them so violent?
Woo hoo, but you know I'm yours
Woo hoo, and I know you're mine
Woo hoo, and that's for all time
Ooh wee ooh, I look just like Buddy Holly
Oh, oh, and you're Mary Tyler Moore
I don't care what they say about us anyway
I don't care 'bout that
Don't you ever fear for I'm always near
I know that you need help
Your tongue is twisted, your eyes are slit
You need a guardian
Woo hoo, and you know I'm yours
Woo hoo, and I know you're mine
Woo hoo, and that's for all time
Ooh wee ooh, I look just like Buddy Holly
Oh, oh, and you're Mary Tyler Moore
I don't care what they say about us anyway
I don't care 'bout that, I don't care 'bout that
Bang, bang, a knock on the door
Another big bang and you're down on the floor
Oh no, what do I do?
Don't look now but I lost my shoe
I can't run and I can't kick
What's a matter babe, are you feelin' sick?
What's a matter, what's a matter, what's a matter you?
What's a matter babe, are you feelin' blue? Oh
Ooh wee ooh, I look just like Buddy Holly
Oh, oh, and you're Mary Tyler Moore
I don't care what they say about us anyway
I don't care 'bout that, I don't care 'bout that
I don't care 'bout that, I don't care 'bout that, oh
Young boy you done me bad, I went and did ya wrong 
Young boy you done me bad, I went and did ya wrong 
Then I got high, Lord, I got high 
And I got a bone to pick with you 
And I'm sure you know its true 
Oh, one day when you're looking back 
You were young and man you were sad 
When you're young you get sad 
When you're young you get sad
Then you get high 
Oh man
Young gal, you done me bad and I went and did ya wrong 
Young gal, you done me bad so I went and did ya wrong 
Then I got high 
Lord I got high 
Now you got a bone to pick with me
But I wish you'd let me be 
Oh, one day when you're looking back 
You were young and man you were sad 
When you're young you get sad 
When you're young you get sad 
Then you get high 
You get high
Oh, the days the rain would fall your way 
Oh, the days the rain would fall your way 
Then you been high 'cause you got sad 
'Cause you got sad 
Oh man
If I were you and you were me,
And we were back in '93
We had it all and all was well,
And this is where about I fell.
But that was then, we could pretend
Our differences would be the end 
I take it back, full-blown attack 
Now it all just fades to black
I just wanna feel alive 
Time goes flying by 
Doodoo doodoo doodoo 
Doodoo doodoo doodoo 
If this is how it's gonna be 
Then I might as well be free 
If this is how you're gonna act 
Then I just won't take it back 
I knew you well, I knew you then 
But now I can't seem to pretend 
Where have we gone, It's been so long? 
I just wanna feel alive 
Time goes flying by 
Doodoo doodoo doodoo 
Doodoo doodoo doodoo 
Doodoo doodoo doodoo 
Doodoo doodoo doodoo 
If I were you and you were me 
And we were back in '93 
We had it all and all was well 
And this was where about I fell 
I would've died, you never lied 
Way before we even tried 
And if I knew what we'd go through 
Would I still be into you? 
Still be into you? 
I just wanna be happy 
I just wanna be happy 
I just wanna be happy here sometime 
Doodoo doodoo doodoo 
Doodoo doodoo doodoo 
Doodoo doodoo doodoo 
Doodoo doodoo doodoo
Free from your past
Free of your future too
There's nothing left to rise above but you
Show me your ocean red
Kiss the tears that stain my neck
Drug me with visions untrue
But I own a photograph
You lay there naked upon your back
Safe in a stone house by the sea
There's nothing true and nothing's real
But I remember one clear feel
Warm beneath your gentle company
While I lay dying upon some bed
I hope that you remember this
The only one I want to see is you
Hi Kids ich bin Carlo, werft den Arm hoch und gebt mir ein "Hallo"
(Hallo)
Ja ja ja, genauso, weil das hier so schön klingt nochmal 'ne Runde
Hi Kids ich bin Carlo, werft den Arm hoch und gebt mir ein "Hallo"
(Hallo)
Ja ja ja, genau so, jeder der mich nicht kennt nimmt trotzdem den Arm hoch!
Sie sagen ich hätt' Power und wollen alle meine Tracks loben
Denn ich spitte nur noch mit dem Finger in der Steckdose
(Verrätst du uns dein Geheimnis?)
Ich weiß nicht, denn es ist mir irgendwie so peinlich
(Komm schon)
Okay! Ich mach jeden Tag
(Schüttelgeräusch)
Und 3x-täglich
(Geräusch)
Und das wichtigste ist
(Geräusch)
Doch ich bin grad bloß am Bahnhof
Schlag jetzt die Zeit und danach deine Mum tot
Spaß, ich bin harmlos'
Und spiel auf meiner Blockflöte Kanon, Plural Kanons
Und wir fahr'n los, ham' schon gepackt
Doch ich renn lieber nackt durch die Nacht und schrei:
"Warum?"
Das hier ist sowas wie 'ne Warnung
Cro war nur Tarnung, oh nenn' mich Carlo!
Hi Kids ich bin Carlo, werft den Arm hoch und gebt mir ein "Hallo"

Ja ja ja, genauso, weil das hier so schön klingt nochmal 'ne Runde
Hi Kids ich bin Carlo, werft den Arm hoch und gebt mir ein "Hallo"
(Hallo)
Ja ja ja, genau so, jeder der mich nicht kennt nimmt trotzdem den Arm hoch!
Leute fragen mich, ob soviel Swag eigentlich weh tut
Keine Ahnung, denn ich fühle nichts, doch mir geht's gut
Dank der Ups und Downer bin ich gerade so erträglich
Überdosis überheblich, überroll dich wie ein D-Zug!
Denn ich bin ein Geisterfahrer
Ich hab meistens Kater
Komm mit 3 Spartanern aus dem Leichenlager
Du sagst das klingt komisch?!
Wie Dr. Dre und 50 ham' den gleichen Vater
Nein, wie Dr. Dre und 50 ham' nen weißen Vater
(Hä?)
Ey, wieso sollte ich mich jemand anpassen?
Denn ein Klaps auf den Po ist doch die beste Anmache
Keine Ahnung, wieso deine Homes mich anlachen
Sieht so aus als würde ich ihnen nicht so große Angst machen
So langsam wird es Zeit, dass ich meine Gun packe
Scheiße man, ich hab noch keine, sammel weiter Pfandflaschen
Und bis ich die Kohle irgendwann dann mal zusammenkratze
Chill ich einfach weiter, Jogginghose, weiße Zwangsjacke
Hi Kids ich bin Carlo, werft den Arm hoch und gebt mir ein "Hallo"
(Hallo)
Ja ja ja, genauso, weil das hier so schön klingt nochmal 'ne Runde
Hi Kids ich bin Carlo, werft den Arm hoch und gebt mir ein "Hallo"
(Hallo)

I'm dreaming of sleeping next to you
I'm feeling like a lost little boy in a brand new town
I'm counting my sheep and 
Each one that passes 
Is another dream to ashes 
And they all fall down.
As I lay me down tonight, 
I close my eyes and what a beautiful sight
I'm sleeping to dream about you 
I'm so tired of having to live without you 
But I don't mind
I'm sleeping to dream about you and I'm so tired
I found myself in the riches 
Your eyes, your lips, your hair,
Well you were everywhere.
But I woke up in the ditches, 
I hit the light and I thought you might be here
But you were nowhere. 
You were nowhere at home.
As I lay me back to sleep 
This love I pray that I can keep
Sleeping to dream about you 
I'm so tired of having to live without you 
But I don't mind
I'm sleeping to dream about you and I'm so tired
It's just a little a lullaby to keep myself from crying myself to sleep at night
Sleeping to dream about you 
I'm so tired of having to live without you 
But I don't mind
Sleeping to dream about you and I'm so tired
You didn't have to be so nice
I would have liked you anyway
If you had just looked once or twice
And gone upon your quiet way
Today I said the time was right for me to follow you
I knew I'd find you in a day or two
And it's true
You came upon a quiet day
You simply seemed to take your place
I knew that it would be that way
The minute that I saw your face
And when we've had a few more days (When we've had a few more days)
I wonder if I'll get to say (Wonder if I'll get to say)
You didn't have to be so nice (Be so nice)
I would have liked you anyway (Would have liked)
Today I said the time was right for me to follow you (Today, said that the time was right to follow you)
I knew I'd find you in a day or two (I knew that I would find you in a day or two)
And it's true
You didn't have to be so nice (Didn't have to be so nice)
I would have liked you anyway (Would have liked you anyway)
If you had just looked once or twice (Once or twice)
And gone upon your quiet way (Quiet way)
I want to call requests through heating vents
And hear them answered with a whispered no
To crack the code of muscles, slacken, tense
Let every second step in boots on snow
Complete your name in accents I can't place
That stumble where the syllables combine
Take depositions from a stranger's face
Paint every insignificance a sign
So tell me nothing matters less or more
Say whatever we think actions are
We'll never know what anything was for
If near is just as far away as far
And I'm permitted one act I can save
I choose to sit here next to you and wave
I'm sad to see that you are sad
I'm sad to see that you are sad
But there's nothing to be sad about
Really nothing to feel bad about
There she was standing peacefully
Sending the message through telepathy
Way beyond the speculation
Furthest away from any condition
But there's nothing to be sad about
Really nothing to feel bad about
There she was standing peacefully
Sending the message through telepathy
Way beyond the speculation
Furthest away from any condition
Here to pacify, connected to joy
Go
When you go into the place
That you work you have no face
You know you wanna go (go baby)
The moment that you get there (go baby)
And you get the evil eye
From the people you despise
And you know you wanna go (go baby)
The moment that you get there (go baby)
You're such a pretty, pretty, pretty little girl
Let's blow this ugly, ugly, ugly little world
Go
There's a party going down
All your friends are going 'round
You know you wanna go (go baby)
The moment that you get there (go baby)
As the people that you know
Act like monkeys in a row
You know you wanna go (go baby)
The moment that you get there (go baby)
You're such a pretty, pretty, pretty little girl
Let's blow this ugly, ugly, ugly little world
Go
When you go into the shop
Lady watches like a cop
You know you wanna go (go baby)
The moment that you get there (go baby)
She don't like the way you look
So she treats you like a crook
You know you wanna go (go baby)
The moment that you get there (go baby)
You're such a pretty, pretty, pretty little girl
Let's blow this ugly, ugly, ugly little world
Go
Come around to this fine town
Where freedom makes the world go round
And where dreams are found
And carried out
Even in the afternoon
You can go there fishing for the moon
And the fairy lights
Glow like fireflies
Come on save it
Come on save it
Every single one
Come on save it
Come on save this town
Growing from diversity
Out of true originality
It's the place to be
And that's why
I fear the need to standardise
And I fear the guys with normal eyes
It's a precious child
Come give it a try
And we try
Every single one
Come on save it
Come on save this town
I know that we can't save this town alone
So this is why I say
Come on and raise your voice
And spread these words around:
Come on save it
Come on save it
Every single one
Come on save it
Come on save this town
Honestly, why are my clothes out on the street?
Honestly, I think you've lost your mind
I can't believe I came home to find my car keyed
And honestly I'm way too tired to fight
'Round and 'round drama every time
Imma go 'cause I got no
Problem with saying goodbye
Is it wrong that I'm gonna be
Having the time of my life?
'Cause deep down I know
I should cry, I should scream,
And get down on my knees
I should say that I need you here
But I'm gonna party tonight
'Cause honestly, I just don't care
Honestly, I just don't care
Honestly, everybody's stoked, I'm finally free
And honestly my phone's blowing up tonight
I'll go out, get drunk again
Make out with all your dumb friends
Tag your face just to rub it in
Imma go 'cause I got no
Problem with saying goodbye
Is it wrong that I'm gonna be
Having the time of my life?
'Cause deep down I know
I should cry, I should scream,
And get down on my knees
I should say that I need you here
But I'm gonna party tonight
'Cause honestly, I just don't care
Honestly, I just don't care
Oh
Don't roll up when they're playing my song
Don't act right when you know you're dead wrong
You're out of line, out of line tonight
Well I'm on the couch when you come back home
It's a little too late 'cause I'm already gone
I'm already gone
Honestly, you did it to yourself
So don't blame me
Imma go 'cause I got no
Problem with saying goodbye
Is it wrong that I'm gonna be
Having the time of my life?
'Cause deep down I know
I should cry, I should scream,
And get down on my knees
I should say that I need you here
But I'm gonna party tonight
Imma go 'cause I got no
Problem with saying goodbye
Is it wrong that I'm gonna be
Having the time of my life?
'Cause deep down I know
I should cry, I should scream,
And get down on my knees
I should say that I need you here
But I'm gonna party tonight
'Cause honestly, I just don't care
Honestly, I just don't care
Honestly, I just don't care
Honestly, I just don't, I just don't, I just don't
Honestly, I just don't care
She said, "Let's put a plastic bag over our heads.
And then kiss and stuff till we get dizzy and fall on the bed."
We were in Heaven for five or six minutes, then we passed out
And I was so in love I thought I knew what love was all about
In church on Sunday making out in front of the preacher
You had a black shirt on with a big picture of Nietzsche
When we had done our thing for a full Christian hour
I had made up my mind that there must be a higher power
A higher, higher power
A higher, higher power
Yes, it's real
At your Christmas party, I hold your hair when you vomit
I help you up to brush your teeth and then I kiss your stomach
We lie still on your bed, the room is lit only by the telly
And it's a perfect night for feeling melancholy
A higher, higher power
A higher, higher power
Higher, higher power
Higher, a higher power
A higher, higher power
A higher, a higher power
Jump into that water and see for yourself
Take a deep breath and hold it in, hold it in
She's got a secret and she wants to tell
But I made a promise to hold it in, hold it in
Baby I'm in love and maybe it's not to tell
Only thing that I can do is hold it in, hold it in
I was told that I'm a man now and I'm not allowed to cry
The only thing that I can do is hold it in, hold it in
Hah!
Life is "Oh my God, if I tell him, he'll tell her, and then she will know I like her!"
Good grief! I don't think that I can take this heartbreak any longer
I will not hold it in
Hoo! Hoo! Hoo!
Well the couple with the baby and it's no secret why
Neither one was able to hold it in, hold it in
Kids in the streets yeah they're all getting high
Everybody's screaming "hold it in, hold it in!"
Ha-hey!
If there's God, He's embarrassed and it's no secret why
The only thing that He can do is hold it in, hold it in
So I printed him a letter to be sent out to sea
Looking for a bottle to hold it in, hold it in
Ha!
Somewhere over the rainbow
Way up high
And the dreams that you dreamed of
Once in a lullaby
Oh, somewhere over the rainbow
Bluebirds fly
And the dreams that you dreamed of
Dreams really do come true
Someday I'll wish upon a star
Wake up where the clouds are far behind me
Where trouble melts like lemon drops
High above the chimney top, that's where you'll find me
Oh, somewhere over the rainbow bluebirds fly
And the dream that you dare to, oh why, oh why can't I?
Well, I see trees of green and red roses too
I'll watch them bloom for me and you
And I think to myself
What a wonderful world
Well, I see skies of blue, and I see clouds of white
And the brightness of day, I like the dark 
And I think to myself
What a wonderful world
The colors of the rainbow so pretty in the sky
Are also on the faces of people passing by
I see friends shaking hands
Saying, "How do you do?"
They're really saying, I, I love you
I hear babies cry, and I watch them grow
They'll learn much more than we'll know
And I think to myself
What a wonderful world, world
Someday I'll wish upon a star
Wake up where the clouds are far behind me
Where trouble melts like lemon drops
High above the chimney top, that's where you'll find me
Oh, somewhere over the rainbow way up high
And the dream that you dare to, why, oh why can't I?
I ain't got no home, ain't got no shoes
Ain't got no money, ain't got no class
Ain't got no skirts, ain't got no sweater
Ain't got no perfume, ain't got no beer
Ain't got no mind
Ain't got no mother, ain't got no culture
Ain't got no friends, ain't got no schooling
Ain't got no love, ain't got no name
Ain't got no ticket, ain't got no token
Ain't got no God
Yeah, and what about God?
Why am I alive anyway?
Yeah, what about God?
Nobody can take away
Got my hair, I got my head
Got my brains, I got my ears
Got my eyes, I got my nose
Got my mouth,
I got my smile
I got my tongue, got my chin
Got my neck, got my boobs
Got my heart, got my soul
Got my back,
I got my sex
I got my arms, got my hands
Got my fingers, got my legs
Got my feet, got my toes
Got my liver,
Got my blood
I've got life,
I've got my freedom
I've got the life
I've got the life
And I'm gonna keep it
I've got the life
And nobody's gonna take it away
I've got the life
Ba, da, da, da, da, da
Ba, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da
Ba, da, da, da, da, da
Ba, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da
What's it gonna take to wake me up
From this black hole I've been living in?
I see my body shake, it's tensing up
My vitals won't be givin' in.
Wake me up.
(Ooh, woo, ooh) I've found what I've been missin' lately.
(Ooh, woo, ooh) It's the reason why my heart's been racing.
It took a car crash to turn it around,
I've figured it out- that I don't have it down.
(Ooh, woo, ooh) I gotta get my feet back on the ground.
Ba, da, da, da, da, da
Ba, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da
This isn't at all what I expected-
To be stranded, drifting all alone.
How can I stay cool, calm, and collected
When my world's been turned and overthrown?
All I can remember was the brake lights flashing,
The sound of the crash, and gasping for air.
It begs the question:
Is this the end?
My last impression:
The end of the world.
Wake me up.
(Ooh, woo, ooh) I've found what I've been missin' lately.
(Ooh, woo, ooh) It's the reason why my heart's been racing.
It took a car crash to turn it around,
I've figured it out- that I don't have it down.
(Ooh, woo, ooh) I gotta get my feet back on the ground.
The lights and sounds,
They are getting closer now.
As they surround,
I realize I will make it out.
And as they pull me from the wreckage,
The stretcher's coming, it's just what I need.
Wake me up.
And it's obvious...
(Ooh, woo, ooh) I've found what I've been missin' lately.
(Ooh, woo, ooh) It's the reason why my heart's been racing.
It took a car crash to turn it around,
I've figured it out- that I don't have it down.
(It took a car crash to turn it around.)
(Ooh, woo, ooh) I've found what I've been missin' lately.
(Ooh, woo, oh) It's the reason why my heart's been racing.
It took a car crash to turn it around,
I've figured it out- that I don't have it down.
(It took a car crash to turn it around.)
(Ooh, woo, oh) I finally get my feet back on the ground.
Ba, da, da, da, da, da,
Ba, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da
Well I've been pushed to the edge by my headache blues
And I got pulled by the pull of the tide.
And I got stripped of my soul, standing in my shoes
Come back, come back, my little peace of mind
Come back, come back, my little peace of mind
Come back, come back, my little peace of mind
Since the day you've been gone I cannot keep from crying
Come back, come back, my little peace of mind
And I've sent signals and signs from the mountainsides
Now I'm gonna try this old microphone light
And now I'm callin' out your name on this radio campaign
Come back, come back, my little peace of mind
Come back, come back, my little peace of mind
Come back, come back, my little peace of mind
Since the day you've been gone I cannot keep from crying
Come back, come back, my little peace of mind.
Come back, come back, my little peace of mind
Come back, come back, my little peace of mind
Since the day you've been gone I cannot keep from crying
Come back, come back,
Come back, come back,
Come back, come back, my little peace of mind.
So one thing led to another
You were calling her a lover
Her brothers her brother
Yeah if you want me to do it, I
Guess that I'll do it, but
I'm telling you
One wrong move and yeah we're through
Hey there sister wife
Get the hell out it's my night
You don't know the way to his heart
Like I do
Damn man kick out the likeness
The view is the prophet
I don't think you got this
Yeah holy as our father
I'd rather not bother, I
And I'm telling you
One wrong move and we're through
Hey there sister wife
Get the hell out it's my night
You don't know the way to his heart
Like I do
I'm stuck with two
I'm stuck with you
I'm stuck with two
I'm stuck with
Hey there sister wife
Get the hell out it's my night
You don't know the way to his heart
Like I do
Te senti venir como en una vision, 
Ya estas aqui y mi mente exploto, 
Desde que estas conmigo creo que ahora 
Brillla mas el sol desde que estas 
Conmigo no se que paso que te di mi corazon,
Y ahora voy caminando junto a ti, 
Somos dos nunca sola vas a ir y ahora 
Voy sonriendo junto a ti somos dos 
Juntos vamos a vivir, pa pa pa pa pa 
Pa pa paara pa pa pa pa pa paara.
Voy pensando en ti cuando lejos estoy 
Hoy pensaste en mi y mi mente exploto 
Desde que estoy contigo la musica tiene 
Otro sabor desde que estoy contigo no se 
Que pasoo que te di mi corazon
Y ahora voy caminando junto a ti, 
Somos doooos nunca sola vas a ir
I would like to hold your hand
As we're shifted through this twisted abandon
I would like to think that you'd know your way
We have dodged the ropes of rain
Well the cats and dogs well they love to play
On the handsome fella with umbrella
Who once saved you your day
And I will ask you to open my door from your side
From the inside after you drive
Because I wanna stay wet for a little bit longer
That's why
I warm the engine compartment up
While I stand here and think it up
But it's a little too early to bury the worries
Till this wish is my command
And I wonder, wonder which one of us
Is gonna state the obvious
And I wonder if you already know
That I gotta let you go
I know this ain't the way I planned it
I guess I ain't the great romantic
And I'm not doubling back now
No doubling back
Doubling back now
Well before I catch you complaining that it hardly rains at all
Let me stop to lock my top
For fear of it falling harder
By the eyes were ears and the arms are
Scars of where the war was waged on words that we heard as a joke
How did it drown our love
Oh love
When it rains it's sure to pour
But when I look in your eyes
I fear I won't see surprise
That I'm not doubling back cause
I wonder, wonder which one of us
Is gonna state the obvious
And then I wonder if you already know
That I gotta let you go
I know this ain't the way I planned it
I guess I ain't the great romantic
And I'm not doubling back now
No doubling back now
Doubling back now
No doubling back now
Doubling back now
No doubling back now
Doubling back now
No doubling back now
Doubling back now
No doubling back now
Doubling back now
No doubling back now
No turning around now
No going back now
No
I'm a good guy for a gal
So won't you look my palm over?
I've got time for a chat
So won't you tell me my future?
I'm gonna break down at fifty
And I'm not quite a stallion
I'm a good guy for a gal
And I'm mentally slipping
Oh yeah, oh yeah, what's that ya see?
Oh boy, find out what's up with me
Oh yeah, oh yeah, what's that ya see?

Ariella, 7:30, I don't want to get up yet
Listen to the morning music, cursing the alarm you set
As you know, I've never been a praying man
I don't need a God to make me feel all right
But if you wonder why I never wrote you a song
It's because happiness writes white.
I try to put it into words, but the words just sound like mistakes
I try to find a set of chords, but you know how long that takes me
I don't trust my fingers, I don't trust my tongue
The work is too important and we're no longer young, after all.
When I consider what you put up with I'm amazed you still have skin
When I consider what you mean to me, It's everything.
It's e-ve-ry-thing.
Ariella, 11:30, I don't want to go to sleep
Turn the TV off already, Curse the hours we have to keep
As you know, I've never been a confident man
I've been in the tall grass all my life
Until you came along; now there's one less thing wrong
Even though happiness writes white.
I know happiness writes white,
I know happiness writes white, (I know happiness writes white)
I know happiness writes white, (I know happiness writes white)
I know happiness writes white,
I know happiness writes white,
I know happiness writes white.
Ariella are you sleeping?
I don't even know how I got here
But I know that I don't ever wanna leave
I feel the aura and I feel the atmosphere
The bass is pumping and now I believe
That life is my bass synth, I feel the attack now
That I have a taste there is no turning back
We are moving as one, we align with the stars
I know nothing can tear us apart
There's something taking over my heart
The night is coming out of the dark
It's like there's no one else in the room
Cause baby, all I see is, all I see is you
Throw my hands up to the sky, let the music take me
All our senses come alive, let the music take me
Throw my hands up to the sky, let the music take me
All our senses come alive, so happy I could die
Heartbeat racing, body losing all control
Baby, you keep my feet on the floor
You take over the rhythm, take over my soul
You be dancing, leave me asking you for more
That life is my bass synth, I feel the attack now
That I have a taste there is no turning back
We are moving as one, we align with the stars
I know nothing can tear us apart
There's something taking over my heart
The night is coming out of the dark
It's like there's no one else in the room
Cause baby, all I see is, all I see is you
Throw my hands up to the sky, let the music take me
All our senses come alive, let the music take me
Throw my hands up to the sky, let the music take me
All our senses come alive, so happy I could die
Don't tell me I don't know you
I don't know you
Remember what I told you
Through these lies
There's something taking over my heart
The night is coming out of the dark
It's like there's no one else in the room
Cause baby, all I see is, all I see is you
Throw my hands up to the sky, let the music take me
All our senses come alive, let the music take me
Throw my hands up to the sky, let the music take me
All our senses come alive, so happy I could die
Instrumental
You mean a lot to me
You've got a heart of gold
Everything falls apart
Leaves you in the cold
Purpose is scaring me
What if I can't see mine
Love on the filthy streets is so divine
You are the colour my dear
You are the colour my dear
You mean a lot to me
You've got a heart of gold
Once I have found the words
I'll loosen my hold
You are the colour my dear
You are the colour my dear
You are the colour my dear
You are the colour my dear
Fill your life with something else baby
Fill your life with something else baby
Fill your life with something else baby
Fill your life with something else baby
Fill your life with something else baby
Fill your life with something else baby
Fill your life with something else baby
Fill your life with something else baby
Walking down a sunny street to the library
Checking out the latest books about outer space
Going to the fruit stand to buy a dozen oranges
Then she and the books and the oranges go back to her place
She tells the same old story to everyone that she knows
She's just sitting in her room reading books about UFOs
Sometimes I see her sitting on the rooftop
Perched on a lawn chair and staring into the sky
I know somewhere in some faraway galaxy
That some gray men with telescopes are gazing right into her eyes
She tells the same old story to everyone that she knows
She's just sitting in her room reading books about UFOs
She tells the same old story to everyone that she knows
She's just sitting in her room reading books about UFOs
Her life revolves around all of the planets
And she is constantly aware of all the changes that occur
I'm going to turn into a lens and focus all my attention
On finding a new planet and naming it right after her
She tells the same old story to everyone that she knows
She's just sitting in her room reading books about UFOs
She tellin' the same old story to everyone that she knows
She's just sitting in her room reading books about UFOs
Yeah
Hold your fire
I'm coming out and I'll tell you the truth
I was trying to raise my roof
Did you see it
That I needed to prove
That my stinger always stays
You said she's beautiful when she plays
Did I hit you in the proper place
Suddenly
I, oh well I could live in this town
Five cold years before I
Yes I could live in this town
Before I head for home
It's my turn
With the spotlight burning a hole
But my bird-heart's turning cold
As the temperature rises all around
To the sound of a ticking bomb
And then it's not just showing off here
You know there's something going on here
Going on here
Suddenly
I, oh well I could live in this town
Five cold years before I
Yes I could live in this town
Five cold years
Yes I could live in this town
Five cold years before I
Well I could live in this town
Before I head for home
And considered it odd
That I ever stayed
You know that feeling you get
When you don't want to leave
That feeling when you don't want to leave
I, oh well I could live in this town
Five cold years before I
Yes I could live in this town
Five cold years
Yes I could live in this town
Five cold years before I
Well I could live in this town
Before I head for home
And considered it odd
That I ever stayed
﻿Well, you done done me and you bet I felt it
I tried to be chill but you're so hot that I melted
I fell right through the cracks
Now I'm trying to get back
Before the cool done run out I'll be giving it my bestest
And nothing's gonna stop me but divine intervention
I reckon it's again my turn to win some or learn some
But I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait, I'm yours
Well, open up your mind and see like me
Open up your plans and damn you're free
Look into your heart and you'll find love love, love, love
Listen to the music of the moment, people dance and sing
We're just one big family
And it's our God-forsaken right to be loved, love, love, loved, loved
So I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait I'm sure
There's no need to complicate
Our time is short
This is our fate, I'm yours
Do you want to, come on
Scootch over closer dear
And I will nibble your ear
I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the mirror
And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer
But my breath fogged up the glass
And so I drew a new face and I laughed
I guess what I'll be saying is there ain't no better reason
To rid yourself of vanities and just go with the seasons
It's what we aim to do
Our name is our virtue
But I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait, I'm yours
Well open up your mind and see like me
Open up your plans and damn you're free
Look into your heart and you'll find that the sky is yours
So please don't please don't please don't
There's no need to complicate
'Cause our time is short
This oh this oh this is our fate I'm yours
Oh I'm yours, oh I'm yours, oh
Baby, do believe I'm yours
You best believe, you best believe I'm yours
Robert's got a quick hand
He'll look around the room, he won't tell you his plan
He's got a rolled cigarette
Hanging out his mouth, he's a cowboy kid
Yeah, he found a six-shooter gun
In his dad's closet with a box of fun things
And I don't even know what
But he's coming for you, yeah, he's coming for you, wait
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You'd better run, better run, outrun my gun
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You'd better run, better run, faster than my bullet
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You'd better run, better run, outrun my gun
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You'd better run, better run, faster than my bullet
Daddy works a long day
He'll be coming home late, yeah, he's coming home late
And he's bringing me a surprise
'Cause dinner's in the kitchen and it's packed in ice
I've waited for a long time
Yeah, the sleight of my hand is now a quick-pull trigger
I reason with my cigarette
And say, "Your hair's on fire, you must have lost your wits," yeah
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You'd better run, better run, outrun my gun
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You'd better run, better run, faster than my bullet
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You'd better run, better run, outrun my gun
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You'd better run, better run, faster than my bullet
Run run run run
Ru-ru-ru-run run run
Ru-ru-ru-ru-run run run run
Ru-ru-ru-run
Run run ru-run run
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You'd better run, better run, outrun my gun
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You'd better run, better run, faster than my bullet
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You'd better run, better run, outrun my gun
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You'd better run, better run, faster than my bullet
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You'd better run, better run, outrun my gun
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You'd better run, better run, faster than my bullet
I backed my car into a cop car the other day
Well, he just drove off, sometimes life's okay
I ran my mouth off a bit too much, oh, what did I say?
Well, you just laughed it off, it was all okay
And we'll all float on okay
And we'll all float on okay
And we'll all float on okay
And we'll all float on anyway
Well, a fake Jamaican took every last dime with that scam
It was worth it just to learn some sleight of hand
Bad news comes, don't you worry, even when it lands
Good news will work its way to all them plans
We both got fired on exactly the same day
Well, we'll float on, good news is on the way
Bring it on, here we are, win or lose, win or lose
Win or lose, win or lose, win or lose, win or lose
Win or lose, win or lose, I can't say
And we'll all float on okay
And we'll all float on okay
And we'll all float on okay
And we'll all float on alright
Already, we'll all float on
No, don't you worry, we'll all float on alright
Already, we'll all float on alright
Don't worry, we'll all float on
Alright, already, and we'll all float on alright
Already, we'll all float on alright
Don't worry, even if things end up a bit
Too heavy we'll all float on alright
Already, we'll all float on alright
Already, we'll all float on okay
Don't worry, we'll all float on
Even if things get heavy, we'll all float on alright
Already, we'll all float on alright
Don't you worry, we'll all float on alright
We'll all float on
Johanna drove slowly into the city
The Hudson River all filled with snow
She spied the ring on His Honor's finger
Oh
A thousand years in one piece of silver
She took it from his lilywhite hand
Showed no fear, she'd seen the thing
In the Young Men's Wing at Sloan-Kettering
Look outside at the raincoats coming, say oh
Look outside at the raincoats coming, say oh
Ay, ay, ay, ay
Ay, ay, ay, ay
His Honor drove southward seeking exotica
Down to the Pueblo huts of New Mexico
Cut his teeth on turquoise harmonicas
Oh, oh
I saw Johanna down in the subway
She took an apartment in Washington Heights
Half of the ring lies here with me
But the other half's at the bottom of the sea
Look outside at the raincoats coming, say oh
Look outside at the raincoats coming, say oh
Look outside at the raincoats coming, say oh
Look outside at the raincoats coming, say oh
Ay, ay, ay, ay
Ay, ay, ay, ay
Happiness hit her like a train on a track
Coming towards her, stuck still, no turning back
She hid around corners and she hid under beds
She killed it with kisses and from it she fled
With every bubble she sank with a drink
And washed it away down the kitchen sink
The dog days are over
The dog days are done
The horses are coming
So you better run
Run fast for your mother, fast for your father
Run for your children, for your sisters and brothers
Leave all your love and your longing behind
You can't carry it with you if you want to survive
The dog days are over, oh
The dog days are done
Can you hear the horses?
'Cause here they come
And I never wanted anything from you
Except everything you had and what was left after that, too, oh
Happiness a-hit her like a bullet in the back
Struck from a great height by someone who should've known better than that
The dog days are over
The dog days are done
Can you hear the horses?
'Cause here they come
Run fast for your mother, run fast for your father
Run for your children, for your sisters and brothers
Leave all your love and your longing behind
You can't carry it with you if you want to survive
The dog days are over
The dog days are done
Can you hear the horses?
'Cause here they come
(The dog days are over)
(The dog days are done)
Here they come
(The horses are coming)
(So you better run)
Here they come
(The dog days are over)
(The dog days are done)
Here they come
(The horses are coming)
(So you better run)
Tonight I'm gonna have myself a real good time
I feel alive
And the world I'll turn it inside out, yeah
I'm floating around in ecstasy
So don't stop me now
Don't stop me
'Cause I'm having a good time
Having a good time
I'm a shooting star leaping through the sky
Like a tiger
Defying the laws of gravity
I'm a racing car passing by
Like Lady Godiva
I'm gonna go, go, go
There's no stopping me
I'm burning through the sky, yeah
200 degrees, that's why they call me Mister Fahrenheit
I'm travelling at the speed of light
I wanna make a supersonic man out of you
Don't stop me now

Don't stop me now
Cause I'm havin' a good time
Don't stop me now
Yes I'm havin' a good time
I don't wanna stop at all, yeah
I'm a rocket ship on my way to Mars
On a collision course
I am a satellite
I'm out of control
I'm a sax machine ready to reload like an atom bomb
About to whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, explode
I'm burning through the sky, yeah
200 degrees, that's why they call me Mister Fahrenheit
I'm travelling at the speed of light
I wanna make a supersonic woman of you
(Don't stop me)
(Don't stop me)
(Don't stop me)
Hey, hey, hey

I don't care if Monday's blue
Tuesday's grey and Wednesday too
Thursday, I don't care 'bout you
It's Friday I'm in love
Monday, you can fall apart
Tuesday, Wednesday, break my heart
Oh, Thursday doesn't even start
It's Friday I'm in love
Saturday, wait
And Sunday always comes too late
But Friday, never hesitate
I don't care if Monday's black
Tuesday, Wednesday, heart attack
Thursday, never looking back
It's Friday I'm in love
Monday, you can hold your head
Tuesday, Wednesday, stay in bed
Or Thursday watch the walls instead
It's Friday I'm in love
Saturday, wait
And Sunday always comes too late
But Friday, never hesitate
Dressed up to the eyes, it's a wonderful surprise
To see your shoes and your spirits rise
Throwing out your frown and just smiling at the sound
As sleek as a sheikh spinning 'round and 'round
Always take a big bite, it's such a gorgeous sight
To see you eat in the middle of the night
You can never get enough, enough of this stuff
It's Friday I'm in love, oh
I don't care if Monday's blue
Tuesday's grey and Wednesday too
Thursday, I don't care about you
It's Friday I'm in love
Monday, you can fall apart
Tuesday, Wednesday, break my heart
Thursday doesn't even start
It's Friday I'm in love, oh
Ah ow, ow!
Woo woo woo woo woo
Ow woo woo woo woo
Ah, doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Oh, doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Oh, oh, oh, oh whoa whoa
Yeah
Hip hip
Hip hip
Hip hip
Hip hip
When you're on a holiday
You can't find the words to say
All the things that come to you
And I wanna feel it too
On an island in the sun
We'll be playin' and havin' fun
And it makes me feel so fine
I can't control my brain
Hip hip
Hip hip
When you're on a golden sea
You don't need no memory
Just a place to call your own
As we drift into the zone
On an island in the sun
We'll be playin' and havin' fun
And it makes me feel so fine
I can't control my brain
We'll run away together
We'll spend some time forever
We'll never feel bad anymore
Hip hip
Hip hip
Hip hip
On an island in the sun
We'll be playin' and havin' fun
And it makes me feel so fine
I can't control my brain
We'll run away together
We'll spend some time forever
We'll never feel bad anymore
Hip hip
Hip hip
(We'll never feel bad anymore)
Hip hip
(No, no)
Hip hip
Hip hip
(We'll never feel bad anymore)
Hip hip
(No, no)
Hip hip
So at my show on Monday
I was hoping that someday
You'd be on your way to better things
It's not about your make-up
Or how you try to shape up
To these tiresome paper dreams
Paper dreams honey
So now you pour your heart out
You're telling me you're far out
You're all about to lie down for your cause
But you don't pull my strings
'Cause I'm a better man
Moving on to better things
But uh oh, I love her because
She moves in her own way
But uh oh, she came to my show
Just to hear about my day
And at the show on Tuesday
She was in her mindset
Tempered firs and spangled boots
Looks are deceiving
Making me believe it
And these tiresome paper dreams
Paper dreams honey, yeah
So won't you go far
Tell me you're a keeper
You're all about to lie down for your cause
But you don't pull my strings because
'Cause I'm a better man
Moving on to better things
But uh oh, I love her because
She moves in her own way
But uh oh, she came to my show
Just to hear about my day
Yes our wish's that we never made it
Through all the summers
We kept them up instead of
Kicking us back down to the suburbs
Yes our wish's that we never made it
Through all the summers
We kept them up instead of
Kicking us back down to the suburbs
But uh oh, I love her because
She moves in her own way
But uh oh, she came to my show
Just to hear about my day
But uh oh, I love her because
She moves in her own way
But uh oh, she came to my show
Just to hear about my day
Here comes the sun
Here comes the sun
And I say
It's all right
Little darlin'
It's been a long cold lonely winter
Little darlin'
It feels like years since it's been here
Here comes the sun
Here comes the sun, and I say
It's all right
Little darlin'
The smiles returning to their faces
Little darlin'
It seems like years since it's been here
Here comes the sun
Here comes the sun, and I say
It's all right
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes
Little darlin'
I feel that ice is slowly melting
Little darlin'
It seems like years since it's been clear
Here comes the sun
Here comes the sun, and I say
It's all right
Here comes the sun
Here comes the sun
It's all right
It's all right
If I told you things I did before
Told you how I used to be
Would you go along with someone like me
If you knew my story word for word
Had all of my history
Would you go along with someone like me
I did before and had my share
It didn't lead nowhere
I would go along with someone like you
It doesn't matter what you did
Who you were hanging with
We could stick around and see this night through
And we don't care about the young folk
Talking 'bout the young style
And we don't care about the old folks
Talking 'bout the old style too
And we don't care about their own folks
Talking 'bout their own style
All we care 'bout is talking
Talking, only me and you
Usually when things has gone this far
People tend to disappear
No one will surprise me unless you do
I can tell there's something going on
Hours seems to disappear
Everyone is leaving, I'm still with you
It doesn't matter what we do
Where we are going to
We can stick around and see this night through
And we don't care about the young folk
Talking 'bout the young style
And we don't care about the old folks
Talking 'bout the old style too
And we don't care about their own folks
Talking 'bout their own style
All we care 'bout is talking
Talking, only me and you
And we don't care about the young folk
Talking 'bout the young style
And we don't care about the old folks
Talking 'bout the old style too
And we don't care about their own folks
Talking 'bout their own style
All we care 'bout is talking
Talking, only me and you
Talking, only me and you
Talking only me and you
Talking only me and you

(Óró mo churaichín ó) And you said
It was like fire around the brim
(Óró mo churaichín ó) Burning solid, burning thin, the burning rim
(Óró mo churaichín ó) Like stars burning holes right through the dark
(Óró mo churaichín ó) Flicking fire like saltwater into my eyes
(Óró mo churaichín ó) You were one inch from the edge of this bed
(Óró mo churaichín ó) I dragged you back a sleepyhead
Sleepyhead (Óró mo churaichín, churaichín)
(Óró mo churaichín ó) They couldn't think of something to say the day you burst
(Óró mo churaichín ó) Those hungry lions with all their might and all their thirst
(Óró mo churaichín ó) They crowd your bedroom like some thoughts wearing thin
(Óró mo churaichín ó) Against the walls, against your rules, against your skin
(Óró mo churaichín ó) My beard grew down to the floor and out through the doors
(Óró mo churaichín ó) Of your eyes, but you're disguised like a sleepyhead 
(Óró mo churaichín ó)
Sleepyhead (Óró mo churaichín, churaichín, churaichín)

One, two, three, uh
My baby don't mess around
Because she loves me so
And this I know for sure (Uh)
But does she really want to
But can't stand to see me walk out the door (Ah)
Don't try to fight the feeling
'Cause the thought alone
Is killing me right now (Uh)
Thank God for Mom and Dad
For sticking two together
'Cause we don't know how
Come on, hey ya, hey ya
Hey ya, hey ya
Hey ya, hey ya
Hey ya, hey ya
You think you've got it
Oh, you think you've got it
But got it just don't get it
'Til there's nothing at all (Ah)
We get together
Oh, we get together
But separate's always better
When there's feelings involved (Ah)
If what they say is
Nothing is forever
Then what makes, then what makes
Then what makes, then what makes (What makes, what makes)
Then what makes love the exception?
So why oh, why oh
Why oh, why oh, why oh
Are we so in denial
When we know we're not happy here?
Y'all don't want to hear me (Hey ya)
You just wanna dance

Alabama, Arkansas
I do love my Ma and Pa
But not the way that I do love you
[Alex]
Well, holy moly, me oh my
You're the apple of my eye
Girl, I've never loved one like you
[Jade]
Man, oh man, you're my best friend
I scream it to the nothingness
There ain't nothin' that I need
[Alex]
Well, hot and heavy pumpkin pie
Chocolate candy, Jesus Christ
There ain't nothin' please me more than you
[All]
Oh home, let me come home
Home is wherever I'm with you
Oh home, let me come home
Home is wherever I'm with you
[Jade & Alex]
Lalalala, take me home
Momma, I'm coming home
[Alex]
I'll follow you into the park
Through the jungle, through the dark
Girl, I've never loved one like you
[Jade (Alex)]
Moats and boats, and waterfalls
Alleyways and payphone calls
I've been everywhere with you (hey!)
(That's true)
[Alex (Jade)]
Laugh until we think we'll die (we'll die!)
Barefoot on a summer night (summer night!)
Never could be sweeter than with you
[Jade]
And in the streets we're running free
Like it's only you and me
[Jade & Alex]
Geez, you're somethin' to see
[All]
Oh home, let me come home
Home is wherever I'm with you
Oh home, let me come home
Home is wherever I'm with you
[Jade & Alex]
Lalalala, take me home
Daddy, I'm coming home
[Jade & Alex]
"Jade..."
"Alexander..."
"Do you remember that day you fell out of my window?"
"I sure do, you came jumping out after me."
"Well, you fell out in the concrete and nearly broke your ass.
And you were bleeding all over the place and I rushed you off to the hospital.
Do you remember that?"
"Yes, I do."
"Well, there's something I never told you about that night."
"What didn't you tell me?"
"While you were sitting in the backseat, smoking a cigarette you thought was gonna be your last,
I was falling deep, deeply in love with you, and I never told you till just now!"
"Aw..."
[All]
Home, let me come home
Home is wherever I'm with you
Oh home, let me come home
Home is when I'm alone with you!
[Alex]
Home, let me come home
Home is wherever I'm with you
[Jade]
Home, yes I am home
Home is when I'm alone with you
[Jade]
Alabama, Arkansas
I do love my Ma and Pa.
Moats and boats and waterfalls
Alleyways and payphone calls
Home is wherever I'm with you
Home is when I'm alone with you
They were sitting
They were sitting in the strawberry swing
Every moment was so precious
They were sitting
They were talking in the strawberry swing
Everybody was for fighting
Wouldn't want to waste a thing
Cold cold water, bring me 'round
Now my feet won't touch the ground
Cold cold water, whatcha say?
It's such, it's such a perfect day
It's such a perfect day
I remember
We were walking up to strawberry swing
I can't wait 'til the morning
Wouldn't want to change a thing
People moving all the time
Inside a perfectly straight line
Don't you wanna just curve away?
And it's such, it's such a perfect day
It's such a perfect day
Ahh...
Now the sky could be blue
I don't mind
Without you, it's a waste of time
Could be blue
I don't mind
Without you, it's a waste of time
Now the sky could be blue
Could be grey
Without you, I'm just miles away
Now the sky could be blue
I don't mind
Without you, it's a waste of time
Four letter word just to get me along
It's a difficulty and I'm bitin' on my tongue
And I, I keep stallin' and keepin' it together
People around gotta find somethin' to say now
Holdin' back everyday the same
Don't wanna be a loner
Listen to me, oh no
I never say anything at all
But with nothin' to consider they forget my name (-ame, -ame, -ame)
They call me hell
They call me Stacey
They call me her
They call me Jane
That's not my name
That's not my name
That's not my name
That's not my name
They call me quiet girl
But I'm a riot
Mary-Jo-Lisa
Always the same
That's not my name
That's not my name
That's not my name
That's not my name
I'll miss the catch if they throw me the ball
I'm the last chick standing up against the wall
Keep fa-fallin', these heels they keep me borin'
Getting clamped up and sittin' on the fence now
So alone all the time and I lock myself away
Listen to me, I'm not
And though I'm dressed up out and all
With everything considered they forget my name (-ame, -ame, -ame)
They call me hell
They call me Stacey
They call me her
They call me Jane
That's not my name
That's not my name
That's not my name
That's not my name
Counterpoint:
This song was in my head and now it's in my mind
Call it reach it get some words and get some timin'
And though I realize, I cannot emphasize
I'll stick around but just don't promise, nothing bindin' 
They call me quiet girl
But I'm a riot
Mary-Jo-Lisa
Always the same
That's not my name
That's not my name
That's not my name
That's not my name
Counterpoint:
Baby can't you see, that you're so desperately
A standin' joker like a vocal one-liner
Instead of sing-a-long, this song is monotone
I gotta get some soul I gotta get some feelin' 
Are you callin' me darlin'?
Are you callin' me bird?
Are you callin' me darlin'?
Are you callin' me bird?
They call me hell
They call me Stacey
They call me her
They call me Jane
That's not my name
That's not my name
That's not my name
That's not my name
They call me quiet girl
But I'm a riot
Mary-Jo-Lisa
Always the same
That's not my name
That's not my name
That's not my name
That's not my name
They call me hell
They call me Stacey
They call me her
They call me Jane
That's not my name
That's not my name
That's not my name
That's not my name
They call me quiet girl
But I'm a riot
Mary-Jo-Lisa
Always the same
That's not my name
That's not my name
That's not my name
That's not my name
They call me hell
They call me Stacey
They call me her
They call me Jane
That's not my name
That's not my name
That's not my name
That's not my name
So alone all the time and I lock myself away
Though I'm dressed up out and all
With everything considered they forget my name
They call me quiet girl
But I'm a riot
Mary-Jo-Lisa
Always the same
That's not my name
That's not my name
That's not my name
That's not my name
Let me tell you now
When I had you to myself
I didn't want you around
Those pretty faces always made you
Stand out in a crowd
But someone picked you from the bunch
One glance was all it took
Now it's much too late for me
To take a second look
Oh baby, give me one more chance
(To show you that I love you)
Won't you please let me
Back in your heart
Oh darling, I was blind to let you go
(Let you go, baby)
But now since I see you in his arms
(I want you back)
Yes I do now (I want you back)
Ooh, ooh baby (I want you back)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (I want you back)
Na na na na
Trying to live without your love
Is one long sleepless night
Let me show you, girl
That I know wrong from right
Every street you walk on
I leave tear stains on the ground
Following the girl
I didn't even want around
Let me tell you now
Oh baby, all I need is one more chance
(To show you that I love you)
Won't you please let me
Back in your heart
Oh darlin', I was blind to let you go
(Let you go baby)
But now since I see you in his arms, uh huh
A buh buh buh buh
A buh buh buh buh
All I want
A buh buh buh buh
All I need
A buh buh buh buh
All I want
A buh buh buh buh
All I need
Oh, just one more chance
To show you that I love you
Baby (baby), baby (baby), baby (baby)
(I want you back)
Forget what happened then
And let me live again
Oh baby, I was blind to let you go
But now since I see you in his arms
(I want you back)
Spare me of this cause
Gimme back what I lost
Oh baby, I need one more chance, ha
I tell ya that I love you
Baby, ow, baby, baby
I want you back
I want you back
You would not believe your eyes
If ten million fireflies
Lit up the world as I fell asleep
'Cause they'd fill the open air
And leave teardrops everywhere
You'd think me rude, but I would just stand and stare
I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems
'Cause I'd get a thousand hugs
From ten thousand lightning bugs
As they try to teach me how to dance
A foxtrot above my head
A sock hop beneath my bed
A disco ball is just hanging by a thread
I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems
(When I fall asleep)
Leave my door open just a crack
(Please take me away from here)
'Cause I feel like such an insomniac
(Please take me away from here)
Why do I tire of counting sheep?
(Please take me away from here)
When I'm far too tired to fall asleep
To ten million fireflies
I'm weird 'cause I hate goodbyes
I got misty eyes as they said farewell
(They said farewell)
But I'll know where several are
If my dreams get real bizarre
'Cause I saved a few and I keep them in a jar
(A jar)
I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems
(When I fall asleep)
I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems
(When I fall asleep)
I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
Because my dreams are bursting at the seams
Yeah...
Sunday morning rain is falling 
Steal some covers, share some skin 
Clouds are shrouding us in moments unforgettable 
You twist to fit the mold that I am in 
But things just get so crazy, living life gets hard to do 
And I would gladly hit the road, get up, and go if I knew
That someday it would lead me back to you 
That someday it would lead me back to you 
That may be all I need 
In darkness, she is all I see 
Come and rest your bones with me 
Driving slow on Sunday morning 
And I never want to leave 
Fingers trace your every outline, oh yeah
Paint a picture with my hands 
And back and forth we sway like branches in a storm 
Change the weather, still together when it ends 
That may be all I need 
In darkness, she is all I see 
Come and rest your bones with me 
Driving slow on Sunday morning 
And I never want to leave 
Yeah!
Oh yeah, but things just get so crazy, living life gets hard to do
Sunday morning rain is falling, and I'm calling out to you
Singing, someday it'll bring me back to you, yeah
Find a way to bring myself back home to you
You may not know
That may be all I need 
In darkness, she is all I see 
Come and rest your bones with me 
Driving slow on Sunday morning, driving slow
Oh yeah yeah, oh yeah yeah, oh yeah yeah...
I'm a flower in your hair, I'm a flower in your hair
Oh yeah yeah, oh yeah yeah, oh yeah...
Get back here
Get back here, yeah...
As a young girl
Louis Vuitton
With your mother
On a sandy lawn
As a sophomore
With reggaeton
And the linens
You're sitting on
Is your bed made, is your sweater on?
Do you want to fuck like you know I do?
Like you know I do
Ooh
But this feels so unnatural, Peter Gabriel too
But this feels so unnatural, Peter Gabriel
Can you stay up
To see the dawn
In the colors
Of Benetton?
Is your bed made, is your sweater on?
Do you want to like you know I do?
Like you know I do
Ooh
Feels so unnatural, Peter Gabriel too
But this feels so unnatural, Peter Gabriel
Is your bed made, is your sweater on?
Do you want to like you know I do?
Like you know I do
Ooh
Oh yeah, I tell you something
I think you'll understand
When I say that something
I wanna hold your hand
I wanna hold your hand
I wanna hold your hand
Oh, please say to me
You'll let me be your man
And please, say to me
You'll let me hold your hand
You'll let me hold your hand
I wanna hold your hand
And when I touch you, I feel happy inside
It's such a feeling that my love 
I can't hide
I can't hide
I can't hide
Yeah, you got that something
I think you'll understand
When I say that something
I wanna hold your hand
I wanna hold your hand
I wanna hold your hand
And when I touch you, I feel happy inside
It's such a feeling that my love
I can't hide
I can't hide
I can't hide
Yeah, you got that something
I think you'll understand
When I feel that something
I wanna hold your hand
I wanna hold your hand
I wanna hold your hand
I wanna hold your hand
(I wanna talk to you.)
(The last time we talked, Mr. Smith, you reduced me to tears. I promise you it won't happen again.)
Do I attract you?
Do I repulse you with my queasy smile?
Am I too dirty?
Am I too flirty?
Do I like what you like?
I could be wholesome
I could be loathsome
Guess I'm a little bit shy
Why don't you like me?
Why don't you like me without making me try?
I tried to be like Grace Kelly
But all her looks were too sad
So I tried a little Freddie
I've gone identity mad!
I could be brown
I could be blue
I could be violet sky
I could be hurtful
I could be purple
I could be anything you like
Gotta be green
Gotta be mean
Gotta be everything more
Why don't you like me?
Why don't you like me?
Why don't you walk out the door?
(Getting angry doesn't solve anything.)
How can I help you?
How can I help it?
How can I help what you think?
Hello, my baby
Hello, my baby
Putting my life on the brink
Why don't you like me?
Why don't you like me?
Why don't you like yourself?
Should I bend over?
Should I look older just to be put on your shelf?
I tried to be like Grace Kelly
But all her looks were too sad
So I tried a little Freddie
I've gone identity mad!
I could be brown
I could be blue
I could be violet sky
I could be hurtful
I could be purple
I could be anything you like
Gotta be green
Gotta be mean
Gotta be everything more
Why don't you like me?
Why don't you like me?
Walk out the door
Say what you want to satisfy yourself, hey!
But you only want what everybody else says you should want
You want
I could be brown
I could be blue
I could be violet sky
I could be hurtful
I could be purple
I could be anything you like
Gotta be green
Gotta be mean
Gotta be everything more
Why don't you like me?
Why don't you like me?
Walk out the door
I could be brown
I could be blue
I could be violet sky
I could be hurtful
I could be purple
I could be anything you like
Gotta be green
Gotta be mean
Gotta be everything more
Why don't you like me?
Why don't you like me?
Walk out the door
(Humphrey. We're leaving.)
(Ka-ching!)
In Penny Lane there is a barber showing photographs
Of every head he's had the pleasure to know
And all the people that come and go
Stop and say hello
On the corner is a banker with a motorcar
The little children laugh at him behind his back
And the banker never wears a mac
In the pouring rain
Very strange
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit and meanwhile back
In Penny Lane, there is a fireman with an hour glass
And in his pocket is a portrait of the Queen
He likes to keep his fire engine clean
It's a clean machine
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
Four of fish and finger pies in summer
Meanwhile back
Behind the shelter in the middle of the roundabout
A pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray
And though she feels as if she's in a play
She is anyway
In Penny Lane the barber shaves another customer
We see the banker sitting waiting for a trim
And then the fireman rushes in
From the pouring rain
Very strange
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit and meanwhile back
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies
Penny Lane
Hey, hey, hey
Your lipstick stains
On the front lobe of my left-side brains 
I knew I wouldn't forget ya
And so I went and let you blow my mind
Your sweet moonbeam
The smell of you in every single dream I dream
I knew when we collided, you're the one I have decided
Who's one of my kind
Hey, soul sister, ain't that Mr. Mister on the radio, stereo?
The way you move ain't fair, you know
Hey, soul sister, I don't wanna miss a single thing you do
Tonight
Hey, hey, hey
Just in time
I'm so glad you have a one-track mind like me
You gave my life direction
A game show love connection we can't deny 
I'm so obsessed
My heart is bound to beat right out my untrimmed chest
I believe in you; like a virgin, you're Madonna
And I'm always gonna wanna blow your mind
Hey, soul sister, ain't that Mr. Mister on the radio, stereo?
The way you move ain't fair you know
Hey, soul sister, I don't wanna miss a single thing you do
Tonight
The way you can cut a rug
Watching you's the only drug I need
You so gangster; I'm so thug
You're the only one I'm dreaming of, you see
I can be myself now, finally
In fact, there's nothing I can't be
I want the world to see you be with me
Hey, soul sister, ain't that Mr. Mister on the radio, stereo?
The way you move ain't fair you know
Hey, soul sister, I don't wanna miss a single thing you do
Tonight
Hey, soul sister, I don't wanna miss a single thing you do
Tonight
Hey, hey, hey
Tonight
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Tonight
Wouldn't it be nice if we were older
Then we wouldn't have to wait so long
And wouldn't it be nice to live together
In the kind of world where we belong
You know it's gonna make it that much better
When we can say good night and stay together
Wouldn't it be nice if we could wake up
In the morning when the day is new
And after having spent the day together
Hold each other close the whole night through
The happy times together we've been spending
I wish that every kiss was never-ending
Oh, wouldn't it be nice
Maybe if we think and wish and hope and pray it might come true
Baby, then there wouldn't be a single thing we couldn't do
We could be married (We could be married)
And then we'd be happy (And then we'd be happy)
Oh, wouldn't it be nice
You know, it seems the more we talk about it
It only makes it worse to live without it
But let's talk about it
Wouldn't it be nice
Good night, baby
Sleep tight, baby
Good night, baby
Sleep tight, baby
It started with a low light
Next thing I knew they ripped me from my bed
And then they took my blood type
They left a strange impression in my head
You know that I was hoping
That I could leave this star-crossed world behind
But when they cut me open
I guess I changed my mind
And you know I might have just flown
Too far from the floor this time
'Cause they're calling me by my name
And they're zipping white light beams
Disregarding bombs and satellites
And that was the turning point
That was one lonely night
The storm maker says it ain't so bad
The dream maker's gonna make you mad
The spaceman says, "Everybody look down
It's all in your mind"
Well, now I'm back at home and
I'm looking forward to this life I live
You know it's gonna haunt me
Some hesitation to this life I give
You think you might cross over
You're caught between the devil and the deep blue sea
You better look it over
Before you make that leap
And you know I'm fine
But I hear those voices at night
Sometimes they justify my claim
And the public don't dwell on my transmission
'Cause it wasn't televised
But it was a turning point
Oh, what a lonely night
The storm maker says it ain't so bad
The dream maker's gonna make you mad
The spaceman says, "Everybody look down
It's all in your mind"
The storm maker says it ain't so bad
The dream maker's gonna make you mad
The spaceman says, "Everybody look down
It's all in your mind"
My global position systems are vocally addressed
They say the Nile used to run from east to west
They say the Nile used to run from east to west
I'm fine
But I hear those voices at night sometimes
The storm maker says it ain't so bad
The dream maker's gonna make you mad
The spaceman says, "Everybody look down
It's all in your mind"
The storm maker says it ain't so bad
The dream maker's gonna make you mad
The spaceman says, "Everybody look down
It's all in your mind"
It's all in my mind
It's all in my mind
Early in the morning, risin' to the street
Light me up that cigarette, and I'll strap shoes on my feet (Dee dee dee dee dee)
Got to find the reason, reason things went wrong
Got to find a reason why my money's all gone
I got a dalmatian, and I can still get high
I can play the guitar like a motherfucking riot, uh!
(Loo da-doo da-doo doo)
(A-loo da-doo doo doo doo doo da-doo doo)
Well, life is (too short), so love the one you got
'Cause you might get run over or you might get shot
Never start no static I just get it off my chest
Never had to battle with no bulletproof vest
Take a small example, take a ti-di-ti-tip from me
Take all of your money give it all to charity
Love is what I got , it's within my reach
And the Sublime style's still straight from Long Beach
It all comes back to you, you're bound to get what you deserve
Try and test that, you're bound to get served
Love's what I got, don't start a riot
You'll feel it when the dance gets hot
'Cause lovin' is what I got, I said remember that
Lovin' is what I got, and remember that
Lovin' is what I got, I said remember that
Lovin' is what I got, I got, I got, I got
Why I don't cry when my dog runs away
I don't get angry at the bills I have to pay
I don't get angry when my mom smokes pot
Hits the bottle and goes right to the rock
Fuckin' and fightin', it's all the same
Livin' with Louie Dog's the only way to stay sane
Let the lovin', let the lovin' come back to me
'Cause lovin' is what I got, I said remember that
Lovin' is what I got, and remember that
Lovin' is what I got, I said remember that
Lovin' is what I got, I got, I got, I got
Yeah, okay, cool, so we're not that far off. So that's...see, but...yeah, we're done there
Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me
I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed
She was looking kinda dumb
With her finger and her thumb
In the shape of an L on her forehead
Well, the years start comin', and they don't stop comin'
Fed to the rules, and I hit the ground runnin'
Didn't make sense not to live for fun
Your brain gets smart, but your head gets dumb
So much to do, so much to see
So what's wrong with taking the back streets?
You'll never know if you don't go
You'll never shine if you don't glow
Hey, now, you're an all star
Get your game on, go play
Hey, now, you're a rock star
Get the show on, get paid
And all that glitters is gold
Only shootin' stars break the mold
It's a cool place, and they say it gets colder
You're bundled up now, wait 'til you get older
But the meteor men beg to differ
Judging by the hole in the satellite picture
The ice we skate is gettin' pretty thin
The water's gettin' warm, so you might as well swim
My world's on fire, how 'bout yours?
That's the way I like it and I'll never get bored
Hey, now, you're an all star
Get your game on, go play
Hey, now, you're a rock star
Get the show on, get paid
"All that glitters is gold"
Only shootin' stars break the mold
Go for the moon
Go for the moon
Go for the moon
Go for the moon
Hey, now, you're an all star
Get your game on, go play
Hey, now, you're a rock star
Get the show on, get paid
And all that glitters is gold
Only shootin' stars
Somebody once asked "Could I spare some change for gas?"
"I need to get myself away from this place"
I said "Yep, what a concept"
"I could use a little fuel myself"
"And we could all use a little change"
Well, the years start comin', and they don't stop comin'
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground runnin'
Didn't make sense not to live for fun
Your brain gets smart, but your head gets dumb
So much to do, so much to see
So what's wrong with taking the back streets?
You'll never know if you don't go (Go!)
You'll never shine if you don't glow
Hey, now, you're an all star
Get your game on, go play
Hey, now, you're a rock star
Get the show on, get paid
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold
Helping the kids out of their coats
But wait, the babies haven't been born, oh
Unpacking the bags and setting up
And planting lilacs and buttercups, oh
But in the meantime, I got it hard
Second floor-living without a yard
It may be years until the day
My dreams will match up with my pay
Old dirt road (Mushaboom, mushaboom)
Knee-deep snow (Mushaboom, mushaboom)
Watching the fire as we grow (Mushaboom, mushaboom)
Old
I got a man to stick it out
And make a home from a rented house, oh-on
And we'll collect the moments one by one
I guess that's how the future's done, oh, oh-on
How many acres, how much light
Tucked in the woods and out of sight
Talk to the neighbours and tip my cap
On a little road barely on the map
Old dirt road (Mushaboom, mushaboom)
Knee-deep snow (Mushaboom, mushaboom)
Watching the fire as we grow (Mushaboom, mushaboom)
Old
Old dirt road
Rambling rose (Mushaboom, mushaboom)
Watching the fire as we grow (Mushaboom, mushaboom)
Well, I'm sold
Oh...
One, two, three, four
Tell me that you love me more
Sleepless long nights
That is what my youth was for
Old teenage hopes are alive at your door
Left you with nothing but they want some more
Oh, oh, oh
You're changing your heart
Oh, oh, oh
You know who you are
Sweetheart, bitterheart now I can't tell you apart
Cozy and cold, put the horse before the cart
Those teenage hopes who have tears in their eyes
Too scared to own up to one little lie
Oh, oh, oh
You're changing your heart
Oh, oh, oh
You know who you are
One, two, three, four, five, six, nine, or ten
Money can't buy you back the love that you had then
One, two, three, four, five, six, nine, or ten
Money can't buy you back the love that you had then
Oh, oh, oh
You're changing your heart
Oh, oh, oh
You know who you are
Oh, oh, oh
You're changing your heart
Oh, oh, oh
You know who you are
Who you are, are, are, are
For, for the teenage boys
They're breaking your heart
For the teenage boys
They're breaking your heart
Kiss me, out of the bearded barley
Nightly, beside the green, green grass
Swing, swing, swing the spinning step
You wear those shoes and I will wear that dress
Oh, kiss me beneath the milky twilight
Lead me out on the moonlit floor
Lift your open hand
Strike up the band and make the fireflies dance
Silver moon's sparkling, so kiss me
Kiss me down by the broken treehouse
Swing me upon its hanging tire
Bring, bring, bring your flowered hat
We'll take the trail marked on your father's map
Oh, kiss me beneath the milky twilight
Lead me out on the moonlit floor
Lift your open hand
Strike up the band and make the fireflies dance
Silver moon's sparkling, so kiss me
Kiss me beneath the milky twilight
Lead me out on the moonlit floor
Lift your open hair
Strike up the band and make the fireflies dance
Silver moon's sparkling, so kiss me
So kiss me
So kiss me
So kiss me
So kiss me
You say yes, I say no
You say stop and I say go, go, go

You say goodbye and I say hello
Hello, hello

Hey-la, hey-ba-hello-ah (cha cha)
Hey-la, hey-ba-hello-ah (cha cha)
Hey-la, hey-ba-hello-ah
What would you think if I sang out of tune?
Would you stand up and walk out on me?
Lend me your ears and I'll sing you a song
And I'll try not to sing out of key
Oh I get by with a little help from my friends
Mm I get high with a little help from my friends
Mm gonna try with a little help from my friends
What do I do when my love is away?
Does it worry you to be alone?
How do I feel by the end of the day?
Are you sad because you're on your own?
No I get by with a little help from my friends
Mm get high with a little help from my friends
Mm gonna try with a little help from my friends
Do you need anybody?
I need somebody to love
Could it be anybody?
I want somebody to love
Would you believe in a love at first sight?
Yes I'm certain that it happens all the time
What do you see when you turn out the light?
I can't tell you but I know it's mine
Oh I get by with a little help from my friends
Mm get high with a little help from my friends
Oh I'm gonna try with a little help from my friends
Do you need anybody?
I just need someone to love
Could it be anybody?
I want somebody to love
Oh I get by with a little help from my friends
Mm gonna try with a little help from my friends
Oh I get high with a little help from my friends
Yes I get by with a little help from my friends
With a little help from my friends
Ooh, hoo hoo hoo
Hoo hoo hoo
All I can say is that my life is pretty plain
I like watchin' the puddles gather rain
And all I can do is just pour some tea for two
And speak my point of view, but it's not sane
It's not sane
I just want someone to say to me, no oh oh oh
I'll always be there when you wake, and a-yeah-hea
You know I'd like to keep my cheeks dry today
So stay with me and I'll have it made
And I don't understand why I sleep all day
And I start to complain that there's no rain
And all I can do is read a book to stay awake
And it rips my life away, but it's a great escape
Escape, escape, escape
Oh yeah
Ooh, hoo hoo
Whoa
All I can say is that my life is pretty plain
You don't like my point of view, you think that I'm insane
It's not sane, it's not sane
I just want someone to say to me, no oh oh oh
I'll always be there when you wake, and a-yeah-hea
You know I'd like to keep my cheeks dry today
So stay with me and I'll have it made
Lord, and I'll have it made
Ooh, and I'll have it made
Oh-ho
Lord, I'm gonna
You know I'm really gonna, really gonna have it made, yeah-hea
You know I'll have it made
Oh-oh-oh-oh (I'll have it made)
Oh-oh-oh-oh (I'll have it made)
Oh-oh-oh-oh (I'll have it made)
Oh-oh-oh-oh (I'll have it made)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
"Time to put the earphones on!"
"No!"
Born to multiply
Born to gaze into night skies
All you want's one more Saturday
But look here until then
They're gonna buy your life's time
So keep your wick in the air and your feet in the fetters
'Til the day
They come in doing cartwheels
We all crawl out by ourselves
And your shape on the dance floor
Will have me thinking such filth I'll gouge my eyes
You'd be damned to be one of us, girl
Faced with the dodo's conundrum
I felt like I could just fly
But nothing happened every time I tried
A duotone on the wall
Selfless fool who hoped he'd save us all
Never dreamt of such sterile hands
You keep them folded in your lap
And raise them up to beg for scraps
You know he's holding you down with the tips of his fingers
Just the same
Will you be pulled from the ocean
But just a minute too late?
Or changed by a potion
And find a handsome young mate for you to love?
You'll be damned to pining through the windowpanes
You know you'd trade your life for any ordinary Joe
Well do it now or grow old
Your nightmares only need a year or two to unfold
Been alone since you were twenty-one
You haven't laughed since January
You try and make like this is so much fun
But we know it to be quite contrary
Dare to be one of us, girl
Facing the android's conundrum
I felt like I should just cry
But nothing happens every time I take one on the chin
You're Himmler in your coat
You don't know how long I have been
Watching the lantern dim
Starved of oxygen
So give me your hand and let's jump out the window
Will you count me in?
I've been awake for a while now
You got me feelin' like a child now
'Cause every time I see your bubbly face
I get the tinglies in a silly place
It starts in my toes
And I crinkle my nose
Wherever it goes, I always know
That you make me smile
Please stay for a while now
Just take your time, wherever you go
The rain is fallin' on my window pane
But we are hidin' in a safer place
Under cover stayin' dry and warm
You give me feelings that I adore
They start in my toes
Make me crinkle my nose
Wherever it goes, I always know
That you make me smile
Please stay for a while now
Just take your time, wherever you go
But what am I gonna say,
When you make me feel this way?
I just... mmmmm...
And it starts in my toes
Makes me crinkle my nose
Wherever it goes, I always know
That you make me smile
Please stay for a while now
Just take your time, wherever you go
I've been asleep for a while now
You tuck me in just like a child now
'Cause every time you hold me in your arms
I'm comfortable enough to feel your warmth
It starts in my soul
And I lose all control
When you kiss my nose, the feelin' shows
'Cause you make me smile
Baby, just take your time now
Holdin' me tight
Wherever, wherever, wherever you go
Wherever, wherever, wherever you go
Oh, wherever you go
I always know
'Cause you make me smile
Even just for a while
Rise above, gonna start the war
Oh, whatcha want, whatcha need, whatcha come here for?
Well, an eye for an eye, and an 'F' for fight
They're takin' me down as the prisoners riot
Eh, yeah
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
I've got shackles on, my words are tied
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Fear can make you compromise
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
With the lights turned up, it's hard to hide
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Sometimes I want to disappear
Eh, eh, eh
When I feel kinda bad and don't want to stress
I just pass it off on ability
Well, you got whatcha want and whatcha never knew
Perfect gift from me to you
Yeah, yeah, yeah
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
I've got shackles on, my words are tied
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Fear can make you compromise
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
With the lights turned up, it's hard to hide
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Sometimes I want to disappear
(Raise up to your ability)
You never knew what I could find
What could come when we realize
I don't want to c-compromise
(Raise up to your ability)
Can't stand when I disappear
Running around before it corners you
Like he's someone who's lost his way
(Raise up to your ability)
I know that you want to
Throw me into the sea for my ability
(Raise up to your ability)
Yeah, you're undecided
Hey, it's the right feeling
Yeah, I don't wanna run away
You gotta focus on to your ability
Focus on to your ability
You gotta focus on to your ability
Focus on to your ability
Then they can't a-get a-what they want to steal
Can't a-get a-what they want to steal
Then they can't a-get a-what they want to steal
Can't a-get a-what they want to steal
I feel it all, I feel it all
I feel it all, I feel it all
The wings are wide, the wings are wide
Wild card in sight, wild card in sight
Ooh, I'll be the one who'll break my heart
I'll be the one to hold the gun
I know more than I knew before
I know more than I knew before
I didn't rest, I didn't stop
Did we fight, or did we talk
Ooh, I'll be the one who'll break my heart
I'll be the one to hold the gun
I love you more
I love you more
I don't know what I knew before
But now I know I want to win the war
No one likes to take a test
Sometimes we don't pull or flex
Put your weight against the door
Kick-drum on the basement floor
Stranded in the fog of words
Looking like the winter bird
On my head the water pours
Gulf stream through the open door
Fly away
Fly away to what you want to make
Ho-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I feel it all, I feel it all, ha
I feel it all, I feel it all, ha
The wings are wide, the wings are wide
Wild card in sight, wild card in sight
Ooh, I'll be the one who'll break my heart
I'll be the one who'll break my heart
I'll be the one who'll break my heart
I'll end it, don't you start it
The truth lies (we could be together)
The truth lied (and now I wonder)
If lies divide (to the end, we've got to make it)
Lies divide
Ho-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh
Three little birds, sat on my window
And they told me I don't need to worry
Summer came like cinnamon
So sweet,
Little girls double-dutch on the concrete
Maybe sometimes, we got it wrong, but it's all right
The more things seems to change, the more they stay the same.
Oh, don't you hesitate
Girl, put your records on, tell me your favourite song
You go ahead, let your hair down
Sapphire and faded jeans, I hope you get your dreams,
Just go ahead, let your hair down
You're gonna find yourself somewhere, somehow
Blue as the sky, sunburnt and lonely,
Sipping tea in the bar by the road side,
(Just relax, just relax)
Don't you let those other boys fool you,
Gotta love that afro hairdo
Maybe sometimes, we feel afraid, but it's all right
The more you stay the same, the more they seem to change
Don't you think it's strange?
Girl, put your records on, tell me your favourite song
You go ahead, let your hair down
Sapphire and faded jeans, I hope you get your dreams,
Just go ahead, let your hair down
You're gonna find yourself somewhere, somehow
Just more than I could take, pity for pity's sake
Some nights kept me awake, I thought that I was stronger
When you gonna realise, that you don't even have to try any longer
Do what you want to
Girl, put your records on, tell me your favourite song
You go ahead, let your hair down
Sapphire and faded jeans, I hope you get your dreams,
Just go ahead, let your hair down
Girl, put your records on, tell me your favourite song
You go ahead, let your hair down
Sapphire and faded jeans, I hope you get your dreams,
Just go ahead, let your hair down
Oh, You're gonna find yourself somewhere, somehow
I'd like to be under the sea
In an octopus's garden in the shade
He'd let us in, knows where we've been
In his octopus's garden in the shade
I'd ask my friends to come and see
An octopus's garden with me
I'd like to be under the sea
In an octopus's garden in the shade
We would be warm
Below the storm 
In our little hideaway beneath the waves
Resting our head
On the sea bed
In an octopus's garden near a cave
We would sing and dance around
Because we know we can't be found
I'd like to be under the sea
In an octopus's garden in the shade
We would shout and swim about
The coral that lies beneath the waves
(lies beneath the ocean waves)
Oh, what joy for every girl and boy
Knowing they're happy and they're safe
(happy and they're safe)
We would be so happy, you and me
No one there to tell us what to do
I'd like to be under the sea
In an octopus's garden with you
In an octopus's garden with you
In an octopus's garden with you
When I came down the dawn poured into me
I shook 'em up, the walls came crumbling
My thin skin trembling with these salty wounds
My stolen gold inside the emperors tomb
Now painting rainbows on my ugly face
I built this cardboard neighborhoods disgrace
But I ascend and serve my feverish need
Within the confines of such chemistry
It's the way I see
Everything I need
Its no way to be
Let this be our little secret
No one needs to know we're feeling
Higher and higher and higher
Higher and higher and higher
But I feel alive and I feel it in me
Up and up we keep on climbing
Higher and higher and higher
Higher and higher and higher
My face blew up at such a casual sight
The spattered colors of ecstatic fright
The rush above me to oblivion
Outlining wet sidewalks in halogen
Oh have you ever felt so goddamned strong
How come it takes some people so damn long
He turned to squeeze the lemon juice to rain
The citrus drawing out the scene in stains
Watch the basin drain
As your lifelines wanes
And you can't explain
As your friends complain
You've caused all this pain
And you proudly shame
Your poor family's name
Let this be our little secret
No one needs to know we're feeling
Higher and higher and higher
Higher and higher and higher
But I feel alive and I feel it in me
Up and up we keep on climbing
Higher and higher and higher
Higher and higher and higher
Mother I can tell what you've been thinking
Staring at the stars on your ceiling
Thinking once there was a power that you were wielding
And now I've hit the mark
Staring at the dark
And I cannot help but ignore the people staring at my scars
Let this be our little secret
No one needs to know we're feeling
Higher and higher and higher
Higher and higher and higher
But I feel alive and I feel it in me
Up and up we keep on climbing
Higher and higher and higher
Higher and higher and higher
If you love somebody
Better tell them while they're here 'cause
They just may run away from you
You'll never know what went well
Then again it just depends on
How long of time is left for you
I've had the highest mountains
I've had the deepest rivers
You can have it all but not keep moving
Now take it in but don't look down
'Cause I'm on top of the world, 'ay
I'm on top of the world, 'ay
Waiting on this for a while now
Paying my dues to the dirt
I've been waiting to smile, 'ay
Been holding it in for a while, 'ay
Take you with me if I can
Been dreaming of this since a child
I'm on top of the world
I've tried to cut these corners
Try to take the easy way out
I kept on falling short of something
I coulda gave up then but
Then again I couldn't have 'cause
I've traveled all this way for something
I take it in but don't look down
'Cause I'm on top of the world, 'ay
I'm on top of the world, 'ay
Waiting on this for a while now
Paying my dues to the dirt
I've been waiting to smile, 'ay
Been holding it in for a while, 'ay
Take you with me if I can
Been dreaming of this since a child
I'm on top of the world
'Cause I'm on top of the world, 'ay
I'm on top of the world, 'ay
Waiting on this for a while now
Paying my dues to the dirt
I've been waiting to smile, 'ay
Been holding it in for a while, 'ay
Take you with me if I can
Been dreaming of this since a child
And I know it's hard when you're falling down
And it's a long way up when you hit the ground
Get up now, get up, get up now
And I know it's hard when you're falling down
And it's a long way up when you hit the ground
Get up now, get up, get up now
'Cause I'm on top of the world, 'ay
I'm on top of the world, 'ay
Waiting on this for a while now
Paying my dues to the dirt
I've been waiting to smile, 'ay
Been holding it in for a while, 'ay
Take you with me if I can (get up now, get up)
Been dreaming of this since a child
I'm on top of the world
It might seem crazy what I'm 'bout to say
Sunshine she's here, you can take a break
I'm a hot air balloon that could go to space
With the air, like I don't care baby by the way
Huh

It could be ten but then again
I can't remember half an hour since a quarter to four
Throw all on your clothes, the second side of Surfer Rosa
And you leave me with my jaw on the floor, hey
Oh, just when you think that you're in control
Just when you think that you've got a hold
Just when you get on a roll
Oh, here it goes
Here it goes
Here it goes again
Oh, here it goes again
I should have known
Should have known
Should have known again
But here it goes again
Oh oh, here it goes again
Starts out easy, something simple, something sleazy
Something inching past the edge of reserve
Now through the lines of the cheap Venetian blinds
Your car is pulling off of the curb, hey
Oh, just when you think that you're in control
Just when you think that you've got a hold
Just when you get on a roll
Oh, here it goes
Here it goes
Here it goes again
Oh, here it goes again
I should have known
Should have known
Should have known again
But here it goes again
Oh, here it goes
Oh, here it goes
Oh, here it goes again
Oh oh, here it goes again
Oh, oh
Oh, here it goes
Yeah, oh, here it goes again
Hey, hey
Oh, here it goes
Alright
I guess there's got to be a break in the monotony
But Jesus, when it rains, how it pours
Throw on your clothes, the second side of Surfer Rosa
And you leave me
Yeah, you leave me
Ah, oh, here it goes
Here it goes
Here it goes again
Oh, here it goes again
I should have known
Should have known
Should have known again
But here it goes again
Oh, here it goes
Oh, here it goes
Oh, here it goes again
I should have known

But here it goes again
Oh, here it
Oh, here it
Oh, here it

Oh, oh yeah

Oh, here it goes it again
Oh oh, here it goes it again
Well, her face is a map of the world
Is a map of the world
You can see she's a beautiful girl
She's a beautiful girl
And everything around her is a silver pool of light
People who surround her feel the benefit of it
It makes you calm
She holds you captivated in her palm
Suddenly I see (suddenly I see)
This is what I want to be
Suddenly I see (suddenly I see)
Why the hell it means so much to me

Like walking the world
And you can hear she's a beautiful girl

Makes you feel warmer when you're trying to remember
What you heard
She likes to leave you hanging on a word

This is what I want to be
Suddenly I see (suddenly I see)
Why the hell it means so much to me

And she's taller than most
And she's looking at me

She makes me feel like I could be a tower
Big strong tower, yeah
The power to be
The power to give

Morning! Today's forecast calls for blue skies.
Sun is shinin' in the sky,
There ain't a cloud in sight
It's stopped rainin'
Everybody's in a play
And don't you know
It's a beautiful new day
Runnin' down the avenue
See how the sun shines brightly
In the city on the streets
Where once was pity
Mister Blue Sky is living here today
Mister Blue Sky, please tell us why
You had to hide away for so long (So long)
Where did we go wrong?
Mister Blue Sky, please tell us why
You had to hide away for so long (So long)
Where did we go wrong?
Hey you with the pretty face
Welcome to the human race
A celebration 
Mister Blue Sky's up there waitin' and today
Is the day we've waited for, ah
Oh, Mister Blue Sky, please tell us why
You had to hide away for so long (So long)
Where did we go wrong?
Hey there, Mister Blue
We're so pleased to be with you
Look around, see what you do
Everybody smiles at you
Hey there, Mister Blue
We're so pleased to be with you
Look around, see what you do
Everybody smiles at you
Mister Blue Sky

Mister Blue, you did it right
But soon comes Mister Night
Creepin' over
Now his hand is on your shoulder
Never mind I'll remember you this
I'll remember you this way
Mister Blue Sky, please tell us why
You had to hide away for so long (So long)
Where did we go wrong?
Hey there, Mister Blue (Sky)
We're so pleased to be with you (Sky)
Look around see what you do (Blue)
Everybody smiles at you
Please turn me over
A man walks down the street
He says, Why am I soft in the middle now?
Why am I soft in the middle?
When the rest of my life is so hard!
I need a photo-opportunity
I want a shot at redemption
Don't want to end up a cartoon
In a cartoon graveyard
Bone-digger, bone-digger
Dogs in the moonlight
Far away, my well-lit door
Mr. Beer Belly, Beer Belly
Get these mutts away from me!
You know, I don't find this stuff amusing anymore
If you'll be my bodyguard
I can be your long lost pal
I can call you Betty
And Betty, when you call me
You can call me Al
A man walks down the street
He says, Why am I short of attention?
Got a short little span of attention
And whoa, my nights are so long!
Where's my wife and family?
What if I die here?
Who'll be my role-model?
Now that my role-model is
Gone, gone
He ducked back down the alley
With some roly-poly, little bat-faced girl
All along, along
There were incidents and accidents
There were hints and allegations
If you'll be my bodyguard
I can be your long lost pal
I can call you Betty
And Betty, when you call me
You can call me Al
Call me Al
A man walks down the street
It's a street in a strange world
Maybe it's the Third World
Maybe it's his first time around
He doesn't speak the language
He holds no currency
He is a foreign man
He is surrounded by the sound, sound
Cattle in the marketplace
Scatterlings and orphanages
He looks around, around
He sees angels in the architecture
Spinning into infinity
He says, Amen! and Hallelujah!
If you'll be my bodyguard
I can be your long lost pal
I can call you Betty
And Betty, when you call me
You can call me Al
Call me
Na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, n-n-n-n-na
Na, na, na, na
N-n-n-n-na, na
Na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na
If you'll be my bodyguard (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
I can call you Betty (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
If you'll be my bodyguard (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
I can call you Betty (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
If you'll be my bodyguard
Desmond has a barrow at the marketplace
Molly is the singer in a band
Desmond says to Molly, "Girl, I like your face"
And Molly says this as she takes him by the hand
Ob-la-di, ob-la-da
Life goes on, bra
La-la, how the life goes on
Ob-la-di, ob-la-da
Life goes on, bra
La-la, how the life goes on
Desmond takes a trolley to the jeweler's store
Buys a twenty carat golden ring (rin-ring)
Takes it back to Molly waiting at the door
And as he gives it to her she begins to sing (sing)
Ob-la-di, ob-la-da (la-la-la-la la-la-)
Life goes on, bra (la-la la-la-la-laaa)
La-la, how the life goes on
Ob-la-di, ob-la-da (la-la-la-la la-la-)
Life goes on, bra (la-la la-la-la-laaa)
La-la, how the life goes on
Yeah
In a couple of years
They have built a home sweet home
With a couple of kids running in the yard
Of Desmond and Molly Jones (ha ha ha ha)
Happy ever after in the market place
Desmond lets the children lend a hand (arm!) (leg!)
Molly stays at home and does her pretty face
And in the evening she still sings it with the band
Yes!
Ob-la-di, ob-la-da
Life goes on, bra
La-la, how the life goes on
Hey!
Ob-la-di, ob-la-da
Life goes on, bra
La-la, how the life goes on
In a couple of years
They have built a home sweet home (home: H-O-M-E)
With a couple of kids running in the yard
Of Desmond and Molly Jones (ha ha ha ha ha ha ha)
Hey!
Happy ever after in the market place
Molly lets the children lend a hand (foot!)
Desmond stays at home and does his pretty face
And in the evening she's a singer with the band
Yeah!
Ob-la-di, ob-la-da
Life goes on, bra
La-la, how the life goes on
Hey!
Ob-la-di, ob-la-da
Life goes on, bra
La-la, how the life goes on (ha ha ha ha)
And if you want some fun (ha ha ha ha ha ha ha)
Take Ob-la-di-bla-da (ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha)
(ha ha ha ha)
Ahh...
Thank you (ha ha)
I'll be the grapes fermented, bottled and served with the table set
In my finest suit, like a perfect gentleman
I'll be the fire escape that's bolted to the ancient brick
Where you will sit and contemplate your day
I'll be the waterwings that save you if you start drowning in
An open tab when your judgment's on the brink.
I'll be the phonograph that plays your favorite
Albums back as you're lying there
Drifting off to sleep (drifting off to sleep)
I'll be the platform shoes, undo what heredity's done to you
You won't have to strain to look into my eyes
I'll be your winter coat, buttoned and zipped straight to the throat
With the collar up so you won't catch a cold
I want to take you far from the cynics in this town
And kiss you on the mouth
We'll cut our bodies free from the tethers of this scene
Start a brand new colony
Where everything will change, we'll give ourselves new names
Identities erased
The sun will heat the grounds under our bare feet
In this brand new colony (in this brand new colony)
Everything will change, ooh
Everything will change, ooh
Everything will change, ooh
Lady Madonna
Children at your feet
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet?
Who finds the money
When you pay the rent
Did you think that money was heaven sent?
Friday night arrives without a suitcase
Sunday morning creeping like a nun
Monday's child has learned to tie his bootlace
See how they run
Lady Madonna
Baby at your breast
Wonders how you manage to feed the rest
See how they run
Lady Madonna
Lying on the bed
Listen to the music playing in your head
Tuesday afternoon is never ending
Wednesday morning papers didn't come
Thursday night your stockings needed mending
See how they run
Lady Madonna
Children at your feet
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet
Riding through the city on my bike all day
Cause the filth took away my license
It doesn't get me down and I feel O.K.
Cause the sights that I'm seeing are priceless
Everything seems to look as it should
But I wonder what goes on behind doors
A fella looking dapper, but he's sitting with a slapper
Then I see it's a pimp and his crack whore
You might laugh, you might frown
Walking 'round London town
Sun is in the sky, oh why, oh why
Would I wanna be anywhere else?
Sun is in the sky, oh why, oh why
Would I wanna be anywhere else?
When you look with your eyes
Everything seems nice
But if you look twice
You can see it's all lies
There was a little old lady who was walking down the road
She was struggling with bags from Tesco
There were people from the city having lunch in the park
I believe that it's called al fresco
When a kid came along to offer a hand
But before she had time to accept it
Hits her over the head, doesn't care if she's dead
'Cause he's got all her jewelery and wallet
You might laugh, you might frown
Walking 'round London town
Sun is in the sky, oh why, oh why
Would I wanna be anywhere else?
Sun is in the sky, oh why, oh why
Would I wanna be anywhere else?
When you look with your eyes
Everything seems nice
But if you look twice
You can see it's all lies
Life, yeah that's city life, yeah that's city life, yeah that's city life
Life, yeah that's city life, yeah that's city life, yeah that's city life
Sun is in the sky, oh why, oh why
Would I wanna be anywhere else?
Sun is in the sky, oh why, oh why
Would I wanna be anywhere else?
Sun is in the sky, oh why, oh why
Would I wanna be anywhere else?
Sun is in the sky, oh why, oh why
Would I wanna be anywhere else?
When you look with your eyes
Everything seems nice
But if you look twice
You can see it's all lies
When you look with your eyes
Everything seems nice
But if you look twice
You can see it's all lies
Cherry-cherry boom-boom
Boy, we've had a real good time and
I wish you the best on your way, eh
I didn't mean to hurt you
I never thought we'd fall out of place, eh, hey
I have something that I love long-long

Cherry-cherry boom-boom
Eh, eh, oh yeah
All I can say is eh, eh
I fell in love again
All things go, all things go
Drove to Chicago
All things know, all things know
We sold our clothes to the state
I don't mind, I don't mind
I made a lot of mistakes
In my mind, in my mind
You came to take us
All things go, all things go
To recreate us
All things grow, all things grow
We had our mindset
All things know, all things know
You had to find it
All things go, all things go
I drove to New York
In a van with my friend
We slept in parking lots
I don't mind, I don't mind
I was in love with the place
In my mind, in my mind
I made a lot of mistakes
In my mind, in my mind
You came to take us
All things go, all things go
To recreate us
All things grow, all things grow
We had our mindset
All things know, all things know
You had to find it
All things go, all things go
If I was crying
In the van with my friend
It was for freedom
From myself and from the land
I made a lot of mistakes
I made a lot of mistakes
I made a lot of mistakes
I made a lot of mistakes
You came to take us
All things go, all things go
To recreate us
All things grow, all things grow

You came to take us
All things go, all things go
To recreate us

We had our mindset (I made a lot of mistakes)
All things know, all things know (I made a lot of mistakes)
You had to find it (I made a lot of mistakes)
All things go, all things go (I made a lot of mistakes)
Celia, you're breaking my heart
You're shaking my confidence daily
Oh, Cecilia, I'm down on my knees
I'm begging you please to come home
Celia, you're breaking my heart
You're shaking my confidence daily
Oh, Cecilia, I'm down on my knees
I'm begging you please to come home
Come on home
Making love in the afternoon
With Cecilia
Up in my bedroom
(Making love in my bed)
I got up to wash my face
When I come back to bed
Someone's taken my place
Celia, you're breaking my heart
You're shaking my confidence daily
Oh, Cecilia, I'm down on my knees
I'm begging you please to come home
Come on home

Jubilation
She loves me again
I fall on the floor and I laughing
Jubilation
She loves me again
I fall on the floor and I laughing
I am unwritten
Can't read my mind
I'm undefined
I'm just beginning
The pen's in my hand
Ending unplanned
Staring at the blank page before you
Open up the dirty window
Let the sun illuminate the words
That you could not find
Reaching for something in the distance
So close you can almost taste it
Release your inhibitions
Feel the rain on your skin
No one else can feel it for you
Only you can let it in
No one else, no one else
Can speak the words on your lips
Drench yourself in words unspoken
Live your life with arms wide open
Today is, where your book begins
The rest is still unwritten
Yeah
Oh, oh
I break tradition
Sometimes my tries 
Are outside the lines
We've been conditioned 
To not make mistakes
But I can't live that way, oh
Staring at the blank page before you
Open up the dirty window
Let the sun illuminate the words
That you could not find
Reaching for something in the distance
So close you can almost taste it
Release your inhibitions
Feel the rain on your skin
No one else can feel it for you
Only you can let it in
No one else, no one else
Can speak the words on your lips
Drench yourself in words unspoken
Live your life with arms wide open
Today is where your book begins
Feel the rain on your skin
No one else can feel it for you
Only you can let it in
No one else, no one else
Can speak the words on your lips
Drench yourself in words unspoken
Live your life with arms wide open
Today is where your book begins
The rest is still unwritten
Oh, oh
Staring at the blank page before you
Open up the dirty window
Let the sun illuminate the words
That you could not find
Reaching for something in the distance
So close you can almost taste it
Release your inhibitions
Feel the rain on your skin
No one else can feel it for you
Only you can let it in
No one else, no one else
Can speak the words on your lips
Drench yourself in words unspoken
Live your life with arms wide open
Today is where your book begins
Feel the rain on your skin
No one else can feel it for you
Only you can let it in
No one else, no one else
Can speak the words on your lips
Drench yourself in words unspoken
Live your life with arms wide open
Today is where your book begins
The rest is still unwritten
The rest is still unwritten
The rest is still unwritten
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Do you remember when we first met? I sure do
It was some time in early September
You were lazy about it, you made me wait around
I was so crazy about you, I didn't mind
So I was late for class, I locked my bike to yours
It wasn't hard to find, you painted flowers on
I guess that I was afraid that if you rolled away
You might not roll back my direction real soon
But I was crazy about you then and now
The craziest thing of all, over ten years have gone by
And you're still mine, we're locked in time
Let's rewind
Do you remember when we first moved in together?
The piano took up the living room
You played me boogie-woogie I played you love songs
You'd say we're playing house now you still say we are
We built our getaway up in a tree we found
We felt so far away but we were still in town
Now I remember watching that old tree burn down
I took a picture that I don't like to look at
Well all those times they come and go
And alone don't seem so long
Over ten years have gone by
We can't rewind, we're locked in time
But you're still mine
Do you remember?
Joan was quizzical, 
Studied pataphysical science in the home 
Late nights all alone with a test tube 
Oh, oh-oh, oh
Maxwell Edison, majoring in medicine 
Calls her on the phone 
"Can I take you out to the pictures, Jo-oh-oh-oan?"
But as she's getting ready to go 
A knock comes on the door 
Bang, bang, Maxwell's silver hammer
Came down upon her head 
Clang, clang, Maxwell's silver hammer
Made sure she was dead 
Back in school again
Maxwell plays the fool again
Teacher gets annoyed 
Wishing to avoid an unpleasant sce-e-e-ene 
She tells Max to stay when the class has gone away 
So he waits behind 
Writing fifty times "I must not be so, oh-oh, oh"
But when she turns her back on the boy 
He creeps up from behind 
Bang, bang, Maxwell's silver hammer
Came down upon her head (do-do do-doo-doo)
Clang, clang, Maxwell's silver hammer
Made sure that she was dead 
(Do-do do-doo-doo)
P.C. 31 said "We've caught a dirty one"
Maxwell stands alone 
Painting testimonial pictures, oh, oh-oh, oh
Rose and Valerie, screaming from the gallery
Say he must go free ("Maxwell must go free")
The judge does not agree, and he tells them so, oh-oh, oh
But as the words are leaving his lips
A noise comes from behind 
Bang, bang, Maxwell's silver hammer
Came down upon his head (do-do do-doo-doo)
Clang, clang, Maxwell's silver hammer
Made sure that he was dead 
Whoa, whoa, whoa-oh
(Do-do do-doo-doo)
Silver hammer man
Oh well, in five years time we could be walking 'round a zoo
With the sun shining down over me and you
And there'll be love in the bodies of the elephants too
And I'll put my hands over your eyes, but you'll peep through
And there'll be sun sun sun all over our bodies
And sun sun sun all down our necks
And there'll be sun sun sun all over our faces
And sun sun sun -so what the heck
'Cause I'll be laughing at all your silly little jokes
And we'll be laughing about how we used to smoke
All those stupid little cigarettes and drink stupid wine
'Cause it's what we needed to have a good time
But it was fun fun fun when we were drinking
It was fun fun fun when we were drunk
And it was fun fun fun when we were laughing
It was fun fun fun, oh it was fun
Oh well, I look at you and say
It's the happiest that I've ever been
And I'll say I no longer feel I have to be James Dean
And she'll say, "Yeah, well I feel all pretty happy too."
And I'm always pretty happy when I'm just kicking back with you
And it'll be love love love all through our bodies
And love love love all through our minds
And it be Love love love all over her face
And love love love all over mine
Although maybe all these moments are just in my head
I'll be thinking 'bout them as I'm lying in bed
And although not really, it might not even come true
But in my mind I'm havin' a pretty good time with you
In five years time, I might not know you
In five years time, we might not speak at all
In five years time, we might not get along
In five years time, you might just prove me wrong
Oh, there'll be love love love wherever you go
There'll be love love love wherever you go
There'll be love love love wherever you go
There'll be love love love wherever you go
There'll be love love love wherever you go
There'll be love love love wherever you go
There'll be love love love wherever you go
There'll be love love love wherever you go
There'll be love

I'm back in Liverpool
And everythin' seems the same
But I worked somethin' out last night
That changed this little boy's brain
A small piece of advice
That took 22 years in the make
And I will break it for you now
Please learn from my mistakes
Please learn from my mistakes
Let's dance to Joy Division
And celebrate the irony
Everythin' is goin' wrong
But we're so happy
Let's dance to Joy Division
And raise our glass to the ceiling
'Cause this could all go so wrong
But we're so happy
Yeah, we're so happy
So if you're ever feelin' down
Grab your purse and take a taxi
To the darker side of town
That's where we'll be
And we will wait for you
And lead you through the dance floor
Up to the DJ booth
You know what to ask for
You know what to ask for
Go ask for Joy Division
And celebrate the irony
Everythin' is goin' wrong
But we're so happy
Let's dance to Joy Division
And raise our glass to the ceiling
'Cause this could all go so wrong
But we're so happy
Yeah, we're so happy
Let the love tear us apart
I've found the cure for a broken heart
Let it tear us apart
Let the love tear us apart
I've found the cure for a broken heart
Let it tear us apart
(Let it tear us apart)
So let the love tear us apart
I've found the cure for a broken heart
Let it tear us apart
(Let it tear us apart)
So let the love tear us apart
I've found the cure for a broken heart
Let it tear us apart
Let it tear us apart

And raise our glass to the ceiling
'Cause this could all go so wrong
But we're so happy
Yeah, we're so happy
So happy, yeah, we're so happy
So happy, yeah, we're so happy
We cut the legs off of our pants
Threw our shoes into the oceans
Sit back and wave through the daylight
Sit back and wave through the daylight
Slip and slide on subway grates
These shoes are poor man's ice skates
Fall through like change in the daylight
Fall through like change in the daylight
I miss yellow lines in my roads
Some color on monochrome
Maybe I'll paint them in myself
Maybe I'll paint them in myself
Maybe I'll paint them in myself
Maybe I'll paint them in myself
Maybe I'll paint them in myself
Maybe I'll paint them in myself
These sidewalks liquid then stone
Building walls and an old pay phone
It rings like all through the daylight
It rings like all through the daylight
And in the daylight we can hitchhike to Maine
I hope that someday I'll see without these frames
And in the daylight I don't pick up my phone
'Cause in the daylight anywhere feels like home
I have five clocks in my life
And only one has the time right
I'll just unplug it for today
I'll just unplug it for today
Open hydrant rolled down windows
This car might make a good old boat
And float down Grand Street in daylight
And float down Grand Street in daylight
And float down Grand Street in daylight
And float down Grand Street in daylight
And float down Grand Street in daylight
And float down Grand Street in daylight
And with just half of a sunburn
New yellow lines that I earned
Step back and here comes the night time
Step back and here comes the night time
And in the daylight we can hitchhike to Maine
I hope that someday I'll see without these frames
And in the daylight I don't pick up my phone
'Cause in the daylight anywhere feels like home
And in the daylight we can hitchhike to Maine
I hope that someday I'll see without these frames
And in the daylight I don't pick up my phone
'Cause in the daylight anywhere feels like home
What, what, what, what
One, two
One, two, three
Wake up, kids, we got the dreamers' disease
Age fourteen, they got you down on your knees
So polite, we're busy still saying please
Frenemies, who, when you're down, ain't your friend
Every night we smash a Mercedes-Benz
First we run, and then we laugh till we cry
But when the night is falling
You cannot find the light (Light)
You feel your dreams are dying
Hold tight
You've got the music in you
Don't let go; You've got the music in you
One dance left; This world is gonna pull through
Don't give up; You've got a reason to live
Can't forget; We only get what we give
I'm comin' home, baby
You're the tops
Give it to me now!
Four AM, we ran the Miracle Mile
We're flat broke, but, hey, we do it in style
The bad rich, God's flying in for your trial
But when the night is falling
You cannot find a friend (Friend)
You feel your tree is breaking
Just bend
You've got the music in you
Don't let go; You've got the music in you
One dance left; This world is gonna pull through
Don't give up; You've got a reason to live
Can't forget; We only get what we give
This whole damn world
Can fall apart
You'll be okay
Follow your heart
You're in harm's way
I'm right behind
Now say you're mine
You've got the music in you
Don't let go; You've got the music in you
One dance left; This world is gonna pull through
Don't give up; You've got a reason to live
Can't forget; We only get what we give
Don't let go; I feel the music in you
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Fly...
High...
What's real
Can't die
You only get what you give
You're gonna get what you give
(Don't give up) Just don't be afraid to leave
Health insurance ripoff lying 
FDA big bankers buying
Fake computer crashes dining
Cloning while they're multiplying
Fashion shoots with Beck and Hanson
Courtney Love and Marilyn Manson
You're all fakes, run to your mansions
Come around, we'll kick your ass in
Don't let go
One dance left
Don't give up
Can't forget
Don't let go
It's getting better all the time
I used to get mad at my school (Now I can't complain)
The teachers that taught me weren't cool (No I can't complain)
You're holding me down (Ah), turning me 'round (Oh)
Filling me up with your rules (Fool)
I've got to admit it's getting better (Better)
A little better all the time (It can't get no worse)
I have to admit it's getting better (Better)
It's getting better since you've been mine
Me used to be angry young man
Me hiding me head in the sand
You gave me the word, I finally heard
I'm doing the best that I can
I've got to admit it's getting better (Better)
A little better all the time (It can't get no worse)
I have to admit it's getting better (Better)
It's getting better since you've been mine
Getting so much better all the time
It's getting better all the time
(Better, better, better)
It's getting better all the time
(Better, better, better)
I used to be cruel to my woman
I beat her and kept her apart from the things that she loved
Man I was mean but I'm changing my scene
And I'm doing the best that I can
I admit it's getting better (Better)
A little better all the time (It can't get no worse)
Yes I admit it's getting better (Better)
It's getting better since you've been mine
Getting so much better all the time
It's getting better all the time
(Better, better, better)
It's getting better all the time
(Better, better, better)
Getting so much better all the time
Back to the street where we began
Feeling as good as lovers can, you know
Yeah we're feeling so good
Pickin' up things we shouldn't read
It looks like the end of history as we know
It's just the end of the world
Back to the street where we began
Feeling as good as love, you could, you can
Into a place, where thoughts can bloom
Into a room where it's nine in the afternoon
And we know that it could be
And we know that it should
And you know that you feel it too
'Cause it's nine in the afternoon
Your eyes are the size of the moon
You could 'cause you can so you do
We're feeling so good
Just the way that we do
When it's nine in the afternoon
Your eyes are the size of the moon
You could 'cause you can so you do
We're feeling so good
Back to the street
Down to our feet
Losing the feeling of feeling unique
Do you know what I mean?
Back to the place, hey
Where we used to say
"Man it feels good to feel this way"
Now I know what I mean
Back to the street, back to the place
Back to the room where it all began
Back to the street, back to the place
Back to the room where it all began
'Cause it's nine in the afternoon
Your eyes are the size of the moon
You could 'cause you can so you do
We're feeling so good
Just the way that we do
When it's nine in the afternoon
Your eyes are the size of the moon
You could 'cause you can so you do
We're feeling so good
Just the way that we do
When it's nine in the afternoon
Your eyes are the size of the moon
You could 'cause you can so you do
We're feeling so good
Just the way that we do
When it's nine in the afternoon
We get high in back seat of cars
We break into mobile homes
We go to sleep to Shake Appeal
Never wake up on our own
And that's the way we get by
Way we get by
And that's the way we get by
Way we get by
We go out in stormy weather
We rarely practice discern
We make love to Some Weird Sin
We seek out the taciturn
And that's the way we get by
Way we get by
And that's the way we get by
Way we get by
We found a new kind of dance in a magazine
Tried it out it's like nothing you ever seen
You sweet talk like a cop and you know it
You bought a new bag of pot, said let's make a new start
And that's the way to my heart
The way to my heart
That's the way we get by
Way we get by
We get high in back seats of cars
We put faith in our concerns
Fall in love to Down on the Street
We believe in the sum of ourselves
I said that's the way we get by
We are young
We run green
Keep our teeth nice and clean
See our friends, see the sights
Feel alright
We wake up, we go out
Smoke a fag, put it out
See our friends, see the sights
Feel alright
Are we like you
I can't be sure?
Of the scene as she turns
We are strange in our worlds
But we are young, we get by
Can't go mad, ain't got time
Sleep around if we like
But we're alright
Got some cash
Bought some wheels
Took it out
'Cross the fields
Lost control, hit a wall
But we're alright
Are we like you
I can't be sure?
Of the scene, as she turns
We are strange in our worlds
But we are young
We run green
Keep our teeth nice and clean
See our friends, see the sights
Feel alright
Are we like you
I can't be sure?
Of the scene, as she turns
We are strange in our world
But we are young
We run green
Keep our teeth nice and clean
See our friends, see the sights
Feel alright
Woke up cold one Tuesday
I'm looking tired and feeling quite sick
I felt like there was something missing in my day-today life
So, I quickly opened the wardrobe
Pulled out some jeans and a t-shirt that seemed clean
Topped it off with a pair of old shoes
That were ripped around the seams
And, I thought, These shoes just don't suit me
Hey, I put some new shoes on
And suddenly everything is right
I said, Hey, I put some new shoes on, and everybody's smiling
It's so inviting
Oh, short on money
But, long on time
Slowly strolling in the sweet sunshine
And I'm running late
And I don't need an excuse
'Cause I'm wearing my brand new shoes
Woke up late one Thursday
And, I'm seeing stars as I'm rubbing my eyes
And, I felt like there were two days missing
As I focused on the time
And I made my way to the kitchen
But, I had to stop from the shock of what I found
A room full of all of my friends all dancing 'round and 'round
And, I thought, Hello, New Shoes
Bye-bye blues
Hey, I put some new shoes on
And suddenly everything is right
I said, Hey, I put some new shoes on and everybody's smiling
It's so inviting
Oh, short on money
But long on time
Slowly strolling in the sweet sunshine
And I'm running late
And I don't need an excuse
'Cause I'm wearing my brand new shoes
Take me wanderin' through these streets
Where bright lights and angels meet
Stone to stone they take me on
I'm walking till the break of dawn
Take me wanderin' through these streets
Where bright lights and angels meet
Stone to stone they take me on
I'm walking till the break of dawn
Hey, I put some new shoes on
And suddenly everything is right
I said, Hey, I put some new shoes on, and everybody's smiling
It's so inviting
Oh, short on money
But, long on time
Slowly strolling in the sweet sunshine
And I'm running late
And I don't need an excuse
'Cause I'm wearing my brand new shoes
Oh, hey, I put some new shoes on
And suddenly everything is right
I said, Hey, I put some new shoes on, and everybody's smiling
It's so inviting
Oh, short on money
But, long on time
Slowly strolling in the sweet sunshine
And I'm running late
And I don't need an excuse
'Cause I'm wearing my brand new shoes
Baby's good to me, you know
She's happy as can be, you know
She said so
I'm in love with her and I feel fine
Baby says she's mine, you know
She tells me all the time, you know
She said so
I'm in love with her and I feel fine
I'm so glad that she's my little girl (ooh)
She's so glad she's telling all the world (ooh)
That her baby buys her things, you know
He buys her diamond rings, you know
She said so
She's in love with me and I feel fine, mmm
Baby says she's mine, you know
She tells me all the time, you know
She said so
I'm in love with her and I feel fine
I'm so glad that she's my little girl (ooh)
She's so glad she's telling all the world (ooh)
That her baby buys her things, you know
He buys her diamond rings, you know
She said so
She's in love with me and I feel fine
She's in love with me and I feel fine
Mmm
Mmm
Imagine me and you, I do
I think about you day and night
It's only right
To think about the girl you love
And hold her tight
So happy together
If I should call you up, invest a dime
And you say you belong to me
And ease my mind
Imagine how the world could be
So very fine
So happy together
I can't see me lovin' nobody but you for all my life
When you're with me, baby, the skies will be blue for all my life
Me and you and you and me
No matter how they tossed the dice
It had to be
The only one for me is you
And you for me
So happy together
I can't see me lovin' nobody but you for all my life
When you're with me, baby, the skies will be blue for all my life
Me and you and you and me
No matter how they tossed the dice
It had to be
The only one for me is you
And you for me
So happy together
Ba, ba-ba, ba-ba ba-ba ba-ba ba
Ba ba-ba ba
Ba, ba-ba, ba-ba ba-ba ba-ba ba
Ba ba-ba ba
Me and you and you and me
No matter how they tossed the dice
It had to be
The only one for me is you
And you for me
So happy together
So happy together
How is the weather?
So happy together
We're happy together
So happy together
We're happy together
So happy together
So happy together

You know I really like it
I know I'll always be here
You know it makes my heart beat
You know I'm happy up here
World, what you got for me?
Just bring it on
What's it gonna be?
Are you ready for it?
People, what you got for me?
Just bring it on
What's it gonna be?
I'm ready for it
You know I really like it
I know I'll always be here
Whatever you do, whatever you say
Nothing can push the feeling away
It's here in my heart and it's here in my head
I feel like I'm part of a book I've read
And every page and every paper
Seems to be part of human nature
Sending me back down on memory lane
My favorite record is playing again
You know I really like it
I know I'll always be here
You know it makes my heart beat
I'd rather dance with you than talk with you 
So why don't we just move into the other room 
There's space for us to shake, and hey, I like this tune 
Even if I could hear what you said 
I doubt my reply would be interesting for you to hear 
Because I haven't read a single book all year 
And the only film I saw, I didn't like it at all 
I'd rather dance, I'd rather dance than talk with you 
I'd rather dance, I'd rather dance than talk with you  
I'd rather dance, I'd rather dance than talk with you 
The music's too loud and the noise from the crowd 
Increases the chance of misinterpretation 
So let your hips do the talking 
I'll make you laugh by acting like the guy who sings 
And you'll make me smile by really getting into the swing 
Getting into the swing, getting into the swing 
Getting into the swing, getting into the swing 
Getting into the swing, getting into the swing 
Getting into the swing, getting into the swing... 
(Getting into the swing...)
I'd rather dance, I'd rather dance than talk with you 
I'd rather dance, I'd rather dance than talk with you  
I'd rather dance, I'd rather dance than talk with you 
I'd rather dance, I'd rather dance than talk with you 
I'd rather dance with you 
I'd rather dance with you
In December drinking horchata
I'd look psychotic in a balaclava
Winter's cold is too much to handle
Pincher crabs that pinch at your sandals
In December drinking horchata
Look down your glasses at that Aranciata
With lips and teeth to ask how my day went
Boots and fists to pound on the pavement
Here comes a feeling you thought you'd forgotten
Chairs to sit and sidewalks to walk on
You'd remember drinking horchata
You'd still enjoy it with your foot on Masada
Winter's cold is too much to handle
Pincher crabs that pinch at your sandals
Here comes a feeling you thought you'd forgotten
Chairs to sit and sidewalks to walk on
Oh, you had it but, oh no, you lost it
Looking back, you shouldn't have fought it
In December drinking horchata
I'd look psychotic in a balaclava
But winter's cold is too much to handle
Pincher crabs that pinch at your sandals
Years go by and hearts start to harden
Those palms and firs that grew in your garden
Are falling down and nearing the rose beds
The roots are shooting up through the tool shed
Those lips and teeth that asked how my day went
Are shouting up through cracks in the pavement
Here comes a feeling you thought you'd forgotten
Chairs to sit and sidewalks to walk on
Oh, you had it but, oh no, you lost it
You understood so you shouldn't have fought it
Here comes a feeling you thought you'd forgotten
Chairs to sit and sidewalks to walk on
Here comes a feeling you thought you'd forgotten
Chairs to sit and sidewalks to walk on

Da lat da (Da lat da), da lat da (Da lat da)
Da-da-da dun-diddle un-diddle un-diddle uh da-da
And I would walk five hundred miles
And I would walk five hundred more
Just to be the man who walked a thousand miles
To fall down at your door
Woke up in London yesterday
Found myself in the city near Piccadilly
Don't really know how I got here
I got some pictures on my phone
New names and numbers that I don't know
Address to places like Abbey Road
Day turns to night
Night turns to whatever we want
We're young enough to say
Oh
This has gotta be good life
This has gotta be good life
This could really be a good life, good life
I say oh
Got this feeling that you can't fight
Like this city is on fire tonight
This could really be a good life
A good, good life
To my friends in New York I say hello
My friends in L.A. they don't know
Where I've been for the past few years or so
Paris to China to Colorado
Sometimes there's airplanes I can't jump out
Sometimes there's bullshit that don't work now
We all got our stories but please tell me-e-e
What there's to complain about
When you're happy like a fool
Let it take you over
When everything is out
You gotta take it in
Oh
This has gotta be good life
This has gotta be good life
This could really be a good life, good life
I say oh
Got this feeling that you can't fight
Like this city is on fire tonight
This could really be a good life
A good, good life
Oh good, good life
Please, oh yeah, ooh
Hopelessly I feel like there might be something that I'll miss
Hopelessly I feel like the window closes oh so quick
Hopelessly I'm taking a mental picture of you now
'cause hopelessly the hope is we have so much to feel good about
Oh
This has gotta be good life
This has gotta be good life
This could really be a good life, good life
I say oh
Got this feeling that you can't fight
Like this city is on fire tonight
This could really be a good life
A good, good life
Oh yeah 
Good, good life
Good life
Listen
To my friends in New York I say hello
My friends in L.A. they don't know
Where I've been for the past few years or so
Paris to China to Colorado?
Sometimes there's airplanes I can't jump out
Sometimes there's bullshit that don't work now 
We all got our stories but please tell me
What there's to complain about?
Safety pins holding up the things
That make you mine
About your hair you needn't care
You look beautiful all of the time
Shine, shine, shine on
Yes
Oh, won't you shine, shine on?
Your magazines, the people at the seams
But you still read
I must admit, I don't believe in it
But I see how you get sucked in
Shine, shine, shine on
Yes
Oh, won't you shine, shine on?
Sha-la-la-la
Shine, shine, shine on
Yes
Oh, won't you shine, shine on?
Because you're not done
Why do you bite the hand that feeds you?
Why do you?
Why do you bite the hand that feeds?
Yeah
Shine, shine, shine on
Yes
Oh, won't you shine, shine on?
Sha-la-la-la
Shine, shine, shine on
Yes
Oh, won't you shine, shine on?
Safety pins holding up the things
That make you mine
About your hair you needn't care
You look beautiful all of the time
Who's the boy you like the most?
Is he teasing you with underage?
Could he be waving from a tropical sunset?
Static silhouette somehow?
Single in his bed someday?
Quiet till it fall, fall, falls
Rome, Rome, Rome, Rome
Focus looking forward the Colosseum
Oh no, what did I say? What can I say?
Rome, Rome, many tears have fallen
Here I'll be driving, you look the other way
That ain't easy to ignore
When your shutters open all the way
When it's candlelight I see I go insane
Distant silhouette somehow
We shared a cigarette somewhere
Addict till it fall, fall, falls
Rome, Rome, Rome, Rome
Focus looking forward the Colosseum
Oh no, what did I say? What can I say?
Rome, Rome, many tears have fallen
Here I'll be driving, you look the other way
Rome, Rome, Rome, Rome
Rome, Rome, Rome, Rome
Rome, Rome, Rome, Rome
Rome, Rome, Rome, Rome
Rome, Rome, Rome, Rome
Rome, Rome, Rome, Rome
Always and forevermore
I call to say I'm on the way
2000 years remain in a trash can
Let burn the cigarette somewhere
Ashes till it fall, fall, falls
I stand outside under broken leaves
I know I can't do without
The future's trying to wait
I've never loved you
If I loved you
I wouldn't say that I'm sorry oh no
I stand outside under broken leaves
Always and forevermore
We're together dead and lonely
I thought I couldn't do this without you
Single in his bed somewhere
Ashes till it fall, fall, falls
Rome, Rome, Rome, Rome
Rome, Rome, Rome, Rome
Rome, Rome, Rome, Rome
"Oh no, what did I say?"
"What can I say?"
Rome, Rome, Rome, Rome
Rome, Rome, Rome, Rome
Rome, Rome, Rome, Rome
Oh, oh
Uptown girl
She's been living in her uptown world
I bet she never had a backstreet guy
I bet her mama never told her why
I'm gonna try for an uptown girl (uptown girl)
She's been living in her white bread world (white bread world)
As long as anyone with hot blood can (hot blood can)
And now she's looking for a downtown man (downtown man)
That's what I am
And when she knows what she wants from her time
And when she wakes up and makes up her mind
She'll see I'm not so tough
Just because I'm in love
With an uptown girl (uptown girl)
You know I've seen her in her uptown world (uptown world)
She's getting tired of her high class toys (high class toys)
And all the presents from her uptown boys (uptown boys)
She's got a choice
Whoa-oa-oa-oa-oa-oa-oa-oa-oa-oa-oa-oa-oa-oa
Whoa-oa-oa-oa-oa-oa-oa-oa-oa-oa-oa-oa-oa-oa
Uptown girl
You know I can't afford to buy her pearls
But maybe someday when my ship comes in
She'll understand what kind of guy I've been (I've been)
And then I'll win
And when she's walking, she's looking so fine
And when she's talking, she'll say that she's mine
She'll say I'm not so tough
Just because I'm in love
With an uptown girl (oh)
She's been living in her white bread world (oh)
As long as anyone with hot blood can (oh)
And now she's looking for a downtown man (oh)
That's what I am
Whoa-oa-oa-oa-oa-oa-oa-oa-oa-oa-oa-oa-oa-oa
Whoa-oa-oa-oa-oa-oa-oa-oa-oa-oa-oa-oa-oa-oa
Uptown girl
She's my uptown girl
Don't you know I'm in love with an uptown girl
My uptown girl
Don't you know I'm in love with an uptown girl
My uptown girl
Don't you know I'm in love with an uptown girl
My uptown girl
Don't you know I'm in love with an uptown girl
My uptown girl
Fall is here, hear the yell
Back to school, ring the bell
Brand new shoes, walking blues
Climb the fence, books and pens
I can tell that we are gonna be friends
I can tell that we are gonna be friends
Walk with me, Suzy Lee
Through the park and by the tree
We will rest upon the ground
And look at all the bugs we've found
Safely walk to school without a sound
Safely walk to school without a sound
Here we are, no one else
We walk to school all by ourselves
There's dirt on our uniforms
From chasing all the ants and worms
We clean up and now it's time to learn
We clean up and now it's time to learn
Numbers, letters, learn to spell
Nouns and books and show and tell
At playtime we will throw the ball
Back to class, through the hall
Teacher marks our height against the wall
Teacher marks our height against the wall
We don't notice any time pass
We don't notice anything
We sit side-by-side in every class
Teacher thinks that I sound funny
But she likes the way you sing
Tonight I'll dream while I'm in bed
When silly thoughts go through my head
'Bout the bugs and alphabet
And when I wake tomorrow, I'll bet
That you and I will walk together again
I can tell that we are gonna be friends
Yes, I can tell that we are gonna be friends
Who's to say
What's impossible
Well they forgot
This world keeps spinning
And with each new day
I can feel a change in everything
And as the surface breaks reflections fade
But in some ways they remain the same
And as my mind begins to spread its wings
There's no stopping curiosity
I want to turn the whole thing upside down
I'll find the things they say just can't be found
I'll share this love I find with everyone
We'll sing and dance to Mother Nature's songs
I don't want this feeling to go away
Who's to say
I can't do everything
Well I can try
And as I roll along I begin to find
Things aren't always just what they seem
I want to turn the whole thing upside down
I'll find the things they say just can't be found
I'll share this love I find with everyone
We'll sing and dance to Mother Nature's songs
This world keeps spinning and there's no time to waste
Well it all keeps spinning spinning round and round and
Upside down
Who's to say what's impossible and can't be found
I don't want this feeling to go away
Please don't go away
Please don't go away
Please don't go away
Is this how it's supposed to be

When I get older, losing my hair
Many years from now
Will you still be sending me a Valentine?
Birthday greetings, bottle of wine?
If I'd been out till quarter to three
Would you lock the door?
Will you still need me, will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four?
You'll be older too
And if you say the word
I could stay with you
I could be handy mending a fuse
When your lights have gone
You can knit a sweater by the fireside
Sunday mornings, go for a ride
Doing the garden, digging the weeds
Who could ask for more?
Will you still need me, will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four?
Every summer we can rent a cottage in the Isle of Wight, if it's not too dear
We shall scrimp and save (we shall scrimp and save)
Grandchildren on your knee
Vera, Chuck, and Dave
Send me a postcard, drop me a line
Stating point of view
Indicate precisely what you mean to say
Yours sincerely wasting away
Give me your answer, fill in a form
Mine for evermore
Will you still need me, will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four?
It's going to take a little time
While you're waiting like a factory line
I'll ride across the park
Backseat on the 79
Wasted days
You've come to pass
So go, I know
You would not stay
It wasn't true
But anyway
Pollination
Yellow cab
Whoa
Whoa
You walk up the stairs
See the French kids by the door
Up one more flight
See the Buddha on the second floor
Coronation
Rickshaw grab
So go, I know
You would not stay
It wasn't true
But anyway
Racist dreams
You should not have
Whoa
Whoa
No excuse to be so callous
Dress yourself in bleeding Madras
Charm your way across the Khyber Pass
Stay awake to break the habit
Sing in praise of Jackson Crowter
Watch your step along the arch of
No excuse to be so callous
Dress yourself in bleeding Madras
Charm your way across the Khyber Pass
Stay awake to break the habit
Sing in praise of Jackson Crowter
Watch your step along the arch of glass
Tell me that you've got everything you want
And your bird can sing
But you don't get me
You don't get me
You say you've seen seven wonders
And your bird is green
But you can't see me
You can't see me
When your prized possessions
Start to weigh you down
Look in my direction
I'll be 'round
I'll be 'round
When your bird is broken 
Will it bring you down?
You may be awoken 
I'll be 'round
I'll be 'round
You tell me that you heard every sound there is 
And your bird can swing 
But you can't hear me 
You can't hear me
Ahh-ahh-ahh-ahh-ahh
Lovely Rita, meter maid
Lovely Rita, meter maid
Lovely Rita, meter maid
Nothing can come between us
When it gets dark I tow your heart away
Standing by a parking meter
When I caught a glimpse of Rita
Filling in the ticket in her little white book
In a cap she looked much older
And the bag across her shoulder
Made her look a little like a military man
Lovely Rita, meter maid
May I inquire discreetly
When are you free to take some tea with me?
Rita
Took her out and tried to win her
Had a laugh and over dinner
Told her I would really like to see her again
Got the bill and Rita paid it
Took her home and nearly made it
Sitting on a sofa with a sister or two
Oh lovely Rita, meter maid
Where would I be without you?
Give us a wink and make me think of you
Lovely Rita, meter maid
They'll never believe it
I'm packed and I'm holding
I'm smiling, she's living
She's golden, she lives for me
Says she lives for me
Ovation, her own motivation
She comes 'round and she goes down on me
And I make her smile like a drug for you
Do ever what you want to do, coming over you
Keep on smiling, what we go through
One stop to the rhythm that divides you
And I speak to you like the chorus to the verse
Chop another line like a coda with a curse
Come on like a freak show takes the stage
We give them the games we play, she said
I want something else
To get me through this
Semi-charmed kind of life, baby, baby
I want something else
I'm not listening when you say goodbye
The sky was gold, it was rose
I was taking sips of it through my nose
And I wish I could get back there
Some place back there
Smiling in the pictures you would take
Doing crystal meth will lift you up until you break
It won't stop, I won't come down, I keep stock
With a tick-tock rhythm, a bump for the drop
And then I bumped up, I took the hit that I was given
And I bumped again and I bumped again
I said
How do I get back there
To the place where I fell asleep inside you?
How do I get myself back to the place where you said
I want something else
To get me through this
Semi-charmed kind of life, baby, baby
I want something else
I'm not listening when you say goodbye
I believe in the sand beneath my toes
The beach gives a feeling, an earthy feeling
I believe in the faith that grows
And the four right chords can make me cry
When I'm with you I feel like I could die
And that would be all right, all right
And when the plane came in, she said she was crashing
The velvet, it rips in the city
We tripped on the urge to feel alive
Now I'm struggling to survive
Those days you were wearing that velvet dress
You're the priestess, I must confess
Those little red panties they pass the test
Slide up around the belly, face down on the mattress
One, and you hold me
And we are broken
Still it's all that I want to do
Just a little now
Feel myself hovering off the ground
I'm scared, I'm not coming down, no no
And I won't run for my life
She's got her jaws now locked down in a smile
But nothing is all right, all right
And I want something else to get me through this life, baby
I want something else, not listening when you say
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
The sky was gold, it was rose
I was taking sips of it through my nose
And I wish I could get back there
Some place back there
In the place we used to start
I want something else
Good day, sunshine
Good day, sunshine
Good day, sunshine
I need to laugh
And when the sun is out
I've got something I can laugh about
I feel good
In a special way
I'm in love and it's a sunny day
Good day, sunshine
Good day, sunshine
Good day, sunshine
We take a walk
The sun is shining down
Burns my feet as they touch the ground
Good day, sunshine
Good day, sunshine
Good day, sunshine
Then we lie
Beneath the shady tree
I love her and she's loving me
She feels good (she does)
She knows she's looking fine
I'm so proud to know that she is mine
Good day, sunshine
Good day, sunshine
Good day, sunshine
Good day, sunshine
Good day, sunshine
Good day, sunshine
Good day, sunshine
(Good day, sunshine)
(Good day, sunshine)
(Good day, sunshine)
(Good day)
What's up with my heart when it skips a beat? (skips a beat)
Can't feel no pavement right under my feet (under my feet)
Up in my lonely room (my room)
When I'm dreaming of you
Oh, what can I do?
I still need you, but I don't want you now
When I'm down and my hands are tied (hands are tied)
I cannot reach a pen for me to draw the line (draw the line)
From this pain I just can't disguise (can't disguise)
It's gonna hurt but I'll have to say goodbye (say goodbye)
Up in my lonely room (my room)
When I'm dreaming of you
Oh, what can I do?
I still need you, but I don't want you now
Oh yeah
Up in my lonely room (my room)
When I'm dreaming of you
Oh, what can I do?
I still need you, but I don't want you now
It's, oh, so quiet
Sssh, sssh
It's, oh, so still
Sssh, sssh
You're all alone
Sssh, sssh
And so peaceful until
You fall in love, zing, boom
The sky above, zing, boom
Is caving in, wow, bam!
You've never been so nuts about a guy
You wanna laugh you wanna cry
You cross your heart and hope to die
Till it's over and then
Sssh, sssh
It's nice and quiet
Sssh, sssh
But soon again
Sssh, sssh
Starts another big riot
You blow a fuse, zing, boom
The devil cuts loose, zing, boom
So what's the use, wow, bam!
Of falling in love?
It's, oh, so quiet
It's, oh, so still
You're all alone
And so peaceful until
You ring the bell, bim, bam
You shout and you yell, hi, ho, ho
You broke the spell
Gee, this is swell you almost have a fit
This guy is 'gorge' and I got hit
There's no mistake: this is it!
Till it's over and then
It's nice and quiet
But soon again
Starts another big riot
You blow a fuse, zing, boom
The devil cuts loose, zing, boom
So what's the use, wow, bam!
Of falling in love?
The sky caves in
The devil cuts loose
You blow, blow, blow, blow, blow your fuse
Ow!
When you've fallen in love
Sssh
I'm sitting here in the boring room
It's just another rainy Sunday afternoon
I'm wasting my time
I got nothing to do
I'm hanging around
I'm waiting for you
But nothing ever happens and I wonder
I'm driving around in my car
I'm driving too fast
I'm driving too far
I'd like to change my point of view
I feel so lonely
I'm waiting for you
But nothing ever happens and I wonder
I wonder how
I wonder why
Yesterday you told me 'bout the blue blue sky
And all that I can see is just a yellow lemon-tree
I'm turning my head up and down
I'm turning turning turning turning turning around
And all that I can see is just another lemon-tree
Sing dap
Dah dah dah dap n deeh dap dah
Dah dah dah dap n deeh dap dah
Dap deeh n deeh dah
I'm sitting here
I miss the power
I'd like to go out taking a shower
But there's a heavy cloud inside my head
I feel so tired
Put myself into bed
While nothing ever happens and I wonder
Isolation is not good for me
Isolation I don't want to sit on the lemon-tree
I'm steppin' around in the desert of joy
Baby anyhow I'll get another toy
And everything will happen and you wonder
I wonder how
I wonder why
Yesterday you told me 'bout the blue blue sky
And all that I can see is just another lemon-tree
I'm turning my head up and down
I'm turning turning turning turning turning around
And all that I can see is just a yellow lemon-tree
And I wonder, wonder
I wonder how
I wonder why
Yesterday you told me 'bout the blue blue sky
And all that I can see
And all that I can see
And all that I can see
Is just a yellow lemon-tree
So she said, "What's the problem, baby?"
What's the problem? I don't know
Well, maybe I'm in love (Love)
Think about it every time, I think about it
Can't stop thinking 'bout it
How much longer will it take to cure this?
Just to cure it 'cause I can't ignore it if it's love (love)
Makes me wanna turn around and face me
But I don't know nothing 'bout love, uh
Come on, come on, turn a little faster
Come on, come on, the world will follow after
Come on, come on, because everybody's after love
So I said I'm a snowball running
Running down into the spring that's coming
All this love melting under blue skies
Belting out sunlight, shimmering love
Well, baby, I surrender to the strawberry ice cream
Never ever end-er all this love
Well, I didn't mean to do it
But there's no escaping your love, uh
These lines of lightning mean we're never alone
Never alone, no, no
Come on, come on, move a little closer
Come on, come on, I wanna hear you whisper
Come on, come on, settle down inside my love
Uh, come on, come on, (Come on) jump a little higher
Come on, come on, if you feel a little lighter
Come on, come on, (Come on) we were once upon a time in love
We're accidentally in love
Accidentally in love
Accidentally in love
Accidentally in love
Accidentally in love
Accidentally in love
Accidentally in love
Accidentally in love
Accidentally in love
Accidentally
I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love
Accidentally
I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love
Accidentally
Come on, come on, (Come on) spin a little tighter
Come on, come on, and the world's a little brighter
Come on, come on, (Come on) just get yourself inside her love
I'm in love
I thought love was only true in fairy tales
Meant for someone else but not for me
Love was out to get me
That's the way it seemed
Disappointment haunted all my dreams
Then I saw her face, now I'm a believer
Not a trace of doubt in my mind
I'm in love
I'm a believer, I couldn't leave her if I tried
I thought love was more or less a given thing
Seems the more I gave the less I got
What's the use in tryin'
All you get is pain
When I needed sunshine I got rain
Then I saw her face, now I'm a believer
Not a trace of doubt in my mind
I'm in love
I'm a believer, I couldn't leave her if I tried, ah
Oh, love was out to get me
That's the way it seemed
Disappointment haunted all my dreams
Then I saw her face, now I'm a believer
Not a trace of doubt in my mind
I'm in love
Oh, I'm a believer, I couldn't leave her if I tried
Yes, I saw her face, now I'm a believer
Not a trace of doubt in my mind
Said, I'm a believer, yeah
Said, I'm a believer, yeah (I'm a believer)
Said, I'm a believer, yeah (I'm a believer)
Oh!

Brainstorm,
Take me away from the norm
I got to tell you something
This phenomenon
I had to put it in a song
And it goes like
Whoa, amber is the color of your energy
Whoa, shades of gold displayed naturally
You ought to know what brings me here oh
You glide through my head blind to fear
And I know why
Whoa, amber is the color of your energy
Whoa, shades of gold displayed naturally
Whoa, amber is the color of your energy
Whoa, shades of gold displayed naturally
You live too far away...
Your voice rings like a bell anyway...
Don't give up your independence,
Unless it feels so right,
Nothing good comes easily,
Sometimes you got to fight...
Whoa, amber is the color of your energy
Whoa, shades of gold displayed naturally
Launched a thousand ships in my heart, so easy
Still it's fine from afar, 
And you know that...
Whoa, brainstorm (brainstorm)
Take me away from the norm
Whoa (whoa), I got to tell you something

Well, Barbie, we're just gettin' started
Oh, I love you Ken!
I want you by my side
So that I never feel alone again
They've always been so kind
But now they've brought you away from me
I hope they didn't get your mind
Your heart is too strong anyway
We need to fetch back the time
They have stolen from us
And I want you
We can bring it on the floor
We've never danced like this before
We don't talk about it
Dancin' on
Doin' the boogie all night long
Stoned in paradise
Shouldn't talk about it
And I want you
We can bring it on the floor
We've never danced like this before
We don't talk about it
Dancin' on
Do the boogie all night long
Stoned in paradise
Shouldn't talk about it
Shouldn't talk about it
Coldest winter for me
No sun is shining anymore
The only thing I feel is pain
Caused by absence of you
Suspense controlling my mind
I cannot find the way out of here
I want you by my side
So that I never feel alone again
And I want you
We can bring it on the floor
We've never danced like this before
We don't talk about it
Dancin' on
Do the boogie all night long
Stoned in paradise
Shouldn't talk about it
And I want you
We can bring it on the floor
We've never danced like this before
We don't talk about it
Dancin' on
Do the boogie all night long
Stoned in paradise
Shouldn't talk about it
Shouldn't talk about it
And I want you
We can bring it on the floor
We've never danced like this before
We don't talk about it
Dancin' on
Do the boogie all night long
Stoned in paradise
Shouldn't talk about it
And I want you
We can bring it on the floor
We've never danced like this before
We don't talk about it
Dancin' on
Do the boogie all night long
Stoned in paradise
Shouldn't talk about it
Shouldn't talk about it
I was alone, I took a ride
I didn't know what I would find there
Another road where maybe I
Could see another kind of mind there
Ooh, then I suddenly see you
Ooh, did I tell you I need you
Every single day of my life?
You didn't run, you didn't lie
You know I wanted just to hold you
And had you gone, you knew in time
We'd meet again, for I had told you
Ooh, you were meant to be near me
Ooh, and I want you to hear me
Say we'll be together every day
Got to get you into my life
Somehow, someway
What can I do? What can I be?
When I'm with you I wanna stay there
If I'm true, I'll never leave
And if I do I know the way there
Ooh, then I suddenly see you
Ooh, did I tell you I need you
Every single day of my life?
Got to get you into my life
I've got to get you into my life
I was alone, I took a ride
I didn't know what I would find there
Another road where maybe I
Could see another kind of mind there
And then I suddenly see you
Did I tell you I need you
Every single day?
Here we go again
I kinda wanna be more than friends
So take it easy on me
I'm afraid you're never satisfied
Here we go again
We're sick like animals, we play pretend
You're just a cannibal
And I'm afraid I won't get out alive
No I won't sleep tonight
Oh oh I want some more
Oh oh what are you waiting for
Take a bite of my heart tonight
Oh oh I want some more
Oh oh what are you waiting for
What are you waiting for
Take a bite of my heart tonight
Here we are again
I feel the chemicals kicking in
It's getting heavy and I want to run and hide
I want to run and hide
I do it every time
You're killing me now
And I won't be denied by you
The animal inside of you
Oh oh I want some more
Oh oh what are you waiting for
Take a bite of my heart tonight
Oh oh I want some more
Oh oh what are you waiting for
What are you waiting for
Take a bite of my heart tonight
Hush hush the world is quiet
Hush hush we both can't fight it
It's us that made this mess
Why can't you understand
Oh I won't sleep tonight
I won't sleep tonight
Here we go again (here we go again)
Oh oh I want some more
Oh oh what are you waiting for
Take a bite of my heart tonight
Oh oh I want some more
Oh oh what are you waiting for
What are you waiting for
What are you waiting
Here we go again
Oh oh here we go again
Oh oh here we go again
Say goodbye to my heart tonight
Oh oh I want some more
Oh oh what are you waiting for
What are you waiting for
Say goodbye to my heart tonight
Hey, what's the big idea?
Yo, Mika!
I said, sucking too hard on your lollipop
Oh, love's gonna get you down
I said, sucking too hard on your lollipop
Oh, love's gonna get you down
Sucking too hard on your lollipop
Oh, love's gonna get you down
Sucking too hard on your lollipop
Oh, love's gonna get you down
Say love, say love
Oh, love's gonna get you down
Say love, say love
Oh, love's gonna get you down
I went walking in with my mama one day
When she warned me what people say
Live your life until love is found
'Cause love's gonna get you down
Take a look at the girl next door
She's a player and a downright bore
Jesus loves her, she wants more
Oh, bad girls get you down
Singing
Sucking too hard on your lollipop
Oh, love's gonna get you down
Sucking too hard on your lollipop
Oh, love's gonna get you down
Say love, say love
Oh, love's gonna get you down
Say love, say love
Oh, love's gonna get you down
Mama told me what I should know
Too much candy gonna rot your soul
If she loves you, let her go
'Cause love only gets you down
Take a look at the boy like me
Never stood on my own two feet
Now I'm blue as I can be
Oh, love come get me down
Singing
Sucking too hard on your lollipop
Oh, love's gonna get you down
Sucking too hard on your lollipop
Oh, love's gonna get you down
Say love, say love
Oh, love's gonna get you down
Say love, say love
Oh, love's gonna get you down
I went walking with my mama one day
When she warned me what people say
Live your life until love is found
Or love's gonna get you down
Singing
Sucking too hard on your lollipop
Oh, love's gonna get you down
Sucking too hard on your lollipop
Oh, love's gonna get you down
Say love (Say love) Say love (Say love)
Oh, love's gonna get you down
Say love (Say love) Say love (Say love)
Oh, love's gonna get you down
Mama told me what I should know
Too much candy gonna rot your soul
If she loves you, let her go
'Cause love only gets you down
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh, lollipop
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh, lollipop
Sucking too hard on your lollipop
Oh, love's gonna get you down
Say sucking too hard on your lollipop
Hey, love's gonna get you down (Lollipop)
Say goodnight and go
Skipping beats, blushing cheeks
I am struggling
Daydreaming bed scenes in
The corner cafe
And then I'm left in bits
Recovering, tectonic trembling
You get me every time
Why'd you have to be so cute?
It's impossible to ignore you
Must you make me laugh so much?
It's bad enough we get along so well
Say goodnight and go
Follow you home
You've got your headphones on
And you're dancing
Got lucky, beautiful shot
You're taking everything off
Watch the curtains, wide open
And you fall in the same routine
Flicking through the TV
Relaxed and reclining
And you think you're alone
Oh, why'd you have to be so cute?
It's impossible to ignore you
Must you make me laugh so much?
It's bad enough we get along so well
Say goodnight and go
One of these days
You'll miss your train and come stay with me
It's always say goodnight and go
We'll have drinks and talk about things
And any excuse to stay awake with you
You'd sleep here, I'd sleep there
But then the heating may be down again
At my convenience
We'd be good, we'd be great together
(Go)
Why'd you have to be so cute?
It's impossible to ignore you
Must you make me laugh so much?
It's bad enough we get along so well
Say goodnight and go
(Why is it always, always?)
Goodnight and go
(Darling, not again)
Go
I like where we are
When we drive in your car
I like where we are 
Here
'Cause our lips can touch
And our cheeks can brush
Our lips can touch 
Here
Well you are the one
The one that lies close to me
Whispers "Hello, I miss you quite terribly." 
I fell in love
In love with you suddenly
Now there's no place else
I could be but here in your arms
I like where you sleep
When you sleep next to me
I like where you sleep
Here 
Our lips can touch
And our cheeks can brush
'Cause our lips can touch
Here
Well you are the one
The one that lies close to me
Whispers "Hello, I miss you quite terribly." 
I fell in love
In love with you suddenly
Now there's no place else
I could be but here in your arms
Our lips can touch 
Our lips can touch 
Here
Well you are the one
The one that lies close to me
Whispers "Hello, I miss you quite terribly." 
I fell in love
In love with you suddenly
Now there's no place else
I could be but here in your arms
Here in your arms
Well you are the one
The one that lies close to me
Whispers "Hello, I miss you, I miss you..." 
I fell in love
In love with you suddenly
Now there's no place else
I could be but here in your arms
Here in your arms
Here in your arms
What I want, you've got
And it might be hard to handle
But like a flame that burns the candle
The candle feeds the flame
Yeah, yeah, what I've got, full stock
Of thoughts and dreams that scatter
If you pull them all together
And a-how, I can't explain
Oh yeah, well, well you (Ooh, ooh, ooh ooh ooh)
You make a-my dreams come true
(You) You (You, you, ooh ooh ooh, you)
Well, well, well you (Ooh, ooh, ooh ooh ooh)
Oh yeah, a-you make a-my dreams come true
(You, you, you, ooh ooh ooh, you)
Well yeah
On a night when bad
Dreams become a screamer
When they're messing with the dreamer
I can laugh it in the face
Twist and shout my way out
And wrap yourself around me
'Cause a-I ain't the way you found me
And I'll never be the same
Oh yeah, well, 'cause you (Ooh, ooh, ooh ooh ooh)
Mmm hmm, you make a-my dreams come true
(You, you, you, ooh ooh ooh, you)
Whoa yeah, well, well, well you (Ooh, ooh, ooh ooh ooh)
Woo woo, you make a-my dreams come true
(You, you, you, ooh ooh ooh, you)
Oh yeah
Well, listen to this
Ow
I'm down on my daydream
Oh, that sleepwalk should be over by now, I know
Ah you
Yeah a-yeah, you make a-my dreams come true
(You, you, you, ooh ooh ooh, you)
Oh yeah, I've been waiting for, waiting for you, girl
(Ooh, ooh, ooh ooh ooh)
Oh yeah, you make a-my dreams come true
(You, you, you, ooh ooh ooh, you)
Me, you, me, you, me
I've been waiting for, waiting for you, girl
(Ooh, ooh, ooh ooh ooh)
Oh my, you make a-my dreams come true
(You) Oh (You, you, ooh ooh ooh, you)
Whoa ooh whoa, I've been waiting for, waiting for, waiting for
(Ooh, ooh, ooh ooh ooh)
Waiting for, waiting for, waiting for, waiting
You make my dreams
(You, you, you, ooh ooh ooh, you)
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
I've been waiting for you, girl
(Ooh, ooh, ooh ooh ooh)
You make my dreams
(You, you, you, ooh ooh ooh, you)
This is my face:
Covered in freckles, with the occasional spot and some veins...
This is my body:
Covered in skin, and not all of it you can see...
And this is my mind:
It goes over and over the same old lines...
And this is my brain:
Its torturous analytical thoughts make me go insane...
And I use mouthwash - Sometimes I floss;
I got a family, and I drink cups of tea...
I've got nostalgic pavements, I've got familiar faces,
I've got mixed-up memories, and I've got favourite places...
And I'm singing "oh oh" on a Friday night...
And I'm singing "oh oh" on a Friday night...
And I'm singing "oh oh" on a Friday night, and I hope everything's gonna be alright;
And I'm singing "oh oh" on a Friday night, and I hope everything's gonna be alright...
This is my face:
I've got a thousand opinions, and half the time, I'm trying to explain...
And this is my body: 
No matter how you try and disable it, yes, I'll still be here...
And this is my mind:
And although you try to infringe, you cannot confine...
And this is my brain:
And even if you try and hold me back, there's nothing that you can gain...
'Cause I use mouthwash - Sometimes I floss;
I've got a family, and I drink cups of tea...
I've got nostalgic pavements, I've got familiar faces,
I've got mixed-up memories, and I've got favourite places...
And I'm singing "oh oh" on a Friday night...
And I'm singing "oh oh" on a Friday night...
And I'm singing "oh oh" on a Friday night, and I hope everything's gonna be alright;
And I'm singing "oh oh" on a Friday night, and I hope everything's gonna be alright...
Oh, uh-oh, oh-oh-oh, ah, uh-oh, ah, ah, ah, ah...
Her name is Noelle, I have a dream about her
She rings my bell, I got gym class in half an hour
Oh, how she rocks in Keds and tube socks
But she doesn't know who I am
And she doesn't give a damn about me
'Cause I'm just a teenage dirtbag, baby
Yeah, I'm just a teenage dirtbag, baby
Listen to Iron Maiden, baby, with me
Her boyfriend's a dick, he brings a gun to school
And he'd simply kick my ass if he knew the truth
He lives on my block and he drives an IROC
But he doesn't know who I am
And he doesn't give a damn about me
'Cause I'm just a teenage dirtbag, baby
Yeah, I'm just a teenage dirtbag, baby
Listen to Iron Maiden, baby, with me, ooh
Oh yeah, dirtbag
No, she doesn't know what she's missing
Oh yeah, dirtbag
No, she doesn't know what she's missing
Man, I feel like mold, it's prom night and I am lonely
Lo and behold; she's walking over to me
This must be fake, my lip starts to shake
How does she know who I am?
And why does she give a damn about me?
She says, "I've got two tickets to Iron Maiden, baby
Come with me Friday, don't say maybe
I'm just a teenage dirtbag, baby, like you, ooh"
Oh yeah, dirtbag
No, she doesn't know what she's missing
Oh yeah, dirtbag
No, she doesn't know what she's missing
After all these implements and texts designed by intellects
So vexed to find evidently there's still so much that hides
And though the saints dub us divine in ancient fading lines 
Their sentiment is just as hard to pluck from the vine
I'll try hard not to pretend
Allow myself no mock defense
As I step into the night
Since I don't have the time nor mind to figure out
The nursery rhymes that helped us out in making sense of our lives
The cruel, uneventful state of apathy releases me
I value them, but I won't cry every time one's wiped out
I'll try hard not to give in
Battened down to fare the wind
Rid my head of this pretense
Allow myself no mock defense
Step into the night
La-da-da-dum
La-da-da-dum
La-da-da-dum
La-da-da-da-dum-dum
La-da-da-dum
La-da-da-da-dum-dum
Mercy's eyes are blue
When she places them in front of you
Nothing holds a Roman candle to
The solemn warmth you feel inside
There's no measuring of  
Nothing else is love
I'll try hard not to give in
Battened down to fare the wind
Rid my head of this pretense
Allow myself no mock defense
Step into the night
La-da-da-dum
La-da-da-dum
La-da-da-dum

Mercy's eyes are blue
When she places them in front of you
Nothing really holds a candle to
The solemn warmth you feel inside of you

He's so the purity, a shaving and a mourning
And standing on a pigeon toe in his disarray
Straight in the picture pose, he's coming around to meet you
And screaming like a battle cry, it's more if I stay
Me and your cold, driving in the snow
Let the good times roll, let the good times roll
Cowgirl king of the rodeo
Let the good times roll, let the good times roll
How dare you come to me like Withnail for a favor
Ah, hold on, not my fairy tale you're trying to start
Take off your overcoat, you're staying for the weekend
And swaying like a smokey grey, a drink in the park
Me and your cold, driving in the snow
Let the good times roll, let the good times roll
Cowgirl king of the rodeo
Let the good times roll, let the good times roll
Good time to roll on
Martha, my dear
Though I spend my days in conversation, please
Remember me
Martha, my love
Don't forget me
Martha, my dear
Hold your head up, you silly girl
Look what you've done
When you find yourself in the thick of it
Help yourself to a bit of what is all around you
Silly girl
Take a good look around you
Take a good look; you're bound to see
That you and me were meant to be
For each other
Silly girl
Hold your hand out, you silly girl
See what you've done
When you find yourself in the thick of it
Help yourself to a bit of what is all around you
Silly girl
Martha, my dear
You have always been my inspiration, please
Be good to be
Martha, my love
Don't forget me
Martha, my dear

I've got to know, know, know you
I have dreams of orca whales and owls
But I wake up in fear
(Bum, bum, bum)
You will never be my
You will never be my
Fool
Will never be my fool
(Ah-ah-ah)
Floaters in my eyes
Wake up in a hotel room
(Ah-ah-ah)
Cigarettes and lies
I am a child, it's too soon
(Ah-ah-ah)
I have dreams of orca whales and owls
But I wake up in fear
(Bum, bum, bum)
You will never be my
You will never be my fool
Will never be my fool
A little bag of cocaine
A little bag of cocaine
So who's the girl wearing my dress?
(Bum, bum, bum)
I figured out her number
Inside a paper napkin
But I don't know her address; I wade downstairs
The porter smiles to me
A smile I've bought
With a couple of gold coins
A sign that I've been caught
I have dreams of orca whales and owls
But I wake up in fear
(Bum, bum, bum)
You will never be my
You will never be my
Dear
Will never be my
Dear, dear friend
Ba-da-da-dum, a-bum
Dear, dear friend
Ba-da-da-dum, a-bum
Dear, dear friend
Ba-da-da-dum, a-bum
Dear, dear friend
Ba-da-da-dum
A little bag of cocaine
A little bag of cocaine
So who's the girl wearing my dress?
I figured out her number
Inside a paper napkin
But I don't know her address
Come into my world
I've got to show, show, show you
(Ah-ah-ah)
Come into my bed
I've got to know, know, know you
I have dreams of orca whales and owls
But I wake up in fear
(Bum, bum, bum)
You will never be my
You will never be my
Dear
Will never be my
Dear, dear friend
Ba-da-da-dum, a-bum
Dear, dear friend
Ba-da-da-dum, a-bum
Dear, dear friend
Ba-da-da-dum, a-bum
Dear, dear friend
Ba-da-da-dum, a-bum

Oh deary me
My little brother's in his bedroom smoking weed
I tell him he should get up 'cause it's nearly half past three
He can't be bothered 'cause he's high on THC
I ask him very nicely if he'd like a cup of tea
I can't even see him 'cause his room is so smoky
Don't understand how one can watch so much TV
My baby brother Alfie how I wish that you could see
I only say it 'cause I care
So please can you stop pulling my hair?
Now, now there's no need to swear
Please don't despair my dear mon frère
Oh Alfie get up it's a brand new day
I just can't sit back and watch you waste your life away
You need to get a job because the bills need to get paid
Get off your lazy arse, Alfie please use your brain
Surely there's some walls out there that you can go and spray
I'm feeling guiltier for leading you astray
Now how the hell do you ever expect that you'll get laid
When all you do is stay and play in your computer games?
I only say it 'cause I care
So please can you stop pulling my hair?
Now, now there's no need to swear
Please don't despair my dear mon frère
Oh little brother please refrain from doing that
I'm tryin' to help you out so can you stop being a twat?
It's time that you and I sat down and had a little chat
And look me in the eyes take off that stupid fitted cap
I only say it 'cause I care
So please can you stop pulling my hair?
Now, now there's no need to swear
Please don't despair
Please don't despair
My mon frère
I'm a new soul 
I came to this strange world 
Hoping I could learn a bit about how to give and take.
But since I came here
Felt the joy and the fear
Finding myself making every possible mistake.
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la...
I'm a young soul 
In this very strange world 
Hoping I could learn a bit about what is true and fake.
But why all this hate?
Try to communicate.
Finding trust and love is not always easy to make.
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la...
This is a happy end 
Cause' you don't understand
Everything you have done.
Why's everything so wrong?
This is a happy end 
Come and give me your hand 
I'll take your far away.
I'm a new soul 
I came to this strange world 
Hoping I could learn a bit 'bout how to give and take.
But since I came here
Felt the joy and the fear
Finding myself making every possible mistake.
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la...
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la...

We're Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
We hope you have enjoyed the show

We're sorry but it's time to go
Sgt. Pepper's lonely

Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
We'd like to thank you once again
Sgt. Pepper's one and only Lonely Hearts Club Band
It's getting very near the end
Sgt. Pepper's lonely
Sgt. Pepper's lonely
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
Woo!
(The test begins...now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now)
I thought I was smart, I thought I was right
I thought it better not to fight, I thought there was a virtue in always being cool
So it came time to fight
I thought, "I'll just step aside and that the time would prove you wrong"
And that you would
Be the fool, I don't know where the sunbeams end and the starlights begin, it's all a mystery
Oh, to fight is to defend
If it's not now then tell me when would be the time that you would stand up and be a man
For to lose I could accept
But to surrender I just wept and regretted this moment (I don't know)
Oh that I, was the fool
I don't know where the sunbeams end and the starlights begin, it's all a mystery
And I don't know how a man decides what's right for his own life, it's all a mystery
'Cause I'm a man, not a boy
And there are things you can't avoid, you have to face them when you're not prepared to face them
If I could, I would
But you're with him, now I'd do no good I should've fought him but instead I let him (I let him take you)
I don't know where the sunbeams end and the starlights begin, it's all a mystery
And I don't know how a man decides what's right for his own life, it's all a mystery
I don't know where the sunbeams end and the starlights begin, it's all a mystery
And I don't know how a man decides what's right for his own life, it's all a mystery
I don't know where the sunbeams end and the starlights begin, it's all a mystery
(If it's not now then tell me when would be the time that you would stand up and be a man)
And I don't know how a man decides what's right for his own life, it's all a mystery
(And there are things you can't avoid, you have to face them when you're not prepared to face them)
I don't know where the sunbeams end and the starlights begin, it's all a mystery
(But you're with him, now I'd do no good I should've fought him but instead I let him I let him take you)
(The test is over...now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now...)
You're a part-time lover and a full time friend
The monkey on your back is the latest trend
I don't see what anyone can see in anyone else
But you
I kiss you on the brain in the shadow of a train
I kiss you all starry-eyed, my body's swinging from side-to-side
I don't see what anyone can see in anyone else
But you
Here is the church and here is the steeple
We sure are cute for two ugly people
I don't see what anyone can see in anyone else
But you
The pebbles forgive me, the trees forgive me
So why can't you forgive me?
I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else
But you
I will find my niche in your car
With my mp3 DVD rumble-packed guitar
I don't see what anyone can see in anyone else
But you
Du-du-du-du-du-du-dudu
Du-du-du-du-du du dudu
Du-du-du-du-du-du-dudu-du
Up-up, down-down, left-right, left-right, B-A, start
Just because we use cheats doesn't mean we're not smart
I don't see what anyone can see in anyone else
But you
You are always trying to keep it real
I'm in love with how you feel
I don't see what anyone can see in anyone else
But you
We both have shiny happy fits of rage
You want more fans, I want more stage
I don't see what anyone can see in anyone else
But you
Don Quixote was a steel-driving man
My name is Adam, I'm your biggest fan
I don't see what anyone can see in anyone else
But you
Squinched up your face and did a dance
You shook a little turd out of the bottom of your pants
I don't see what anyone can see in anyone else
But you
Du-du-du-du-du-du-dudu
Du-du-du-du-du-du-dudu
Du-du-du-du-du-du-dudu-du
But you
This is the way you left me
I'm not pretending
No hope, no love, no glory
No happy ending
This is the way that we love
Like it's forever
Then live the rest of our life
But not together
Wake up in the morning, stumble on my life
Can't get no love without sacrifice
If anything should happen, I guess I wish you well
A little bit of heaven but a little bit of hell
This is the hardest story that I've ever told
No hope or love or glory
Happy ending's gone forever more
I feel as if I'm wastin'
And I'm wastin' everyday
This is the way you left me
I'm not pretending
No hope, no love, no glory
No happy ending
This is the way that we love
Like it's forever
Then live the rest of our life
But not together
Two o'clock in the morning, something's on my mind
Can't get no rest, keep walkin' around
If I pretend that nothin' ever went wrong
I can get to my sleep, I can think that we just carried on
This is the hardest story that I've ever told
No hope or love or glory
Happy ending's gone forever more
I feel as if I'm wastin'
And I'm wastin' everyday
This is the way you left me (Oh, I feel as if I'm wastin')
I'm not pretending
No hope, no love, no glory
No happy ending
This is the way that we love (And I'm wastin' everyday)
Like it's forever
Then live the rest of our life
But not together
Little bit of love
Little bit of love
(Little bit of love, little bit of love, little bit of love, little bit of love)
(Little bit of love, little bit of love, little bit of love, little bit of love)
Little bit of love
(Little bit of love, little bit of love, little bit of love, little bit of love)
Little bit of love
(Little bit of love, little bit of love, little bit of love, little bit of love)
Little bit of love, little bit of love, little bit of love, little bit of love
(Little bit of love, little bit of love, little bit of love, little bit of love)
Little bit of love, love, I feel as if I'm wastin'
(Little bit of love, little bit of love, little bit of love, little bit of love)
And I'm wastin' everyday, hey, hey, hey
(Little bit of love, little bit of love, little bit of love, little bit of love...)
This is the way you left me
I'm not pretending
No hope, no love, no glory
No happy ending
This is the way that we love
Like it's forever
To live the rest of our life
But not together
This is the way you left me
I'm not pretending
No hope, no love, no glory
No happy ending
This is the way that we love
Like it's forever
To live the rest of our life
But not together
This is the way you left me
I'm not pretending
No hope, no love, no glory
No happy ending

You're always wearing Dodger blue
Mad doggin' me and
Anyone from any other crew
I am small, but I am strong

Everyone would take a cue
From anything you do

This time of night's for singin'
Songs about the local news
Cabron, cabron

Get down have a barbecue
Let's keep the moon awake
And do electric boogaloo
I am small, but I am strong
You see I'm just like you
If you only knew
That I'm just like you
All the world would
Take a cue from anything you do
If you only knew
That they're just like you
I don't want to fight
I want to get along with you
This time of night's for singin'

You're a falling star
You're the getaway car
You're the line in the sand
When I go too far
You're the swimming pool
On an August day
And you're the perfect thing to say
And you play it coy
But it's kinda cute
Oh when you smile at me
You know exactly what you do
Baby don't pretend
That you don't know it's true
'Cause you can see it
When I look at you
And in this crazy life
And through these crazy times
It's you, it's you
You make me sing
You're every line
You're every word
You're everything
You're a carousel
You're a wishing well
And you light me up
When you ring my bell
You're a mystery
You're from outer space
You're every minute of my every day
And I can't believe
That I'm your man
And I get to kiss you baby
Just because I can
Whatever comes our way
We'll see it through
And you know
That's what our love can do
And in this crazy life
And through these crazy times
It's you, it's you
You make me sing
You're every line
You're every word
You're everything
And so la la la la, la la la
So la la la la, la la la
And in this crazy life
And through these crazy times
It's you, it's you
You make me sing

You're everything
You're every song
And I sing along
'Cause you're my everything
Yeah, yeah
So la la la la, la la la
So la la la la, la la-la-la
La la la
Watching me like you never watched no one
Don't tell me that you didn't try to check out my bum
'Cause I know that you did 'cause your friend told me that you liked it
Gave me those pearls and I thought they were ugly
Don't you try to tell me that you never loved me
I know that you did 'cause you said it and you wrote it down
Dancing at discos
Eating cheese on toast
Yeah, you make me merry
Make me very very happy
But you, obviously, you didn't want to stick around
Dancing at discos
Eating cheese on toast
Yeah, you make me merry

Sitting in restaurants

But I know now that we were not the people that we turned out to be
Chatting on the phone
Can't take back those hours
But I won't regret 'cause you can grow flowers
From where dirt used to be
Dancing at discos

Aha, shake
Taper jean girl with a motel face
Aha, shake
Bury your eyes in a secret place
Aha, shake
Black as night on a summer day
Cunts watch their bodies
No room for make up
I think he's tasted
Tasted the watcher
Heartbreak
Knockin' 'em down like the seventh grade
Heartbreak
Cigarettes and songs with a winter's chafe
Heartbreak
Keep like my daughter and a run away
Cunts watch their bodies
No room for make up
I think he's tasted
Tasted the watcher
Aha, shake
Tapered jean girl kills me
Cunts watch their bodies
No room for make up
I think he's tasted
Tasted the watcher

But it's gonna take money
A whole lotta spending money
It's gonna take plenty of money
To do it right, child

When I wake up in the morning, love
And the sunlight hurts my eyes
And something without warning, love
Bears heavy on my mind
Then I look at you
And the world's alright with me
Just one look at you
And I know it's gonna be
A lovely day
(Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day)
(Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day)
A lovely day
(Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day)
(Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day)
When the day that lies ahead of me
Seems impossible to face
When someone else instead of me
Always seems to know the way
Then I look at you
And the world's alright with me
Just one look at you
And I know it's gonna be
A lovely day
(Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day)
(Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day)
A lovely day
(Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day)

And the world's alright with me
Ah, just one look at you

Good morning
Good morning
Good morning
Good morning
Good morning
Nothing to do to save his life, call his wife in
Nothing to say but "What a day, how's your boy been?"
Nothing to do, it's up to you
I've got nothing to say but "It's okay"
Good morning
Good morning 
Good morning
Going to work, don't want to go, feeling low down
Heading for home, you start to roam, then you're in town
Everybody knows there's nothing doing
Everything is closed, it's like a ruin
Everyone you see is half asleep
And you're on your own, you're in the street
After a while you start to smile, now you feel cool
Then you decide to take a walk by the old school
Nothing has changed, it's still the same
I've got nothing to say but "It's okay"
Good morning
Good morning
Good morning
People running 'round, it's five o'clock
Everywhere in town is getting dark
Everyone you see is full of life
It's time for tea and Meet the Wife
Somebody needs to know the time, glad that I'm here
Watching the skirts you start to flirt, now you're in gear
Go to a show, you hope she goes
I've got nothing to say but "It's okay"
Good morning, good morning, good
Good morning, good morning, good
Good morning, good morning, good
Good morning, good morning, good
Guten morgen, guten morgen, gut
Guten morgen, guten morgen, gut
Guten morgen, guten morgen, gut
Guten morgen, guten morgen, gut
(Ja, Ja)
Guten morgen, guten morgen, gut (Ja)
Guten morgen, guten morgen, gut
Gewozei teuer
Guten morgen, guten morgen, good morning (Hey)
Was it you who spoke the words that things would happen but not to me
Oh things are gonna happen naturally
Oh taking your advice and I'm looking on the bright side
And balancing the whole thing
Oh but at often times those words get tangled up in lines
And the bright light turns to night
Oh until the dawn it brings
Another day to sing about the magic that was you and me
'Cause you and I both loved
What you and I spoke of
And others just read of
Others only read of the love
Oh the love that I love
La la la la
See I'm all about them words
Over numbers, unencumbered numbered words
Hundreds of pages, pages, pages for words
More words than I had ever heard
And I feel so alive
'Cause you and I both loved
What you and I spoke of
And others just read of
And if you could see me now
Oh love, love
You and I you and I
Not so little you and I any more
And with this silence brings a moral story
More importantly evolving
Is the glory of a boy
'Cause you and I both loved
What you and I spoke of
And others just read of
And if you could see me now
Well then I'm almost finally out of
I'm finally out of
Finally de de de de de de de,
Well I'm almost finally, finally,
Well I am free, oh, I'm free
And it's okay
If you had to go away
Oh just remember the telephones
Well they work in both ways
(Additional lyrics from live version:
And the more you follow through,
There's always more left over,
And not too much explaining to do.
And if ever you find your love,
I will be your lifeline,
I will never miss your phonecall)
But if I never, ever hear them ring
If nothing else
I'll think the bells inside have finally found you someone else
And that's okay
'Cause I'll remember everything you sang
'Cause you and I both loved
What you and I spoke of
And others just read of
And if you could see me now
Well then I'm almost finally out of
I'm finally out of, finally de de de de de de de de,
Well I'm almost finally, finally,
Out of words.
You're chatting to me, like we connect 
But I don't even know if we're still friends 
It's so confusing
Understanding you is making me not want to do 
The things that I know I should do 
But I trip fast and then I lose 
And I hate looking like a fool 
I just want your kiss, boy (kiss boy, kiss boy)
I just want your kiss 
I just want your kiss, boy (kiss boy, kiss boy)
I just want your kiss 
The lights are on 
And someone's home 
But I'm not sure if they're alone  
There's someone else inside my head
Living there to fill me with dread
This paranoia is distressing 
And I spend most of my night guessing 
Are we not, are we together? 
Will this make our lives much better? 
I'm not in love
I just wanna be touched 
I just want your kiss, boy (kiss boy, kiss boy)
I just want your kiss 
I just want your kiss, boy (kiss boy, kiss boy)
I just want your kiss
Whoops, I think I've got too close
'Cause now he's telling me I'm the girl that he likes most
Now I messed up it's not the first time
I'm not saying you're not on my mind
I hope that you don't think I'm unkind
I just want your kiss, boy (kiss boy, kiss boy)
I just want your kiss
I just want your kiss, boy (kiss boy, kiss boy)
I just want your kiss
I just want your kiss, boy (kiss boy, kiss boy)
I just want your kiss
I'm feeling sexy and free
Like glitter's raining on me
You're like a shot of pure gold
I think I'm 'bout to explode
I can taste the tension like a cloud of smoke in the air
Now I'm breathing like I'm running, 'cause you're taking me there
Don't you know... you spin me out of control?
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
We can do this all night
Damn, this love is skin tight
Baby, come on!
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Booming like a bass drum
Sparking up a rhythm
Baby, come on!
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Rock my world until the sunlight
Make this dream the best I've ever known
Dirty dancing in the moonlight
Take me down like I'm a domino
Every second is a highlight
When we touch, don't ever let me go
Dirty dancing in the moonlight
Take me down like I'm a domino
You got me losing my mind
My heart beats out of time
I'm seeing Hollywood stars
You strum me like a guitar
I can taste the tension like a cloud of smoke in the air
Now I'm breathing like I'm running, 'cause you're taking me there
Don't you know... you spin me out of control?
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
We can do this all night
Damn, this love is skin tight
Baby, come on!
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Booming like a bass drum
Sparking up a rhythm
Baby, come on!
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Rock my world until the sunlight
Make this dream the best I've ever known
Dirty dancing in the moonlight
Take me down like I'm a domino
Every second is a highlight
When we touch, don't ever let me go
Dirty dancing in the moonlight
Take me down like I'm a domino
Ooh baby, baby, got me feeling so right
Ooh baby, baby, dancing in the moonlight
Ooh baby, baby, got me feeling so right
Ooh baby, baby, dancing in the moonlight
Ooh baby, baby, got me feeling so right
Ooh baby, baby, dancing in the moonlight
Ooh baby, baby, got me feeling so right
Ooh baby, baby
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Rock my world until the sunlight
Make this dream the best I've ever known
Dirty dancing in the moonlight
Take me down like I'm a domino
Every second is a highlight
When we touch, don't ever let me go
Dirty dancing in the moonlight
Take me down like I'm a domino
I tried to do handstands for you
I tried to do headstands for you
Every time I fell on you yeah every time I fell
I tried to do handstands for you
But every time I fell for you
I'm permanently black and blue, permanently blue
For you
I tried to do handstands for you
I tried to do headstands for you
Every time I fell on you yeah every time I fell
I tried to do handstands for you but every time I fell for you
I'm permanently black and blue, permanently blue
For you, ooh
For you, ooh
So black and blue, ooh
For you, ooh
I grabbed some frozen strawberries so I could ice your bruising knees
But frozen things they all unfreeze and now I taste like
All those frozen strawberries I used to chill your bruising knees
Hot July ain't good to me
I'm pink and black and blue
(For you)
I got bruises on my knees for you
And grass stains on my knees for you
Got holes in my new jeans for you
Got pink and black and blue
Got bruises on my knees for you
And grass stains on my knees for you
Got holes in my new jeans for you
Got pink and black and blue
For you, ooh
For you, ooh
So black and blue, ooh

Do-doo-do-do-do
Do-doo-do-do-do
Do-doo-do-do-do
Do-doo-do-do-do
Do-doo-do-do-do
Ow
Mm, yeah
I used to think maybe you loved me, now, baby, I'm sure
And I just can't wait till the day when you knock on my door
Now every time I go for the mailbox, gotta hold myself down
'Cause I just can't wait till you write me you're coming around
Now I'm walking on sunshine, whoa
I'm walking on sunshine, whoa
I'm walking on sunshine, whoa
And don't it feel good
Hey, all right now
And don't it feel good
Hey, yeah
I used to think maybe you loved me, now I know that it's true
And I don't want to spend my whole life just a-waiting for you
Now, I don't want you back for the weekend, not back for a day, no, no, no
I said, baby, I just want you back, and I want you to stay
Oh, yeah, now I'm walking on sunshine, whoa
I'm walking on sunshine, whoa
I'm walking on sunshine, whoa
And don't it feel good
Hey, all right now
And don't it feel good
Yeah, oh, yeah, now
And don't it feel good
Walking on sunshine
Walking on sunshine
I feel alive, I feel the love, I feel the love that's really real
I feel alive, I feel the love, I feel the love that's really real
I'm on sunshine, baby, oh
Oh, yeah, I'm on sunshine, baby 
Oh, I'm walking on sunshine, whoa
I'm walking on sunshine, whoa
I'm walking on sunshine, whoa
And don't it feel good
Hey, all right now
And don't it feel good
I'll say it, I'll say it, I'll say it again now
And don't it feel good
Hey, yeah now
And don't it feel good
Now don't it, don't it, don't it, don't it, don't it, don't it
And don't it feel good
I'll say it, I'll say it, I'll say it again now

And don't it feel good
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah
And don't it feel good
Just last night I woke from some unconscionable dream
And had it nailed to my forehead again
To keep this boat afloat, there are things you can't afford to know
So I save all my breath for the sails
But you'll find those lingering voices
Are just your ego's attempt to make it all clean and nice and make a moron out of you
Walking a bridge on weakening cables
Huddled up in fear and hate because we know our fate and it's a lot to put us through
Most ideas turn to dust, as there are few in which we all can trust
Haven't you noticed I've been shedding all of mine?
So let's abandon that track and leave our fathers fighting in a sack
'Cause we're way too wise-assed for that
You might find some fools at your doorstep
Hustling the latest changes to the book that's the strangest in an attempt to multiply
Marionettes on weakening cables
Huddled up with fear and hate because they know their fate and it's a lot to put them through
We've taken on a climb
And it's long enough to put the best of us on our backs
Walking up a slide
And there are those we know who'd have us five miles off the track
You will find those lingering voices
Are just your ego's attempt to make it all clean and nice and make a moron out of you
Crossing a bridge on weakening cables
Huddled up with fear and hate because we know our fate and it's a lot to put us through
"Oh, don't you dare look back
Just keep your eyes on me"
I said, "You're holding back"
She said, "Shut up and dance with me"
This woman is my destiny
She said, "Ooh hoo
Shut up and dance with me"
We were victims of the night
The chemical, physical kryptonite
Helpless to the bass and the fading light
Oh, we were bound to get together
Bound to get together
She took my arm
I don't know how it happened
We took the floor, and she said
"Oh, don't you dare look back
Just keep your eyes on me"
I said, "You're holding back"
She said, "Shut up and dance with me"
This woman is my destiny
She said, "Ooh hoo
Shut up and dance with me"
A backless dress and some beat up sneaks
My discothèque Juliet, teenage dream
I felt it in my chest as she looked at me
I knew we were bound to be together
Bound to be together
She took my arm
I don't know how it happened
We took the floor, and she said
"Oh, don't you dare look back
Just keep your eyes on me"
I said, "You're holding back"
She said, "Shut up and dance with me"
This woman is my destiny
She said, "Ooh hoo
Shut up and dance with me"
Oh, c'mon girl!
Deep in her eyes
I think I see the future
I realize this is my last chance
She took my arm
I don't know how it happened
We took the floor, and she said
"Oh, don't you dare look back
Just keep your eyes on me"
I said, "You're holding back"
She said, "Shut up and dance with me"
This woman is my destiny
She said, "Ooh hoo
Shut up and dance"
"Don't you dare look back
Just keep your eyes on me"
I said, "You're holding back"
She said, "Shut up and dance with me"
This woman is my destiny
She said, "Ooh hoo
Shut up and dance with me"
Ooh hoo
Shut up and dance with me
Ooh hoo
Shut up and dance with me
Picture yourself in the living room
Your pipe and slippers set out for you
I know you think that it ain't too far
But I hear the call of a lifetime ring
Felt the need to get up for it
Oh you cut out the middleman
Get free from the middleman
You got no time for the messenger,
Got no regard for the thing that you don't understand,
You got no fear of the underdog,
That's why you will not survive!
I want to forget how conviction fits
But can I get out from under it?
Can I gut it out of me?
It can't all be wedding cake
It can't all be boiled away
I try but I can't let go of it
Can't let go of it,
Cause you don't talk to the water boy
And there's so much you could learn but you don't want to know,
You will not back up an inch ever,
That's why you will not survive,
The thing that I tell you now
It may not go over well
And it may not be photo-op
In the way that I spell it out
But you won't hear from the messenger,
Don't wanna know bout something that you don't understand,
You got no fear of the underdog,
That's why you will not survive!
I had a dream so big and loud 
I jumped so high I touched the clouds 
Wo-oah-oah-oah-oah-oh
(Wo-oah-oah-oah-oah-oh)
I stretched my hands out to the sky 
We danced with monsters through the night
Wo-oah-oah-oah-oah-oh
(Wo-oah-oah-oah-oah-oh)
I'm never gonna look back, whoa
Never gonna give it up, no
Please don't wake me now 
This is gonna be the best day of my life 
My life-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ife 
This is gonna be the best day of my life 
My life-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ife
I howled at the moon with friends 
And then the sun came crashing in 
Wo-oah-oah-oah-oah-oh
(Wo-oah-oah-oah-oah-oh)
But all the possibilities 
No limits just epiphanies 
Wo-oah-oah-oah-oah-oh
(Wo-oah-oah-oah-oah-oh)
I'm never gonna look back, whoa
Never gonna give it up, no
Just don't wake me now 
This is gonna be the best day of my life 
My life-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ife
This is gonna be the best day of my life 
My life-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ife 
I hear it calling outside my window 
I feel it in my soul (soul) 
The stars were burning so bright 
The sun was out 'til midnight 
I say we lose control (control) 
This is gonna be the best day of my life 
My life-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ife 
This is gonna be the best day of my life 
My life-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ife
This is gonna be, this is gonna be, this is gotta be 
The best day of my life
Everything is looking up, everybody up now
This is gonna be the best day of my life 
My life-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ife
Shut out, pimpled and angry
I quietly tied all my guts into knots
Gave up on trying to make 'em
I figured it'd take 'em too long to look up and besides
It was undeniably clear to me
I don't know why
When every other part of life seemed locked behind shutters
I knew the worthless dregs we've always been
Lucked out, found my favorite record
Lying in wait at the Birmingham Mall
The songs that I heard, the occasional book were the only fun I ever took
And I got on with making myself
The trick is just making yourself
But when they're parking their cars on your chest 
You've still got a view of the summer sky
To make it hurt twice when your restless body caves to its whims
And suddenly struggles to take flight
Three thousand miles northeast
I left all my friends at the morning bus stop shaking their heads
"What kind of life do you dream of? You're allergic to love!"
Yes, I know but I must say in my own defense
It's been undeniably dear to me, I don't know why
When every other part of life seemed locked behind shutters
I knew the worthless dregs we are, the selfless, loving saints we are
The melting, sliding dice we've always been
Let's go away for a while, you and I
To a strange and distant land
Where they speak no word of truth
But we don't understand anyway
Holiday, far away
To stay on a holiday
Far away, let's go today
In a heartbeat
Heartbeat, heartbeat
Don't bother to pack your bags or your map
We won't need them where we're goin'
We're goin' where the wind is blowin'
Not knowin' where we're gonna stay
Holiday, far away
To stay on a holiday
Far away, to stay
On a holiday, far away
Let's go today, in a heartbeat
Heartbeat, heartbeat
Heartbeat, heartbeat
We will write a postcard to our friends
And family in free verse
We will write a postcard to our friends
And family in free verse (On this road with Kerouac)
We will write a postcard to our friends (Sheltered in his bivouac)
And family in free verse (On this road with Kerouac)
Heartbeat, heartbeat
Let's go away for a while, you and I
To a strange and distant land
Where they speak no word of truth
But we don't understand anyway
Holiday, far away
To stay on a holiday
Far away, to stay
On a holi
Let's go away, let's go away (To stay, on a holiday, far away)
Let's go away, let's go away (To stay in a heartbeat)
The mama pajama rolled out of bed
And she ran to the police station
When the papa found out, he began to shout
And he started the investigation
It's against the law
It was against the law
What the mama saw
It was against the law
The mama looked down and spit on the ground
Every time my name gets mentioned
The papa said, oy if I get that boy
I'm gonna stick him in the house of detention
Well, I'm on my way
I don't know where I'm going, I'm on my way
I'm taking my time, but I don't know where
Goodbye to Rosie, the queen of Corona
See me and Julio down by the schoolyard
See me and Julio down by the schoolyard
In a couple of days they come and take me away
But the press let the story leak
And when the radical priest come to get me released
We was all on the cover of Newsweek
And I'm on my way, I don't know where I'm going
I'm on my way
I'm taking my time, but I don't know where
Goodbye to Rosie, the queen of Corona
See me and Julio down by the schoolyard
See me and Julio down by the schoolyard
See me and Julio down by the schoolyard
1969 Studio version 
I'm sticking with you
'Cause I'm made out of glue
Anything that you might do
I'm gonna do too
You held up a stage coach in the rain
And I'm doin' the same
Saw you hangin' from a tree
And I made believe it was me
Oh, I'm sticking with you
'Cause I'm made out of glue
Anything that you might do
I'm gonna do too
Moon people going to the stratosphere
Soldiers fighting with the Cong
But with you by my side I can do anything
When we swing
We hang past right and wrong
I'll do anything for you
Anything you want me to
I'll do anything for you
Oh, I'm sticking with you
1970 Studio version 
I'm sticking with you
'Cause I'm made out of glue
Anything that you might do
I'm gonna do too
You held up a stage coach in the rain
(In the rain)
And I'm doin' the same
(The same)
Saw you hangin' from a tree
(From a tree)
And I made believe it was me
(Was me)
Oh, I'm sticking with you
'Cause I'm made out of glue
Anything that you might do
I'm gonna do too
Moon people going to the stratosphere
Soldiers fighting with the Cong
But with you by my side I can do anything
When we swing
We hang past right and wrong
I'll do anything for you
Baby, anything you want me to
Oh, I'll do anything for you
Oh, I'm sticking with you
Weight is coming off, soaring high, Pleading you to stay, come alive
Say you mean it, seal it up, say you wanna try
Say you haven't had enough, say you wanna
Once you get the feeling it, wants you back for more
Says it's gonna heal it but, you won't make the call
One step back you're leaving it, now it's moving on
Why won't you believe in it, till it's gone
Fading out the light, softly say, Get it out my mind, any way
Say you mean it, seal it up, say you wanna try
Say you haven't had enough, say you wanna
Once you get the feeling it, wants you back for more
Says it's gonna heal it but, you won't make the call
One step back you're leaving it, now it's moving on
Why won't you believe in it, till it's gone
Once you get the feeling it, wants you back for more
Now it gets ethereal, feet ain't on the floor
One step back you're leaving it, jumping at the wall
Why won't you believe in it, till it's gone
You gave to me, all I know, I will stay here, I will not go
Well our mamas, they left us
And our daddies took a ride
And we walked out of the castle
And we held our head up high
Well we once were the jesters
In your kingdom by the sea
And now we're out to be the masters 
For to set our spirit free, set free
We want to feel ya (hey)
We don't mean to kill ya (hey)
We come back to heal ya, janglin soul
Edward and the Magnetic Zeros
Well your wartime is funny
Your guns don't bother me
I said we're out to prove the truth of
The man from Galilee
Well your laws are for dummies, yeah
Your institution's dead
I say we're out to blow the trumpet
To wake you all from bed, from bed
We want to feel ya (hey)
We don't mean to kill ya (hey)
We come back to heal ya, janglin soul
Edward and the Magnetic Zeros
We carry the mail
We carry it home
Yeah, we carry the mail now
We carry it home
Scare up your letters
Give us your tails
Blowing like whale now to 
Magnetic ears, wow
We want to feel ya (hey)
We don't mean to kill ya (hey)
We come back to heal ya, janglin soul
Edward and the Magnetic Zeros
If the trials at hand are really getting you down
We had a close call
I didn't even see it, then another one
I hardly believed it at all
What the writers say, it means shit to me now
Plants and animals
We're on a bender when it's 80 degrees
The end of December, what's going on?
Only for you and me
With a showing of hands, who's going back to the south?
We're hungry, next that I know
Been running a blender in a lightning storm
Disguised as a blessing, I'm sure
Knowing ahead, there comes a fork in the road
Pants have got to go
We're on an island on the fourth of July
Looks like the tide is going home
In time I'd find
A little way to your heart
Down to the general store for nothing specific
Gonna wash my bones in the Atlantic shore
Only for you and me
(Hello, hello, hello)
I'm wakin' up at the start of the end of the world
But it's feeling just like every other morning before
Now I wonder what my life is gonna mean if it's gone
The cars are moving like a half a mile an hour and I
Started staring at the passengers and waving goodbye
Can you tell me what was ever really special about me all this time?
But I believe the world is burning to the ground
Oh well, I guess we're gonna find out
Let's see how far we've come
Let's see how far we've come
Well I believe it all is coming to an end
Oh well, I guess we're gonna pretend
Let's see how far we've come
Let's see how far we've come
I think it turned ten o'clock but I don't really know
Then I can't remember caring for an hour or so
Started crying and I couldn't stop myself
I started running but there's nowhere to run to
I sat down on the street, took a look at myself
Said, "Where you going man, you know the world is headed for hell?"
Say your goodbyes if you've got someone you can say goodbye to
I believe the world is burning to the ground
Oh well, I guess we're gonna find out
Let's see how far we've come (right now)
Let's see how far we've come
Well I believe it all is coming to an end
Oh well, I guess we're gonna pretend
Let's see how far we've come (oh yeah)
Let's see how far we've come
It's gone, gone, baby it's all gone
There's no one on the corner and there's no one at home
Well it was cool, cool, it was just all cool
Now it's over for me and it's over for you
Well it's gone, gone, baby it's all gone
There's no one on the corner and there's no one at home
Well it was cool, cool, it was just all cool
Now it's over for me and it's over for you
I believe the world is burning to the ground
Oh well, I guess we're gonna find out
Let's see how far we've come (oh yeah)
Let's see how far we've come
Yeah well I believe it all is coming to an end
Oh well, I guess we're gonna pretend
Let's see how far we've come (oh yeah)
Let's see how far we've come
Let's see how far we've come
Let's see how far we've come
Let's see how far we've come
Let's see how far we've come
Let's see how far we've come
Let's see how far we've come
Let's see how far we've come
The lights go on
The lights go off
When things don't feel right
I lie down like a tired dog
Licking his wounds in the shade
When I feel alive
I try to imagine a careless life
A scenic world, where the sun sets are all
Breathtaking, breathtaking
Another sunny day, I met you up in the garden
You were digging plants, I dug you, beg your pardon
I took a photograph of you in the herbaceous border
It broke the heart of men and flowers and girls and trees
Another rainy day, we're trapped inside with a train set
Chocolate on the boil, steamy windows when we met
You've got the attic window looking out on the cathedral 
And on a Sunday evening bells ring out in the dusk 
Another day in June, we'll pick 11 for football (Pick 11 for football)
We're playing for our lives, the referee gives us fuck-all (Ref, you're giving us fuck-all)
I saw you in the corner of my eye on the sidelines
Your dark mascara bids me to historical deeds
Now everybody's gone, you pick me up for a long drive (Pick me up for a long drive)
We took the tourist route, the nights are light until midnight (Light until midnight)
We took the evening ferry over to the peninsula
We found the avenue of trees went up to the hill
That crazy avenue of trees, I'm living there still
There's something in my eye, a little midge, so beguiling
Sacrificed his life to bring us both eye to eye
I heard the Eskimos remove obstructions with tongues, dear
You missed my eye, I wonder why, I didn't complain
You missed my eye, I wonder why, please do it again
The lovin' is a mess, what happened to all of the feeling? (All of the feeling)
I thought it was for real, babies, rings, and fools kneeling (Babies, rings, and fools kneeling)
And words of pledging trust and lifetimes stretching forever
So what went wrong, it was a lie, it crumbled apart
Ghost figures of past, present, future haunting the heart
Á silfur á
Lýsir allan heiminn og augun blá
Skera stjörnuhiminn
Ég óska mér og loka nú augunum
Já, gerðu það, nú rætist það
Ó nei
Á stjörnuhraða
Inni í hjarta springur, flugvélarbrak
Ofan í jörðu syngur
Ég óska mér, og loka nú augunum
Já, gerðu það, lágfara dans
Allt gleymist í smá smá stund og rætist það
Opna augun
Ó nei
Minn besti vinur, hverju sem dynur
Ég kyngi tári og anda hári
Illum látum, í faðmi grátum
Þegar að við hittumst
Þegar að við kyssumst
Varirnar brenndu, höldumst í hendur
Ég sé þig vakinn
Ég sé þig nakinn
Inní mér syngur vitleysingur
Alltaf þið vaða, við hlaupum hraðar
Allt verður smærra, ég öskra hærra
Er erfiðara, í burtu fara
Minn besti vinur, hverju sem dynur
Illum látum, í faðmi grátum
Ég kyngi tári og anda hári
Þegar að við hittumst
Þegar að við kyssumst
Varirnar brenndu, höldumst í hendur
Ég sé þig vakinn
Ég sé þig nakinn
Inní mér syngur vitleysingur
If I was a flower growing wild and free
All I'd want is you to be my sweet honey bee.
And if I was a tree growing tall and greeen
All I'd want is you to shade me and be my leaves
If I was a flower growing wild and free
All I'd want is you to be my sweet honey bee.
And if I was a tree growing tall and green
All I'd want is you to shade me and be my leaves
All I want is you, will you be my bride
Take me by the hand and stand by my side
All I want is you, will you stay with me?
Hold me in your arms and sway me like the sea.
If you were a river in the mountains tall,
The rumble of your water would be my call.
If you were the winter, I know I'd be the snow
Just as long as you were with me, let the cold winds blow
All I want is you, will you be my bride
Take me by the hand and stand by my side
All I want is you, will you stay with me?
Hold me in your arms and sway me like the sea.
If you were a wink, I'd be a nod
If you were a seed, well I'd be a pod.
If you were the floor, I'd wanna be the rug
And if you were a kiss, I know I'd be a hug
All I want is you, will you be my bride
Take me by the hand and stand by my side
All I want is you, will you stay with me?
Hold me in your arms and sway me like the sea.
If you were the wood, I'd be the fire.
If you were the love, I'd be the desire.
If you were a castle, I'd be your moat,
And if you were an ocean, I'd learn to float.
All I want is you, will you be my bride
Take me by the hand and stand by my side
All I want is you, will you stay with me?
Hold me in your arms and sway me like the sea.
Spoken:
"I Dig a Pygmy", by Charles Hawtrey and the Deaf Aids
Phase One, in which Doris gets her oats
Two of us riding nowhere
Spending someone's hard-earned pay
You and me Sunday driving
Not arriving
On our way back home
We're on our way home
We're on our way home
We're going home
Two of us sending postcards
Writing letters on my wall
You and me burning matches
Lifting latches
On our way back home
We're on our way home
We're on our way home
We're going home
You and I have memories
Longer than the road
That stretches out ahead
Two of us wearing raincoats
Standing solo
In the sun
You and me chasing paper
Getting nowhere
On our way back home
We're on our way home
We're on our way home
We're going home
You and I have memories
Longer than the road
That stretches out ahead
Two of us wearing raincoats
Standing solo in the sun
You and me chasing paper
Getting nowhere
On our way back home
We're on our way home
We're on our way home
We're going home
Spoken:
We're going home
Better believe it
Goodbye
I've been down so low people look at me and they know
They can tell something is wrong
Like I don't belong
Well, staring through a window, standing outside they're just too happy to care
Tonight I wanna be like them but I'll mess it up again
I tripped on my way in, got kicked outside, everybody saw
And I know that it's a wonderful world
But I can't feel it right now
Well I thought that I was doing well but I just want to cry now
Well I know that it's a wonderful world from the sky down to the sea
But I can only see it when you're here, here with me
Sometimes I feel so full of love, it just comes spilling out
It's uncomfortable to see I give it away so easily
But if I had someone I would do anything and never, never, never let you feel alone
I won't, I won't leave you on your own
Who am I to dream? Dreams are for fools, they let you down
And I wish that I could make it better
I'd give anything for you to call me
Maybe just a little letter
Oh, it could start again
And I know that it's a wonderful world
I can't feel it right now
I've got all the right clothes to wear
I just want to cry now, cry now
Well I know that it's a wonderful world from the sky down to the sea
I can only see when you're here, here with me
And I know that it's a wonderful world
When you're with me
Junk of the heart, there's junk in my mind
So hard to leave you all alone
We'd get so drunk that we can hardly see
But what use is that to you or me, baby?
See I notice nothing makes you shatter, no, no
You're a lover of the wild and a joker of the heart
But are you mine?
I wanna make you happy
I wanna make you feel alive
Let me make you happy
I wanna make you feel alive at night
I wanna make you happy, are you a good girl tonight?
You seem to be sunk, life is no race
Well I'm not happy, I'm in disgrace
So I spend time guessing on you, oh
You're a lover of the wild and a joker of the heart
But are you mine?
I wanna make you happy
I wanna make you feel alive
Let me make you happy
I wanna make you feel alive at night
I wanna make you happy, are you a good girl tonight?
Still I notice nothing makes you shatter, no, no
You're a lover of the wild and a joker of the heart
And are you mine?
I wanna make you happy
I wanna make you feel alive
Let me make you happy
I wanna make you feel alive at night
I wanna make you happy, are you a good girl tonight?
She was a working girl
North of England way
(Now, she's hit the big time)
In the U.S.A.
And if she could only hear me
This is what I'd say
Honey pie
You are making me crazy
I'm in love, but I'm lazy
So won't you please come home?
Oh, honey pie
My position is tragic
Come and show me the magic
Of your Hollywood song
You became a legend
Of the silver screen
And now the thought of meeting you
Makes me weak in the knee
Oh, honey pie
You are driving me frantic
Sail across the Atlantic
To be where you belong
Honey pie, come back to me
Oo
Yeah
I like it like that (oo, ah)
I like this kind of, hot kind of music
Hot kind of music
Play it to me, play it to me
Hollywood blues
Will the wind that blew her boat across the sea
Kindly send her sailing back to me? t-t-tee
Now, honey pie
You are making me crazy
I'm in love, but I'm lazy
So won't you please come home?
Come, come back to me, honey pie, ha, ha, ha
Hoo-woo-doo ooh-ooh
Bo bo
Buh-huh-buh wa-ooh-uh bo bo
Honey pie, honey pie
Drinking in the morning sun
Blinking in the morning sun
Shaking off a heavy one
Heavy like a loaded gun
What made me behave that way?
Using words I never say
I can only think it must be love
Oh anyway, it's looking like a beautiful day
Someone tell me how I feel
It's silly wrong, but vivid right
Oh, kiss me like a final meal
Yeah, kiss me like we die tonight
'Cause holy cow, I love your eyes
And only now I see the light
Yeah, lying with you half awake
Oh, anyway, it's looking like a beautiful day
When my face is chamois creased
If you think I wink, I did
Laugh politely at repeats
Yeah, kiss me when my lips are thin
'Cause holy cow, I love your eyes
And only now I see the light
Yeah, lying with you half awake
Stumbling over what to say
Well, anyway, it's looking like a beautiful day
So throw those curtains wide
One day like this a year would see me right
Throw those curtains wide
One day like this a year would see me right
Throw those curtains wide
One day like this a year would see me right
Throw those curtains wide
One day like this a year would see me right for life
Throw those curtains wide ( 'Cause holy cow, I love your eyes)
One day like this a year would see me right (And only now I see the light)
Throw those curtains wide ( 'Cause holy cow, I love your eyes)
One day like this a year would see me right (And only now I see the light)
Throw those curtains wide
One day like this a year would see me right
Throw those curtains wide
One day like this a year would see me right
Throw those curtains wide
One day like this a year would see me right
Throw those curtains wide
One day like this a year would see me right
Throw those curtains wide
One day like this a year would see me right
Throw those curtains wide
One day like this a year would see me right
Throw those curtains wide
One day like this a year would see me right
Throw those curtains wide
One day like this a year would see me right
For once in my life
I have someone who needs me
Someone I've needed so long
For once unafraid
I can go where life leads me
Somehow I know I'll be strong
For once I can touch
What my heart used to dream of
Long before I knew
Oh, someone warm like you
Would make my dream come true, yeah, yeah, yeah (for once in my life)
For once in my life
I won't let sorrow hurt me
Not like it's hurt me before (not like it's hurt before)
For once I have something
I know won't desert me
I'm not alone anymore (I'm not alone anymore)
For once I can say
This is mine, you can't take it
As long as I know I have love I can make it
For once in my life
I have someone who needs me
(Someone who needs me) A-heh, heh, hey yeah
(Someone who needs me) Oh, I'm in love baby

For once in my life

(Someone who needs me) Whoa, for once in my life
(Someone who needs me) Hey, somebody that needs me
(Someone who needs me) Ooh baby, for once in my life

Hey, remember the time when I found a human tooth
Down on Delancey?
Hey, remember that time when we decided to kiss anywhere
Except the mouth?
Hey, remember that time when my favorite colors was
Pink and green?
Hey, remember that month when I only ate
Boxes of tangerines?
So cheap and juicy!
Tangerines.
Hey, remember that time when I would only read
Shakespeare?
Hey, remember that other time, when I would only read the backs of
Cereal boxes?
Hey remember that time I tried to save a pigeon with a broken wing?
A street cat got him by morning and I had to bury pieces of his body in our building's playground.
I thought I was going to be sick.
I thought I was going to be sick -
Hey, remember that time when I would only smoke
Parliaments?
Hey, remember that time when I would only smoke
Marlboros?
Hey, remember that time when I would only smoke
Camels?
Hey, remember that time when I was broke?
I didn't care, I just bummed from my friends.
Bum, bu-bum, bu-bum-bum
Bum, bu-bum, bu-bum-bum
Hey, remember that time when you OD'ed?
Hey, remember that other time when you OD'ed
For the second time?
Well, in the waiting room while waiting for news of you, 
I hallucinated I could read your mind.
And I was on a lot of shit too, but what I saw, man, I tell you, was
Freaky
Freaky
Are you gonna live your life wondering
Standing in the back, looking around?
Are you gonna waste your time thinking
How you've grown up or how you missed out?
T-t-t-t-t-things are never gonna be the way you want
Where's it gonna get you, acting serious?
T-t-t-t-t-things are never gonna be quite what you want
Even at 25, you gotta start sometime
I'm on my feet, I'm on the floor, I'm good to go
All I need is just to hear a song I know
I want to always feel like part of this was mine
I want to fall in love tonight
Are you gonna live your life
Standing in the back, looking around?
Are you gonna waste your time?
Gotta make a move or you'll miss out
S-s-s-s-someone's gonna ask you what it's all about
Stick around, nostalgia won't let you down
S-s-s-s-someone's gonna ask you what it's all about
Whatcha gonna have to say for yourself?
I'm on my feet, I'm on the floor, I'm good to go
Now all I need is just to hear a song I know
I want to always feel like part of this was mine
I want to fall in love tonight
Crimson and clover
Over and over
Crimson and clover
Over and over                       
Crimson and clover (Our house in the middle of the street, why did we ever meet?)
Over and over (Started my rock 'n' roll fantasy)
Crimson and clover (Don't, don't, don't let's start, why did we ever part?)
Over and over (Kickstart my rock 'n' roll heart)
I'm on my feet, I'm on the floor, I'm good to go
So come on, Davey, sing me something that I know
I want to always feel like part of this was mine
I want to fall in love tonight (Here tonight)
I want to fall in love tonight (Here tonight)
I want to always feel like part of this was mine
Want to fall in love tonight
Want to fall in love tonight
Want to fall in love tonight
She comes in colours everywhere
She combs her hair
She's like a rainbow
Coming, colours in the air
Everywhere
She comes in colours
She comes in colours everywhere
She combs her hair
She's like a rainbow
Coming, colours in the air
Oh, everywhere
She comes in colours
Have you seen her dressed in blue?
See the sky in front of you
And her face is like a sail
Speck of white, so fair and pale
Have you seen a lady fairer?
She comes in colours everywhere
She combs her hair
She's like a rainbow
Coming, colours in the air
Oh, everywhere
She comes in colours
Have you seen her all in gold?
Like a queen in days of old
She shoots colours all around
Like the sunset going down
Have you seen a lady fairer?
She comes in colours everywhere
She combs her hair
She's like a rainbow
Coming, colours in the air
Oh, everywhere
She comes in colours
She's like a rainbow
Coming, colours in the air
Oh, everywhere
She comes in colours
Say the word and you'll be free 
Say the word and be like me 
Say the word I'm thinking of 
Have you heard the word is love? 
It's so fine, it's sunshine
It's the word, love 
In the beginning I misunderstood 
But now I've got it
The word is good
Spread the word and you'll be free 
Spread the word and be like me
Spread the word I'm thinking of
Have you heard the word is love? 
It's so fine, it's sunshine
It's the word, love 
Everywhere I go I hear it said
In the good and the bad books that I have read
Say the word and you'll be free 
Say the word and be like me 
Say the word I'm thinking of 
Have you heard the word is love? 
It's so fine, it's sunshine
It's the word, love 
Now that I know what I feel must be right 
I'm here to show everybody the light 
Give the word a chance to say 
That the word is just the way 
It's the word I'm thinking of 
And the only word is love 
It's so fine, it's sunshine
It's the word, love
Say the word, love
Say the word, love
Say the word, love
Say the word
Love
I've just seen a face
I can't forget the time or place where we just met
She's just the girl for me
And I want all the world to see we've met
Had it been another day
I might have looked the other way
And I'd have never been aware
But as it is I'll dream of her tonight
Falling, yes, I am falling
And she keeps calling
Me back again
I have never known the like of this
I've been alone and I have missed things
And kept out of sight
But other girls were never quite like this
Falling, yes, I am falling
And she keeps calling
Me back again
Falling, yes, I am falling
And she keeps calling
Me back again
I've just seen a face
I can't forget the time or place where we just met
She's just the girl for me
And I want all the world to see we've met
Falling, yes, I am falling
And she keeps calling
Me back again
Falling, yes, I am falling
And she keeps calling
Me back again
Oh, falling, yes, I am falling
And she keeps calling
Me back again

'Cause every little thing gonna be all right
Singin', don't worry about a thing
'Cause every little thing gonna be all right 
Rise up this mornin'
Smile with the risin' sun
Three little birds
Pitch by my doorstep
Singin' sweet songs
Of melodies pure and true

Singin', don't worry 'bout a thing
'Cause every little thing gonna be all right
Singin', don't worry (don't worry) 'bout a thing

Wake up everyone
How can you sleep at a time like this
Unless the dreamer is the real you
Listen to your voice
The one that tells you to taste past the tip of your tongue
Leap and the net will appear
I don't wanna wake before
The dream is over
I'm gonna make it mine
Yes I... I know it
I'm gonna make it mine
Yes I'll make it all mine
I keep my life on a heavy rotation
Requesting that it's lifting you up
Up up and away
And over to a table at the gratitude cafe
And I am finally there
And all the angels they'll be singing
Ah la la la ah la la la I la la la la love this
Well I don't wanna break before
The tour is over
I'm gonna make it mine
Yes I... I'm alone and
I'm gonna make it mine
Yes I'll make it all mine
Timing's everything
And this time there's plenty
I am balancing
Careful and steady
And reveling in energy that everyone's emitting
Well I don't wanna wait no more
Oh I wanna celebrate the whole world
I'm gonna make it mine
Oh yes, I'm following your joy
I'm gonna make it mine
Because I... I am open
I'm gonna make it mine
That's right... I will show it
I'm gonna make it all mine
Gonna make, gonna make, gonna make, gonna make it, make it, make it mine
All mine
Yes I'll make it all mine
Lisa likes brandy and the way it hits her lips
She's a rock 'n' roll survivor with pendulum hips
She's got deep brown eyes
That've seen it all
Working at a nightclub that was called The Avenue
The bar men used to call her "Little Lisa, Looney Tunes"
She went down on almost anyone
From the hard time living till the Chelsea days
From when her hair was sweet blonde till the day it turned gray
She said:
L.I.F.E.G.O.E.S.O.N.
You've got more than money and sense, my friend
You've got heart, and you're going your own way
L.I.F.E.G.O.E.S.O.N.
What you don't have now will come back again
You've got heart, and you're going your own way
Some people wear their history like a map on their face
And Joey was an artist just living out a case
But his best work was his letters home
Extended works of fiction about imaginary success
The chorus girls in neon were his closest things to friends
But to a writer, the truth is no big deal
And from the hard time living to the sleepless nights
And the black and blue body from the weekend fights
He'd say
L.I.F.E.G.O.E.S.O.N.
You've got more than money and sense, my friend
You've got heart, and you're going your own way
L.I.F.E.G.O.E.S.O.N.
What you don't have now will come back again
You've got heart, and you're going your own way
On my last night on earth, I won't look to the sky
Just breathe in the air and blink in the light
On my last night on earth, I'll pay a high price
To have no regrets and be done with my life
L.I.F.E.G.O.E.S.O.N.
You've got more than money and sense, my friend
You've got heart, and you're going your own way
L.I.F.E.G.O.E.S.O.N.
What you don't have now will come back again
You've got heart, and you're going your own way
L.I.F.E.G.O.E.S.O.N.
You've got more than money and sense, my friend
You've got heart, and you're going your own way
L.I.F.E.G.O.E.S.O.N.
What you don't have now will come back again
You've got heart, and you're going your own way

Now when the sun come up
I'll be there to say what up
In the morning brush my teeth
Find that clip I been lookin'
For since last night
I feel so caught up in a bud
I flow some round in my bedroom turn around see myself in the mirror
I guess I'm cool and
Those happy thoughts in my head I'm feeling like I'm Peter Pan minus the tights and the fairies
Happy to see how far I've come to the same place it began my dreams and imagination
Perfectly at peace so I move along a bit higher
I'll be up up and away
Up up and away
'Cause they gon' judge me anyway so whatever
I'll be up up and away
Up up and away
Cause in the end they'll judge me any so whatever
I learn, I see the dreams are made so I'm cooler now

And my little niece Zuri so
Sing along lil' mama you ain't gotta worry 'bout no drama no I'll provide for friends and fam and fans
Cleveland city grinding man stay afloat the kids hope

The end is never the end
A new challenge awaits
A test no man could be prepared for
A new hell he must conquer and destroy
A new level of growth he must confront himself
The machine in the ghost within
This is the journey of the man on the moon
Talking to the songbird yesterday
Flew me to a place not far away
She's a little pilot in my mind
Singing songs of love to pass the time
Gonna write a song so she can see
Give her all the love she gives to me
Talk of better days that have yet to come
I never felt this love from anyone
She's not anyone
She's not anyone
She's not anyone
A man can never dream these kind of things
Especially when she came and spread her wings
Whispered in my ear the things I'd like
Then she flew away into the night
Gonna write a song so she can see
Give her all the love she gives to me
Talk of better days that have yet to come
Never felt this love from anyone
She's not anyone
She's not anyone
She's not anyone
Da dadada da da dadada
Da dadada da da dadada
Da dadada da da dadada
Da dadada da da dadada
San Francisco Bay, past pier thirty-nine
Early PM can't remember what time
Got the waiting cab, stopped at the red light
Address unsure of, but it turned out just right
It started straight off, "Coming here is hell"
That's his first words, we asked what it meant
He said "Where you from?" we told him our lot
Ya' take a holiday, is this what you want...
To have a nice day
Lie around all day have a drink to chase
"Yourself and tourists, yeah that's what I hate"
He said "We're going wrong, we've all become the same
We dress the same ways only our accents change"
So have a nice day
Da dadada da da dadada
Da dadada da da dadada
"Swim in the ocean that'd be my dish
I'll drive around all day and kill processed fish
It's all money gum, no artists anymore
Your only in it now to make more, more, more"
So have a nice day
I stay out too late
Got nothin' in my brain
That's what people say, mmh-hmm
That's what people say, mmh-hmm
I go on too many dates (heh-heh)
But I can't make 'em stay
At least that's what people say, mmh-hmm
That's what people say, mmh-hmm
But I keep cruisin'
Can't stop, won't stop movin'
It's like I got this music
In my mind sayin', "it's gonna be all right"
'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off (whoo)
Heartbreakers gonna break, break, break, break, break
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off (whoo)
I never miss a beat, ah
I'm lightnin' on my feet
And that's what they don't see, mmh-hmm
That's what they don't see, mmh-hmm
I'm dancin' on my own (dancin' on my own)
I'll make the moves up as I go (moves up as I go)
And that's what they don't know, mmh-hmm
That's what they don't know, mmh-hmm
But I keep cruisin'
Can't stop, won't stop groovin'
It's like I got this music
In my mind sayin', "it's gonna be all right"
'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off (whoo)
Heartbreakers gonna break, break, break, break, break
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off (whoo)
I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off (whoo)
Hey, hey, hey
Just think while you've been getting down and out about the liars and the dirty, dirty cheats of the world
You could've been getting down to this sick beat
My ex-man brought his new girlfriend
She's like, "Oh my God"
But I'm just gonna shake
And to the fella over there
With the hella good hair
Won't you come on over, baby
We can shake, shake, shake
Yeah, oh
'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate (haters gonna hate)
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off (whoo)
Heartbreakers gonna break, break, break, break, break (mmm)
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake (they fake, they fake, they fake)
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off (whoo)
I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off (whoo)
I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off (you got to)
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off (whoo)
Here's a little song I wrote
You might want to sing it note for note
Don't worry, be happy
In every life we have some trouble
But when you worry, you make it double
Don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, be happy now
Ooh-ooh-hoo-hoo-ooh hoo-hoo-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Don't worry
Woo-ooh-woo-ooh-woo-ooh-ooh
Be happy
Woo-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Don't worry, be happy
Ooh-ooh-hoo-hoo-ooh hoo-hoo-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Don't worry
Woo-ooh-woo-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Be happy
Woo-ooh-woo-ooh-ooh
Don't worry, be happy
Ain't got no place to lay your head
Somebody came and took your bed
Don't worry, be happy
The landlord say your rent is late
He may have to litigate
Don't worry (Ha-ha ha-ha ha-ha) 
Be happy (Look at me, I'm happy)
Ooh-ooh-hoo-hoo-ooh ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Don't worry
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Be happy
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
(Here, I'll give you my phone number
When you're worried, call me
I'll make you happy)
Ooo-ooh-hoo-hoo-ooh ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Don't worry
Woo-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Be happy
Woo-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ain't got no cash, ain't got no style
Ain't got no gal to make you smile
But don't worry, be happy
'Cause when you're worried, your face will frown
And that will bring everybody down
So don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, be happy now
Ooh-ooh-hoo-ooh-ooh ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Don't worry
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Be happy
Woo-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Don't worry, be happy
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Don't worry
Woo-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Be happy
Woo-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Don't worry, be happy
Now there, is this song I wrote
I hope you learned it note-for-note, like good little children
Don't worry, be happy
A-listen to a-what I say
In your life, expect some trouble
When you worry you make it double
Don't worry, be happy, be happy now
Ooo-oo-hoo-hoo-ooh ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Don't worry
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Be happy
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Don't worry, be happy
Ooh-ooh-hoo-ooh-ooh ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Don't worry
Woo-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Be happy
Woo-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Don't worry, be happy
Ooh-ooh-hoo-ooh-ooh ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Don't worry, don't worry
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Don't do it, be happy
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Put a smile on your face
Don't bring everybody down like this
Ooh-ooh-hoo-hoo-ooh ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Don't worry
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
It will soon pass, whatever it is
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Don't worry, be happy
Ooh-ooh-hoo-hoo-ooh ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I'm not worried
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I'm happy
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
(Stacy's mom has got it going on)
(Stacy's mom has got it going on)
(Stacy's mom has got it going on)
(Stacy's mom has got it going on)
Stacy can I come over after school, ooh-hoo ooh-hoo? (after school)
We can hang around by the p-p-p-pool, ooh-hoo ooh-hoo (hang by the pool)
Did your mom get back from her business trip? (business trip)
Is she there, or is she trying to give me the slip, eh-he, eh-he? (give me the slip)
You know I'm not the little boy that I used to be
I'm all grown-up now, baby, can't you see?
Stacy's mom has got it going on
She's all I want and I've waited for so long
Stacy, can't you see?
You're just not the girl for me
I know it might be wrong
But I'm in love with Stacy's mom
(Stacy's mom has got it going on)
(Stacy's mom has got it going on)
Stacy, do you remember when I mowed your lawn? (mowed your lawn)
Your mom came out with just a towel on, oh-ho oh-hon (towel on)
I could tell she liked me from the way she stared (way she stared)
And the way she said, "You missed a spot over there", eh-here eh-here (spot over there)
And I know that you think it's just a fantasy
But since your dad walked out, your mom could use a guy like me
Stacy's mom has got it going on
She's all I want and I've waited for so long
Stacy, can't you see?
You're just not the girl for me
I know it might be wrong
But I'm in love with Stacy's mom
Stacy's mom has got it going on (she's got it going on)
She's all I want and I've waited for so long (waited and waited)
Stacy, can't you see?
You're just not the girl for me
I know it might be wrong
But I'm in love with (Stacy's mom, oh-ho oh-ho)
(I'm in love with) (Stacy's mom, oh-ho oh-ho)
(Wait a minute) Stacy, can't you see?
You're just not the girl for me
I know it might be wrong
But I'm in love with Stacy's mom
From all the drugs the one I like more is music
From all the junks the one I need more is music
From all the boys the one I take home is music
From all the ladies the one I kiss is music
Music is my boyfriend
Music is my girlfriend
Music is my dead end
Music is my imaginary friend
Music is my brother
Music is my great-grand-daughter
Music is my sister
Music is my favorite mistress
From all the shit the one I gotta buy is music
From all the jobs the one I choose is music
From all the drinks I get drunk off music
From all the bitches the one I wanna be is music
Music is my beach house
Music is my hometown
Music is my kingsize bed
Music is where I meet my friends
Music is my hot hot bath
Music is my hot hot sex
Music is my back rub
My music is where I'd like you to touch
Claro que sim, fui escoteira mirim
Direto da escola, não, não ia cheirar cola
Nem basquete, pebolim
O que eu gosto não é de graça, o que gosto não é farsa
Tem guitarra, bateria, computador saindo som
Alguns dizem que mais alto que um furacão (rhéum)
Perto dele eu podia sentir, saía de seu olho e chegava em mim
Sentada do seu lado eu queria encostar
Faria o tigela até o sol raiar
Debaixo do lençol ele gemia em ré bemol
Fiquei tensa, mas tava tudo bem
Ele é fodão, mas eu sei que eu sou também
Ele é fodão, mas eu sei que eu sou também
Ele é fodão, mas eu sei que eu sou também
Ele é fodão, mas eu sei que eu sou também
I used to see you every day
I used to see you every day
I danced around your folk and soul
I danced to all your fucking soul
I left you with your nose a bleedin'
And your toes creepin' around
Ah, so mundane and incomplete
Hand me down my pants and get me off this street
I'm passed out in your garden
I'm in, I can't get off
So soft
I'd pop myself in your body
I'd come into your party
But I'm soft
Behind the fringe of a whiskey high
Mutilating cat like eyes
And in your nose, blood decadence
You try to drag me into your bohemian dancing
You paint my fingers and you paint my toes
You let your perfect nipple show
I'm passed out in your garden
I'm in, I can't get off
So soft
I'd pop myself in your body
I'd come into your party
But I'm soft
But I'm soft
I'm passed out in your garden
I'm in, I can't get off, I'm so soft
I'd pop myself in your body
I'd come all over your party, but I'm soft
I should have known better with a girl like you
That I would love everything that you do
And I do, hey hey hey, and I do
Whoa, whoa, I never realised what a kiss could be
This could only happen to me
Can't you see, can't you see?
That when I tell you that I love you, oh
You're gonna say you love me too, oh
And when I ask you to be mine
You're gonna say you love me too
So I should have realised a lot of things before
If this is love you gotta give me more
Give me more, hey hey hey, give me more
Whoa, whoa, I never realised what a kiss could be
This could only happen to me
Can't you see, can't you see?
That when I tell you that I love you, oh
You're gonna say you love me too, oh
And when I ask you to be mine
You're gonna say you love me too
You love me too
You love me too
You love me too
It's all a game of this or that, now versus them
They're better off against worse for wear
And you're someone who knows someone
Who knows someone I once knew
And I just want to be a part of this
The road outside my house is paved with good intentions
Hired a construction crew 'cause it's hell on the engine
And you are the dreamer, and we are the dream
I could write it better than you ever felt it
So hum hallelujah, just off the key of reason
I thought I loved you, and it's just how you looked in the light
A teenage vow in a parking lot, till tonight do us part
I sing the blues and you swallow them too
My words are my faith, to hell with our good name
We mix up your guts, your insides x-rayed
And one day we'll get nostalgic for disaster
We're a bull, your ears are just a china shop
I love you in the same way, there's chapel in a hospital
One foot in your bedroom, and one foot out the door
Sometimes we take chances, sometimes we take pills
I could write it better than you ever felt it
So hum hallelujah, just off the key of reason
I thought I loved you, and it's just how you looked in the light
A teenage vow in a parking lot, till tonight do us part
I sing the blues and you swallow them too
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelu
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelu
(Hum hallelujah, hum hallelujah)
A teenage vow in a parking lot, till tonight do us part
I sing the blues and swallow them too
So hum hallelujah, just off the key of reason
I thought I loved you, and it's just how you looked in the light
A teenage vow in a parking lot, till tonight do us part
A teenage vow in a parking lot, till tonight do us part
A teenage vow in a parking lot, till tonight do us part
I sing the blues and you swallow them too
I heard it from a friend
The Revolution never happened
Sigh
A little die
No more a child
Goodbye
Now where's the woolen sweater
You mentioned in the letter?
Imply
The other guy
And scandalize the lion
A clean shave in the morning
And a full beard with no warning
Time has gotten by on alibis and wine
Success is so forbidding
But it makes me think I'm winning
Quiet
Dim the lights
Adopt another lifestyle
Come come come on
Come come come on
Come come come on
Come come come on
Come come come on
Come come come on
Come come come
Over and over again
You look like David Bowie
But you've nothing new to show me
Start another fire
And watch it slowly die
Let's all get up and dance to a song
That was a hit before your mother was born
Though she was born a long, long time ago
Your mother should know (your mother should)
Your mother should know (know)
Sing it again
Let's all get up and dance to a song
That was a hit before your mother was born
Though she was born a long, long time ago
Your mother should know (your mother should)
Your mother should know (know)
Lift up your hearts and sing me a song
That was a hit before your mother was born
Though she was born a long, long time ago
Your mother should know (your mother should)
Your mother should know (kno-ow)
Your mother should know (your mother should)
Your mother should know (kno-ow)
Sing it again
Daa-da da-daa da-daa-daa-da-da
Da-daa-da daa da-daa daa daa-da-da-daa
Though she was born a long, long time ago
Your mother should know (your mother should)
Your mother should know (yeah)
Your mother should know (your mother should)
Your mother should know (yeah)
Your mother should know (your mother should)
Your mother should know (yeah)
The sun is up, I'm so happy I could scream
And there's nowhere else in the world I'd rather be
Than here with you, it's perfect
It's all I ever wanted
Oh, I almost can't believe that it's for real
So pinch me quick
I really don't think it gets any better than this
Vanilla smile and a gorgeous strawberry kiss
Birds sing, we swing
Clouds drift by and everything is like a dream
It's everything I wished
Never guessed it got this good
Wondered if it ever would
Really didn't think it could
Do it again, I know we should
The sun is up, I'm so fizzy I could burst
Yeah, you wet through and me headfirst
Into this is perfect
It's all I ever wanted
Oh, it feels so big it almost hurts
Never guessed it got this good
Wondered if it ever would
Really didn't think it could
Do it some more, I know we should
Say it will always be like this
The two of us together
It will always be like this
Forever and ever and ever and ever and ever ever ever ever ever ever
Never guessed it got this good
Wondered if it ever would
Really didn't think it could
Do it all the time, I know that we should
Big girl, you are beautiful

All the girls I've known are crying (oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
All the clouds have silver linings (oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
Though the days are counting backwards (oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
I know that you have the right words (oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
Me and you over something to do
Could this be true, it all comes down to you
Hey you, when I hold you in my arms
We'll be starting what you're searching for
Hey you, put your lips up close
Feel the love and to your arms I fall
All the girls I've known are crying (oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)

There was a game we used to play
We would hit the town on Friday night
Stay in bed until Sunday
We used to be so free
We were living for the love we had
Living not for reality
Just my imagination (My imagination)
Just my imagination (My imagination)
Just my imagination
It was
Just my imagination (My imagination)
Just my imagination (My imagination)
Just my imagination
It was
That was the time I used to pray
I have always kept my faith in love
It's the greatest thing from the man above
The game I used to play
I've always put my cards upon the table
Never be said that I'd be unstable
Just my imagination (My imagination)
Just my imagination (My imagination)
Just my imagination
It was
Just my imagination (My imagination)
Just my imagination (My imagination)
Just my imagination
It was
There is a game I like to play
I like to hit the town on Friday night
And stay in bed until Sunday
We'll always be this free
We will be living for the love we have
Living not for reality
It's not my imagination (My imagination)
It's not my imagination (My imagination)
It's not my imagination
It was
Not my imagination (My imagination)
Not my imagination (My imagination)
Not my imagination
It was
Not my, not my, not my (My imagination)
Not my, not my, not my (My imagination)
Not my, not my
La-a-a-a-a
My imagination, my imagination
Not my imagination (My imagination)
Not my imagination (My imagination)
Not my imagination (My imagination)
Not my imagination (My imagination)
There's every good reason
For letting you go
She's sneaky and smoked out
And it's starting to show
I'll never let you go
I'll never let you turn around
Your back on each other
That's a good idea
Break a promise to your mother
Turn around
Your back on each other
You say that I changed
Well maybe I did
But even if I changed
What's wrong with it
I never let you go
I'll never let you go
I never let you go
I'll never let you turn around
Your back on each other
That's a good idea
Break a promise to your mother
Turn around
Your back on each other
And all our friends are gone
Are gone
And all the time moves on and on
And all I know is it's wrong
It's wrong
If there's a reason
It's lost on me
Maybe we'll be friends
I guess we'll see
I never let you go
I'll never let you go
Turn around
Your back on each other
That's a good idea
Break a promise to your mother
Turn around
Let's turn on each other
Good idea
Break a promise to your mother
Turn around
Your back on each other
That's a good idea
Break a promise to your mother
Turn around your back on each other
What a good idea
I remember the stupid things
The mood rings
The bracelets and the beads
Nickels and dimes
Yours and mine
Did you cash in all your dreams
You don't dream for me
No
But I still feel you pulsing like sonar
From the days in the waves
That girl is like a sunburn
I would like to save
She's like a sunburn
How does it feel to be
One of the beautiful people?
Now that you know who you are
What do you want to be?
And have you travelled very far?
Far as the eye can see
How does it feel to be
One of the beautiful people?
How often have you been there?
Often enough to know
What did you see when you were there?
Nothing that doesn't show
Baby, you're a rich man
Baby, you're a rich man
Baby, you're a rich man, too
You keep all your money in a big brown bag
Inside a zoo
What a thing to do!
Baby, you're a rich man
Baby, you're a rich man
Baby, you're a rich man, too
How does it feel to be
One of the beautiful people?
Tuned to a natural E
Happy to be that way
Now that you've found another key
What are you going to play?
Baby, you're a rich man
Baby, you're a rich man
Baby, you're a rich man, too
You keep all your money in a big brown bag
Inside a zoo
What a thing to do!
(Baby)
Baby, you're a rich man
Baby, you're a rich man
Baby, you're a rich man, too
(Oh)
Baby, you're a rich man
Baby, you're a rich man (baby)
Baby, you're a rich man, too
(Wahoo!)
Baby, you're a rich (whoo) man
Baby, you're a (hey) rich man
Baby, you're a rich man, too
(Oh)
Well, I sincerely miss those heavy metal bands
I used to go see on the landing in the summer
She fell in love with the drummer
She fell in love with the drummer
She fell in love
Shiny, shiny pants and bleached blonde hair
A double kick drum by the river in the summer
She fell in love with the drummer
Another, then another
She fell in love
I miss the innocence I've known
Playing KISS covers, beautiful and stoned
Unlock my body and move myself to dance
Into warm liquid, flowing, blowing glass
Classical music blasting masks the ringing in my ears
Oh, I sincerely miss those heavy metal bands
I used to go to see on the landing in the summer
She fell in love with the drummer
She fell in love with another
She fell in love
I miss the innocence I've known
Playing KISS covers, beautiful and stoned
I miss the innocence I've known
Playing KISS covers, beautiful and stoned
Playing KISS covers, beautiful and stoned
Playing KISS covers, beautiful and stoned
Aruba, Jamaica, ooh I wanna take you
Bermuda, Bahama, come on pretty mama
Key Largo, Montego, baby why don't we go?
Jamaica
Off the Florida Keys
There's a place called Kokomo
That's where you wanna go
To get away from it all
Bodies in the sand
Tropical drink melting in your hand
We'll be falling in love
To the rhythm of a steel drum band
Down in Kokomo
Aruba, Jamaica, ooh I wanna take you
To Bermuda, Bahama, come on pretty mama
Key Largo, Montego, baby why don't we go?
Ooh I wanna take you down to Kokomo
We'll get there fast
And then we'll take it slow
That's where we wanna go
Way down to Kokomo
To Martinique, that Monserrat mystique
We'll put out to sea
And we'll perfect our chemistry
By and by we'll defy
A little bit of gravity
Afternoon delight
Cocktails and moonlit nights
That dreamy look in your eye
Give me a tropical contact high
Way down in Kokomo
Aruba, Jamaica, ooh I wanna take you
To Bermuda, Bahama, come on pretty mama
Key Largo, Montego, baby why don't we go?
Ooh I wanna take you down to Kokomo
We'll get there fast
And then we'll take it slow
That's where we wanna go
Way down to Kokomo
Port-au-Prince, I wanna catch a glimpse
Everybody knows
A little place like Kokomo
Now if you wanna go
And get away from it all
Go down to Kokomo
Aruba, Jamaica, ooh I wanna take you
To Bermuda, Bahama, come on pretty mama
Key Largo, Montego, baby why don't we go?
Ooh I wanna take you down to Kokomo
We'll get there fast
And then we'll take it slow
That's where we wanna go
Way down to Kokomo
Aruba, Jamaica, ooh I wanna take you
To Bermuda, Bahama, come on pretty mama
Key Largo, Montego, baby why don't we go?
Ooh I wanna take you down to Kokomo
Can't count the years on one hand that we've been together
I need the other one to hold you
Make you feel, make you feel better
It's not a walk in the park to love each other
But when our fingers interlock
Can't deny, can't deny you're worth it
'Cause after all this time
I'm still into you
I should be over all the butterflies
But I'm into you (I'm into you)
And baby, even on our worst nights
I'm into you (I'm into you)
Let 'em wonder how we got this far
'Cause I don't really need to wonder at all
Yeah, after all this time, I'm still into you
Recount the night that I first met your mother
And on the drive back to my house
I told you that, I told you that I loved ya
You felt the weight of the world fall off your shoulder
And to your favorite song
We sang along into the start of forever
And after all this time
I'm still into you
I should be over all the butterflies
But I'm into you (I'm into you)
And baby, even on our worst nights
I'm into you (I'm into you)
Let 'em wonder how we got this far
'Cause I don't really need to wonder at all
Yeah, after all this time, I'm still into you
Well, some things just, some things just make sense
And one of those is you and I (Hey)
Well, some things just, some things just make sense
And even after all this time (Hey)
I'm into you
Baby, not a day goes by that I'm not into you
I should be over all the butterflies
But I'm into you (I'm into you)
And baby, even on our worst nights
I'm into you (I'm into you)
Let 'em wonder how we got this far
'Cause I don't really need to wonder at all
Yeah, after all this time
I'm still into you
I'm still into you
I'm still into you
The Queen says no to pot-smoking FBI members
Because you're sweet and lovely, girl, I love you
Because you're sweet and lovely, girl, it's true
I love you more than ever, girl, I do
I want you in the morning, girl, I love you
I want you at the moment I feel blue 
I'm living every moment, girl, for you 
Walk, walk, cat, walk
Go, Johnny, go!
Same old twelve-bar blues
Elmore James got nothin' on this, baby!
I loved you from the moment I saw you
You looked at me, that's all you had to do
I feel it now, I hope you feel it too
Because you're sweet and lovely, girl, I love you
Because you're sweet and lovely, girl, it's true
I love you more than ever, girl, I do
I'm having the blues
Screen falling off the door, door hanging off the hinges
My feet are still sore, my back's on the fringes
We tore up the walls, we slept on couches
We lifted this house, we lifted this house
Firecrackers in the east, my car parked south
Your hands on my cheeks, your shoulder in my mouth
I was up against the wall on the west mezzanine
We rattle this town, we rattle this scene
Oh, Anna Sun
What do you know? This house is falling apart
What can I say? This house is falling apart
We got no money but we got h-heart
We're gonna rattle this ghost town
This house is falling apart
Screen falling off the door, door hanging off the hinges
My feet are still sore, my back's on the fringes
We were up against the wall on the west mezzanine
We rattle this town, we rattle this scene
Oh, Anna Sun
What do you know? This house is falling apart
What can I say? This house is falling apart
We got no money but we got h-heart
We're gonna rattle this ghost town
Do you know this house is falling apart
What can I say? This house is falling apart
We got no money but we got h-heart
We're gonna rattle this ghost town
This house is falling apart
This house is falling apart
Live my life without
Station wagon rides
Fumbling 'round the back
Not one seat belt on
Wait for summertime
Coming up for air
Now it's all I want
Now it's all I want
Live my life without
Coming up for air
Now it's all I want
I want everyone
Racing down the hill
I am faster than you
Wait for summertime
Wait for summertime
Oh, Anna Sun
What do you know? This house is falling apart
What can I say? This house is falling apart
We got no money but we got h-heart
We're gonna rattle this ghost town
What do you know? This house is falling apart
What can I say? This house is falling apart
We got no money but we got h-heart
We're gonna rattle this ghost town
This house is falling apart
This house is falling apart
This house is falling apart
We're gonna rattle this ghost town
This house is falling apart
This house is falling apart
The world is spinning too fast
I buy lead Nike shoes
To keep myself tethered
To the days I've tried to lose
My mama said to slow down
You must make your own shoes
Stop dancing to the music
Of Gorillaz in a happy mood
Keep a mild groove on
They do the bump
They do the bump
They do the bump
They do the bump
They do the bump
They do the bump
They do the bump
Here you go!
Get the cool!
Get the cool shoeshine!
Get the cool!
Get the cool shoeshine!
Get the cool!
Get the cool shoeshine!
Get the cool!
Get the cool shoeshine!
There's a monkey in the jungle
Watching a vapor trail
Caught up in the conflict
Between his brain and his tail
And if time's a limitation
Then we've got nothing to lose
Please repeat the message:
It's the music that we choose
Keep a mild groove on...
They do the bump
They do the bump
They do the bump
They do the bump
They do the bump
They do the bump
They do the bump
OK, bring it down, yeah, we gonna break out.
Get the cool!
Get the cool shoeshine!
Get the cool!
Get the cool shoeshine!
Get the cool!
Get the cool shoeshine!
Get the cool!
Get the cool shoeshine!
They do the bump

Well I saw fireworks from the freeway 
And behind closed eyes, I cannot make them go away 
'Cause you were born on the Fourth of July
Freedom ring
Well something on the surface it stinks
I said something on the surface 
Well it kind of makes me nervous
To say that you deserve this 
And what kind of God would serve this 
We will cure this dirty old disease 
Well if you've gots the poison, I've gots the remedy 
The remedy is the experience, this is a dangerous liaison 
I says the comedy is that it's serious
This is a strange enough new play on words 
I said, the tragedy is how you're going to spend
The rest of your nights with the light on
So shine the light on all of your friends
Well, it all amounts to nothing 
In the end 
I won't worry my life away
I won't worry my life away
Well I heard two men, talking on the radio 
In a crossfire kind of new reality show
Uncovering the ways to plan the next big attack 
Or they were counting down the ways to stab the brother in the
Be right back after this 
The unavoidable kiss, with a minty fresh death-breath 
Is sure to outlast this catastrophe 
Dance with me 
'Cause if you've gots the poison, I've gots the remedy 
The remedy is the experience, this is a dangerous liaison 
I says the comedy is that it's serious
This is a strange enough new play on words 
I said, the tragedy is how you're going to spend
The rest of your nights with the light on
So shine the light on all of your friends
When, it all amounts to nothing 
In the end 
I won't worry my life away 
I won't worry my life away 
When I fall in love
I take my time, there's no need to hurry 
When I'm making up my mind
You can turn off the sun, but I'm still going to shine 
And I'll tell you why
Because the remedy is the experience, this is a dangerous liaison 
I says the comedy is that it's serious
This is a strange enough new play on words 
I said, the tragedy is how you're going to spend
The rest of your nights with the light on
So shine the light on all of your friends
When, it all amounts to nothing 
In the end
I won't worry my life away
I won't worry my life away 
'Cause I won't, I won't, I won't 
Won't worry my life away
Since my heart is golden
I've got sense to hold it
Tempted just to make an ugly scene
No I'm not as proper
My money's in copper
Ripped down from the brownstones to the street
Listen, I'm your friend (don't quote me)
But not a friend worth noting
Yes please don't ever note me as your friend
Who says we have cold hearts
Acting out our old parts
Let's perform our favorite little scene, oho
I get carried away, carried away, from you
And I'm hoping and I'm praying
'Cause I'm sorry, sorry bout that
Sorry 'bout the things that I said
Always let it get to my head
All European, once again with feeling
Higher education making a sense
Justify your thesis certain that you need this
Tell me what your point is in defense
Listen, I don't really know you
And I don't think I want to
But I think I can fake it if you can
And let's agree there's no need, no more talk of money
Let's just keep pretending to be friends, oho
I get carried away, carried away, from you
And I'm hoping and I'm praying
'Cause I'm sorry, sorry bout that
Sorry 'bout the things that I said
Always let it get to my head
Wake up in the morning
Wake up in the evening
Wake up when you want
'Cause no one's really watching
Well she'll have something to say about it but
We all have problems
We're all having problem
And we've all got something to say
I get carried away, carried away, from you
And I'm hoping and I'm praying
'Cause I'm sorry, sorry bout that
Sorry 'bout the things that I said
Always let it get to my head
Now it's day, I've been trying to get that taste off my tongue
I was dreaming of just you, now our cereal, it is warm
Attractive day in the rubble of the night from before
Now I can't walk in a vacuum, I feel ugly, feel my pores
It's the trees of this day that I do battle with for the light
Then I start to feel trapped in, people greet me, I'm polite
"What's the day? What's you doing? How's your mood? How's that song?"
Man it passes right by me, it's behind me, now it's gone
And I can't lift you up 'cause my mind is tired
It's family beaches that I desire
A sacred night, where we'll watch the fireworks
The frightened babies poo
They've got two flashing eyes and they're colored why
They make me feel that I'm only all I see sometimes
I was eating with a good friend
Who said "A Genii made me out of the earth's skin"
But in spite of her she is my birth kin
She spits me out in her surly blood rivers
All the people life lurking in dominions of a hot Turk dish
If the elephants are reaching for our purses
Then meet me after the world with the shivers
I was eating with a good friend
Who said "A Genii made me out of the earth's skin"

Man it passes right by me, it's behind me, now it's gone
And I can't lift you up 'cause my mind is tired
It's family beaches that I desire
That sacred night where we watched the fireworks
They frightened the babies and you know they've got two
Flashing eyes and if they are color blind
They make me feel that you're only what I see sometimes
And I can't lift you up 'cause my mind is tired
It's family beaches that I desire
That sacred night where we watched the fireworks
They frightened the babies and you know they've got two
Flashing eyes and if they are color blind
They make me feel that I'm only all I see sometimes

I took the Polaroid down in my room
I'm pretty sure you have a new girlfriend
It's not as if I don't like you
It just makes me sad whenever I see it
'Cause I like to be gone most of the time
And you like to be home most of the time
If I stay in one place I lose my mind
I'm a pretty impossible lady to be with
Joey never met a bike that he didn't wanna ride
And I never met a Toby that I didn't like
Scotty liked all of the books that I recommended
Even if he didn't I wouldn't be offended
I had a dream that I had to drive to Madison
To deliver a painting for some silly reason
I took a wrong turn and ended up in Michigan
A pallbearer aboard took me to the giant tire swing
Gave me a push and he started singing
I sang along while I was swinging
The sound of our voices made us forget everything
That had ever hurt our feelings
Joey never met a bike that he didn't wanna ride
And I never met a Toby that I didn't like
Scotty liked all of the books that I recommended
Even if he didn't I wouldn't be offended
I wouldn't be offended
Now I'm home for less than twenty-four hours
That's hardly time to take a shower
Hug my family and take your picture off the wall
Check my email write a song and make a few phone calls
Before it's time to leave again
I've got one hand on the steering wheel
One waving out the window
If I'm a spinster for the rest of my life
My arms will keep me warm on cold and lonely nights
Joey never met a bike that he didn't wanna ride
And I never met a Toby that I didn't like
Scotty liked all of the books that I recommended
Even if he didn't I wouldn't be offended
This bed is on fire with passionate love
The neighbours complain about the noises above
But she only cums when she's on top
My therapist said not to see you no more
She said you're like a disease without any cure
She said I'm so obsessed that I'm becoming a bore, oh no
Ah, you think you're so pretty
Caught your hand inside the till
Slammed your fingers in the drawer
Fought with kitchen knives and skewers
Dressed me up in women's clothes
Messed around with gender roles
Line my eyes and call me pretty
Moved out of the house, so you moved next door
I locked you out, you cut a hole in the wall
I found you sleeping next to me, I thought I was alone
You're driving me crazy, when are you coming home?
Laid, laid
7A.
What number is this, Chip?
7A!
Okay. I mean, don't get excited, man. It's 'cause I'm short, I know.
Oh, I could hide 'neath the wings of the bluebird as she sings
The six o'clock alarm would never ring
But it rings and I rise, wipe the sleep out of my eyes
My shavin' razor's cold and it stings
Cheer up, sleepy Jean
Oh, what can it mean
To a daydream believer
And a homecoming queen
You once thought of me as a white knight on his steed
Now you know how happy I can be
Oh and our good time starts and end without dollar one to spend
But how much, baby, do we really need?
Cheer up, sleepy Jean
Oh, what can it mean
To a daydream believer
And a homecoming queen
Cheer up, sleepy Jean
Oh, what can it mean
To a daydream believer
And a homecoming queen
Cheer up, sleepy Jean
Oh, what can it mean
To a daydream believer
And a homecoming queen
Cheer up, sleepy Jean
Oh, what can it mean
To a daydream believer
And a homecoming queen
Cheer up, sleepy Jean
Oh, what can it mean
To a daydream believer
And a homecoming queen
Cheer up, sleepy Jean
Oh, what can it mean
To a...
Our haven on the southern point is calling us
Our haven on the southern point is calling us
And faced with all the obvious she'll carry us
Avert your eyes from all of this, we'll make it all back
In the end
You'll never find
You'll never find
In the end
You'll never find me now
In the end
You'll never find me now
You'll never find
But I'll return to you
You'll never find
When you return to me
In the end
In the end
You'll never find
You'll never find
In the end
You'll never find me now
In the end
You'll never find me now
You'll never find
But I'll return to you
You'll never find
When you return to me
In regards to the last word
It's not the last you'll hear
I'd never find any other
I could ever
I could ever
Never say it's the last one
It's not the last one
I'd never find any other
I could ever
I could ever
And the first one tore a picture
Of a dead and hanging man
Who was kissing foreign fishes
That flew right out from his hands
And when I put my arms around him
Felt the blushing blood run through my cheeks
And an eerieness surrounded
When his tongue began to speak
And he said, "Oh, boy, you are so pretty,
Enough to wrap tight in rice-paper string"
And when I finally kissed him
The whole world began to ring
Lost like a bell that's tipping over
With two cracks along both sides
And I knew the world was over
So I took a look outside
And watched the fires that were reaching
Up to the weather vanes and the tops of trees
And the waiting scene and the Sunday dream -
They're all waiting here for me
Deli markets with their flower stands
Their pretty girls and their burning men
Hanging out on the hooks next to the window displays
And I took out my tongue, twice removed from my face
Across a bridge and across the mountains
Threw a nickel in the fountain
To save my soul from all these troubled times
And all the drugs that I don't have the guts to take to soothe my mind
So I'm always sober
Always aching
Always heading towards
Mass suicide, occult figurines
And wasted gas-station attendants
Attending to their jobs
And a nice drive in the country
Finds a nice cliff to drop off
Oh, when this life just gets so grating
All the grittiness of life
But don't take those pills your boyfriend gave you ...
You're too wonderful to die
And the last one tore a picture
From the pornographic page
And all the pleasure points attacking
All the looks of love were staged
And it's a lie that you've been given
That just hurts you every day
So why should I lie here naked
When it's just too far away
From anything we could call loving -
Any love worth living for?
So I'll sleep out in the gutter
You can sleep here on the floor
And when I wake up in the morning
I won't forget to lock the door
'Cause with a match that's mean and some gasoline
You won't see me anymore.
Taking a moment just imagining that I'm dancing with you
I'm your pole and all you're wearing is your shoes
You've got soul, you know what to do to turn me on until I write a song about you
And you have your own engaging style, you've got the knack to vivify
And you make my slacks a little tight, you may unfasten them if you like
That's if you crash and spend the night
But you don't bode, you don't pay, you got everything you need
Especially me, sister you've got it all
You make the call to make my day
In your message say my name
Your talk is all the talk, sister you've got it all
Curl your upper lip up and let me look around
Ride your tongue along your bottom lip and bite down
And bend your back and ask those hips if I can touch
Well they're the perfect jumping up point
Getting closer to your butterfly
You float on by
Oh kiss me with your eyelashes tonight
Or Eskimo your nose real close to mine
And let's mood the lights and finally make it right
But you don't bode and you don't pay, you got everything you need
Especially me, sister you've got it all
You make the call to make my day
In your message say my name
Your talk is all the talk, sister you've got it all
You've got it all, you've got it all, you've got it all
You've got it all, you've got it all, you've got it all
You've got it all
Don't I need to see you pull your knee socks up
Let me feel you upside down, slide in, slide out
Slide over here, climb into my mouth now
Butterfly
Well you landed on my mind
Damn right you, landed on my ear and then you crawled inside
And now I see you perfectly behind closed eyes
I wanna fly with you
And I don't want to lie to you
'Cause I can't recall a better day
Sun coming to shine on the occasion
You're an open-minded lady, you've got it all
And I never forget a face
If I could make you my own, I have my days
The fact is, it's you who've got it all to make my day
In your message say my name
Your talk is all the talk, sister you've got it all
You know that fortune favors the brave
But let me get paid while I make you breakfast
The rest is up to you, you makes the call
You make the call to make my day
In your message say my name
It's you who's got it all
I can't recall a better day
Sun coming to shine on the occasion
You're a sophisticated lady, you've got it all
You've got it all, you've got it all, you've got it all
You've got it all, you've got it all, you've got it all
You've got it all, you've got it all, you've got it all
You've got it all, you've got it all, you've got it all
Butterfly, baby, you've got it all
How do you describe a feeling? 
I've only ever dreamt of this
DJ's spinning up my favourite song
Hurry up and get a move on
Light fantastic and it won't be long
Don't let the moment slip away
'Cause you and I could find a pleasure
No one else has ever known
Feels like it is now or never
Don't wanna be alone
How does it feel in my arms?
How does it feel in my arms?
Do you want it?
Do you need it?
Can you feel it?
Tell me, how does it feel in my arms?
Got a feeling this is something strong
All I wanna do is move on
No more wondering where I belong,
So never go away
'Cause you and I could find a pleasure
No one else has ever known
Feels like it is now or never
Don't wanna be alone
How does it feel in my arms? 
(How does it feel in my arms?)
How does it feel in my arms?
Do you want it? 
Do you need it? 
Can you feel it? 
Tell me, how does it feel in my arms?
Do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do
Oh yeah yeah 
Do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do
Oh yeah yeah 
I'm listening.
How does it feel in my arms? 
(How does it feel in my arms?)
How does it feel in my arms?
(Yeah, yeah)
Do you want it? 
Do you need it? 
Can you feel it? 
Tell me, how does it feel in my arms?
Turn your magic on
Umi she'd say
Everything you want's a dream away
And we are legends every day
That's what she told me
Turn your magic on
To me she'd say
Everything you want's a dream away
Under this pressure, under this weight
We are diamonds
I feel my heart beating
I feel my heart underneath my skin
I feel my heart beating
Oh, you make me feel
Like I'm alive again
(Alive again)
Oh, you make me feel
Like I'm alive again
Said I can't go on, not in this way
I'm a dream that died by light of day
Gonna hold up half the sky and say
Only I own me
I feel my heart beating
I feel my heart underneath my skin
Oh, I can feel my heart beating
'Cause you make me feel
Like I'm alive again
(Alive again)
Oh, you make me feel
Like I'm alive again
Turn your magic on
Umi she'd say
Everything you want's a dream away
Under this pressure, under this weight
We are diamonds taking shape
We are diamonds taking shape
Woo hoo
Woo hoo
If we've only got this life
This adventure, oh, then I
And if we've only got this life
You get me through, ah
And if we've only got this life
In this adventure, oh, then I
Want to share it with you
With you
With you
I see you, I see you
Woo hoo (Woo hoo)
Woo hoo (Woo hoo)
Woo hoo (Woo hoo)
Woo hoo (Woo hoo)
Woo hoo (Woo hoo)
Woo hoo (Woo hoo)
Woo hoo (Woo hoo)

Woo hoo (Woo hoo)
Woo hoo (Woo hoo)
I heard about this frog
It's a very tiny frog
But it's also very special
You can only find it in the jungle
So far away from here
But if you find it, and if you touch it
Your world can change forever
If you touch its skin 
You can feel your body changing
And your vision also
Blue becomes red and red becomes blue
And your mommy suddenly becomes your daddy
And everything looks like a giant cupcake
And you keep laughing and laughing and laughing
Nothing is ever quite the same, really
And after you finished laughing
It's time to turn into a frog yourself
Its very funny to be a frog
You can dive into the water and cross the rivers
And the oceans
And you can jump all the time and everywhere
Do you wanna play with me?
We can be a whole group of friends
A whole group of frogs
Jumping into the streets
Jumping into the planets
Climbing the buildings
Swimming in the lakes and in the bathtubs
We would be hundreds, thousands, millions
The biggest group of friends the world has ever seen
Jumping and laughing forever
It would be great, right?
See all the colors in the sky
See all the colors in the sky
See all the colors in the sky
See all the colors in the sky
See all the colors in the sky
See all the colors in the sky
See all the colors in the sky
See all the colors in the sky
Við keyrðum út um allt
Í gegnum sól og malarryk
Við sáum öll svo margt
Já, heimsins ból og svart malbik
Við spiluðum
(hopelandic)
Við spiluðum
(hopelandic)
Við spiluðum
Dagur síungur líður
Já, endalausir og birtan
Reykur í augum svíður
Já, rifjast upp og núna man
Við spiluðum

Við spiluðum

Við spilum út um allt
Við sáum öll svo margt
Mátum allt allt upp á nýtt

Við spilum út um allt

Við spilum endalaust
Við spilum endalaust saman
Við spilum út um allt saman
Við syngjum öll saman

I worry
I weigh three times my body
I worry
I throw my fear around
But this morning
There's a calm I can't explain
The rock candy's melted, only diamonds now remain
By the time I recognize this moment
This moment will be gone
But I will bend the light pretending
That it somehow lingered on
And I will wait to find
If this will last forever
And I will wait to find
If this will last forever
And I will wait to find
That it won't and it won't because it can't
It just can't
(It's not supposed to)
Was there a second of time I looked around?
Did I sail through or drop my anchor down?
Was anything enough to kiss the ground
And say I'm here now?
And she is here now?
So much wasted in the afternoon
So much sacred in the month of June
How 'bout you?
And I will wait to find
If this will last forever
And I will pay no mind
When it won't and it won't
Because it won't
And I will waste no time
Worried 'bout no rainy weather
And I will waste no time
Remaining in our lives together
Stand in the place where you live
Now face north
Think about direction
Wonder why you haven't before
Now stand in the place where you work
Now face west
Think about the place where you live
Wonder why you haven't before
If you are confused, check with the sun
Carry a compass to help you along
Your feet are going to be on the ground
Your head is there to move you around
So stand in the place where you live
Now face north
Think about direction
Wonder why you haven't before
Now stand in the place where you work
Now face west
Think about the place where you live
Wonder why you haven't before
Your feet are going to be on the ground
Your head is there to move you around
If wishes were trees, the trees would be falling
Listen to reason, season is calling
Stand in the place where you live
Now face north
Think about direction
Wonder why you haven't before
Now stand in the place where you work
Now face west
Think about the place where you live
Wonder why you haven't before
If wishes were trees, the trees would be falling
Listen to reason, reason is calling
Your feet are going to be on the ground
Your head is there to move you around
So stand (Stand!)
Now face north
Think about direction
Wonder why you haven't before
Now stand (Stand!)
Now face west
Think about the place where you live
Wonder why you haven't
Stand in the place where you live
Now face north
Think about direction
Wonder why you haven't before
Now stand in the place where you work
Now face west
Think about the place where you live
Wonder why you haven't before
Stand in the place where you are
Now face north
Stand in the place where you are
Now face west
Your feet are going to be on the ground
(Stand in the place where you are)
Your head is there to move you around, so stand
Loose lips might sink ships but loose gooses take trips
To San Francisco, double Dutch disco,
Tech TV hottie, do it for Scotty
Do it for the living and do it for the dead
Do it for the monsters under your bed
Do it for the teenagers and do it for your mom
Broken hearts hurt but they make you strong and
We won't stop until somebody calls the cops
And even then we'll start again and just pretend that
Nothing ever happened
We won't stop until somebody calls the cops
And even then we'll start again and just pretend that
Nothing ever happened
We're just dancing, we're just hugging,
Singing, screaming, kissing, tugging
On the sleeve of how it used to be
How's it gonna be?
I'll drop kick Russell Stover, move into the starting over house
And know Matt Rouse and Jest are watching me achieve my dreams
And we'll pray, all damn day, every day,
That all this shit our President has got us in will go away
While we strive to figure out a way we can survive
These trying times without losing our minds
So if you wanna burn yourself
Remember that I love you
And if you wanna cut yourself
Remember that I love you
And if you wanna kill yourself
Remember that I love you
Call me up before you're dead, we can make some plans instead
Send me an IM, I'll be your friend
Shysters live from scheme to scheme, but my 4th quarter pipe dreams
Are seeming more and more worth fighting for
So I'll curate some situations, make my job a big vacation
And I'll say fuck Bush and fuck this war
My war paint is Sharpie ink and I'll show you how much my shit stinks
And ask you what you think because your thoughts and words are powerful
They think we're disposable, well both my thumbs opposable
Are spelled out on a double word and triple letter score
We won't stop until somebody calls the cops
And even then we'll start again and just pretend that
Nothing ever happened
We won't stop until somebody calls the cops
And even then we'll start again and just pretend that
Nothing ever happened
We won't stop until somebody calls the cops
And even then we'll start again and just pretend that
Nothing ever happened
We won't stop until somebody calls the cops
And even then we'll start again and just pretend that
Nothing ever happened
We're just dancing, we're just hugging,
Singing, screaming, kissing, tugging
On the sleeve of how it used to be
Hey, I'm in love
My fingers keep on clickin' to the beatin' of my heart
Hey, I can't stop my feet
Ebony and ivory and dancin' in the street
Hey, it's 'cause of you
The world is in a crazy, hazy hue
My heart is beatin' like a jungle drum
But a doong ka doong ka doong doong doong doong
My heart is beatin' like a jungle drum
Rroo ka do ka do goong ka do ka roo ka doong doong
My heart is beatin' like a jungle drum
Man, you got me burnin'
I'm the moment between the strikin' and the fire
Hey, read my lips
Cause all they say is kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss
No, it will never stop
My hands are in the air, yes I'm in love
My heart is beatin' like a jungle drum
Rroo ka doong ka doong ka do ka do ka doong doong
My heart is beatin' like a jungle drum
Rroo ka do ka do ko koo ka do ka do ka do ka doong
My heart is beatin' like a jungle drum
Rrrrroong doong do rroong koong koong
My heart is beatin' like a jungle drum
Doong ka doong ka rroo ka do ka doong doong
Do ka do ka do ko kok ka do ka do ka dong doong
Rroom boom boom boom boom boom
Bub boo bub bow ka rrah ka duk ka koong gung
Boom boom boom tick tock boom
But tuk ka tok ka tok ka tuk ka tuk ka dom dou
Rroong ka goong ka kow doung kong kow
Rroong ka goong ka like a ruk ka kung kew
My heart is beatin' like a jungle drum
My heart is beatin' like a jungle drum
My heart is beatin' like a jungle drum
My heart is beatin' like a jungle
Rroong ka doong ka roo ka do ka doong doong
Lovers In Japan
Lovers, keep on the road you're on
Runners, until the race is run
Soldiers, you've got to soldier on
Sometimes even the right is wrong
They are turning my head out
To see what I'm all about
Keeping my head down
To see what it feels like now
But I have no doubt
One day, we're gonna get out
Tonight, maybe we're gonna run
Dreaming of the Osaka sun
Ohohohoh ohohohoh oh
Dreaming of when the morning comes 
They are turning my head out
To see what I'm all about
Keeping my head down 
To see what it feels like now
But I have no doubt
One day, the sun will come out
Reign Of Love
Reign of love
I can't let go
To the sea I offer this heavy load
Locust wind
Lift me up
I'm just a prisoner in a reign of love
Locust wind
Let us stop
How I wish I'd spoken up
To a reign of love
Reign of love by the church we're waiting
Reign of love on my knees go praying
How I wish I'd spoken up
Away get carried on a reign of love
It's a war on war
It's a war on war
It's a war on war
It's a war on war
It's a war on war
It's a war on war
It's a war on war
There's a war on
You're gonna lose
You have to lose
You have to learn how to die
Just watching the miles flying by
Just watching the miles flying by
You are not my typewriter
But you could be my demon
Moving forward through the flaming doors
You have to lose
You have to learn how to die
If you want to, want to be alive
Okay
You have to lose
You have to lose
You have to learn how to die
If you want to, want to be alive
You have to die
You have to die
You have to learn how to die
If you want to, want to be alive
Okay
Don't get mad
If I'm laughing
Blame the caffeine
For all the 5AM phone calls
I haven't slept a single night in over a month
Not even once did you start to make sense to me
Well maybe I'm a little bit slow
I'm just consistently inconsistent
She said unpredictability's my responsibility baby
But you're waiting at the door
Where everybody's hanging out just like they hung out before
You didn't have to do it but you did it to say
That you didn't have to do it but you would anyway
To give you something to go on
When I go off
Back to the middle of no where
To give you something to go on
When I go off
Back to the middle of no where
They chewed me up
And then they spit me out
And I'm not supposed to let it bother me
But maybe I'm a little bit weak
I let my frailty take the wheel
She said maybe there's a bit of me
Waiting for a bit of you baby
But you're waiting at the door
Where everybody's hanging out just like they hung out before
You didn't have to do it but you did it to say
That you didn't have to do it but you would anyway
To give you something to go on
When I go off
Back to the middle of no where
To give you something to go on
When I go off
Back to the middle of no where
But you're waiting at the door
Where everybody's hanging out just like they hung out before
You didn't have to do it but you did it to say
That you didn't have to do it but you would anyway
To give you something to go on
When I go off
Back to the middle of no where
To give you something to go on
When I go off
Back to the middle of no where
To give you something to go on
To go on
Back to the middle of no where
I'm just a little bit caught in the middle
Life is a maze, and love is a riddle
I don't know where to go, can't do it alone
I've tried, but I don't know why
Slow it down, make it stop
Or else my heart is going to pop
'Cause it's too much, yeah, it's a lot
To be something I'm not
I'm a fool, out of love
'Cause I just can't get enough
I'm just a little bit caught in the middle
Life is a maze, and love is a riddle
I don't know where to go, can't do it alone
I've tried, but I don't know why
I'm just a little girl lost in the moment
I'm so scared, but I don't show it
I can't figure it out, it's bringing me down
I know I've got to let it go
And just enjoy the show
The sun is hot in the sky
Just like a giant spotlight
The people follow the signs
And synchronize in time
It's a joke, nobody knows
They got a ticket to the show
Yeah, I'm just a little bit caught in the middle
Life is a maze, and love is a riddle
I don't know where to go, can't do it alone
I've tried, but I don't know why
I'm just a little girl lost in the moment
I'm so scared, but I don't show it
I can't figure it out, it's bringing me down
I know I've got to let it go
And just enjoy the show, oh
Just enjoy the show, oh, oh
I'm just a little bit caught in the middle
Life is a maze, and love is a riddle
I don't know where to go, can't do it alone
I've tried, but i don't know why
I'm just a little girl lost in the moment
I'm so scared, but I don't show it
I can't figure it out, it's bringing me down
I know I've got to let it go
And just enjoy the show
Dum-be-dum
Da-dum-be-dum
Just enjoy the show
Da-dum-be-dum
Da-dum-be-dum
Just enjoy the show
I want my money back
I want my money back
I want my money back
Just enjoy the show
I want my money back
I want my money back
I want my money back
Just enjoy the show
I'm glad to see you
I had a funny dream and you were wearing funny shoes
You were going to a dance
You were dressed like a punk, but you were too young to remember
I'm glad to see you
I'm outside the house and not thinking right today
I've got no energy
I'm glad that you are waiting with me
Tell me all about your day
Breaking off is misery
I see a wilderness for you and me
Punctuated by philosophy
I'm wondering how things could've been
I'm happy for you
You've made it hard for me
I counted on your company
You are staying with your friends tonight
I'm feeling sorry for myself
I keep taking everything to be a sign
I'm happy for you
But now I know this hurt is poison
Too sharp to be bled
I'm sitting on my empty bed
I'm on my empty bed
At night the fever grows it's pounding, pounding
I'd rather be in Tokyo
I'd rather listen to Thin Lizzy-oh
And watch the Sunday gang in Harajuku
There's something wrong with me, I'm a cuckoo
Scary moment, lovin' every moment
I was high from playing shows
We lost a singer to her clothes
My trouble raised its ugly head
I was revealed
And I was home in bed
I was a kid again
Jesus told me go after every coin like it was the last in the world
And protect the wayward child
But I'm a little lost sheep
I need my Bo Peep
You know I need my shepherd here tonight
Breaking off is misery
I see a wilderness for you and me
Punctuated by philosophy
I'm wondering how things could've been
I'd like to see you
But, really, I should stay away
And let you settle down (Let you settle down)
I've got no claims to your crown (Let you settle down)
I was the boss of you and I loved you
You know I loved you
It's all over now
And I was there for you
When you were lonely
I was there when you were bad (There when you were bad)
I was there when you were sad (There when you were sad)
Now it's my time of need
I'm thinking, do I have to plead to get you by my side?
I'd rather be in Tokyo
I'd rather listen to Thin Lizzy-oh
And watch the Sunday gang in Harajuku
There's something wrong with me, I'm a cuckoo
Who loves the sun
Who cares that it makes plants grow
Who cares what it does since you broke my heart
Who loves the wind
Who cares that it makes breezes
Who cares what it does since you broke my heart
Who loves the sun
Who loves the sun
Not everyone
Who loves the sun
Who loves the rain
Who cares that it makes flowers
Who cares that it makes showers since you broke my heart
Who loves the sun
Who cares that it is shining
Who cares what it does since you broke my heart
Who loves the sun
Who loves the sun
Not everyone
Who loves the sun
Ooh-way-ooh
Who loves the sun
Who loves the sun
Not just anyone
Who loves the sun
Who loves the sun
I've got a big, big, big heartbeat, yeah, I think you are the sweetest thing
I wear a coat of feelings and they are loud
I've been having good days, think we are the right age to start our own peculiar ways
With good friendly homes
You get me freaked freaked freaked on Preakness
I've never met a girl that likes to drink with horses, knows her Chinese ballet
I must admit you smell like fruity nuts and good grains but could you show my purple gaze
A thing or two at night?
It'd make me sick, sick, sick, to kiss you and I think that I would vomit
But I'll do that on Mondays, I don't have to work away
I like it when I bump you, an accident's a truth gate, I'm humbled in your pretty lens
I'll hold you, don't you go
Sometimes you're quiet and sometimes I'm quiet, Hallelujah
Sometimes I'm talkative and sometimes you're not talkative, I know
Well I'd like to spread your perfume around the old apartment
Could we live together and agree on the same wares?
A trapeze is a bird cage and even if it's empty, it definitely fits the room
And we would too
And my dear dear dear Khalana, I talk too much about you
Their ears are getting tired of me singing all the night through
Let's just talk together, you and me and me and you and if there's nothing much to say
Well, silence is a bore
I've gotta big, big, big heartbeat, yeah, I think you are the sweetest thing
I wear a coat of feelings and they are loud
I've been having good days, think we are the right age to start our own peculiar ways
With good friendly homes
Sometimes you're quiet and sometimes I'm quiet, Hallelujah
Sometimes I'm talkative and sometimes you're not talkative, I know
Sometimes you hear me when others they can't hear me, Hallelujah
Sometimes I'm naked and thank god sometimes you're naked, well, hello
Can I tell you that you are the purple in me?
Can I call you just to hear you would you care?
When I saw you put your purple finger on me
There's a feeling in your bottle
Found your bottle, found your heart
Gives a feeling from your bottled little part
Can I tell you that you are the purple in me?
Can I call you just to hear you would you care?
When I saw you put your purple finger on me
There's a feeling in your bottle
Found your bottle, found your heart
Gives a feeling from your bottled little part
Gotta crush high, thought I crushed all I could
Crushed all I can then I crushed your hand
Crush high, don't want it to stop
'Cause stories of your brother make my crush high bop
And you couldn't really know 'cause it's in my toes
And sometimes I wonder where'd that crush high go
Crush high then I go and take some pills
'Cause I can't do all of my dose and still feel ill
You get that woo, you get that woo
You get that woo, you get that woo
You get that woo, you get that woo
You get that woo, you get that
Gotta crush high, thought I crushed all I could
Crushed all I can then I crushed your hand
Crush high, don't want it to stop
'Cause stories of your brother make my crush high bop
And you couldn't really know 'cause it's in my toes
And sometimes I wonder where'd that crush high go
Crush high then I go and take some pills
'Cause I can't do all of my dose and still feel ill
You get that woo, you get that woo
You get that woo, you get that woo
You get that woo, you get that woo
You get that woo, you get that
Gotta crush high, thought I crushed all I could
Crushed all I can then I crushed your hand
Crush high, don't want it to stop
'Cause stories of your brother make my crush high bop
And you couldn't really know 'cause it's in my toes
And sometimes I wonder where'd that crush high go
Crush high then I go and take some pills
'Cause I can't do all of my dose and still feel ill
Woo, you get that woo
You get that woo, you get that woo
You get that woo, you get that woo
You get that woo, you get that woo
You get that woo, you get that woo
You get that woo, you get that woo
You get that woo, you get that woo
You get that woo, you get that
Honey, lovin' you is the greatest thing
I get to be myself and I get to sing
I get to play at being irresponsible
I come home late and I love your soul
I never forget you in my prayers
I never have a bad thing to report
You're my picture on the wall
You're my vision in the hall
You're the one I'm talking to
When I get in from my work
You are my girl and you don't even know it
I am livin' out the life of a poet
I am the jester in the ancient court
And you're the funny little frog in my throat
My eyesight's fading, my hearing's dim
I can't get insured for the state I'm in
I'm a danger to myself, I've been starting fights
At the party at the club on a Saturday night
But I don't get disapproving from my girl
She gets all the highlights wrapped in pearls
You're my picture on the wall
You're my vision in the hall
You're the one I'm talking to
When I get in from my work
You are my girl and you don't even know it
I am livin' out the life of a poet
I am the jester in the ancient court
And you're the funny little frog in my throat
Had a conversation with you at night
It's a little one-sided but that's all right
I tell you in the kitchen about my day
You sit on the bed in the dark changing places
With the ghost that was there before you came
You've come to save my life again
I don't dare to touch your hand
I don't dare to think of you
In a physical way
And I don't know how you smell
You are the cover of my magazine
You're my fashion tip, a living museum
I'd pay to visit you on rainy Sundays
I'll maybe tell you all about it someday
I wrote a letter on a nothing day
I asked somebody "Could you send my letter away?"
"You are too young to put all of your hopes in just one envelope"
I said goodbye to someone that I love
It's not just me, I tell you it's the both of us
And it was hard
Like coming off the pill that you take to stay happy
Someone above has seen me do alright
Someone above is looking with a tender eye
Upon your face, you may think you're alone but you
May think again
If I could do just one near perfect thing I'd be happy
They'd write it on my grave, or when they scattered
My ashes
On second thoughts I'd rather hang around and be there
With my best friend
If she wants me
And far away somebody read the letter
He condescends to read the words I wrote about him
And if he smiles, it's no more than a genius deserves
For all your curious nerve and your passion
I'm going deaf, you're growing melancholy
Things fall apart, I don't know why we bother at all
But life is good and "It's always worth living at least
For a while"
If I could do just one near perfect thing I'd be happy
They'd write it on my grave, or when they scattered
My ashes
On second thoughts I'd rather hang around and be there
With my best friend
If she wants me
If you think to yourself "What should I do now?"
Then take a baton, girl, you better run with it
Cause there is no point in standing in the past cause it's over
And done
I took a book and went into the forest
I climbed the hill, I wanted to look down on you
But all I saw was twenty miles of wilderness so I went
Home
If I could do just one near perfect thing I'd be happy
They'd write it on my grave, or when they scattered
My ashes
On second thoughts I'd rather hang around and be there
With my best friend
If she wants me
If I could do just one near perfect thing I'd be happy
They'd write it on my grave, or when they scattered
My ashes
On second thoughts I'd rather hang around and be there
With my best friend
If she wants me
If she wants me, yeah
If she wants me, yeah
If she wants me, yeah
"We got a young brother that stands for something! We got a young brother that believes in the all of us! Brother Kendrick Lamar! He's not a rapper, he's a writer, he's an author! And if you read between the lines, we'll learn how to love one another! But you can't do that-right on!-I said, you can't do that without loving yourself first. "
(This is a world premiere)
I done been through a whole lot
Trial, tribulation, but I know God
Satan wanna put me in a bow tie
Praying that the holy water don't go dry (get it, get it)
As I look around me
So many motherfuckers wanna down me
But an enemigo never drown me
In front of a dirty double-mirror they found me
And I love myself
(The world is a ghetto with big guns and picket signs)
I love myself
(But it can do what it want whenever it wants and I don't mind)
I love myself
(He said I gotta get up, life is more than suicide)
I love myself
(One day at a time, sun gon' shine)
Everybody looking at you crazy (Crazy)
What you gon' do? (What you gon' do?)
Lift up your head and keep moving (Keep moving)
Or let the paranoia haunt you? (Haunt you)
Peace to fashion police, I wear my heart
On my sleeve, let the runway start
You know the miserable do love company
What do you want from me and my scars?
Everybody lack confident, everybody lack confident
How many times our potential was anonymous?
How many times the city making me promises?
So I promise this
And I love myself
(The world is a ghetto with big guns and picket signs)
I love myself
(But it can do what it want whenever it wants and I don't mind)
I love myself
(He said I gotta get up, life is more than suicide)
I love myself
(One day at a time, sun gon' shine)
They wanna say there's a war outside and a bomb in the street
And a gun in the hood and a mob of police
And a rock on the corner and a line full of fiends
And a bottle full of lean and a model on a scheme, yup
These days of frustration, keep y'all on tuck and rotation
I duck these gold faces, post up fee-fi-fo-fum basis
Dreams of realities peace
Blow steam in the face of the beast
The sky can fall down, the wind can cry now
The strong in me, I still smile
And I love myself
(The world is a ghetto with big guns and picket signs)
I love myself
(But it can do what it want whenever it wants and I don't mind)
I love myself
(He said I gotta get up, life is more than suicide)
I love myself
(One day at a time, sun gon' shine)
Walk my bare feet (Walk my bare feet)
Down, down valley deep (Down, down valley deep)
I keep my fee-fi-fo-fum (Fee-fi-fo-fum)
I keep my heart undone (My heart undone)
And I love myself
(The world is a ghetto with big guns and picket signs)
I love myself
(But it can do what it want whenever it wants and I don't mind)
I love myself
(He said I gotta get up, life is more than suicide)
I love myself
(One day at a time, sun gon' shine)
I went to war last night
With an automatic weapon, don't nobody call a medic
Imma do it till I get it right
I went to war last night
I've been dealing with depression ever since an adolescent
Duckin' every other blessin', I can never see the message
I could never take the lead, I could never bob and weave
From a negative and letting 'em annihilate me
And its evident I'm moving at a meteor speed
Finna run into a building, lay my body in the street
Keep my money in the ceiling, let my mama know I'm free
Give my story to the children and the lesson they can read
And the glory to the feeling of the only unseen
Seen enough, make a motherfucker scream, "I love myself!"
I lost my head
I must misread what the good book said
Oh woes be me, it's a jungle inside
Give myself again till the well runs dry
You are eighteen year old girl, who live in small city of Japan
You heard me on the radio about one year ago
And you wanted to know, all about me, and my hobbies
My favorite food and my birthday
Why are you so far away from me?
I need help and you're way across the sea
I could never touch you, I think it would be wrong, oh
I've got your letter, you've got my song
They don't make stationery like this where I'm from so fragile, so refined
So I sniff (So I sniff)
And I lick (And I lick)
Your envelope and fall to little pieces every time
I wonder what clothes you wear to school
I wonder how you decorate your room
I wonder how you touch yourself and curse myself for being across the sea
Why are you so far away from me?
I need help and you're way across the sea
I could never touch you, I think it would be wrong, oh
I've got your letter, you've got my song
At ten, I shaved my head and tried to be a monk
I thought the older women would like me if I did
You see mom, I'm a good little boy (Good little boy)
It's all your fault, momma
It's all your fault (It's all your fault)
Goddamn, this business is really lame
I gotta live on an island to find the juice
So you send (So you send)
Me your love (Me your love)
From all around the world
As if I could live off words and dreams and a million screams
Oh, how I need a hand in mine to feel
Why are you so far away from me?
Why are you so far away from me?
I could never touch you, I think it would be wrong
I've got your letter, you've got my song
(I've got your letter) I've got your letter, you've got my song

You said you hate the sound
Of the buses on the ground
You said you hate the way they scrape their brakes all over town
Said pretend it's whales
Keeping their voices down
Such were the grounds for divorce I know
On the radio
And the bouncing body drone
Found eighteen reasons I can't pick up on the phone 
Said look at the clouds
It's a show all on its own
Such were the grounds for divorce I know
But the darling is dead
We hit her on the head
It looked like a wedding cake
But the darling is dead
We hit her on the head
It looked like a newlywed
But I look at the lovers
And they way they stand
And the way they move and the way move their hands
And I look at their babies
And their tiny little hands
And the way they get loved and the way they get loved
Oh look at the lovers
And they way they stand
And the way they move and the way move and the way move their hands
Said you hate the sound
Of the buses on the ground
Said you hate the way they scrape their brakes all over town
Said pretend it's whales
Keeping their voices down
Such were the grounds for divorce I know
Looked like a newlywed
On the radio
And the bouncing body drone
Found eighteen reasons I can't pick up on the phone
Said look at the clouds
It's a show all on its own
Such were the grounds, such were the grounds for divorce I know
You talk about life, you talk about death
And everything in between
Like it's nothing and the words are easy
You talk about me and talk about you
And everything I do
Like it's something that needs repeating
I don't need an alibi or for you to realize
The things we left unsaid
Are only taking space up in our heads
Make it my fault, win the game
Point the finger, place the blame
It does me up and down
It doesn't matter now
'Cause I don't care if I ever talk to you again
This is not about emotion
I don't need a reason not to care what you say
Or what happened in the end
This is my interpretation
And it don't, don't make sense
The first two weeks turn into ten
I hold my breath and wonder when it'll happen
Does it really matter?
If half of what you said is true
And half of what I didn't do could be different
Would it make it better?
If we forget the things we know
Would we have somewhere to go?
The only way is down, I can see that now
'Cause I don't care if I ever talk to you again
This is not about emotion
I don't need a reason not to care what you say
Or what happened in the end
This is my interpretation
And it don't, don't make sense
It's really not such a sacrifice
If I ever talk to you again
This is not about emotion
I don't need a reason not to care what you say
Or what happened in the end
This is my interpretation
And it don't, don't make sense
And it don't have to make no sense to you at all
'Cause this is my interpretation, yeah, yeah, yeah
Last night I had a dream we were inseparably entwined
Like a piece of rope made out of two pieces of vine
Held together, holding each other with no one else in mind
Like 2 atoms in a molecule inseparably combined
But then I woke from the dream to realize I was alone
A tragic event I must admit but let's not be overblown
I'm not trying to write a love song just a sad, pathetic moan
Maybe I just need a change, maybe I just need a new cologne
Now I look at love like being stabbed in the heart
You torture each other from day to day and then one day you part
Most of the time it's misery but there's some joy at the start
Oh, for that I'd say it's worth it, just use a blade that's short and sharp on me
And if love is just a game then how come it's no fun
If love is just a game how come I've never won
I guess maybe it's possible I might be playing it wrong
And that's why every time I roll the dice I always come undone
I'm starting to feel 
We stay together out of fear of dying alone
I've been slipping through the years 
My old clothes don't fit like they once did
So they hang like ghosts of the people I've been
It's like my heart can't be tamed
And I fall in love every day and I feel like a fool
I have to face the truth 
That no one could ever look at me like you do
Like I'm something worth holding on to
And there's times I think of leaving
But it's something I'll never do
'Cause you can do better than me
But I can't do better than you
You can do better than me
But I can't do better than you
There's somethin' 'bout the way the street looks when it's just rained
There's a glow off the pavement, you walk me to the car
And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there
In the middle of the parking lot, yeah
We're drivin' down the road, I wonder if you know
I'm tryin' so hard not to get caught up now
But you're just so cool, run your hands through your hair
Absent-mindedly makin' me want you
And I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me headfirst, fearless
And I don't know why but with you I dance
In a storm in my best dress, fearless
So baby drive slow 'til we run out of road
In this one horse town, I wanna stay right here
In this passenger seat, you put your eyes on me
In this moment, now capture it, remember it
'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me headfirst, fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress, fearless
Well, you stood there with me in the doorway
My hands shake, I'm not usually this way
But you pull me in and I'm a little more brave
It's the first kiss, it's flawless, really somethin'
It's fearless
'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me headfirst, fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress, fearless
'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me headfirst, fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress, fearless
Ah Ah Ah ah...
When I watch you, wanna do you, right where your standing, yeah...
Right on the foyer, on this dark day, right in plain view... Oh yeah...
Of the whole ghetto, the boot-stomped meadows, but we ignore that... yeah...
You're lovely baby, this war is crazy, I won't let you down, OH NO... no
No, I won't let them take you, wont let them take you,
Hell no no, oh no, I won't let them take you, won't let them take you,
Hell no no
No
Oh no no no
And when our city, vast and shitty, falls to the Axis, yeah...
They'll search the buildings, collect gold fillings, wallets, and rings... Oh yeah...
But Miss Black Eyeliner, You'd look finer, with each day in hiding, oh yeah...
Beneath the wormwood, ooh love me so good, they won't hear us screw away the day
I'll make you say no I won't let them take you, won't let them take you
(Alive, Alive, Alive with glory alive with glory)
Hell no no, whoa no, I won't let them take you, wont let them take you, hell no no
Our Treblinka is alive with the glory of love
Treblinka alive with glory of love yeah!
(Okay, speed it up go)
Should they catch us, and dispatch us to those separate work camps
I'll dream about you, I will not doubt you with the passing of time, oh yeah...
Should they kill me, your love will fill me as warm as the bullets, yeah...
I'll know my purpose, this war was worth this, I won't let you down
No I won't no I won't no I won't (alive) (alive with love, alive with love)
Hell no no, whoa no, I won't let them take you, won't let them take you
Hell no no... no, no
I opened my eyes last night
And saw you in the low light
Walking down by the bay on the shore
Staring up at the stars that aren't there anymore
I was feeling the night grow old
And you were looking so cold
So like an introvert, I drew my over-shirt
Around my arms and began to shiver violently before
You happened to look and see
The tunnels all around me
Running into the dark underground
All the subways around create a great sound
To my motion fatigue, farewell
With your ear to a seashell
You can hear the waves in underwater caves
As if you actually were inside a saltwater room
Time together isn't ever quite enough
When you and I are alone, I've never felt so at home
What will it take to make or break this hint of love?
Only time, only time
Can you believe that the crew has gone
And they wouldn't let me sign on?
All my islands have sunk in the deep
And I can hardly relax or even oversleep
But I feel warm with your hand in mine
When we walk along the shoreline
I guess we'll never know why sparrows love the snow
We'll turn out all of the lights and set this ballroom aglow
(So tell me darling, do you wish we'd fall in love?)
(Yeah, all the time)
(All the time)
Time together isn't ever quite enough
When you and I are alone, I've never felt so at home
What will it take to make or break this hint of love?
Only time, only time
When we're apart whatever are you thinking of?
If this is what I call home, why does it feel so alone?
So tell me darling, do you wish we'd fall in love?
All the time, all the time
Time together isn't ever quite enough
When we're apart whatever are you thinking of?
What will it take to make or break this hint of love?
So tell me darling, do you wish we'd fall in love?
All the time, oh all the time
You and I buy star maps and drive my car around Los Angeles
You and I buy star maps and ding dong ditch a televangelist
It's only been a week
But I know that you are mine to keep
You are a radar detector
I drive 1,000 miles an hour
I won't go on and on
But you are always looking out for me
You and I go shopping and find exactly what we're looking for
You and I go shopping and fall asleep inside the mattress store.
We cruise the neighborhood
But it's not supposed to feel this good
You are a radar detector
I drive 1,000 miles an hour
I won't go on and on
But you are always looking out for me because
You are a radar detector
You are a radar detector
I drive 1,000 miles an hour
I won't go on and on and on and 
You are always looking out for me
When I'm driving around, you are a radar detector
Though you've gone away this morning, you'll be back again tonight
Telling me there'll be no next time if I just don't treat you right
You'll never leave me and you know it's true
'Cause you like me too much and I like you
You've tried before to leave me but you haven't got the nerve
To walk out and make me lonely which is all that I deserve
You'll never leave me and you know it's true
'Cause you like me too much and I like you
I really do and it's nice when you believe me
If you leave me I will follow you and bring you back where you belong
'Cause I couldn't really stand it, I'd admit that I was wrong
I wouldn't let you leave me 'cause it's true
'Cause you like me too much and I like you
'Cause you like me too much and I like you
I really do and it's nice when you believe me
If you leave me, I will follow you and bring you back where you belong
'Cause I couldn't really stand it I'd admit that I was wrong
I wouldn't let you leave me 'cause it's true
'Cause you like me too much and I like you
'Cause you like me too much and I like you

Don't you worry there, my honey 
We might not have any money 
But we've got our love to pay the bills 
Maybe I think you're cute and funny 
Maybe I wanna do what bunnies do with you 
If you know what I mean 
Oh, let's get rich and buy our parents homes in the South of France 
Let's get rich and give everybody nice sweaters and teach them how to dance 
Let's get rich and build a house on a mountain 
Making everybody look like ants from way up there, 
You and I, you and I 
Well, you might be a bit confused 
And you might be a little bit bruised 
But baby, how we spoon like no one else 
So I will help you read those books 
If you will soothe my worried looks 
And we will put the lonesome on the shelf 
Oh, let's get rich and buy our parents homes in the South of France 
Let's get rich and give everybody nice sweaters and teach them how to dance 
Let's get rich and build a house on a mountain 
Making everybody look like ants from way up there, 
You and I, you and I

You and I, you and I
Run the lip off sunshine shore
Betray white water, delay dark forms
Slap young waves on wooden bones
Don't touch the laughter and away we go
Away we go (And away we go)
Away we go (Away we go)
Away we go (And away we go)
Away we go (Away)
Clap your hands (But I feel so lonely)
Clap your hands (But it won't do nothing)
Just clap your hands (But I have no money)
Just clap your hands (But it don't seem like me)
Yeah, clap your hands (Are you up to something?)
Clap your hands (Where's my milk and honey?)
Just clap your hands (But I just look funny)
And clap your hands
I'll just wait awhile
As time alone stands still for some
Stuffed sailor up, up with eyeball sun
And if by castle ship should stray
It has like you no chosen fate
For it's tongue-tied caboose that leads this ragged lad
This finger-flipping mom and dad 
For what is worth some aimless steer
And should not confuse my foggy mirror
Reveal what is not there 
I shall take this unbound train and flow away
You and me we're meant to be
Walking free in harmony
One fine day we'll fly away
Don't you know that Rome wasn't built in a day, hey hey hey
In this day and age it's so easy to stress
'Cause people are strange and you can never second guess
In order to love child we got to be strong
I'm caught in the crossfire why can't we get along
'Cause you and me we're meant to be
Walking free in harmony
One fine day we'll fly away
Don't you know that Rome wasn't built in a day
I'm having a daydream, we're getting somewhere
I'm kissing your lips and running fingers through your hair
I'm as nervous as you 'bout making it right
Though we know we were wrong, we can't give up the fight
Oh no
'Cause you and me we're meant to be
Walking free in harmony
One fine day we'll run away
Don't you know that Rome wasn't built in a day
You and me we're meant to be
Walking free in harmony
One fine day we'll fly away
Don't you know that Rome wasn't built in a day
You and me (you and me) we're meant to be (meant to be)
Walking free (walking free) in harmony (in harmony)
One fine day (one fine day) we'll run away
(We're gonna run away, we're gonna run away)
Don't you know that Rome wasn't built in a day
You and me (you and me) we're meant to be (meant to be)
Walking free (walking free) in harmony (in harmony)
One fine day (one fine day) we'll fly away
(We're gonna run away, we're gonna run away)
Don't you know that Rome wasn't built in a day
She said you'd given up,
Your folks told me you should be left alone,
On a mountain top
Knocking the aeroplanes down with stones.
Do the whirlwind
And carry the hope that stings all night long,
Don't abandon him
'Cause he quivers when he hears your song.
Believe me, it's safe to see,
At least be confused about right and wrong,
Plan to settle down,
Over the moon under the sun.
Do the whirlwind,
And shotgun the seat that beats (beats)
Hanging on to the one you love
To keep, keepin', sleepin', dreamin' on.
Folks given up under the quivers and lines,
You do the whirlwind,
Don't abandon,
Get a handle of yourself, son
(Oh... oh oh oh oh...)
(Do the whirlwind, do the whirlwind...)
Everyday, it's a-gettin' closer
Goin' faster than a roller coaster
Love like yours will surely come my way
A-hey, a-hey hey
Everyday, it's a-gettin' faster
Everyone said, "Go ahead and ask her"
Love like yours will surely come my way
A-hey, a-hey hey
Everyday seems a little longer
Every way, love's a little stronger
Come what may, do you ever long for
True love from me?
Everyday, it's a-gettin' closer
Goin' faster than a roller coaster
Love like yours will surely come my way
A-hey, a-hey hey
Everyday seems a little longer
Every way, love's a little stronger
Come what may, do you ever long for
True love from me?
Everyday, it's a-gettin' closer
Goin' faster than a roller coaster
Love like yours will surely come my way
A-hey, a-hey hey
Love like yours will surely come my way
Having trouble telling
How I feel
But I can dance, dance, dance
Couldn't possibly tell you
How I mean
But I can dance, dance, dance
So when I trip on my feet
Look at the beat
It was all
Written in the sand
When I'm shaking my hips
Look for the swing
It was all
Written in the air
Oh dance
I was a dancer all along
Dance, dance, dance
Words can never make up for what you do
Easy conversations
There's no such thing
Oh, I'm shy, shy, shy
My hips they lie
'Cause in reality, aye
I'm shy shy shy
When I trip on my feet
Look at the ground
The words are
Written in the dust
Well I'm shaking my hips
Look for the swing
The words are
Written in the air
Oh dance
I was a dancer all along
Dance, dance, dance
Now words can never make up for what you do
Oh dance
I was a dancer all along
Dance, dance, dance
Now words can never make up for what you do
Oh, Billy Brown had lived an ordinary life
Two kids, a dog, and then the cautionary wife
But while it was all going accordingly to plan
Then Billy Brown fell in love with another man
He met his lover almost every single day
Making excuses for his dodgy holiday
On some religion that he said he newly found
They didn't know that his faith was earthly bound
Brown, oh, Billy Brown
Don't let the stars get you down
Don't let the waves let you drown
Brown, oh, Billy Brown
Gonna pick you up like a paper cup
Gonna shake the water out of every nook
Oh, Billy Brown
Oh, Billy Brown needed a place, somewhere to go
He found an island off the coast of Mexico
Leaving his lover and his family behind
Oh, Billy Brown needed to find some peace of mind
And on his journey and his travels on the way
He met a girlie who was brave enough to say
When they made love he shared the burden of his mind
Oh, Billy Brown you are a victim of the times
Brown, oh, Billy Brown
Don't let the stars get you down
Don't let the waves let you drown
Brown, oh, Billy Brown
Gonna pick you up like a paper cup
Gonna shake the water out of every nook
Oh, Billy Brown
Brown, oh, Billy Brown
Gonna pick you up like a paper cup
Gonna shake the water out of every nook
Oh, Billy Brown
Oh, Billy Brown had lived an ordinary life
Two kids, a dog, and then the cautionary wife
While it was all going accordingly to plan
Then Billy Brown fell in love with another man
Said the voice from afar
"Don't you know it doesn't have to be so hard?"
Waiting for everyone else around to agree might take too long
Might take too long
Then it won't be so hard (It won't be so hard)
Well it's true, yes, but you won't get far telling me
That you are all you're meant to be
When the one from our dream
Is sitting right next to me
And I don't know what to do
Oh, alter ego
Get them to love you
While they may depending on your heart and wealth
The only one who's really judging you is yourself
Nobody else, nobody else
If I could part
It wouldn't be so hard (It won't be so hard)
Well it's true, yes, but you won't get far telling me
That you are all you're meant to be
When the one from our dream
Is sitting right next to me
And I don't know what to do
Oh, alter ego
Brown eyes and lungs are filled up with smoke
Fast lives we're stuck in the undertow
But you know the places I wanna go
Cause oh oh oh
I've got a sickness, you've got the cure
You've got the spark I've been lookin' for
And I've got a plan, we walk out the door
You know you wanna
Just let go
It's time to roll down the windows
And sing it oh oh oh
We got all we need so here we go
Turn it up
It's five minutes to midnight
You're coming home with me tonight
I can't get enough
Shakin' me up
Turn it up
All right, at five minutes to midnight
We'll see our name in city lights
We'll make the clock stop
Make your heart drop and come alive
We could
Pack up and leave all our things behind
No fact or fiction or storyline
'Cause I need you more than just for tonight
You're oh oh oh like air
I can't stop my breathing in
I'm weak and you are my medicine
I won't stop till I am under your skin
You know you wanna
Just let go
It's time to roll down the windows
Sing it oh oh oh
Yeah all we need so here we go
Turn it up
It's five minutes to midnight
You're coming home with me tonight
I can't get enough
Shakin' me up
Turn it up
All right, at five minutes to midnight
We'll see our name in city lights
We'll make the clock stop
Make your heart drop and come alive
And when the clock strikes twelve
Will you find another boy to go and kiss and tell?
Cause you know I never will
I think we should strike a match
We'll hold it to the wind to and see how long it lasts
We can make the time stand still
Turn it up
It's five minutes to midnight
You're coming home with me tonight
I can't get enough
Shakin' me up
Turn it up
All right, at five minutes to midnight
We'll see our name in city lights
We'll make the clock stop
Make your heart drop and come alive
Turn it up

You're coming home with me tonight
I can't get enough
Shakin' me up
Turn it up
All right, at five minutes to midnight
We'll see our name in city lights
We'll make the clock stop
Make your heart drop and come alive
I almost got drunk at school at fourteen
Where I almost made out with the homecoming queen
Who almost went on to be Miss Texas
But lost to a slut with much bigger breast-es
I almost dropped out to move to L.A.
Where I was almost famous for almost a day
And I almost had you
But I guess that doesn't cut it
Almost loved you
I almost wished you would have loved me, too
I almost held up a grocery store
Where I almost did five years and then seven more
'Cause I almost got popped for a fight with a thug
'Cause he almost made off with a bunch of the drugs
That I almost got hooked on, 'cause you ran away
And I wish I would've had the nerve to ask you to stay
And I almost had you
But I guess that doesn't cut it
Almost had you
And I didn't even know it
You kept me guessing
And now I'm destined
To spend my time missing you
I almost wish you would have loved me, too
Here I go thinkin' 'bout all the things I could have done
I'm gonna need a forklift, 'cause all the baggage weighs a ton (baggage weighs a ton)
I know we had our problems, I can't remember one.
I almost forgot to say something else
And if I can't fit it in, I'll keep it all to myself
I almost wrote a song about you today
But I tore it all up and then I threw it away
And I almost had you
But I guess that doesn't cut it
Almost had you
And I didn't even know it
You kept me guessin'
And now I'm destined
To spend my time missin' you
I almost had you
Almost had you
I almost wished you would've loved me, too
Wished you would have loved me, too
Can I wake you up?

Saw you hanging out with your eyes looking down 
And it's all wasted now. 
Told you but you can't take it.

Can you feel it?
Now it's coming back
We can steal it
If we bridge this gap
I can see you
Through the curtains of the waterfall
When I lost it
Yeah you held my hand
But I tossed it
Didn't understand
You were waiting
As I dove into the waterfall
So say Geronimo!
Say Geronimo!
Say Geronimo!
Say Geronimo!
Say Geronimo!
Say Geronimo!
Say Geronimo!
Can you feel my love?
Bombs away
Bombs away
Bombs away
Can you feel (my love, my love, my love, my love, my love) my love?
Bombs away
Bombs away
Bombs away
Say Geronimo!
Well we rushed it
Moving way too fast
And we crushed it
But it's in the past
We can make this leap
Through the curtains of the waterfall
So say Geronimo!
Say Geronimo!
Say Geronimo!
Say Geronimo!
Say Geronimo!
Say Geronimo!
Say Geronimo!
Can you feel (my love, my love, my love, my love, my love) my love?
Bombs away
Bombs away
Bombs away
Can you feel (my love, my love, my love, my love, my love) my love?
Bombs away
Bombs away
Bombs away
Well I'm just a boy
With a broken toy
All lost and coy
At the curtains of the waterfall
So it's here I stand
As a broken man
But I've found my friend
At the curtains of the waterfall
Now I'm falling down
Through the crashing sound
And you've come around
At the curtains of the waterfall
And you rushed to me
And it sets us free
So I fall to my knees
At the curtains of the waterfall
So say Geronimo!
Say Geronimo!
Say Geronimo!
Say Geronimo!
Say Geronimo!
Say Geronimo!
Say Geronimo!
Say Geronimo!
Say Geronimo!
Say Geronimo!
Say Geronimo!

Say Geronimo!
Make this leap
Make this leap
Make this leap
Make this leap
Can you feel my love?
Slow down, you move too fast
You've got to make the morning last
Just kickin' down the cobble stones
Looking for fun and feeling groovy
Ba da-da-da da da, feelin' groovy
Hello lamppost, what'cha knowin'?
I've come to watch your flowers growin'
Ain'tcha got no rhymes for me?
Do-in do do, feelin' groovy
Ba da-da-da da da, feelin' groovy
I got no deeds to do, no promises to keep
I'm dappled and drowsy and ready to sleep
Let the morning-time drop all its petals on me
Life I love you, all is groovy
Watch out Cupid 
Stuck me with a sickness
Pull your little arrows out
Let me live my life
You better watch out Cupid
Stuck me with a sickness
Pull your little arrows out
And let me live my life
The one I'd better lead
All the blondes are fantasies
And we looked at them eleven ways
You said, "Look at me", and looked away
And you wrote the song I wanna play
I'll write you harmony in C
Everybody, everybody just wanna fall in love
Everybody, everybody just wanna play the lead
Everybody, everybody just wanna fall in love
Everybody, everybody just wanna play the lead
Play the lead, play the lead
Watch out Cupid
Money is a sick muse
Pull your little arrows out
And let me live my life
She said, "I'm with stupid"
Money is a sick muse
Pull your little arrows out 
Let me live my life
The one I'd better lead
All the blondes are fantasies
And we looked at them eleven ways
You said, "Look at me", and looked away
And you wrote the song I wanna play
I'll write you harmony in C
Everybody, everybody just wanna fall in love
Everybody, everybody just wanna play the lead
Everybody, everybody just wanna fall in love
Everybody, everybody just wanna play the lead
Play the lead, play the lead
I'll write you harmony in C
Everybody, everybody just wanna fall in love
Everybody, everybody just wanna play the lead
Everybody, everybody just wanna fall in love
Everybody, everybody just wanna play the lead
Play the lead, play the lead
When you walk by every night
Talking sweet and looking fine
I get kind of hectic inside
Baby, I'm so into you
Darling, if you only knew
All the things that flow through my mind
But it's just a
Sweet, sweet fantasy baby
When I close my eyes you come and you take me
On and on and on
It's so deep in my daydream
But it's just a
Sweet, sweet fantasy baby
Images of rapture
Creep into me slowly
As you go into my head
And my heart beats faster
When you take me over
Time and time and time again
But it's just a
Sweet, sweet fantasy baby
When I close my eyes you come and you take me
On and on and on
It's so deep in my daydream
But it's just a
Sweet, sweet fantasy baby
It's just a sweet...
Sweet, sweet fantasy baby
When I close my eyes you come and you take me
On and on and on
It's so deep in my daydream
But it's just a
Sweet, sweet fantasy baby
I'm in heaven
With my boyfriend
My laughing boyfriend
There's no beginning
And there is no end
Feels like I'm dreaming but
I'm not sleeping
Sweet, sweet fantasy baby
When I close my eyes you come and you take me
On and on and on
It's so deep in my daydream
But it's just a
Sweet, sweet fantasy baby (x2)
Sweet, sweet fantasy baby
Sweet, sweet fantasy baby
Fantasy
The rain it started tapping
On the window near my bed
There was a loophole in my dreaming
So I got out of it
And to my surprise my eyes were wide and already open
Just my nightstand and my dresser
Where those nightmares had just been
So I dressed myself and left then
Out into the gray streets
But everything seemed different
And completely new to me
The sky the trees, houses, buildings, even my own body
And each person I encountered
I couldn't wait to meet
And I came upon a doctor
Who appeared in quite poor health
I said there's nothing that I can do for you you can't do for yourself
He said oh yes you can, just hold my hand, I think that that would help
So I sat with him awhile
Then I asked him how he felt
He said I think I'm cured
No, in fact, I'm sure of it
Thank you, stranger
For your therapeutic smile
So that's how I learned the lesson
That everyone's alone
And your eyes must do some raining
If you're ever gonna grow
And when crying don't help
You can't compose yourself
It's best to compose a poem
An honest verse of longing
Or a simple song of hope
That's why I'm singing baby don't worry
'Cause now I got your back
And every time you feel like crying
I'm gonna try and make you laugh
And if I can't
If it just hurts too bad
Then we'll wait for it to pass
And I will keep you company for those days so long and black
And we'll keep working on the problem
We know we'll never solve
Of love's uneven remainders
Our lives are fractions of a whole
But if the world could remain within a frame
Like a painting on a wall
Then I think we'd see the beauty then
We'd stand staring in awe
At our still lives posed
Like a bowl of oranges
Like a story told
By the fault-lines and the soil
The beats yeah, they were coming out the speakers
And were winding up straight in your sneakers
And I'm dancing like every song he spins is bis
Or like all my dance heroes would if they existed
And yeah it's sad that you think that we're all just scenesters
And even if we were it's not the scene you're thinking of
To taking props from nineties boy band fashions
All crop tops and testosterone passion
If there's one thing that I could never confess
It's that I can't dance a single step
It's you, it's me
And there's dancing
It's you, it's me
And there's dancing
Not sure if you mind if I dance with you
But I don't think right now you care about anything at all
If only there were clothes on the floor
I'd feel for certain I was bedroom dancing
And it's all flailing limbs at the front line
Every single one of us is twisted by design
And dispatches from the back of my mind
Says as long as we're here everything is all right
If there's one thing that I could never confess
It's that I can't dance a single step
It's you, it's me
And there's dancing
It's you, it's me
And there's dancing
If there's one thing that I could never confess
It's that I can't dance a single step
One thing that I could never confess
It's that I can't dance a single step
It's you, it's me
And there's dancing
It's you, it's me
And there's dancing
It's you, it's me
And there's dancing
It's you, it's me
And there's dancing
And I always get confused,
Because in supermarkets they turn the lights off when they want you to leave,
But in discos they turn them on.
And it's always sad to go, but it's never that sad,
Because there's only so many places you're guaranteed of getting a hug when you leave.
And then on the way home, it always seems like a good idea to go paddling in the fountain, and that's because it IS a good idea.
And were just like, how Rousseau depicts man in the state of nature:
We're undeveloped, we're ignorant, we're stupid, but we're happy.
Well, look at the kid from school
He's teaching mamas and papas how to be a little cool
He's changing fashion, the way he dress
The tracksuits are old, and the hoodie's way too moody
For a kid with the will to funk
He dances in secret, he's a part-time punk
Now she's getting off the plane
She wants to write a thesis on the population underprivileged
The kids fighting up the lane
Shoplifting, just drifting
Like The Switchblade and the Cross
But if there's trouble she's got the moves
She's taking an elementary class in kung fu
I left my washing in the launderette
You can put some money on it, you can place a little bet
That when I see my washing
The black will be gray and the white will be gray
But the blues are still blue
I'm crying out for my mum
If the malady don't go away we're in a little trouble
With the boss of the company
I'm a singer, a swinger, I'm a layabout but laying on
The dock in the lazy sun
Will never quite relegate me to a bum
I left my lady in the launderette
You can put some money on it, you can place a little bet
That when I see my lady
The black will be white and the white will be black
But the blues are still blue
Oh, baby, I love your face (Baby, I love your face)
I've been creeping round this town because
Well, creeping's just my way
But with a little wink I'll be there (Little wink I'll be there)
I'll be excited for a week, but then excitement starts to fade
I know you're young, but you're out of touch
You're French, your vocabulary's not quite formed
I left my homework in the launderette
I got a letter from my mama which my stupid dog has ate
I hid behind the fence
Here comes the deputy head with the bark of a bulldog
He's not making much sense
I left my lady in the launderette
You can put some money on it, you can place a little bet
That when I see my lady
The black will be white and the white will be black
But the blues are still blue
I left my lady in the launderette
You can put some money on it, you can place a little bet
That when I see my lady
The black will be white and the white will be black
But the blues are still blue
We lay on the bed there
Kissing just for practice
Could we please be objective?
Cause the other boys are queuing up behind us
A hand over my mouth
A hand over the window
Well, if I remain passive and you just want to cuddle
Then we should be ok, and we won't get in a muddle
'Cause we're seeing other people
At least that's what we say we are doing
How are you feeling?
I don't think you can be dealing
With the situation very well
You take a lover for a dirty weekend, that's ok
But when it's over
You are looking at the working week through the eyes of a gigolo
You're kissing your elbow
You're kissing your reflection
And you can't understand why all the other boys are going for the
New, tall, elegant rich kids
You can bet it is a bitch, kid
But if they don't see the quality then it is apparent that
You're going to have to change
Or you're going to have to go with girls
You might be better off
At least they know where to put it
We lay on the bed there
Kissing just for practice
Could we please be objective?
Cause the other boys are queuing up behind us
A hand over my mouth
A hand over the window
Well, if I remain passive and you just want to cuddle
Then we should be ok, and we won't get in a muddle
'Cause we're seeing other people
At least that's what we say we are doing

Now all the secrets of old age
They tell us we should really stop
Now they implore us oh
They should adore us oh
It's been a year and now we find
We're lost behind enemy lines
They're gunning for us oh
They never even met us oh
Now what happened to our heavy metal?
Now what happened to our coat of arms?
We will find that we're stuck in the middle
Picking up the pieces of our hearts
And there will be no comfort
For all that we have lost
The actors seemed so happy
But somehow ended all washed up
Now what happened to my heavy metal?
Guess what happened to my coat of arms?
We will find that we're stuck in the middle
Picking up the pieces of our hearts
Oh angel sent from up above
You know you make my world light up
When I was down, when I was hurt
You came to lift me up...
Life is a drink and love's a drug
Oh now I think I must be miles up
When I was a river dried up
You came to rain a flood
You said 'drink from me, drink from me'
When I was so thirsty
Poured on a symphony
Now I just can't get enough
Put your wings on me, wings on me
When I was so heavy
Poured on a symphony
When I'm low low low low
I oh I oh II oh...
Got me feeling drunk and high
So high so high
Oh I oh I oh I
Now I'm feeling drunk and high
So high so high...
Oh angel sent from up above
I feel you coursing through my blood
Life is a drink, your love's about
To make the stars come out
Put your wings on me, wings on me
When I was so heavy
Poured on a symphony
When I'm low low low low...
I oh I oh I...
You got me feeling drunk and high
So high so high
Oh I oh I oh I...
Now I'm feeling drunk and high
So high so high
I oh I oh I...
La la la la la la la
So high so high
Oh I oh I oh I
Now I'm feeling drunk and high
So high so high
That I shoot across the sky
That I shoot across the
That I shoot across the sky
Watch me shoot across the...
Jane, I've made it plain,
Although I'm faded as a ghost
I want you here inside me,
Say the word.
Oh, you've been playing nice,
But I can see it in your eyes
You're thinking, "Christ,
He's everybody's girl."
You can't spend the night...
Jane, I've seen you at the club
You were tearin' up the rug
With no regard for form,
You're such a brute!
You had a ready elbow
For the girls you hate or just don't know.
You head-butt me,
'Cause you thought it was cute.
You can't spend the night...
Yes, I'm sure you're right
You can't spend the night...
Yeah, I'm sure you're right.
You can't spend the night...
Yes, I'm sure you're right.
But we could spend the night together
Or alone, that would be better
It's Friday night and I ain't got nobody
Oh, what's the use of making a bed?
I took something and it feels like karate
It's kicked me down and left me for dead.
It's Friday night and I ain't got nobody
So what's the use of pulling a shape?
I put what I want, when I want, in my body
I'm never gonna give what I take
Jane, I've seen the pain you've dealt
You've been with all my friends
You tell me guard my heart,
I might get hurt.
No doubt you'll hurt my feelings,
And it's a given I'll be kneeling
But I'm telling myself
That it's gonna be worth it.
You can't spend the night...
Yes, I'm sure you're right
You can't spend the night...
Yeah, I'm sure you're right.
You can't spend the night...
Yes, I'm sure you're right.
But we could spend the night together
Or alone, that would be better
It's Friday night and I ain't got nobody
Oh, what's the use of making a bed?
I took something and it feels like karate
It's kicked me down and left me for dead.
It's Friday night and I ain't got nobody

One thing that I just can't conceive
Is how to let you go.
And if you will stay here with me
Then we will always know.
We will find out
As we change about.
Is this the last part?
Here is when we shout:
One thing that I just can't conceive
Is how to let you go.
These days await if we believe
I'll make it to the show.
We will find out
As we change about.
Is this the last part?
Here is when we shout:
And you could say, "Your love to me,"
But I was far away.
And you could be a love to me,
But I was far away.
And you could say "Your love to me",
That I was far away.
And you could be a love to me,
But I was far away.
I've lost myself once and I see
That I was weak at heart.
And if you will stay here with me
We face the hardest part.
We will find out
As we change about.
Is this the last part?
Here is one we shout:
And you could say, "Your love to me,"
But I was far away.
And you could be a love to me,
But I was far away.
And you could say "Your love to me",
That I was far away.
And you could be a love to me,
But I was far away.
If you believe a hand on your sleeve
Can pull you over,
Because you know wherever you go
I'll be over your shoulder.
If you believe a hand on your faith
Can pull you over,
Because you know wherever you go
I'll be over your shoulder.
And you could say, "Your love to me,"
But I was far away.
And you could be a love to me,
But I was far away.
Let's have bizarre celebrations... let's forget who, forget what, forget where.
We'll have bizarre celebrations... I'll play the Satyr in Cyprus, you the bride being stripped bare.
Let's pretend we don't exist, let's pretend we're in Antarctica.
Let's pretend we don't exist, let's pretend we're in Antarctica.
Let's have bizarre celebrations... let's forget when, forget what, forget how.
We'll have bizarre celebrations... we'll play Tristan and Iseult, but make sure I see white sails.
Let's pretend we don't exist, let's pretend we're in Antarctica.
Let's pretend we don't exist, let's pretend we're in Antarctica.
Maybe I'll never die, I'll just keep growing younger with you, and you'll grow younger, too.
Now it seems too lovely to be true, but I know the best things always do.
Let's pretend we don't exist, let's pretend we're in Antarctica.
Let's pretend we don't exist, let's pretend we're in Antarctica.
Let's pretend we don't exist, let's pretend we're in Antarctica.
Let's pretend we don't exist, let's pretend we're in Antarctica.
Let's pretend we don't exist, let's pretend we're in Antarctica.
Let's pretend we don't exist, let's pretend we're in Antarctica.
Let's pretend we don't exist, let's pretend we're in Antarctica.
Let's pretend we don't exist, let's pretend we're in Antarctica.
Baby Britain feels the best
Floating over a sea of vodka
Separated from the rest
Fights problems with bigger problems
Sees the ocean fall and rise
Counts the waves that somehow didn't hit her
Water pouring from her eyes
Alcoholic and very bitter
For someone half as smart
You'd be a work of art
You put yourself apart
And I can't help until you start
We knocked another couple back
The dead soldiers lined up on the table
Still prepared for an attack
They didn't know they'd been disabled
Felt a wave a rush of blood
You won't be happy 'til the bottle's broken
And you're out swimming in the flood
You kept back, you kept unspoken
For someone half as smart
You'd be a work of art
You put yourself apart
And I can't help you until you start
You got a look in your eye
When you're saying "goodbye"
Like you wanna say "hi"
The light was on but it was dim
Revolver's been turned over
And now it's ready once again
The radio was playing "Crimson and Clover"
London bridge is safe and sound
No matter what you keep repeating
Nothing's gonna drag me down
To a death that's not worth cheating
For someone half as smart
You'd be a work of art
You put yourself apart
And I can't help until you start
For someone half as smart
You'd be a work of art
You put yourself apart
Baby, I've been waiting for you
Don't run away now
You've got nothing to lose
Baby, I feel so alone
And I need someone
To call my own
'Cause my love has just left me
And I need someone new
Who can tell me forever
And my eyes are on you
Baby, oh baby, oh baby
Come to me
Baby, I've been waiting on you
Don't run away now
You've got nothing to lose
Baby, I feel so alone
And I need someone
To call my own
I sit and think about the day that you're gonna die
Cause your wrinkled eyes betray the joy with which you smile
Care to see my reason?
Care to put your life in mine?
Looking at life from the perspective of a boy
Who's learned to love you but has also learned to grow
Could we make it better?
Stormy weather is so I do not
Ah, ah, ah, is there anybody home?
Who will believe me, won't deceive me, won't try to change me?
Ah, ah, ah, is there anybody home?
Who wants to have me just to love me?
Stuck in the middle
I look at you, you look at me, we bite each other
And with your bitter words you kick me in the gutter
But my troops are bigger than yours
You'll never stand my fight
Ours is a family that's based upon tradition
But with my careless words I tread upon your vision
Are five kids better than one Who doesn't like to be gone?
Ah, ah, ah, is there anybody home?
Who will believe me, won't deceive me, won't try to change me?
Ah, ah, ah, is there anybody home?
Who wants to have me just to love me?
Stuck in the middle
This is to my name
This ain't a greater plan to break your heart over me
I know that what I've started
Means that when we have parted
I can live in honesty
Ah, ah, ah, is there anybody home?
Who will believe me, won't deceive me, won't try to change me?
Ah, ah, ah, is there anybody home?
Who wants to have me just to love me?
Stuck in the middle
Stuck in the middle
Stuck in the middle
Stuck in the middle
8 o'clock, Monday night and I'm waiting
To finally talk to a girl a little cooler than me
Her name is Nona, she's a rocker with a nose ring
She wears a two-way, but I'm not quite sure what that means
And when she walks
All the wind blows and the angels sing
But she doesn't notice me
'Cause she's watching wrestling
Creaming over tough guys
Listening to rap metal
Turntables in her eyes
It's like a bad movie
She's looking through me
If you were me, then you'd be
Screaming someone shoot me
As I fail miserably
Trying to get the girl all the bad guys want
'Cause she's the girl all the bad guys want
She likes the Godsmack and I like Agent Orange
Her CD changer's full of singers that are mad at their dad
She says she'd like to score some reefer and a forty
She'll never know that I'm the best that she'll never have
And when she walks
All the wind blows and the angels sing
She'll never notice me
'Cause she's watching wrestling
Creaming over tough guys
Listening to rap metal
Turntables in her eyes
She likes 'em with a mustache
Racetrack season pass
Drivin' in a Trans Am
Does a mullet make a man?
It's like a bad movie
She's looking through me
If you were me, then you'd be
Screaming someone shoot me
As I fail miserably
Trying to get the girl all the bad guys want
'Cause she's the girl all the bad guys want
'Cause she's the girl all the bad guys want
'Cause she's the girl all the bad guys want
There she goes again with fishnets on
And dreadlocks in her hair
She broke my heart, I wanna be sedated
All I wanted was to see her naked
Now I'm watching wrestling
Trying to be a tough guy
Listening to rap metal
Turntables in my eyes
I can't grow a mustache
And I ain't got no season pass
All I got's a moped (moped, moped)
It's like a bad movie
She's looking through me
If you were me, then you'd be
Screaming someone shoot me
As I fail miserably
Trying to get the girl all the bad guys want
'Cause she's the girl all the bad guys want
'Cause she's the girl all the bad guys want
'Cause she's the girl all the bad guys want
'Cause she's the girl all the bad guys want (There she goes again)
'Cause she's the girl all the bad guys want
'Cause she's the girl all the bad guys want (There she goes again)
'Cause she's the girl all the bad guys want
'Cause she's the girl all the bad guys want
Sheepdog standing in the rain
Bullfrog doing it again
Some kind of happiness is measured out in miles
What makes you think you're something special when you smile?
Childlike, no one understands
Jack-knife in your sweaty hands
Some kind of innocence is measured out in years
You don't know what it's like to listen to your fears
You can talk to me
You can talk to me
You can talk to me
If you're lonely, you can talk to me
Big man (yeah?) walking in the park
Wigwam frightened of the dark
Some kind of solitude is measured out in you
You think you know me, but you haven't got a clue
You can talk to me
You can talk to me
You can talk to me
If you're lonely, you can talk to me
Hey!
Hey, bulldog
Hey, bulldog
Hey, bulldog
Hey, bulldog
Hey, man
What's that, boy?
Ruff!
 What do you say?
I say, "Woof!"
Do you know any more?
Awoo arf!
Ah-ha-ha!
You've got it! That's it! You've got it! That's it, man! Whoo! That's it, you've got it!
Don't look at me, man, I only have ten children. Hoo!
Ah-ho! Ha-ha-ha aarrh ha-ha-ha!
Quiet, boy, quiet!
Okay
Quiet!
Hey, bulldog
Hey, bulldog
It's hard to be ignored
When I look at you, you look so bored
My baby, my darling, I've been takin' a beating
Well, all right (Well, all right)
It's okay (It's okay)
We all get the slip sometimes every day
I'll just keep it to myself
In the sun
In the sun
It's hard to take the blame
When I look at you, you're so ashamed
My baby, my darling, I've been thinkin' of leaving
Well, all right (Well, all right)
It's okay (It's okay)
We all get the slip sometimes every day
I'll just keep it to myself
In the sun
In the sun
Well, all right (Well, all right)
It's okay (It's okay)
We all feel ashamed sometimes every day
I'll just keep it to myself
In the sun
In the sun
There was a time I was down, down
I didn't know what to do
I was just stumbling around, around
Thinking things could not improve
I couldn't look on the bright side
Of anything at all
That's when you gave me a call
And I feel better
Better
Better than before
I feel better
Better
Now I'm not down any more
There were times I was sure, so sure
I couldn't turn it around
I couldn't care anymore
About the good things I found
That's when you gave me a reason
To make me smile again
I only have to see you and then
I feel better
Better
Better than before
I feel better
Better
Now I'm not down any more
I feel better
Better
Better than before
I feel better
Better
Now I'm not down any more
Life sometimes seems to get the best of you
Like everything just brings you down
Just when you think
There's nothing you can do
A friendly face will bring you around
And you'll feel better
You'll feel better
You'll feel better
Better than before
You'll feel better
Much better
No you won't be down any more
We could let this love be the fading sky
We could drift all night until the new sun rise
Pass me a drink or maybe two
One for me and one for you
And we'll be free-ee-ee-ee-ee
Free-ee-ee-ee-ee
Free-ee-ee-ee-ee
Free-ee-ee-ee-ee
Here comes corner winds and the changin' tide
We better drop them sails and get inside
When will the weather ever let us go
I guess we'll have to wait until the trade winds blow
When we'll be free-ee-ee-ee-ee
Free-ee-ee-ee-ee
Free-ee-ee-ee-ee
Free-ee-ee-ee-ee
There's nothing in between
What we are, what we see
There's nothing in between
What we are, what we see, what we are
We are just
On a life boat sailin' home
With our drunken hearts and our tired bones
Well I just take one last look around
Yeah an' every place feels like a familiar town
And now we're free-ee-ee-ee-ee
Free-ee-ee-ee-ee
And dontcha wanna be
Free-ee-ee-ee-ee
From time to time a little
Free-ee-ee-ee-ee
(Hey now now)
Free-ee-ee-ee-ee
I know you know your
Free-ee-ee-ee-ee
Feels so good to be
Free-ee-ee-ee-ee
Free-ee-ee-ee-ee
We just want to emote until we're dead
I know we suffer for fashion or whatever
We don't want these days to ever end
We just want to emasculate them forever
Pretty sirens don't go flat
It's not supposed to happen like that
Not like that
Not like that
Not like that
We've got to keep it physical
When our tellies are six hours away
Please call to say that you miss me, feel me or whatever
Vicissitudes are boxing our heads
Like they just want to emaciate them forever
Forever
Forever
Pretty sirens don't go flat
It's not supposed to happen like that
Not like that
Not like that
Not like that
We've got to keep our little click clicking at 130 BPM
It's not too slow
If we've got to burn out, let's do it together
Let's all melt down together
Together
Let's go together
Let's do it together
Let's go together
...Focus... (...calling...)
...What's the status? (eleven)...
Forever
Forever
Pretty sirens don't go flat
It's not supposed to happen like that
Not like that
Not like that
Not like that
We've got to keep our little click clicking at 130 BPM
It's not too slow
If we've got to burn out, let's do it together
Let's all melt down together
Together
Let's go together
Let's do it together
Let's go together
It's not right
But it's now or never
And if I wait
Could I ever forgive myself?
On a night
When the moon glows yellow in the riptide
With the light
From the TV's buzzing in the house
'Cause I'm gonna cut it where I can
And then I'm gonna duck out behind them
If I ever had a chance, it's now then
But I never had the feeling I could offer that to you
To offer it to you would be cruel
When all I want to do is use, use you
He was a diplomat's son, it was '81
He was a diplomat's son, it was '81
Dressed in white
With my cars keys hidden in the kitchen
I could sleep
Wherever I lay my head
And the sight
Of your two shoes sitting in the bathtub
Let me know
That I shouldn't give up just yet
'Cause I'm gonna take it from Simon
And then I'm gonna duck out behind them
If I ever had a chance, it's now then
But I never had the feeling I could offer that to you
To offer it to you would be cruel
When all I want to do is use, use you
He was a diplomat's son, it was '81
He was a diplomat's son, it was '81
I know, you'll say
I'm not doing it right
But this is how I want it
I can't go back
To how I felt before
That night I smoked a joint with my best friend, we found ourselves in bed
When I woke up he was gone
He was a diplomat's son, it was '81
He was a diplomat's son, it was '81
Looking out
At the ice-cold water all around me
I can't feel
Any traces of that other place
In the dark
When the wind comes racing off the river
There's a car
All black with diplomatic plates
Oh life, with your shoulders in the mirror
From the park when Dakota ran and brought you there
In the car when your mother lost her temper
The catalog and the catastrophic smile
Let the bugles play the sermon on the raid
I kissed you on the face
I kissed you on the playground
Oh Father John, you cannot tell me
What's right and wrong
You cannot tell me
I jump before I get around you
Oh Father John
Pick it up with the band on the Ronald Reagan Tollway
(Don't give up, let's go forget about yourself)
Illinois in it ran from the Ronald Reagan Tollway
Forget about yourself and all your plans
Oh life, with your colorful surprises
Eleanor, how you put one on disguises
Oh Father John, you cannot tell me
What's right and wrong
You cannot tell me
In the mortal life
Far in the morning light
We're back from Bloomington
We let the runners win
Far in the morning light
We let the movies play
A weekend from the holiday
Pick it up with the band 
On the Ronald Reagan toll way
(Don't break down, let's go: forget about yourself)
Illinois in it ran from the Ronald Reagan toll way
(If I'm wrong makes nothing right about yourself)
Snowmobile on the field where the gunners throw their weight around
Forget about yourself and all your plans
The moon was shinin', on the lake that night
Your Slayer T-shirt, fit the scene just right
Through smeared mascara, I looked into your eyes and saw a light
You told me stories, about your chickadees
They didn't like BB guns, or stupid archery
You charmed the lifeguard, he let them use the pool all day for free
Then the conversation stopped, and I looked down at my feet
I was next to you, and you were right there next to me
Then I said:
Girl! If you're wondering if I want you to (I want you to)
I want you to (I want you to)
So make a move (make a move)
'Cause I ain't got all night
The rest of the summer was the best we ever had
We watched Titanic and it didn't make us sad
I took you to Best Buy, you took me home to meet your mom and dad
Your mom cooked meatloaf even though I don't eat meat
I dug you so much, I took some for the team
Your dad was silent, his eyes were fixed on what was on TV
Then the conversation stopped, and I looked down at the ring
Your folks were next to you, and you were right there next to me
And I said:
Girl! If you're wondering if I want you to (I want you to)
I want you to (I want you to)
I swear it's true (swear it's true)
Without you, my heart is blue
Woohoo oh-oh oh
Girl! If you're wondering if I want you to (I want you to)
I want you to (I want you to)
So make a move (make a move)
'Cause I ain't got all night
So much pain
May come our way
There may come a day
When we have nothing left to say
When the conversation stops and we're facing our defeat
I'll be next to you and you'll be right there next to me
Then I'll say:
Girl! If you're wondering if I want you to (I want you to)
I want you to (I want you to)
I swear it's true (swear it's true)
Without you, my heart is blue
Woohoo oh-oh oh
Girl! If you're wondering if I want you to (I want you to)
I want you to (I want you to)
So make a move (make a move)
'Cause I ain't got all night 
Whooo!
I just want to be ok, be ok, be ok
I just want to be ok today

I just want to feel today, feel today, feel today
I just want to feel something today
I just want to know today, know today, know today
Know that maybe I will be ok
Know that maybe I will be ok
Know that maybe I will be ok
I filled the bucket
I spilled the bucket
Out on the floor
A mistake for sure
Consequences
Turned me hostile
I got so saddened
Made me docile
Then you applauded
When I was loving
Made me feel weak and
I start recovering
Now I feel silly
Selfish and dizzy
Now I got this feeling
That you'll forgive me
And you know
Oh my god just please don't ever let me go
Yeah sometimes we're high and sometimes we're low
Put up with me then I'll make you see
That things are better when you're with me
Ooh
Ooh there was the night we
Kissed in the moonlight
It was romantic
But didn't feel so right
Cause something was lost then
Today its replenished
But it was you who cleaned up my messes
And oh
Oh my god just please don't ever let me go
Yeah sometimes we're high and sometimes we're low
Put up with me then I'll make you see
That things are better when you're with me

Do you want to go to the plage with me?
I'm going down-down-down there at 4 in the morning
Most beautiful girl I've ever seen
Come down-down-down, my love is calling
Do you want to go to the plage with me?

Most beautiful girl I've ever seen
Come down-down-down, my love is calling
It's half-past the moonlight
Nobody would see us go
(And I wonder) If I were to walk by you once more
Maybe you will look into my eyes
And you will see just what you've done to me
The time is short. You know we only live one life
It was love at first sight
And being by your side is the only thing on my mind (So)
Do you want to go to the plage with me?
I'm going down-down-down there at 4 in the morning
Most beautiful girl I've ever seen
Come down-down-down, my love is calling

And I will love your heart with mine, with mine
So do you want to go to the plage with me?
I'm going down-down-down there at 4 in the morning
Most beautiful girl I've ever seen
Come down-down-down, my love is calling!
Come down-down-down, my love is calling!
Do you want to go to the plage with me?
I'm going down-down-down there at 4 in the morning
Most beautiful girl I've ever seen
Come down-down-down, my love is calling!
I heard you're feeling 
Nothing's going right
Why don't you let me 
Stop by
The clock is ticking
Running out of time
So we should party
All night
So cover your eyes
I have a surprise
I hope you got a healthy appetite
If you wanna dance
If you want it all
You know that I'm the girl that you should call
Boy, when you're with me
I'll give you a taste
Make it like your birthday every day
I know you like it sweet
So you can have your cake
Give you something good to celebrate
So make a wish
I'll make it like your birthday every day
I'll be your gift
Give you something good to celebrate
Pop your confetti
Pop the Pérignon
So hot and heavy
'Til dawn
I got you spinning 
Like a disco ball
All night they're playing
Your song
We're living the life
We're doing it right
You're never gonna be unsatisfied
If you wanna dance
I you want it all
You know I'm the girl that you should call
Boy, when you're with me
I'll give you a taste
Make it like your birthday every day
I know you like it sweet
So you can have your cake
Give you something good to celebrate
So make a wish
I'll make it like your birthday every day
I'll be your gift
Give you something good to celebrate
Happy birthday
So let me get you in your birthday suit
It's time to bring out the big balloons
So let me get you in your birthday suit
It's time to bring out the big, big, big, big, big, big balloons
Boy, when you're with me
I'll give you a taste
Make it like your birthday every day
I know you like it sweet
So you can have your cake
Give you something good to celebrate
Boy, when you're with me
I'll give you a taste

So you can have your cake
Give you something good to celebrate
So make a wish
I'll make it like your birthday every day
I'll be your gift
Give you something good to celebrate
Happy birthday
We're running through the aisles
Of the churches still in style
Does this city have a curfew?
Don't you know it's good to see you too
The riders on the chan de lise
We are the tourists in the cafes
We drank our wine along the river
Not believing where we were at all
It's all right, the camera's talking
Oh
And even though I can't be sure
Memory tells me that these times are worth working for
The buffalo in Catalina
The colored stones and troop leaders
The voices of the canopy singers
Ensured that we wouldn't sleep for long
I knew this would be the part
My plane's arrival catches me off guard
We'll all be leaving with a broken heart
Wallets empty and we're back at start
It's all right, the camera is talking
Oh
And even though I can't be sure
Memory tells me that these times are worth working for
The cistern is not even full
The sister is naughty
The cistern is not even
Instrumental
I have walked this earth and watched people.
I can be sincere and say I like them
You can't say no to hope, can't say no to happiness
I want to go on a mountain-top
With a radio and good batteries
Play a joyous tune
And free the human race from suffering
I'm no fucking Buddhist but this is enlightenment
The less room you give me, the more space I've got
This is an alarm-call so wake-up wake-up now
Today has never happened and it doesn't frighten me
Teenage dreams in a teenage circus
Running around like a clown on purpose
Who gives a damn about the family you come from?
No giving up when you're young and you want some
Running around again
Running from running
Running around again
Running from running
Waking up in the midday sun
What's to live for?
You could see what I've done
Staring at emotion
In the light of day
I was running from the things that you'd say
We are not what you think we are
We are golden, we are golden
We are not what you think we are
We are golden, we are golden
Teenage dreams in a teenage circus
Running around like a clown on purpose
Who gives a damn about the family you come from?
No giving up when you're young and you want some
Running around again
Running from running
Running around again
Running from running
I was a boy at an open door
Why you staring?
Do you still think that you know?
Looking for treasure
In the things that you threw
Like a magpie
I live for glitter, not you
We are not what you think we are
We are golden, we are golden
We are not what you think we are
We are golden, we are golden
Teenage dreams in a teenage circus
Running around like a clown on purpose
Who gives a damn about the family you come from?
No giving up when you're young and you want some
Now I'm sitting alone
I'm finally looking around
Left here on my own
I'm gonna hurt myself
Maybe losing my mind
I'm still wondering why
Had to let the world, let it bleed me dry
We are not what you think we are, we are...
We are not what you think we are, we are...
We are not what you think we are, we are...
We are golden, we are golden
Teenage dreams in a teenage circus
Running around like a clown on purpose
Who gives a damn about the family you come from?
No giving up when you're young and you want some
Running around again
Running from running
Running around again
Running from running
We are not what you think we are
We are golden, we are golden
It's far too early in the morning,
To be trying to call you
And far too early in the daytime,
To be thinking about that
But I, But I, But I am
What did I do in a past life,
Oh to deserve this?
Yeah the way I make myself
He's far too innocent to be a part of
Such a cruel world
And it is, and it is, and it is
So I'll go, yes I'll go
So I'll take that train and ride
Hoping I could write her a rhyme,
That might stop the tick of time
Get off this situation and feel fine
Get off this situation and feel fine
What did I do to deserve her love?
I have to ask myself,
When I am such a bad man
But only to her, only to her, only to her
So I'll go, yes I'll go
So I'll take that train and ride
So I'll go, yes I'll go
So I'll take that train and ride
Wishing, hoping I could write her a rhyme,
That might stop the tick of time
Get off this situation and feel fine
Get off this situation and feel fine
Whenever I want you around, yeah
All I gotta do
Is call you on the phone
And you'll come running home
Yeah, that's all I gotta do
And when I, I wanna kiss you, yeah
All I gotta do
Is whisper in your ear
The words you long to hear
And I'll be kissing you
And the same goes for me
Whenever you want me at all
I'll be here, yes, I will
Whenever you call
You just gotta call on me, yeah
You just gotta call on me
And when I, I wanna kiss you, yeah
All I gotta do

Whenever you call
You just gotta call on me, yeah
You just gotta call on me
Oh, you just gotta call on me
One, two, three, four
Can I have a little more?
Five, six, seven-eight-nine-ten
I love you.
A, B, C, D
Can I bring my friend to tea?
E, F, G-H-I-J
I love you.

Whoo!
Breathe, and I'll carry you away into the velvet sky
And we'll stir the stars around
And watch them fall away into the Hudson Bay
And plummet out of sight and sound
The open summer breeze will sweep you through the hills
Where I live in the Alpine Heights
Below the Northern Lights, I spend my coldest nights
Alone, awake, and thinking of
The weekend we were in love
(The weekend we were in love)
Home among these mountaintops can be so awfully dull
A thousand miles from the tide
But photos on the walls of New York shopping malls
Distract me so I stay inside
I wish the rockets stayed over the Promenade
'Cause I would make a hook and eye
And fish them from the sky, my darling, she and I
We're hanging on so take us high
To sing the world goodbye
I am floating away
Lost in a silent ballet
I'm dreaming you're out in the blue
And I am right beside you
Awake to take in the view
Late nights and early parades
Still photos and noisy arcades
My darling we're both on the wing
Look down and keep on singing
And we can go anywhere
Are you there?
(Are you there? Are you there? Are you there?)
Are you there?
(Are you there? Are you there? Are you there?)
Or are you just a decoy dream in my head?
Am I home or am I simply tumbling all alone?
I am floating away (floating away)
Lost in a silent ballet (silent ballet)
I'm dreaming you're out in the blue
And I am right beside you
Awake to take in the view
Late nights and early parades (and early parades)
Still photos and noisy arcades (noisy arcades)
My darling we're both on the wing
Look down and keep on singing
And we can go anywhere
(Are you there? Are you there? Are you there?)
Are you there?
My heart is on my sleeve
Wear it like a bruise or black eye
My badge, my witness means that I believed
Every single lie you said (and learned from the best)
'Cause every pane of glass that your pebbles tap 
Negates the pains I went through to avoid you
And every little pat on the shoulder for attention 
Fails to mention I still hate you
But there's a light on in Chicago
And I know I should be home
All the colors of the street signs 
They remind me of the pick-up truck out in front of your neighbor's house
She took me down and said
"Boys like you are overrated" (So save your breath)
Loaded words and loaded friends
Are loaded guns to our heads
'Cause every pane of glass that your pebbles tap 
Negates the pains I went through to avoid you
And every little pat on the shoulder for attention 
Fails to mention I still hate you
But there's a light on in Chicago
And I know I should be home
All the colors of the street signs 
They remind me of the pick-up truck out in front of your neighbor's house
You want apologies?
Girl, you might hold your breath 
Until your breathing stops forever, forever
The only thing you'll get is this curse on your lips
I hope they taste of me forever
And there's a light on in Chicago (every pane of glass)
And I know I should be home (every pane of glass)
And the colors of the street signs 
They remind me of the pick-up truck out in front of your neighbor's
With every breath, I wish your body will be broken again, again
With every breath, I wish your body will be broken again, again
(Well there's a light on)
With every breath, I wish your body will be broken again, again
(Light)
With every breath, I wish your body will be broken again
I thought love was only true in fairy tales
Meant for someone else but not for me
Love was out to get me, that's the way it seems
Disappointment haunted all my dreams
And then I saw her face
Now I'm a believer
Not a trace
Of doubt in my mind
I'm in love
I'm a believer
I couldn't leave her if I tried
I thought love was more or less a giving thing
But more I gave the less I've got, oh yeah
What's the use in trying, all you get is pain
When I wanted sunshine I got rain
And then I saw her face
Now I'm a believer
Not a trace
Of doubt in my mind
I'm in love
I'm a believer
I couldn't leave her if I tried
What's the use in trying, all you get is pain
When I wanted sunshine I got rain
And then I saw her face
Now I'm a believer
Not a trace
Of doubt in my mind
I'm in love
I'm a believer
I couldn't leave her if I tried
Then I saw her face
Now I'm a believer
Not a trace
Of doubt in my mind
Now I'm a believer,
Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
Now I'm a believer
(Then I saw her face)
Now I'm a believer
(Not a trace
Of doubt in my mind)
I'm a believer
(Now I'm a believer...)
Bandages on my legs and my arms from you
Bandages, bandages, bandages
Up and down on my legs and my arms from you
Bandages, bandages, bandages
These bandages cover more than scrapes
Cuts and bruises from regrets and mistakes
I've been hoping you're moping around the street again
I've been tripping from sipping the dripping dirty water tap
I've been poking a voodoo doll that you do not know I made
These bandages are anonymity
I've been shaking from making an awful decision

And round, around, around, around, around, around

Hey, Matt
Yeah, Tim?
Hey, you talked to Mark lately?
Uh, haven't really talked to him, but he looks pretty, uh, down
"He looks pretty, uh, down". Yeah, well, maybe we should cheer him up then
What do you, uh, suppose we should do?
Well, does he like butter tarts?
I was lying on the grass of Sunday morning of last week
Indulging in my self-defeat
My mind was thugged, all laced and bugged, all twisted, wrong and beat
A comfortable three feet deep
Now the fuzzy stare from not being there on a confusing morning week
Impaired my tribal lunar-speak
And of course you can't become if you only say what you would've done
So I missed a million miles of fun
I know it's up for me
(If you steal my sunshine)
Making sure I'm not in too deep
(If you steal my sunshine)
Keeping versed and on my feet
(If you steal my sunshine)
Chad, come here, come here, come here!
Wow, look at her!
I know!
Wow, I've never seen Sharon look so bad before.
I did once before, but this is pretty bad.
Yeah, what do you think she got up to last night?
Well, I--Sharon... I love you!
I was frying on the bench slide in the park across the street
L-A-T-E-R that week
My sticky paws were into making straws out of big fat slurpy treats
An incredible eight foot heap
Now the funny glare to pay a gleaming tear in a staring under heat
Involved an under usual feat
And I'm not only among but I invite you all to come
So I missed a million miles of fun
I know it's up for me
(If you steal my sunshine)
Making sure I'm not in too deep
(If you steal my sunshine)
Keeping versed and on my feet
(If you steal my sunshine)
I know it's done for me
(If you steal my sunshine)
Not as some and hard to see
(If you steal my sunshine)
Keeping dumb and built to beat
(If you steal my sunshine)
My sunshine (If you steal my sunshine)
My sunshine (If you steal my sunshine)
My sunshine (If you steal my sunshine)
My sunshine (If you steal my sunshine)
My sunshine (If you steal my sunshine)
My sunshine (If you steal my sunshine)
My sunshine (If you steal my sunshine)
My sunshine (If you steal my sunshine)
My sunshine (If you steal my sunshine)
My sunshine (If you steal my sunshine)
Oh, the bitter winds are coming in
And I'm already missing the summer
Stockholm's cold but I've been told
I was born to endure this kind of weather
When it's you I find like a ghost in my mind
I am defeated and I gladly wear the crown
I'll be your Emmylou and I'll be your June
And you'll be my Gram and my Johnny too
No, I'm not asking much of you
Just sing, little darling, sing with me
Now so much I know that things just don't grow
If you don't bless them with your patience
And I've been there before, I held up the door
For every stranger with a promise
But I'm holding back, that's the strength that I lack
Every morning keeps returning at my window
And it brings me to you and I won't just pass through
But I'm not asking for a storm
I'll be your Emmylou and I'll be your June
And you'll be my Gram and my Johnny too
No, I'm not asking much of you
Just sing, little darling, sing with me
And yes, I might have lied to you
But you wouldn't benefit from knowing all the truth
I was frightened, but I held fast
I need you now at long last
I'll be your Emmylou and I'll be your June
And you'll be my Gram and my Johnny too
No, I'm not asking much of you
Just sing, little darling, sing with me
I'll be your Emmylou and I'll be your June
And you'll be my Gram and my Johnny too
No, I'm not asking much of you
Just sing, little darling, sing with me
Just sing, little darling, sing with me
Close your eyes and I'll kiss you
Tomorrow I'll miss you
Remember I'll always be true
And then while I'm away
I'll write home everyday
And I'll send all my loving to you
I'll pretend that I'm kissing
The lips I am missing
And hope that my dreams will come true
And then while I'm away
I'll write home everyday
And I'll send all my loving to you
All my loving I will send to you
All my loving, darling, I'll be true
Close your eyes and I'll kiss you
Tomorrow I'll miss you
Remember I'll always be true
And then while I'm away
I'll write home everyday
And I'll send all my loving to you
All my loving, I will send to you
All my loving, darling I'll be true
All my loving, All my loving
Woo, all my loving
I will send to you
She thinks I'm much too thin
She asks me if I'm sick
What's a girl to do with friends like this?
She lets me drive her car so I can score an eighth
From the lesbians out west in Venice
Oh, California in the summer
Ah, and my hair is growing long
And fuck yeah, we can live like this
But if you left it up to me
Everyday would be a holiday from real
We'd waste our weeks beneath the sun
We'd fry our brains 
And say it's so much fun out here
When it's all over
I'll come back for another year
I look for work today
I'm spilling out the door
Put my glasses on so no one sees me
I never thought that I'd be living on your floor
But the rents are high and LA's easy
Oh, it's a picture of perfection
Ah, and the postcard's gonna read
Fuck yeah, we can live like this
We can live like this
But if you left it up to me
Everyday would be a holiday from real
We'd waste our weeks beneath the sun
We'd fry our brains
And write it's so much fun out here
Hey, Madeline (Hey, Madeline)
You sure look fine (You sure look fine)
You wore my favorite sweater
Being poor was never better
A safety buzz (A safety buzz)
Some cheap red wine (Some cheap red wine)
Oh, the trouble we can get in
So let's screw this one up right
But if you left it up to me
If you left it up to me
Everyday would be a holiday from real
We'd waste our weeks beneath the sun
We'd lie and tell our friends
It's so much fun out here
When it's all over 
I'll come back for another
When it's all over
I'll come back for another year
5, 6, 5, 6, 7, 8
All these beats
Workin' down the street
Jumping, jacking
Gimme some time
'Cause if you don't, I won't
You'll never get back, yeah
If you do, I swear
I'll give it to you
Banging on the door
'Cause we can't hear a thing
Keep shutting down the power
'Cause we can always sing girl
I got the power
Back here
All you gotta do
I got the power
Back here
Gimme some time
I got here, where?
I got there, where?
I got it
You got it
We got it everywhere
Okay!
Revolution has come
Okay!
Time to pick up a gun
Okay!
Yay
One, two, three, four
Our stepmom, we did everything to hate her
She took us down to the edge of Decatur
We saw the lion and the kangaroo take her
Down to the river where they caught a wild alligator
Sangamon River, it overflowed
It caused a mudslide on the banks of the operator
Civil War skeletons in their graves
They came up clapping in the spirit of the aviator
The sound of the engines and the smell of the grain
We go riding on the abolition grain train
Stephen A. Douglas was a great debater
But Abraham Lincoln was the great emancipator
Chickenmobile with your rooster tail
I had my fill, and I know how bad it feels
Stay awake and watch for the data
No small caterpillar, go congratulate her
Denominator, go Decatur
Go Decatur, it's the great I Am
Abominate her, go Decatur
Why did we hate her? It's the great I Am
Denominator, go Decatur
Anticipate her, it's the great I Am
Appreciate her, appreciate her
Stand up and thank her
Stand up and thank her, it's the great I Am
Stand up and thank her, it's the great I Am
Stand up and thank her, it's the great I Am
Stand up and thank her
The last night of the fair
By the big wheel generator
A boy is stabbed and his money is grabbed
And the air hangs heavy like a dulling wine
She is famous, she is funny
An engagement ring
Doesn't mean a thing
To a mind consumed by brass (money)
And though I walk home alone
I might walk home alone
But my faith in love is still devout
The last night of the fair
From a seat on a whirling waltzer
Her skirt ascends for a watching eye
It's a hideous trait (on her mother's side)
From a seat on a whirling waltzer
Her skirt ascends for a watching eye
It's a hideous trait (on her mother's side)
And though I walk home alone
I might walk home alone
But my faith in love is still devout
Then someone falls in love
And someone's beaten up
Someone's beaten up
And the senses being dulled are mine
And someone falls in love
Then someone's beaten up
Someone's beaten up
And the senses being dulled are mine
And though I walk home alone
I might walk home alone
But my faith in love is still devout
This is the last night of the fair
And the grease in the hair
Of a speedway operator
Is all a tremulous heart requires
A schoolgirl is denied
She said: "How quickly would I die
If I jumped from the top of the parachute?"
This is the last night of the fair
And the grease in the hair
Of a speedway operator
Is all a tremulous heart requires
A schoolgirl is denied
She said: "How quickly would I die
If I jumped from the top of the parachute?"
So scratch my name on your arm with a fountain pen
This means you really love me
Scratch my name on your arm with a fountain pen
This means you really love me
And though I walk home alone
I just might walk home alone
But my faith in love is still devout
I might walk home alone
But my faith in love is still devout
I might walk home alone
But my faith in love is still devout
Well I met an old man dying on a train
No more destination, no more pain
Well he said one thing, before I graduate
"Never let your fear decide your fate"
I say ya kill your heroes and
Fly, fly, baby don't cry.
No need to worry 'cause
Everybody will die.
Every day we just
Go, go, baby don't go.
Don't you worry we
Love you more than you know.
Well the sun one day will leave us all behind
Unexplainable sightings in the sky
Well I hate to be the one to ruin the night
Right before your, right before your eyes
I say ya kill your heroes and
Fly, fly, baby don't cry
No need to worry 'cause
Everybody will die
Every day we just
Go, go, baby don't go
Don't you worry we
Love you more than you know

In a village in the hills
House buried to the window sills in snow
In a prison yard at night
An Alsatian barking for the stars to go
In the attic of a house
In the slats of light which creep across the room
In a forest grove at dawn
Where the animals sleep hidden in the gloom
On the 97th floor overlooking Tokyo
In Camden road in a second floor flat with
Dilworth down below
There is only one thing
There is only one thing
In a cancer ward where the patients sit
Waiting patiently to die
In an aeroplane high above the place
You finally left behind
In a cage where only one thing could be free
And it's not you and I
In a cage where only one thing could be free
And it's not you and I
In every single place that has ever, ever been
Hiroshima, Los Angeles and each town in between
There is only one thing
There is only one thing
One thing
In the darkest part of you that you have ever seen
In the smile of the child staring at the TV screen
In the diary of a priest, in the sheets that lie upon his bed
Out there amongst the waves and inside your lover's head
There is only one thing (x6)
There is only one... thing
20 years asleep before we sleep... forever
20 years asleep before we sleep... forever
10 years on the coast figuring out... the weather
Another decade getting high until you're free
There's nothing after that but you and I
Nothing after that but you and me
20 years asleep before we sleep... forever
20 years asleep before we sleep... forever...
Hey heart on the road again
Moving on... forward
See the stars, won't break the bones
They're in the car... on the highway
It's so magical feeling, that no one's got a hold
Your heart can list the all, happiness you know
This is your heart, it's alive
It's pumping blood
It's your heart, it's alive
It's pumping blood
And the whole wide world is whistling
Hey heart on the run again
Drive is strong... anywhere
Stick and stones won't take his course
Sky's the ball and it fits in
It's the best of world's feeling, like nothing can go wrong
You're the saddle of the world you don't get to know
'Cause it's your heart, it's alive
It's pumping blood
It's your heart, it's alive
It's pumping blood
And the whole wide world is whistling
Hey heart on the road again
On a highway, on a highway
Hey heart on the road again
On a highway, on a highway
'Cause it's your heart, it's alive
It's pumping blood
And it's your heart, it's alive
It's pumping blood
And the whole wide world is whistling

Sunshine
I'd really like to tell you
Oh my sunshine
Even though your skies are blue
You're drying up my bed
How can I get any rest now?
Sha la la la la la la la
Someday 
You will get the best of me 
Oh someday
Probably when I'm old and grey
I'm lying in my bed
And I will soon be put to rest now
Sha la la la la la la la
Sunshine
I'd really like to tell you

You went into the kitchen cupboard
Got yourself another hour
And you gave half of it to me
We sat there looking at the faces
Of these strangers in the pages
'Til we knew 'em mathematically
They were in our minds
Until forever
But we didn't mind
We didn't know better
So we made our own computer
Out of macaroni pieces
And it did our thinking while we lived our lives
It counted up our feelings
And divided them up even
And it called that calculation perfect love
Didn't even know
That love was bigger
Didn't even know
That love was so, so
Hey Hey Hey
Hey this fire it's burnin'
Burnin' us up
Hey this fire it's burnin'
Burnin' us 
Up
So we made the hard decision
And we each made an incision
Past our muscles and our bones
Saw our hearts were little stones
Pulled them out they weren't beating
And we weren't even bleeding
As we lay them on the granite counter top
We beat 'em up
Against each other
We beat 'em up
Against each other
We struck 'em hard
Against each other
We struck 'em so hard
So hard
Until they sparked
Hey this fire it's burnin'
Burnin' us up
Hey this fire it's burnin'
Burnin' us Up
Hey this fire it's burnin'
Burnin' us 
Up
I'm your only friend
I'm not your only friend
But I'm a little glowing friend
But really I'm not actually your friend
But I am
Blue canary in the outlet by the light switch
Who watches over you
Make a little birdhouse in your soul
Not to put too fine a point on it
Say I'm the only bee in your bonnet
Make a little birdhouse in your soul
I have a secret to tell
From my electrical well
It's a simple message and I'm leaving out the whistles and bells
So the room must listen to me
Filibuster vigilantly
My name is blue canary, one note spelled L-I-T-E
My story's infinite
Like the Longines Symphonette it doesn't rest
Blue canary in the outlet by the light switch
Who watches over you
Make a little birdhouse in your soul
Not to put too fine a point on it
Say I'm the only bee in your bonnet
Make a little birdhouse in your soul
I'm your only friend
I'm not your only friend
But I'm a little glowing friend
But really I'm not actually your friend
But I am
There's a picture opposite me
Of my primitive ancestry
Which stood on rocky shores and kept the beaches shipwreck free
Though I respect that a lot
I'd be fired if that were my job
After killing Jason off and countless screaming Argonauts
Bluebird of friendliness
Like guardian angels it's always near
Blue canary in the outlet by the light switch
Who watches over you
Make a little birdhouse in your soul
Not to put too fine a point on it
Say I'm the only bee in your bonnet
Make a little birdhouse in your soul
While you're at it
Keep the nightlight on inside the birdhouse in your soul
Not to put too fine a point on it
Say I'm the only bee in your bonnet
Make a little birdhouse in your soul
(Blue canary in the outlet by the light switch) While you're at it
(Who watches over you) Keep the nightlight on inside the birdhouse in your soul
(Make a little birdhouse in your soul)
Not to put too fine a point on it
Say I'm the only bee in your bonnet
Make a little birdhouse in your soul
(Blue canary in the outlet by the light switch) While you're at it
(Who watches over you) Keep the nightlight on inside the birdhouse in your soul
(Make a little birdhouse in your soul)
Not to put too fine a point on it
Say I'm the only bee in your bonnet
Make a little birdhouse in your soul
Killing it 
Ask me what I did with my life 
I spent it with you 
If I lose my fame and fortune 
Really don't matter 
As long as I got you, baby 
Clap your hands y'all it's alright
Clap your hands y'all it's alright
Clap your hands y'all it's alright

As the years they pass us by 
(Years they, years they, years they) 
We stay young through each other's eyes 
(Each other's eyes) 
And no matter how old we get 
It's okay, as long as I got you, baby 
Clap your hands y'all it's alright 
As long as I got you, baby

Goddamn Europeans!
Take me back to beautiful England
And the grey, damp filthiness
Of ages and battered books and
Fog rolling down behind the mountains
On the graveyards and dead sea-captains
Let me walk through the stinking alleys
To the music of drunken beatings
Past the Thames River, glistening like gold
Hastily sold for nothing
Nothing!
Let me watch night fall on the river
The moon rise up and turn to silver
The sky move, the ocean shimmer
The hedge shake, the last living rose
Quiver
Istanbul
...denn schön nach...
Istanbul
...doch weit und...
Ich sah nur Deine braunen...
...denn schön nach...
Istanbul
...doch weit und...
Da sah ich Deine braunen
Augen
Da sah ich Deine braunen
Augen

She's got the devil in her heart
But her eyes they tantalise
She's gonna tear your heart apart
Oh, her lips, they really thrill me
I'll take my chances
For romance is
So important to me
She'll never hurt me
She won't desert me
She's an angel sent to me
She's got the devil in her heart
No, no, this I can't believe
She's gonna tear your heart apart
No, no, nay will she deceive
I can't believe that she'll ever ever go
Not when she hugs me and says she loves me so
She'll never hurt me
She won't desert me
Listen, can't you see?
She's got the devil in her heart
Oh, no, no, no, this I can't believe
She's gonna tear your heart apart
No, no, nay will she deceive
Don't take chances
If your romance is
So important to you
She'll never hurt me
She won't desert me
She's an angel sent to me
She's got the devil in her heart
Oh, no, no, no, no, this I can't believe
She's gonna tear your heart apart
No, no, nay will she deceive
She's got the devil in her heart
No, she's an angel sent to me
She's got the devil in her heart
No, she's an angel sent to me
Today seems like a good day
To burn a bridge or two
The one with old wood creaking
That would burn away right on cue
I try to be not like that
But some people really suck
People need to get the axing
Chalk it up to bad luck
I know a drugstore cowgirl
So afraid of getting bored
She's always running from something
So many things ignored
I might do that stuff if
It didn't make me feel like shit
I'm on some old reality tip
So many trips in it
Beautiful disaster
Flyin' down the street again
I tried to keep up
You wore me out and left me ate up
Now I wish you all the luck
You're a butterfly in the wind without a care
A pretty train crash to me and I can't care
I do, I don't, whatever
I know a drugstore cowgirl
So afraid of getting bored
She's always running from something
So many things ignored
I try to be not like this
But I thought it'd make a good song
There's nothing to see, show's over
People, just move along
Beautiful disaster
Flyin' down the street again
I tried to keep up
You wore me out and left me ate up
Now I wish you all the luck
You're a butterfly in the wind without a care
A pretty train crash to me and I can't care
I do, I don't, whatever
So let the people talk
This Monday morning walk
Right past the fabulous mess we're in
It's gonna be a beautiful day
So do the bluebirds sing
As I take your hand
And you take my kiss
And I take the world
'Cause out of all the people I've known
The places I've been
The songs that I have sung
The wonders I've seen
Now that the dreams are all coming true
Who is the one that leads me on through
It's you
Who puts me in the magic position, darling now
You put me in the magic position
To live, to learn, to love in the major key
And I know how you've hurt
And been dragged through the dirt
But c'mon get back up
It's the time to live
So give your love to me
I'm gonna keep it carefully
Deep in the treasure chest below my breast
'Cause out of all the people I've known
The places I've been
The songs that I have sung
The wonders I've seen
Now that the dreams are all coming true
Who is the one that leads me on through
It's you
Who puts me in the magic position, darling now
You put me in the magic position, darling so
Let me put you in the magic position, darling
'Cause I'm singing in the, the major key
Let me put you in the major key
You spurn my natural emotions
You make me feel like dirt
And I'm hurt
And if I start a commotion
I run the risk of losing you
And that's worse
Ever fallen in love with someone
Ever fallen in love
In love with someone
Ever fallen in love
In love with someone
You shouldn't've fallen in love with
I can't see much of a future
Unless we find out what's to blame
What a shame (oh what a shame)
And we can't be together
Until we realize that we are the same
Ever fallen in love with someone
Ever fallen in love
In love with someone
Ever fallen in love
In love with someone
You shouldn't've fallen in love with
Ever fallen in love with someone
Ever fallen in love
In love with someone
Ever fallen in love
In love with someone
You shouldn't've fallen in love with
Ever fallen in love with someone
Ever fallen in love
In love with someone
Ever fallen in love
In love with someone
You shouldn't've fallen in love with
Ever fallen in love with someone
Ever fallen in love
In love with someone
Ever fallen in love
In love with someone
You shouldn't've fallen in love with
You disturb my natural emotions
You make me feel like dirt
And I'm hurt
And if I start a commotion
I'll only end up losing you
And that's worse
Ever fallen in love with someone
Ever fallen in love
In love with someone
Ever fallen in love
In love with someone
You shouldn't've fallen in love with
Ever fallen in love with someone
Ever fallen in love
In love with someone
Ever fallen in love
In love with someone
You shouldn't've fallen in love with
La la la la la la...
This is the definition of my life 
Lying in bed in the sunrise 
Choking on a vitamin tablet the doctor gave 
In the hope of saving me 
In the hope of saving me 
Mott's in the corner of the room 
Junkyard fool with eyes of (glue/gloom/blue) 
I asked him time again, 
Take me in and dry the rain 
Take me in and dry the rain 
Take me in and dry the rain, 
Take me in and dry the rain, 
The rain, the rain, the rain, the rain, my rain now 
Dusty brown boots in the corner by the ironing board 
Spray-on dust is the greatest thing 
Sure is the greatest thing 
Since the last, since the last
Mott's in the corner of the room 
Junkyard fool with eyes of (glue/gloom/blue) 
I asked him time again

Well she got her daddy's car
And she cruised through the hamburger stand now
Seems she forgot all about the library
Like she told her old man now
And with the radio blasting
Goes cruising just as fast as she can now
And she'll have fun, fun, fun
'Til her daddy takes the T-Bird away
(Fun, fun, fun 'til her daddy takes the T-Bird away)
Well the girls can't stand her
'Cause she walks looks and drives like an ace now
(You walk like an ace now, you walk like an ace)
She makes the Indy 500 look like the Roman chariot race now
(You look like an ace now, you look like an ace)
A lotta guys try to catch her
But she leads them on a wild goose chase now
(You drive like an ace now, you drive like an ace)
And she'll have fun, fun, fun
'Til her daddy takes the T-Bird away
(Fun, fun, fun 'til her daddy takes the T-Bird away)
Well you knew all along
That your dad was gettin' wise to you now
(You shouldn't have lied now, you shouldn't have lied)
And since he took your set of keys
You've been thinking that your fun is all through now
(You shouldn't have lied now, you shouldn't have lied)
But you can come along with me
'Cause we gotta a lot of things to do now
(You shouldn't have lied now, you shouldn't have lied)
And we'll have fun, fun, fun now that daddy took the T-Bird away
(Fun, fun, fun now that daddy took the T-Bird away)
And we'll have fun fun fun now that daddy took the T-Bird away
(Fun, fun, fun now that daddy took the T-Bird away)

Those nasty kids are fantastic
Five, four, three, two, one

Get up in the morning
I can't keep it in
I'm falling all over myself
And I could jump out of my skin
Wanna break the door down
Just to greet the day
'Cause there ain't nothing that's more certain
To keep my blues away
And I say
(La la, hey hey)
And I say
(La la, hey hey)
And it can settle the sadness
And the voices in my head
When I'm in the glow of the warmth you throw
I can put all that to bed
(In your light, just when I'm in your light)
(In your light, just when I'm in your light)
(In your light, just when I'm in your light)
(In your light, just when I'm in your light)
In your light, just when I'm in your light
(In your light, just when I'm in your light)
And I won't get by if you take that light away
(In your light, just when I'm in your light)
And when you're smiling on me
That is all I need
To put behind me all my worry
And life's complexities
It may be only a moment
But the world just falls away
And I forget myself
And everything else
That depressed me yesterday
And I can sing
(La la, hey hey)
Yeah I sing
(La la, hey hey)
When I'm in your light
All of this is clear
If only I could always be just as I am right here
When I'm in your light, just when I'm in your light
And I won't get by if you take that light away
(La la, hey hey)
(In your light, just when I'm in your light)
When I'm in your light
Nothing brings me down
If only I could always feel just as I do right now
When I'm in your light, just when I'm in your light
And I won't get by if you take that light away
When I'm in your light
All of this is clear
(In your light, just when I'm in your light)
If only I could always be just as I am right here
(In your light, just when I'm in your light)
In your light, just when I'm in your light
(In your light, just when I'm in your light)
And I won't get by if you take that light away
(In your light, just when I'm in your light)
No I won't get by if you take that light away
(In your light, just when I'm in your light)
No I won't get by if you take that light away

Bite your face to spite your nose,
17-and-a-half years old.
Worrying about my brother finding out,
Where's the fun in doing what you're told?
I said "No!
Oh give it a rest, I could persuade you.
I'm not your typical, stoned 18-year-old,
Give me a night I'll make you.
I know you're looking for salvation in the secular age,
But girl I'm not your savior."
Wrestle to the ground,
God help me now.
'Cause they're just girls breaking hearts,
Eyes bright, uptight, just girls.
But she can't be what you need if she's 17,
They're just girls.
A pair of frozen hands to hold,
Oh she's so southern so she feels the cold.
One moment I was tearing off your blouse,
Now you're living in my house.
What happened to just messing around?
I said "Yo,
I think I better go; I can't take you.
You just sit and get stoned with 30-year-olds,
And you think you've made it.
Well, shouldn't you be fucking with somebody your age,
Instead of making changes?"
Wrestle to the ground,
God help me now.
'Cause they're just girls breaking hearts,
Eyes bright, uptight, just girls.
But she can't be what you need if she's 17,
They're just girls.
Told her from the start,
Destined to be hard.
Told her from the start,
"I'll break your heart."
Destined to be hard,
Break your heart.
I said "Yo,
I think I better go; I can't take you.
I know you're looking for salvation in the secular age,
But girl I'm not your savior.
Well, shouldn't you be fucking with somebody your age,
Instead of making changes?"
Wrestle to the ground,
God help me now.
'Cause they're just girls breaking hearts,
Eyes bright, uptight, just girls.
But she can't be what you need if she's 17,
They're just girls.
'Cause they're just girls...
Come and open up your folding chair next to me
My feet are buried in the sand
And there's a breeze
There's a shadow
You can't see my eyes
And the sea is just a wetter version of the skies
Let's get a silver bullet trailer
And have a baby boy
I'll safety pin these clothes all cool
And you'll
Graffiti up his toys
I've got a perfect body
But sometimes I forget
I've got a perfect body
'Cause my eyelashes catch my sweat
Yes, they do
They dooo
Now, I've been sitting on this abandoned beach
For years
Waiting for the salty water
To cover up my ears
But every time the tide
Come in to take me home
I get scared
Now I'm sitting here alone
Dreaming of the dolphin song
Maybe one day you'll understand
I don't want nothing from you but to sweetly hold your hand
Till that day, just
Please don't be so down
Don't make frowns
You silly clown
Just come and open up your folding chair next to me
My feet are buried in the sand
And there's a breeze
There's a shadow
You can't see my eyes
And the sea is just a wetter version of the skies
There's a shadow
You can't see my eyes
There's a shadow
You can't see my eyes
Hungry bread and butter hustle
You'll be doing it a while, livers only fail
Where's your relaxation?
Where's the time required for your health?
Been hating on my new perspective
Been hurrying along, no meal is ever done
You could win a rabbit
You can have a rabbit or a rib
The fast child is gonna have a dead hand
We can get him started, yeah
Bad mind, let me put on good habits
Been working and put on good habits
Sometimes I can't find my good habits
Oh, Spanish bands use all the echo
Persian kitty better stay out of the train
Glad you brought your food on
Eat it like it's gonna get away
Your coffee sure is getting colder
And seats are getting fewer, space is losing place
You could win a rabbit
You could kill a rabbit with a rib
Rabbit or a habit? Habit or a rib?
Rabbit or a habit? Habit or a rib?
Rabbit or a habit?
Cruising down the highway with my friends, top down
And we're all on our way to the beach.
And everyone keeps laughing at those cars we are passing,
As we're sucking down that funny, funny weed.
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
And we're rolling up to sand
Take your shoes off, man
We are skinny dipping underneath the sea
And it's a chicken fight clan
Throw your dukes up, "wham!"
We are splashing in the water to the beat.
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Crossing sandy dunes
Hot day, mid-June
Naked kids, running wild, and free.
It's summer time fun, relax and stay young
You could be home, with Oprah Winfrey.
The water feels nice, dive deep down under
The ships, and treasures make reef
Just one of those days, had a blue, perfect wave
Come out, and join. You'll see.
We are lying in the sun, when we're done finding a towel
Now we're thinking of where we're gonna eat.
Back corner table, order lobsters and Black Label
Raise your glasses, here's to living out our dreams.
Cruising down the highway with my friends, top down
And we're all on our way to the beach.
And everyone keeps laughing at those cars we are passing,
As we're sucking down that funny, funny weed.
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
If I say, "Too bad," I'll take a lesson in my head
I've got to have till I am dead
If I say, "Too bad," I'll take a lesson in my head
I've got to have till I am dead
Now I've got these chores and I'm never going to hurt no one
And when at last, my work is done
Now I've got these chores and I'm never going to hurt no one
And when at last, my work is done
If I, if I, if I, if I
If I, if I, if I, if I

If I, if I, if I, if I
If I, if I, if I, if I
If I, if I, if I, if I
If I, if I, if I, if I
If I
I only want the time to do one thing that I like
I want to get so stoned and take a walk out in the light drizzle
At the end of the day, when there's no one watching
When there's no one watching
When there's no one watching
When there's no one watching
When there's no one watching
At the end of the day
When there's no one watching
When there's no one watching
When there's no one watching
When there's no one watching
It's not going to happen
It's not going to happen
It's not going to happen
It's not going to happen
It's not going to happen
That was our fifth song,
And I hope you enjoyed it,
Now this would be our best song you have ever heard,
The dirt bikes going on stage. thank you.
Cocaine is great. thank you more.
You're gonna drive me crazy
You're gonna drive me mad
You got an angel on your shoulder
Makin' hairpins outta glass
I believe in believing
The things that we don't see
And the skin violin is where the neighbors wont read meals
And the family heirloom jewelery
With sets and heaps of thieves
Will cast down things
That you've never even
Seen like the gods
Like the glory like the stories
That your fathers set before you
Ride the tiger round the kingdom
Oh no oh no
Oh no there's a meeting in the canyons
Oh no this is rising to the clouds
You're gonna drive me crazy
You're gonna drive me mad
You got an angel on your shoulder
Makin' hairpins outta glass
Baby don't be unhappy
Baby don't be sad
Better things are coming
I swear there's truth in that
I'm shooting off the cannons
Of the clouds begin to flow
And the baskets weave with your mothers [strength] but the ones we'll never keep
Just pretend that things are mobile and will never stay put
And the way we were the day we climbed to the top of the
Steeple with its people spewing angels out their mouths and letting tables turn to charcoal in the lipstick and the lipstick in the evening (oh no)
Oh no we were waving like the trees
Oh no then they moved us to the sky
You're gonna drive me crazy
You're gonna drive me mad
You got an angel on your shoulder
Makin' hairpins outta glass
Baby don't be unhappy
Baby don't be sad
Better things are coming
I swear there's truth in that
Two or three times the bell will ring but when when we look for the better things we search for this we have not build I feel it crash upon your skin
I find it hard to believe there more
Of these things behind the door
Do you miss me like I miss you
Do I miss you like you miss me
You're gonna drive me crazy
You're gonna drive me mad
You got an angel on your shoulder
Makin' hairpins outta glass
Baby don't be unhappy
Baby don't be sad
Better things are coming
I swear there's truth in that

I had forgiven you for tricking me again
But I have been tricked again into forgiving you
What is this? Are you some kind of hypnotist?
Waving your powers around, the sun eclipse behind the cloud
I thought I recognized your face amongst all of those strangers
But I am the stranger now amongst all of the recognized
What is this? Are you some kind of hypnotist?
Waving your powers around, the sun eclipse behind the cloud
The sun eclipse behind the cloud
Shut the bedroom window in the morning 
Go to the shop, make plans to be leaving 
In the morning
Thought I was sleeping, it was just a dream
An alley cat chewing on dead leaves
In the morning
Out of the dark and into the light
When the morning comes, I will be all right
When I leave, I try not to wake her
Tea and a toast to yesterday's capers
In the morning
She wrote my name on a red telephone box
When I got there, she'd already rubbed it off
In the morning
Out of the dark and into the light
When the morning comes, I will be all right
And all this time I've watched it change
But it's still the same
In the morning
In the morning
In the morning
In the morning
Stickshifts and safetybelts
Bucket seats have all got to go
When we're driving
In the car
It makes my baby seem so far
I need you here with me
Not way over in a bucket seat
I need you to be here with me
Not way over in a bucket seat
But when we're driving in my Malibu
It's easy to get right next to you
I say, "Baby, scoot over please"
And then she's right there next to me
I need you here with me
Not way over in a bucket seat
I need you to be here with me
Not way over in a bucket seat
Well, a lot of good cars
Are Japanese
But when we're driving far
I need my baby, I need my baby
Next to me
Well, stickshifts and safetybelts
Bucket seats have all got to go
When we're driving in the car
It makes my baby seem so far
I need you here with me
Not way over in a bucket seat
I need you to be here with me
Not way over in a bucket seat
Someone once told me
That you have to choose
What you win or lose
You can't have everything
Don't you take chances
You might feel the pain
Don't you love in vain
'Cause love won't set you free
I could stand by the side
And watch this life pass me by
So unhappy
But safe as could be
So what if it hurts me?
So what it I break down?
So what if this world just throws me off the edge
My feet run out of ground
I gotta find my place
I wanna hear my sound
Don't care about all the pain in front of me
I'm just trying to be happy
I just wanna be happy, yeah
Holding on tightly
Just can't let it go
Just trying to play my role
Slowly disappear
But all these days
They feel like they're the same
Just different faces
Different names
Get me out of here
I can't stand by the side
Ooh, no
And watch this life pass me by
Pass me by
So what if it hurts me?
So what if I break down?
So what if this world just throws me off the edge?
My feet run out of ground
I gotta find my place
I wanna hear my sound
Don't care about all the pain in front of me
I'm just trying to be happy
Oh, happy
Oh
So many turns that I can't see
Like I'm a stranger on this road
But don't say victim
Don't say anything
So what if it hurts me?
So what if I break down?
So what if this world just throws me off the edge?
My feet run out of ground
I gotta find my place
I wanna hear my sound
Don't care about all the pain in front of me
I just wanna be happy
Happy
I just wanna be
Oh
I just wanna be
Happy
Diamonds
I was born a unicorn
I missed the ark but I could've sworn you'd wait for me
Ginger
I was born a unicorn
I could've sworn you believed in me
Then how come all the other unicorns are dead?
Diamonds
Put your crystals under my pillow
Ginger
Send your epistle to my better fellows
Diamonds
If I start believing in you
Ginger
If you start believing in me
Diamonds
If I start believing in you
Ginger
If you start believing in me
We're the unicorns,
We're more than horses,
We're the unicorns,
And we're people too!
He's got a brand new car
Looks like a jaguar
It's got leather seats
It's got a CD player
But I don't wanna talk about it anymore
I think we're gonna make it
I think we're gonna save it yet
So don't you try and fake it
Anymore, anymore
We'll start over again
Grow ourselves new skin
Get a house in Devon
Drink cider from a lemon
But I don't wanna talk about it anymore
I think we're gonna make it
I think we're gonna save it yet
So don't you try and fake it
Anymore, anymore
I think we're gonna make it
I think we're gonna save it yet
So don't you try and fake it
Anymore, anymore
He's got a brand new car
He's got a brand new car
A brand new car
A brand new car
A brand new car
I think we're gonna make it
I think we're gonna save it yet
So don't you try and fake it
Anymore, anymore
I think we're gonna make it
I think we're gonna save it yet
So don't you try and fake it
Anymore, anymore
Colours are what keep me alive
Colours are one to hold in my head
Colours are where my old makes new
Colours are where my brain finds glue
Colours and colours and colours of colours
Colours and colours and colours of colours
Covers and covers and covers in colours
Covers and covers and covers in colours
Bursts are where I find a fix
Bursts are made to colour me rich
Bursts are blocks, Stickle Bricks
Bursts are colour till I'm sick
(Colours and colours and colours of colours)
I only wanted for to see
(Colours and colours and colours of colours)
There's nothing in this heart but me
(Covers and covers and covers in colours)
Everything you want is not free
(Covers and covers and covers in colours)
(Colours and colours and colours of colours)
I'm everything a girl could need
(Colours and colours and colours of colours)
There's nothing in this heart but me
(Covers and covers and covers in colours)
If everything you want is free
(Covers and covers and covers in colours)
I wish I lived in the Golden Age, giving it up on the Broadway stage.
Hang with the rats and smoke cigars, have a break with Frank and count the stars.
Dressed to the nines, with hair to match. Shiny jewels, casino cash.
Tapping feet, wanna take the lead. A trip back in time is all I need!
Sing it out loud, gonna get back honey!
Sing it out loud, get away with me!
Sing it out loud, on a trip back honey!
Sing it out loud and let yourself free!
I'm on my way, gonna make it big, gonna make the songs for the chicks to dig.
It's really hot and a little bit sour, we're getting your strength to maximum power.
Flying away from reality, whatever ever happened to gravity?
I see it clear, a shooting star! I'm a really good singer la-di-da-da-da!
Sing it out loud, gonna get back honey!
Sing it out loud, get away with me!
Sing it out loud, on a trip back honey!
Sing it out loud and let yourself free! 2x
Ooh, Silver screen on a rainy day, Sally Bowles in a cabaret.
Shaking sticks, oh what a show, rushing joy from tip to toe.
Rambling down the boulevard, with a fire burning in a wooden heart.
My mind is set, I walk the line!
But I never really thought it would feel this fine! Yeah!
Sing it out loud, gonna get back honey!
Sing it out loud, get away with me!
Sing it out loud, on a trip back honey!
Sing it out loud and let yourself free! 2x
Sukie was a kid, she liked to hang out in the graveyard
She did brass rubbings, she learned you never had to press hard
When she was finished hanging out she was all alone
She decided that she better check in at home
There was an awful row between her mum and dad
They said she hadn't done this, she hadn't done that
If she wanted to remain inside the family home
She'd have to tow the line, she'd have to give it a go
It didn't suit Sukie
She took her things and left 
Sukie was a kid, she liked to hang out at the art school
She didn't enrol, but she wiped the floor with all the arseholes
She took a bijou flat with the fraternity cat
She hid inside the attic of the sculpture building
She had a slut slave and his name was Dave
She said, "Be my photo bitch and I'll make you rich"
He didn't believe her but the boy revered her
He got her meals and he got her a bed
He watched behind the screen and she started to undress
He never got far 
Just lookin' and playing guitar
Autumn hanging down all the trees are draped like chandeliers
Now Sukie saw the beauty but she wasn't wet behind the ears
She had an A1 body and a face to match
She didn't have money, she didn't have cash
With the winter coming on, and the attic cold
She had to press her nose on the refectory wall
They served steamed puddings, she went without
She had to pose for life for all the scholars of art
She didn't feel funny, she didn't feel bad
Peeling away everything she had
She had the grace of an eel, sleek and stark
As the shadows played tricks on the girl in the dark
Sukie was a kid, and she liked to hang out in the graveyard
Sukie was a kid, and she liked to hang out in the graveyard
Sukie was a kid, and she liked to hang out in the graveyard
Sukie was a kid, and she liked to hang out in the graveyard

If you want, want my love
Take it off of me, off of me
If you want, want my heart
Take it off of me, off off me
You can have it all
You can have it all
If you want, want my time
Take it off of me, off of me
And if you want my last dime
Take it off, off of me
You can have it all
You can have it all
Take it, baby
Take it, baby
Take it, baby
Take it, baby
Take it, baby
Yoo can have it all
Yoo can have it all
Yoo can have it all
Yoo can have it all
Yoo can have it
Yoo can have it
Have it all
Have it all

If you're the bird whenever we pretend it's summer
Then I'm the worm, I know the part is such a bummer
But fair is fair, if my segments get separated
I'll scream and you'll be there
Close your eyes (close my eyes)
Slide the cotton off of your shoulder 
And feel the shine (feel the shine)
On the hook, so toss me over and cast the line (we'll all try)
I'll throw a party and greet my undersea friends (it depends)
As they arrive (if they arrive)
You and I left our troubles far behind (troubles far behind)
But I still have just one more question on my mind
For all my pals who live in the oceans and the seas
With friends like these, well who needs enemies?
If I'm your boy, let's take a shortcut we remember
And we'll enjoy picking apples in late September
Like we've done for years 
Then we'll take a long walk through the cornfield 
Then I'll kiss you between the ears
If you're my girl, swirl me around your room with feeling
And as we twirl the glow in the dark stars on your ceiling
Will shine for us as love sweeps over the room 'cause we tend to
Make each other blush (you make me blush)
You and I left our troubles far behind (troubles far behind)
But I still have just one more question on my mind
For all my pals who live in the oceans and the seas
With fronds like these, well who needs anemones?
You're the bird, I'm the worm, and it's plain to see 
That we were meant to be
We were meant to be
We were meant to be
If you're the bird, if you're the bird then I'm the worm
We were meant to be
Soft kiss and wine what a pretty friend of mine
We're finally intertwined
Nervous and shy for the moment we will come
Alive tonight
Secret valentine
We'll write a song
That turns out the lights
When both boy and girl start suddenly shaking inside
Don't waste your time
Speed up your breathing
Just close your eyes
We'll hope it's not for nothing at all
Lay down be still
Don't worry talk they will
I'll be loving you until
Morning's first light
Breaks tomorrow
I'll take care of you tonight
Secret valentine
We'll write a song
That turns out the lights
When both boy and girl start suddenly shaking inside
Don't waste your time
Speed up your breathing
Just close your eyes
We'll hope it's not for nothing at all
When guilt fills your head
Brush off rise up from the dead
This is the moment that we
Will come alive
Brace yourself for love
Sweet love, secret love.
We'll write a song
That turns out the lights
When both boy and girl start suddenly shaking inside
Don't waste your time
Speed up your breathing
Just close your eyes
We'll hope it's not for nothing at all
We'll write a song
That turns out the lights
When both boy and girl start suddenly shaking inside
Don't waste your time
Speed up your breathing
Just close your eyes
We'll hope it's not for nothing at all
Nothing at all
The flower said "I wish I was a tree"
The tree said "I wish I could be 
A different kind of tree"
The cat wished that it was a bee
The turtle wished that it could fly 
Really high into the sky
Over rooftops and then dive 
Deep into the sea
And in the sea there is a fish
A fish that has a secret wish 
A wish to be a big cactus with 
A pink flower on it
And in the sea there is a fish
A fish that has a secret wish 
A wish to be a big cactus with 
A pink flower on it
And the flower 
Would be its offering 
Of love to the desert 
And the desert's 
So dry and lonely 
That the creatures all appreciate the effort
Et le cachalot a dit
Je voudrais être un yeti
Pour voler dans la nuit
Et m'en aller loin d'ici
Mais le yeti a dit
Je voudrais être un monstre marin
Pour pouvoir rentrer dans la mer
De tous les requins.
Translation (not sung):
(And the sperm whale said
I wish I was a yeti
So I could steal into the night
And get away from here
But the yeti said
I wish I was a sea monster
So I could go into the sea
With all the sharks.)
And the rattlesnake said 
"I wish I had hands 
So I could hug you like a man"
And then the cactus said 
"But don't you understand?
My skin is covered with sharp spikes 
That'll stab you like a thousand knives
A hug would be nice 
But hug my flower with your eyes"
The flower said "I wish I was a tree"
The tree said "I wish I could be 
A different kind of tree"
The cat wished that it was a bee
The turtle wished that it could fly 
Really high into the sky
Over rooftops and then dive 
Deep into the sea
And in the sea there is a fish
A fish that has a secret wish 
A wish to be a big cactus with 
A pink flower on it
And in the sea there is a fish
A fish that has a secret wish 
A wish to be a big cactus with 
A pink flower on it
And the flower

Of love to the desert 
And the desert's 
So dry and lonely

I want to be a lilikoi, Boy Lilikoi
You grind your claws, you howl, you growl, unafraid of Hoi Polloi
You run, you're free, you climb endless trees, you reignite
You growl, you howl, you show your teeth
You bite, it's all right
Just say no more, use your eyes, the world goes and flutter by
Use your eyes, you'll know you are
Use your eyes, the world goes and flutter by
Use your eyes, you'll know you are
Wild beam, wild boy, you burn so bright
You illuminate
One day you're out, you give up the fight
You slow down heart-rate
We all grow old, use your eyes, the world goes and flutter by
Use your eyes, you'll know you are
Use your eyes, the world goes and flutter by
Use your life, you'll know you are
Electricity wires are down
Rainbow colours fading to brown
Adventurous smile shifting to frown
Courageous boy, now you're a clown
Your antarctic hair, off with the crown
Your spirited friends, now a ghost town
You run...
You run...
I want to be a lilikoi boy - You
You grind your claws, you howl, you growl, unafraid of Hoi Polloi
Electricity wires are down
Rainbow colours fading to brown
Adventurous smile shifting to frown
Courageous boy, now you're a clown
Your antarctic hair, off with the crown
Your spirited friends, now a ghost town
You run...
You run...

The smokestack spitting black soot into the sooty sky
The load on the road brings a tear to the indian's eye
The elephant won't forget what it's like inside his cage
The ringmaster's Telecaster sings on an empty stage
Uh-huh, goddamn right, it's a beautiful day 
Uh-huh, goddamn right, it's a beautiful day
Uh-huh
The girl with the curls and the sweet pink ribbon in her hair
She's crawlin' out her window 'cause her daddy just don't care
Come on
Uh-huh, goddamn right, it's a beautiful day 
Uh-huh, goddamn right, it's a beautiful day
Uh-huh
The clown with the frown driving down to the sidewalk fair
Finger on the trigger, let me tell you, it is quite a scare
Uh-huh, goddamn right, it's a beautiful day 
Uh-huh, goddamn right, it's a beautiful day
Uh-huh
The kids flip their lids when their heads hear that crazy sound
My neighbor digs the flavor, still he's moving to another town
And I don't believe he'll come back
Goddamn right, it's a beautiful day 
Uh-huh, goddamn right, it's a beautiful day
Uh-huh
And I don't know how you're taking all the shit you see
You don't believe anyone, but most of all, don't believe me
Only you
Goddamn right, it's a beautiful day (only you)
Uh-huh, goddamn right, it's a beautiful day
Uh-huh, goddamn right, it's a beautiful day
Uh-huh, goddamn right, it's a beautiful day
Uh-huh
Hey!
Uh huh
Hey!

Do you hear the voice inside your head
Whispering to live your dreams instead
Some people cling to what they know
But I woke up now it's time to go
Uh I can hear it calling
Uh did you see me falling
In and out of love
Uh I can hear it calling
Uh did you see me falling
Take me over, now take me out
Give me something to dream about
Take me over, take me out
To the jungle through the night in paradise, paradise
Take me over, take me out
To the jungle, through the night forever
All the things in only on the screen
That's the way to live
City's memories promise stereo
But don't sleep, 'cause now it's time to go
Uh I can hear you calling
Uh did you see me falling
Take me over, take me out
To the jungle through the night in paradise, paradise
Take me over, take me out
To the jungle, through the night forever
You may not notice now, what people talk about you
Some people think that we're running away
I'll push the
It's all I ever done, so give me a reason to stay
Uh, uh
Take me over, take me out
To the jungle through the night in paradise
Take me over, take me out
To the jungle through the night forever, uh
We were born with sun in our teeth and in our hair
When we get bored we like to sit around sit around and stare
At the mountains at the birds at the ocean at the trees
We have fun we have fun we have fun when we please
We wake up with the sun in our eyes
It's no surprise that we get so much done
But we always yes we always we always have fun
Yes we always yes we always we always have fun
Why would you live anywhere else?
Why would you live anywhere else?
We've got the ocean got the babes
Got the sun we've got the waves
This is the only place for me
So leave your coat behind
We're gonna make it to the beach on time
Yeah leave the cold behind
We're gonna make it to the beach on time
Why would you live anywhere else?
Why would you live anywhere else?
We've got the ocean got the babes
Got the sun we've got the waves
This is the only place
This is the only place
This is the only place
This is the only place for me
Choke, choking on a wishbone in the firing line of lovers who will never slow down
And I won't let you steer, commandeer the atmosphere, since you suggested running away (Romantic)
Hit the redial, maybe we should sigh a while, save our second wind for sentimental warm weather
Four forever, two together, we'll play dead, we'll play dead! We'll play deadly
Should we make believe you remember me from a holiday delayed by a storm?
Should we chance our arms' alarms set to high noon until the shiver in the river is gone?
Hope, hoping you might whistle, get all dizzy, 'cause I found the reason why you're around
If I locate the fear, talk you through the tangles, can you chase me till you my feet touch the ground? (And go dancing)
Tambourine style, walking in a single file
You whisper half thoughts to me
Should we make believe you remember me from a holiday delayed by a storm?
Should we chance our arms' alarms set to high noon until the shiver in the river is gone?
If you could blow up the world with the flick of a switch 
Would you do it? 
If you could make everybody poor just so you could be rich 
Would you do it? 
If you could watch everybody work while you just lay on your back 
Would you do it? 
If you could take all the love without giving any back 
Would you do it? 
And so we cannot know ourselves or what we'd really do 
With all your power 
With all your power 
With all your power 
What would you do? 
With all your power 
With all your power 
With all your power 
What would you do? 
If you could make your own money and then give it to everybody 
Would you do it? 
If you knew all the answers and could give it to the masses 
Would you do it? 
No no no no no no are you crazy? 
It's a very dangerous thing to do exactly what you want 
Because you cannot know yourself or what you'd really do 
With all your power 
With all your power 
With all your power 
What would you do do do do do do do do...?
With all your power 
With all your power 
With all your power 
What would you do?
With all your power 
With all your power 
With all your power 
What would you do?
With all your power 
With all your power 
With all your power 
What would you do?
"Looks great."
"I quit, you... you m... I didn't... I didn't make it all the way through that."
Oh, it is love
From the first time I set my eyes up on yours
Thinking oh, is it love?
Oh dear
It's been hardly a moment
And you are already missed
There is still a bit of your skin
That I've yet to have kissed
Oh say please do not go
But you know you know that I must
Oh say I love you so
But you know you know you can trust
We'll be holding hands once again
All our broken plans I will mend
I will hold you tight so you know
It is love from the first
Time I pressed my hand into yours
Thinking Oh is it love?
Oh dear, it's been hardly three days
And I'm longing to feel your embrace
There are several days
Until I can see your sweet face
Oh say Wouldn't you like to be older and married with me
Oh say wouldn't it be nice to know right now that we'll be
Someday holding hands in the end
All our broken plans will have been
I will kiss you soft so you know
It is love from the first
Time I pressed my lips against yours
Thinking Oh is it love?
Oh
Your heart may long for love that is more near
So when I'm gone these words will be here
To ease every fear
And dry up every tear
And make it very clear
I kiss you and I know
It is love from the first
Time I pressed my lips against yours
Thinking Oh is it love?
Oh it is love from the first
Time I pressed my lips against yours
Thinking Oh is it love?
Oh I kiss you and I know
It is love from the first
Time I pressed my lips against yours
Thinking Oh is it love?
I woke up in New York City
From my sleep behind the wheel
Caught a train to Poughkeepsie
And time stood still
She wrote me a letter from San Diego
To qualify her luck
These flights connect through Arizona
But I think I'll stay stuck
So here I am
Here I am
Well, I woke up in a car
I traced away the fog
So I could see the Mississippi on her knees
I've never been so lost
I've never felt so much at home
Please write my folks and throw away my keys
I woke up in a car
I woke up in a car
I met a girl who kept tattoos
For homes that she had loved
If I were her I'd paint my body
Till all my skin was gone
She wrote me a letter
As we passed through Rockford
She said she won't forget
Maybe I do maybe I don't
But I know I haven't yet
So here I am
Here I am
Well, I woke up in a car
I traced away the fog
So I could see the Mississippi on her knees
I've never been so lost
I've never felt so much at home
Please write my folks and throw away my keys
I woke up in a car
I woke up in a car
And maybe I could live forever
If not ever I had known
That you'd be waiting there whenever
I am all alone
But here I am
Well, I woke up in a car
I traced away the fog
So I could see the Mississippi on her knees
I've never been so lost
I've never felt so much at home
Please write my folks and throw away my keys
Well, I woke up in a car
I traced away the fog
So I could see the Mississippi on her knees
I've never been so lost
I've never felt so much at home
Please write my folks and throw away my keys
I woke up in a car
I woke up in a car
I woke up in a car
Baby
I finally know what I'm going after
I'm learning to let in all the laughter
Holy Moley you're so funnny
You Crack me up, you crack me up
Look out for dreams that keep returning
'Cause magic ain't no hand-me-down yearning
You feel it, you want it, the way I want you babe
Traveling by choo-choo train
We know where we just don't know when
Like some everlasting onion peeled by love
Never heard a better bad joke said out loud
You flip-flop and I wild out
Can you believe it
I can't believe it but it's true
You're giving eighty billion years of giggling
A whole new world to live in
But this one's real, this one's real, this one's real
Like a bow tied Kangaroo
You be one and I'll be one too
We play it goofy or we play it cool
Everything that happened
You know it don't mean a thing to us
'Cause so much is gonna happen
Because
You showed me a sunset overflowing
But who cares where it's going
As long as you're next to me
Sea Lion woman
She drinks coffee
She drinks tea
And we're so cold
Sea Lion woman
She drinks coffee

We got the man then stab him in his back

I will bathe myself
Then I'll wear you for the night
Colors fading and frayed at the sides
We're changing in the light
Oh, why is your face so pale and white?
There's a lot of words to come out
Just waiting for the perfect hideout
Down where the walls started shaking
I'm ready for you to find out
To find out
Now the night has fled
Just like everything I said
When the moon was out instead
Now the sun glows soft and red
You burn through my mind
Again and again, again and again
And again and again
There's a lot words to come out
Just waiting for the perfect hideout
Down where the walls started shaking
I'm ready for you to find out
To find out
Part 1: World's Columbian Exposition
Oh, great intentions
I've got the best of interventions
But when the ads come
I think about it now
In my infliction
Entrepreneurial condition
Take us to glory
I think about it now
Cannot conversations cull united nations?
If you've got the patience, celebrate the ancients
Cannot all creation call it celebration?
Or united nation, put it to your head
Oh, great white city
I've got the adequate committee
Where have your walls gone?
I think about it now
Chicago, in fashion
The soft drinks, expansion
Oh, Columbia
From Paris, incentive
Like Cream of Wheat invented
The Ferris wheel
Oh, great intentions
Covenant with the imitation
Have you no conscience?
I think about it now
Oh, God of Progress
Have you degraded or forgot us?
Where have your laws gone?
I think about it now
Ancient hieroglyphic or the South Pacific
Typically terrific, busy and prolific
Classical devotion, architect promotion
Lacking in emotion, think about it now
Chicago, the New Age
But what would Frank Lloyd Wright say?
Oh, Columbia
Amusement or treasure
These optimistic pleasures
Like the Ferris wheel
Cannot conversations cull united nations?
If you've got the patience, celebrate the ancients
Columbia
Part 2: Carl Sandburg Visits Me in a Dream
I cried myself to sleep last night
And the ghost of Carl
He approached my window
I was hypnotized
I was asked to improvise
On the attitude, the regret
Of a thousand centuries of death
Even with the heart of terror and the superstitious wearer
I am riding all alone, I am writing all alone
Even in my best condition, counting all the superstition
I am riding all alone, I am running all alone
And we laughed at the beatitudes of a thousand lines
We were asked at the attitudes, they reminded us of death
Even with the rest belated, everything is antiquated
Are you writing from the heart, are you writing from the heart?
Even in his heart, the Devil has to know the water level
Are you writing from the heart, are you writing from the heart?
And I cried myself to sleep last night
For the Earth, and materials, they may sound just right to me
Even with the rest belated, everything is antiquated
Are you writing from the heart, are you writing from the heart?
Even in his heart, the Devil has to know the water level
Are you writing from the heart, are you writing from the heart?
And the sign said: "Long haired, freaky people need not apply" (x18)
I'm writing you to catch you up on places I've been
And you held this letter probably got excited,
But there's nothing else inside it
Didn't have a camera by my side this time
Hoping I would see the world with both my eyes
Maybe I will tell you all about it
When I'm in the mood
To lose my way
With words
Today skies are painted colors of a cowboy's cliché
And strange how clouds that look like mountains
In the sky are next to mountains anyway
Didn't have a camera by my side this time
Hoping I would see the world with both my eyes
Maybe I will tell you all about it
When I'm in the mood
To lose my way but let me say
You should have seen that sunrise
With your own eyes
It brought me back to life
You'll be with me next time I go outside
No more 3x5's
I guess you had to be there
I guess you had to be with me
Oh today I finally overcame
Tryin' to fit the world inside a picture frame
Maybe I will tell you all about it
When I'm in the mood
To lose my way but let me say
You should have seen that sunrise
With your own eyes
It brought me back to life
You'll be with me next time I go outside
No more 3x5's
Just no more 3x5's
Ooh, ooh, yeah!
Ooh, ooh, yeah!
Muck around
Waste another mile now
Muck around
Waste another mile now
You feel the need
There is no way to return
You feel the need
Oh yeah it burns
What a ride
Hot love on a platter
Yeah, yeah
Give me that thing
Give in my friend
Give me good good times around the bend
I'll stay forever
Give me that thing
Give in my friend
Give me hot, hot love around the bend
I'll stay forever with you
Ooh, ooh, yeah!
Lay down on daddy's lawn
Lay me down
Smell the break of dawn
You feel the heat
There is no way to return
You feel the heat
Oh yeah it burns
Pick a fruit
Let me be your apple
Yeah, oh yeah!
Give me that thing
Give in my friend
Give me good good times around the bend
I'll stay forever
Give me that thing
Give in my friend
Give me hot, hot love around the bend
I'll stay forever with you
Yeah-eah!
Ooh, ooh, yeah!
Yeah-eah!
Ooh, ooh, yeah!
Give me that thing
Give in my friend
Give me good good times around the bend
I'll stay forever
Oh yeah!
Give me that thing
Give in my friend
Give me hot, hot love around the bend
I'll stay forever with you
Forever with you (Stay for ever)
Muck around 'til the end
I'll stay forever with you
Give me love
Give in, my friend
Ah, 'round the bend
Yeah, hot, hot, love
And we're slow to acknowledge
The knots in the laces, heart it races
And we go back to where
We moved out to the places, heart it races
I bought it in a can
And stirred it with my fingers singing
Boom, da da, da da, da da
Boom, da da, da da
Threw it out the window
Lately you've been tanned
Suspicious for the winter with your
Boom, da da, da da, da da
Boom, da da, da da
Legs like little splinters
And we're slow to acknowledge
The knots in the laces, heart it races
And we go back to where
We moved out to the places, heart it races
I sold it to a man
And threw him out that window, he went
Boom, da da, da da, da da
Boom, da da, da da
Made his wife a widow
Heart it races alone
Heart it races alone
Heart it races alone
Boom, da da, da da, da da
Boom, da da, da da
Boom, da da, da da, da da
Boom, da da, da da
Boom, da da, da da, da da
Boom, da da, da da
Boom, da da, da da, da da
Boom, da da, da da
Boom, da da, da da, da da
Boom da da, da da
Boom, da da, da da, da da
Boom da da, da da
Boom, da da, da da, da da
Boom, da da, da da
Boom, da da, da da, da da
Boom, da da, da da
Boom, da da, da da, da da
Boom, da da, da da
Boom, da da, da da, da da
Boom, da da, da da
Boom, da da, da da, da da
Boom da da, da da
(Heart it races)
Boom, da da, da da, da da

Boom, da da, da da, da da
Boom, da da, da da, boom
Oh, when I look to the shape of my heart
It's separated only by scars
That cut in and cut out
Oh, and leave me without
Oh, a heart that functions at all
And when I look to the shape of the sky
I give thanks for this hollow chest of mine
That I no longer feel
The great weight of ordeals
That can make this life so unkind
Oh, and if there's any love in me
Don't let it show
Oh, and if there's any love in me
Don't let it grow
Oh when the wild was all covered by snow
I forgot the colours that the grass tend to grow
Oh, the trees were all leafless
And lifeless and black
And I wondered if the leaves could grow back
For your heart is like a flower as it grows
And its the rain, not just the sun that helps it bloom
And you don't know how it feels to be alive
Until you know how it feels to die
Oh, and if there's any love in me
Don't let it show
Oh, and if there's any love in me
Don't let it grow
Oh, and if there's any love in me
Don't let it show
Oh, and if there's any love in me
Don't let it grow
Oh, and if there's any love in me
Don't let it show
Oh, and if there's any love in me
Don't let it grow
And do you ever feel like you're alone?
And do you ever wish to be unknown?
I can say that I have
I can say that I have
And do you ever feel things here aren't right?
And do you ever feel the time slip by?
And I can say that I have
And I can say that I have
So hear this please
And watch as your heart speeds up endlessly
And look for the stars as the sun goes down
Each breath that you take has a thunderous sound
Everything, everything's magic
Just sit back and hold on, but hold on tight
Prepare for the best and the fastest ride
And reach out your hand and I'll make you mine
Everything, everything's magic
And do you ever lay awake at night?
And do you ever tell yourself don't try?
Don't try to let yourself down
Don't try to let yourself down
And do you ever see yourself in love?
And do you ever take a chance, my love?
Because you know that I will
Because you know that I will
So hear this please
And watch as your heart speeds up endlessly
And look for the stars as the sun goes down
Each breath that you take has a thunderous sound
Everything, everything's magic
Just sit back and hold on, but hold on tight
Prepare for the best and the fastest ride
And reach out your hand and I'll make you mine
Everything, everything's magic
Everything, everything's magic
So hear this please
And watch as your heart speeds up endlessly
And look for the stars as the sun goes down
Each breath that you take has a thunderous sound
Everything, everything's magic
Just sit back and hold on, but hold on tight
Prepare for the best and the fastest ride
And reach out your hand and I'll make you mine
Everything, everything's magic
I am a vampire
I am a vampire
I am a vampire
I am a vampire
I am a vampire
Vampire
I am a vampire
I have lost my fangs
I am a vampire
I am a vampire
I am a vampire
I have lost my fangs
So I'm sad and I feel lonely
So I cry and I'm very angry
And I eat some garlic
So I'm no more satanic
Yeah yeah
I am a vampire and I'm looking in the city
But the pretty girls don't look at me
Don't look at me
'Cause I don't have my fangs
'Cause I have lost my fangs
I am a vampire
I am a vampire
I have lost my mouth organ
I am a vampire
I am a vampire
I have lost my mouth organ
So I get bored and I shout
So I eat pop corn and I put on weight
And I sing but my voice is breaking
And I want to play the guitar
But my guitar is out of tune
I am a vampire and I'm walking in the city
But the musicals don't play with me
Don't play with me
'Cause I don't have my mouth organ
'Cause I have lost my mouth organ
My friend the communist 
Holds meetings in his RV 
I can't afford his gas
So I'm stuck here watching TV
I don't have digital
I don't have diddly squat
It's not having what you want
It's wanting what you've got 
I'm gonna soak up the sun
I'm gonna tell everyone 
To lighten up (I'm gonna tell 'em that)
I've got no one to blame
For every time I feel lame
I'm looking up
I'm gonna soak up the sun
I'm gonna soak up the sun
I've got a crummy job
It don't pay near enough
To buy the things it takes
To win me some of your love
Every time I turn around
I'm looking up, you're looking down
Maybe something's wrong with you
That makes you act the way you do
I'm gonna soak up the sun
I'm gonna tell everyone 
To lighten up (I'm gonna tell 'em that)
I've got no one to blame
For every time I feel lame
I'm looking up
I'm gonna soak up the sun
While it's still free
I'm gonna soak up the sun
Before it goes out on me
Don't have no master suite
But I'm still the king of me
You have a fancy ride
But baby, I'm the one who has the key
Every time I turn around
I'm looking up, you're looking down
Maybe something's wrong with you
That makes you act the way you do
Maybe I am crazy too
I'm gonna soak up the sun
I'm gonna tell everyone 
To lighten up (I'm gonna tell 'em that)
I've got no one to blame
For every time I feel lame
I'm looking up
I'm gonna soak up the sun
I'm gonna tell everyone 
To lighten up (I'm gonna tell 'em that)
I've got no one to blame
For every time I feel lame
I'm looking up
I'm gonna soak up the sun
Got my 45 on
So I can rock on
Summer in winter
Winter in springtime
You heard the birds sing
Everything will be fine
I spent the summer wasting
The time was passed so easily
But if the summer's wasted
How come that I could feel so free?
I spent the summer wasting
The sky was blue beyond compare
A photograph of myself
Is all I have to show for
Seven years of river walkways
Seven weeks of staying up all night
I spent the summer wasting
The time was passed so pleasantly
Say cheerio to books now
The only things I'll read are faces
I spent the summer wasting
Under a canopy of
Seven weeks of river walkways
Seven weeks of reading papers
Seven weeks of feeling guilty
Seven weeks of staying up all night
Summer in winter
Winter is springtime
You heard the birds sing
Everything will be fine
I can't look at the rocket launch
The trophy wives of the astronauts
And I won't listen to their words
'Cause I like
Birds
I don't care for walkin' downtown
Crazy auto car gonna mow me down
Look at all the people like cows in a herd
Well I like
Birds
If you're small and on a search
I've got a feeder for you to perch on
I can't stand in line at the store
The mean little people are such a bore
But it's all right if you act like a turd
'Cause I like
Birds
If you're small and on a search
I've got a feeder for you to perch on
If you're small and on a search
I've got a feeder for you to perch on
I've got a feeder for you to perch on
If you're small and on a search
I've got a feeder for you to perch on
I've got a feeder for you to perch on
Candy, she's sweet like candy in my veins
Baby, I'm dying for another taste
And every night my mind is running around her
Thunder's getting louder and louder
Baby you're like lightning in a bottle
I can't let you go now that I got it
And all I need is to be struck by your electric love
Baby your electric love
Electric love
Drown me
You make my heart beat like the rain
Surround me
Hold me deep beneath your waves
And every night my mind is running around her
Thunders getting louder and louder
Baby you're like lightning in a bottle
I can't let you go now that I got it
And all I need is to be struck by your electric love
Baby your electric love
Electric love
Rushing through me
Feel your energy rushing through me
Feel your energy rushing through me
Baby you're like lightning in a bottle
I can't let you go now that I got it
And all I need is to be struck by your electric love
Baby your electric love
Baby your electric
Yeah, like it or not
Like a ball and a chain
all I wanna do is get off
And feel it for a minute, babe
Hot diggity dog
I love God all the same
But all I wanna do is get off
And feel it, feel it, feel it, babe
Baby, come on, yeah
If you have a hard time getting there
Maybe, you're gone
If you find, find yourself against yourself
Yeah maybe I thought
What I thought I would say
that all I wanna do is get off
And feel it for a minute
Like a real big thing, again
I already forgot
Why I thought I was sane
when all I wanna do is get off
And feel it, feel it, feel it babe
Baby, come on, yeah
If you have a hard time getting there
Maybe you're gone
If you find, find yourself against yourself
Hey, come on, yeah
If you have a hard time getting there
Maybe you're gone
If you find, find yourself against yourself
And like it or not
Like a ball and a chain
All I wanna do is get off
And feel for a minute
Like a real big thing, again
I already forgot
Why I thought I was sane
But all I wanna do is get off
And feel it, feel it, feel it, babe
Baby, come on, yeah
If you have a hard time getting there
Maybe you're gone
If you find, find yourself against yourself
Hey, come on, yeah
If you have a hard time getting there
Maybe you're gone
If you find, you find yourself against yourself
Tell me where it all went wrong, tell me where it all went wrong
Tell me where it all went wrong, maybe I can make it better 
Tell me where it all went wrong, don't you know that you really upset her
When you act like a man who is cross with every woman he's never had
If it's true looks could kill and you will be the first to make me mad
Then you'll have to go, maybe you'll have to go
Is this the kind of fate you could contemplate, a breakdown at my very sight 
I promise hidden words of tenderness in every single line that I write
Still you act like a man who is cross with every woman he's never had
If it's true looks could kill and you will be the first to make me mad
Then you'll have to go, maybe you'll have to go
Tell me where it all went wrong, tell me where it all went wrong
(Don't you know that you really upset her?)
Tell me where it all went wrong, tell me where it all went wrong
(Don't you know that you really upset her?)
 
When you act like a man who is cross with every woman he's never had
If it's true looks could kill and you will be the first to make me mad
When you act like a man who is cross with every woman he's never had
If it's true looks could kill and you will be the first to make me mad
Then you'll have to go, maybe you'll have to go
Is it true looks could kill? Is it true looks could kill?
Is it true looks could kill? Yeah, it's true looks could kill
Under the tree where the grass don't grow
We made a promise to never get old
You had a chance and you took it on me
I made a promise that I couldn't keep
Heartache, heartbreak, all over town
But something flipped like a switch when you came around
When I'm in pieces you pick me up and put me together
These are the days we've been waiting for
With days like these you couldn't ask for more
Keep them coming 'cause we're not done yet
These are the days we won't regret
These are the days we won't forget
These are the days we've been waiting for
Rattle the cage and slam that door
We'll look to the stars but not just yet
These are the days we won't regret
These are the days we won't forget
Out on the midnight the wild ones howl
Last of the lost boys who've thrown in the towel
We used to believe we were stars aligned
You made a wish and I fell out of time
Time flew, cut through, all over town
You make me bleed when I look up and you're not around
But I'm in pieces, pick me up, and put me together
These are the days we've been waiting for
With days like these you couldn't ask for more
Keep them coming 'cause we're not done yet
These are the days we won't regret
These are the days we won't forget
These are the days we've been waiting for
Neither of us knows what's in store
You just roll your window down and place your bets
These are the days we won't regret
These are the days we'll never forget
And these are the days
And these are the days
In the salsify mains of what was thought but unsaid
all the calcified arithmatists were doing the math
And it would take a calculated blow to the head 
to light the eyes of all the harmless sociopaths
oh arm in arm we are the harmless sociopaths 
oh, arm in arm with all the harmless sociopaths
calcium mines are buried deep in your chest 
oh the calcium mines you buried deep in your chest.
Ooh,
you're deep in a mine
Ooh,
a calcium mine
o-o-oh
let's get out of here
past the atmosphere
squint your eyes and no one dies or goes to jail
past the silver bridge
oh the silver bridge wearing nothing but a one-sie and a veil.      
Ooh,
you're deep in a mine, o-o-oh
Ooh,
a calcium mine
oh-no-no
arm in arm we are the harmless sociopaths
oh arm in arm with all the harmless sociopaths
in the calcium mines buried deep in your chest
oh the calcium mines buried deep in your chest.
Ooh,
deep in a mine, oh-no
Ooh,
a calcium mine
oh-no
so let's get out of here 
past the atmosphere
squint your eyes and no one dies or goes to jail
past the silver bridge
oh the silver bridge wearing nothing but a one-sie and a veil.
oh-no
oh-no
oh-no
oh-no

Oh Mr. Pit, oh Mr. Pit, Mr. Pitiful
Who let you down?
Who let you down?
Who let you down?
You still don't believe, you don't believe
You don't believe, and your grievances show
When your soapbox unfolds
But please come down from that cloud you're sitting on
I don't expect you to admit that you were wrong
I just want to know how you've been
It don't make me feel bad that we're still friends
Mulling it all over in my head
I hope that you see through your picket
I hope that you see through your big yard and white picket fence
To make amends
And still be friends, still be my friend
So where did you go? Where did you go?
Where did you go while I was out?
While I was out? While I was out?
Well I don't believe, I don't believe
I don't believe everything I see
And if you don't like the movie then quit acting
But please come down from that cloud you're sitting on
I don't expect you to admit that you were wrong
I just want to know how you've been
It don't make me feel bad that we're still friends
Mulling it all over in my head
I hope that you see through your picket
I hope that you see through your big yard and white picket fence
To make amends
And still be friends, still be friends
Still be my friend
I can see clearly now the rain is gone
I can see all obstacles in my way
Gone are the dark clouds that had me blind
It's gonna be a bright (bright)
Bright (bright) sun-shining day
It's gonna be a bright (bright)
Bright (bright) sun-shining day
Oh yes I can make it now the pain is gone
All of the bad feelings have disappeared
Here is that rainbow I've been praying for
It's gonna be a bright (bright)
Bright (bright) sun-shining day
(Ooh...)
Look all around, there's nothing but blue skies.
Look straight ahead, there's nothing but blue skies.
I can see clearly now the rain is gone
I can see all obstacles in my way
Here is that rainbow I've been praying for
It's gonna be a bright (bright)
Bright (bright) sun-shining day
It's gonna be a bright (bright)
Bright (bright) sun-shining day
It's going to be a bright (bright)
Bright (bright) sun-shining day
It's gonna be a bright (bright)
Bright (bright) sun-shining day
It's gonna be a bright (bright)
Bright (bright) sun-shining day
It's gonna be a bright (bright)
Bright (bright) sun-shining day
It's gonna be a bright (bright)
Bright (bright) sun-shining day
It was pretty bright, up on the rainbow bridge tonight
I could see into your window although you're far away
You were racing in a car
Beside a boy, you just don't know if he is up for
What you have in mind
If he is up for what you have in mind
Change is on the cards, but this time it will be hard
I never want to leave you
We've never had a fight
You should never split a pole
You should never split at all
I wish I had two paths I could follow
I'd write the ending without any sorrow
I will say a prayer, just while you are sitting there
And I will wrap my arms around you
'Cause I know it will be fine
We've got a fantasy affair
We didn't get wet, we didn't dare
Our aspirations are wrapped up in books
Our inclinations are hidden in looks
Summer's hastening on
I'm trying to get a feeling from the city
But I've been unfaithful
I've been traveling abroad
We've got a fantasy affair
We didn't get wet, we didn't dare
But the fantasy remains
You better come back to Earth again
Our aspirations, wrapped up in books
Our inclinations, hidden in looks
For the price of a cup of tea
You'd get a line of coke
For the price of a night with me
You'd be the village joke
For the price of a pint of milk
I'll tell you all I know
About the state of the world today
Sit down, enjoy the show
She had several hours to find a place to stay
Try the coffee shop, but somewhere on the way
She heard about a place, somewhere she could go 
Walked a couple of blocks to her destination
For the price of a cup of tea
You'd get a seven inches
Soul black vinyl to stop your tears
You can use my stereo  
You might be the village joke but 
Don't listen to the gossip of the other folk
She just wants to be accepted in this place 
There's something in her face
She will always seem exotic and aloof
If you want to know the truth
Her friend the stars dripping from the jewelled sky
When she was passing by
Would keep her calm 
There was people that she knew, at least she thought she did
Be easy on the kid!
She took her winter coat from her plastic wrapper
Pushed back her fringe, see her birthmark
She can finally be the person she wanted to be
There she goes
There she goes again
Racing through my brain
And I just can't contain
This feeling that remains
There she goes
There she goes again
Pulsing through my veins
And I just can't contain
This feeling that remains
There she goes 
There she goes again
Racing through my brain
And I just can't contain
This feeling that remains
There she goes
There she goes again
She calls my name
Pulls my train
No one else could heal my pain
And I just can't contain
This feeling that remains
There she goes
There she goes again
Chasing down my lane
And I just can't contain
This feeling that remains
There she goes
There she goes
There she goes
It's been a long time comin' since I seen your face
I've been everywhere and back tryin' to replace
Everything that I had till my feet went numb
Praying like a fool that's been on the run
Heart still beating but it's not working
It's like a million dollar phone that you just can't ring
I reached out tried to love but I feel nothing
Yeah, my heart is numb
But with you
I feel again
Yeah with you
I can feel again
Yeah
(Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo
Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo)
I'm feeling better ever since you know me
(Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo)
I was a lonely soul but that's the old me
(Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo)
It's been a long time coming since I've seen your face
And I've never went back trying to replace
Everything that I broke till my feet went numb
Praying like a fool just shy of a gun
Heart still beating but it's not working
It's like a hundred thousand voices that just can't sing
I reach out trying to love but I feel nothing
Oh my heart is numb
But with you
I feel again
Yeah with you
I can feel again
But with you
(I'm feeling better ever since you know me)
I feel again
(I was a lonely soul but that's the old me)
Yeah with you
(I'm feeling better ever since you know me)
I can feel again
(I was a lonely soul)
Woo-hoo
(Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo

(I'm feeling better ever since you know me)
(Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo)

(Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo)
I'm feeling better ever since you know me
(Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo)
I was a lonely soul, but that's the old me
(Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo)
I'm feeling better ever since you know me
(Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo)
I was a lonely soul, but that's the old me
(Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo)
I'm feeling better ever since you know me
I was a lonely soul but that's the old me
A little wiser now from what you showed me
Yeah, I feel again
Feel again
Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo
Hang up the chick habit
Hang it up, daddy
Or you'll be alone in a quick
Hang up the chick habit
Hang it up, daddy
Or you'll never get another fix
I'm telling you it's not a trick
Pay attention, don't be thick
Or you're liable to get licked
You're gonna see the reason why
When they're spittin' in your eye
They'll be spittin' in your eye
Hang up the chick habit
Hang it up, daddy
A girl's not a tonic or a pill
Hang up the chick habit
Hang it up, daddy
You're just jonesing for a spill
Oh, how your bubble's gonna burst
When you meet another nurse
She'll be driving in a hearse
You're gonna need a heap of glue
When they all catch up with you
And they cut you up in two
Now your ears are ringing
The birds have stopped their singing
Everything is turning grey
No candy in your till
No cutie left to thrill
You're alone, alone to stay
Hang up the chick habit
Hang it up, daddy
Or you'll be alone in a quick
Hang up the chick habit
Hang it up, daddy
Or you'll never get another fix
I'm telling you it's not a trick
Pay attention, don't be thick
Or you're liable to get licked
You're gonna see the reason why
When they're spitting in your eye
They'll be spitting in your eye
You're gonna see the reason why
When they're spitting in your eye
They'll be spitting in your eye
You're gonna see the reason why
When they're spitting in your eye
They'll be spitting in your eye
You're gonna see the reason why
When they're spitting in your eye
They'll be spitting in your eye
Free from it all
I'm not gonna change till I want to
And I'm free from it all
I'm not gonna change till I want to
By the way she looked, I should've calmed down
I went too far
Oh, that's all I've got to say
By the way she looked, I should've calmed down
I went too far
Oh, that's all I've got to say
Free from it all
I'm not gonna change till I want to
And I'm free from the world
Where I've built too many walls
By the way she looked, I should've calmed down
I went too far
Oh, that's all I've got to say
By the way she looked, I should've calmed down
I went too far
Oh, I went too far
Lisa knows a girl who's been abused
It changed her philosophy in '82
She's always looking for a fight
She keeps the neighbors up all night
I go to her when I'm feeling slack
The girl's using me as a punching bag
I think that I could help her out
But the girl's got a lot to be mad about
And in the first moment of her waking up
She knows she's losing it, yeah she's losing it
When the first cup of coffee tastes like washing up
She knows she's losing it, oh yeah she's losing
Oh yeah she's losing it
Lisa met Chelsea at the knocking school
Chelsea didn't feel like following the rules
So they left the place for another school
Where the boys go with boys and the girls with girls
Chelsea was the one who's been abused
It changed her philosophy in '82
She says, "Inch for inch and pound for pound"
Who needs boys when there's Lisa round?"
But in the first moment of her waking up
She knows she's losing it, oh yeah she's losing it
When the first cup of coffee tastes like washing up
She knows she's losing it, oh yeah she's losing it
She goes to the mirror to put on her stuff
She knows she's losing it, oh yeah she's losing it
When she doesn't speak to anyone till four o' clock
She knows she's losing it, oh yeah she's losing it
Oh yeah she's losing it
I spent the winter on the verge of a total breakdown while living in Norway
I felt the darkness of the black metal bands
But being such fawn of a man I didn't burn down any old churches
Just slept way too much, just slept
My mind rejects the frequency
It's static craziness to me
Is it a solar fever?
The TV man is too loud
Our plane is sleeping on a cloud
You turn the dial, I'll try and smile
We've eaten plastic weather
This family sticks together
We will escape from the south to the west side
My mind rejects the frequency
It's just verbosity to me
I spent the winter with my nose buried in a book
While trying to restructure my character
Because it had become vile to its creator
And through many dreadful nights
I lay praying to a saint that nobody has heard of
And waiting for some high times to come again
My mind rejects the frequency
It's static craziness to me
Is it a solar fever?
The TV man is too loud
Our plane is sleeping on a cloud
You turn the dial, I'll try and smile
We've eaten plastic weather
This family sticks together
We will escape from the south to the west side
My mind rejects the frequency
It's just verbosity to me
Dirty old shadow, stay away
Don't play your games with me
I am older now, I see the way you operate
If you don't hurt me then you die
My mind rejects the frequency
It's static craziness to me
Is it a solar fever?
The TV man is too loud
Our plane is sleeping on a cloud
You turn the dial, I'll try and smile
We've eaten plastic weather
This family sticks together
We will escape from the south to the west side
My mind rejects the frequency
It's just verbosity to me
(Uno, dos, tres)
It's been a really, really messed up week
Seven days of torture, seven days of bitter
And my girlfriend went and cheated on me
She's a California dime but it's time for me to quit her
La la la, whatever
La la la, it doesn't matter
La la la, oh well
La la la
We're going at it tonight, tonight
There's a party on the rooftop, top of the world
Tonight, tonight and we're dancing on the edge of the Hollywood Sign
I don't know if I'll make it, but watch how good I'll fake it
It's all right, all right, tonight, tonight
I woke up with a strange tattoo
Not sure how I got it, not a dollar in my pocket
And it kinda looks just like you
Mixed with Zach Galifianakis
Huh
La la la, whatever, la la la, it doesn't matter, la la la, oh well, la la la
We're going at it tonight, tonight
There's a party on the rooftop, top of the world

She runs through the valley of death and of sleeping
She laughs as she dances, her feet wake the flowers
She comes a-now running through our gloomy town
Yes Jade is the girl of the hour
We can't help but follow, she's Buddha, just watch her
She moves like an old gypsy woman but swears she's a girl
And all that she asks we'll allow her
For Jade is the girl of the hour
It is her hour so let it be hers
Find it and shine it and wind it always
It is her hour so let it be hers 
Yes Jade is the girl of the hour
The people in town now just wake up to see her for
When she smiles they all feel the power 
The strong men, the children and even the cowards 
Know Jade's the girl of the hour
It is her hour so let it be hers
Find it and shine it and wind it always
It is her hour so let it be hers 
Yes Jade is the girl of the hour
You won't soon forget the name
Softly now, join her she's blessed for construction
She sings and sounds off the hammer of God
Man I swear she's come here to fill us with power
It's Jade, the girl of the hour
It is her hour so let it be hers
Find it and shine it and wind it always
It is her hour so let it be hers 
Yes Jade is the girl of the hour
It is her hour so let it be hers
Find it and shine it and wind it always
It is her hour so let it be hers 
Yes Jade is the girl of the hour
You won't soon forget the name
You remind me of a former love that I once knew
And you carry a little speech with you
We were holding hands walking through the middle of the street
It's fine with me, I'm just taking in the scenery
You remind me of a few of my famous friends
Well, that all depends what you qualify as friends
You remind me of a few of my famous friends
Well, that all depends what you qualify as friends
Take a chance, take your shoes off, dance in the rain
And I was flashing around and the news spread all over town
I'm not complaining that it's raining, I'm just saying that I like it a lot
More than you think, if the sun would come out and sing with me
You remind me of a few of my famous friends
Well, that all depends what you qualify as friends
You remind me of a few of my famous friends
Well, that all depends what you qualify as friends
Just in case they're wondering
They've got us pinned terribly
They don't believe our love is real
'Cause they don't know how real love feels
You should know it's true
Just now, the part about my love for you
And how my heart's about to burst
Into a thousand pieces
Oh it must be true
And They'll believe us too, soon
Baby, it's fact
That our love is true
The way black is black
And blue is just blue
My love is true
It's a matter of fact
Oh, and you love me too
It's a simple as that
Baby, our love is true
They may say some awful things
But there's no point in listening
Your words are the only words
That I believe in afterwards.
You should know it's true
Just now, the part about my love for you

When I think back on all the crap I learned in high school
It's a wonder I can think at all
And though my lack of education hasn't hurt me none
I can read the writing on the wall
Kodachrome
They give us those nice bright colors
Give us the greens of summers
Makes you think all the world's a sunny day, oh yeah
I got a Nikon camera
I love to take a photograph
So mama don't take my Kodachrome away
If you took all the girls I knew when I was single
And brought 'em all together for one night
I know they'd never match my sweet imagination
And everything looks worse in black and white
Kodachrome
They give us those nice bright colors
They give us the greens of summers
Makes you think all the world's a sunny day, oh yeah
I got a Nikon camera
I love to take a photograph
So mama don't take my Kodachrome away
Mama don't take my Kodachrome away
Mama don't take my Kodachrome away
Mama don't take my Kodachrome away
Mama don't take my Kodachrome
Mama don't take my Kodachrome
Mama don't take my Kodachrome away
Mama don't take my Kodachrome
Leave your boy so far from home
Mama don't take my Kodachrome away
Mama don't take my Kodachrome
Mama don't take my Kodachrome away
My head is a box filled with nothing
And that's the way I like it
My garden's a secret compartment
And that's the way I like it
And that's the way I like it
Your body's a dream that turns violent
And that's the way I like it
And that's the way I like it
The winter is long in the city
And that's the way I like it
So please
Baby, please
Open your heart
Catch my disease
I was backstage in Pomona
And that's the way I like it
She drank beer with Coca-Cola
And that's the way I like it
And that's the way I like it
She told me about the winds from Santa Ana
And that's the way I like it
And that's the way I like it
She told me she loved me like fireworks
And that's the way I like it
So please
Baby, please
Open your eyes
And catch my disease
So please (Please)
Baby, please
Come on
And catch my disease
Catch it
Na na na na na na na
They play Good Charlotte on the radio
And that's the way I like it
They play Sleepy Jackson on the radio
And that's the way I like it
Yeah, that's the way I like it
I hear Beyoncé on the radio
And that's the way I like it
'Cause that's the way I like it
They don't play me on the radio
But that's the way I like it
So please
Baby, please
Open your heart
Catch my disease
So please
Baby, please
Come on
And catch my disease
Catch my disease

(Na na na na na na na)
(Na na na na na na na)
Whoo
(Na na na na na na na)
Na na na na
(Na na na na na na na)
I get tired and upset
And I'm trying to care a little less
When I Google I only get depressed
I was taught to dodge those issues
I was told
Don't worry, there's no doubt
There's always something to cry about
When you're stuck in angry crowd
They don't think what they say
Before they open their mouth
You gotta 
Pack up your troubles in your old kit bag
And bury them beneath the sea
I don't care what the people may say 
What the people may say about me
Pack up your troubles, get your old kit bag
Don't worry about the cavalries
I don't care what the whisperers say
'Cause they whisper too loud for me
Hot topic
Maybe I should drop it
It's a touchy subject
And I like to tiptoe 'round
The ship going down
We got no penny, no pound
So if your business is running out
It's not my business to talk about
They don't think what to say
Before they open their mouth
You gotta 
Pack up your troubles in your old kit bag
And bury them beneath the sea
I don't care what the people may say 
What the people may say about me
Pack up your troubles, get your old kit bag
Don't worry about the cavalries
I don't care what the whisperers say
'Cause they whisper too loud for me
Tweet, tweet
Tweet, tweet, tweet, tweet, tweet
Tweet, tweet, tweet, 
Tweet, tweet, tweet, tweet, tweet
Tweet, tweet, tweet, 
Tweet, tweet, tweet, tweet, tweet
Tweet, tweet, tweet, tweet
Pack up your troubles in your old kit bag
And bury them beneath the sea
I don't care what the people may say 
What the people may say about me
Pack up your troubles, get your old kit bag
Don't worry about the cavalries
I don't care what the whisperers say
'Cause they whisper too loud for me
Yeah, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh
Yeah, eh, eh, eh
Yeah, eh, eh, eh
(When your best friend's all strung out)
You do everything you can 'cause you're never gonna let it get 'em down
(When you find it all around)
Yeah, it comes in waves, but it's hardest from the start
Feelings sleeping in the field again
But I can feel, I can feel, I can feel it's beginning to end
Yeah, premonitions smiling in the dark
Well, I can see, I can see, I can see the story's starting to arc
It dries up
I've been a spoken word, I've been a river bed, I've been a rabid force
And let it flow out from within
Sometimes it feels like I only dream in black and white
And color's so, oh!
(When your best friend's all strung out)
You do everything you can 'cause you're never gonna let it get 'em down
(When you find it all around)
You say it's what you need and hide your eyes when you're close to me
(With your feet up in the clouds)
Well, it comes in waves, but it's hardest from the start
Waves in theta slipping into dreams
I can feel, I can feel, I can feel the celestial beings
Wilted pleasures leave you with a breath
I can see, I can see, I can see the beauty in the mess
It dries up
I've been a river bed, I tried to salt the wound
I've carried more than I can
I feel I've got a lot to prove
Sometimes it feels like I only dream in black and white
And color's so, oh!
(When your best friend's all strung out)
You do everything you can 'cause you're never gonna let it get 'em down
(When you find it all around)
You say it's what you need and hide your eyes when you're close to me
(With your feet up in the clouds)
You oughta know, that I'm here no matter where you go
(With your head hanging upside down)
Well, it comes in waves, but it's hardest from the start
I am here
No matter where you are
I'm waiting here with open arms
No matter where you are
Sometimes you have to wait until it passes by
Like a satellite or star
No matter where you are
(When your best friend's all strung out)
You know it, ooh, ooh
(With your feet up in the clouds)
Oh yeah, you know it
Ooh, ooh
(When your best friend's all strung out)
Oh yeah, you know it
You oughta know that I'm here no matter where you go
(With your head hanging upside down)
Oh yeah, you know it
That's how you know that your best friend's all strung out
Standing in a crowded room and I can't see your face
Put your arms around me, tell me everything's OK
In my mind, I'm running round a cold and empty space
Just put your arms around me, tell me everything's OK
Break my bones but you won't see me fall, oh
The rising tide will rise against them all, oh
Darling, hold my hand
Oh, won't you hold my hand?
'Cause I don't wanna walk on my own anymore
Won't you understand? 'Cause I don't wanna walk alone
I'm ready for this, there's no denying
I'm ready for this, you stop me falling
I'm ready for this, I need you all in
I'm ready for this, so darling, hold my hand
Soul is like a melting pot when you're not next to me
Tell me that you've got me and you're never gonna leave
Tryna find a moment where I can find release
Please tell me that you've got me and you're never gonna leave
Break my bones but you won't see me fall, oh
The rising tide will rise against them all, oh
Darling, hold my hand
Oh, won't you hold my hand?
'Cause I don't wanna walk on my own anymore
Won't you understand? 'Cause I don't wanna walk alone
I'm ready for this, there's no denying
I'm ready for this, you stop me falling
I'm ready for this, I need you all in
I'm ready for this, so darling, hold my hand
Don't wanna know
That feeling when I'm all alone
So please don't make me wait, 'cause I don't wanna break
And I don't wanna fall
When you're next to me
Can tell I'm not afraid to be
That you don't make me wait, and never let me break
You never let me fall
Darling, hold my hand
Oh, won't you hold my hand?
'Cause I don't wanna walk on my own anymore
Won't you understand? 'Cause I don't wanna walk alone
I'm ready for this, there's no denying
I'm ready for this, you stop me falling
I'm ready for this, I need you all in
I'm ready for this, so darling, hold my hand
Oh twisted me, I came to eat at the hall where we danced to some duds
My crowd of pals observed my fingers and prayed for the lunch I had hung
And cheers rolled out and I thought early of tunas in tenison's tubs
That should turn into something
You should turn into something
Oh blissful bleed, I came out peaking and leaked out like a wet clown
My tears rolled down and arms went round at night, I gapped at her gowns
So often green but she held me my curtains were covered in hounds
She said, "Oh my sweet goodness wish you could be here every time
But don't miss me goodness because I rub away every time
Then groan at the goodness but do you mean not every time?
Then gone in the goodness wish I could stay here every time"
A mistful meet with teachers speaking there muffled by buzzes and hums
So headphone tones do float me home, my chair was begging to come
And I'm not bummed, some works not fun then we crawl in the carpet like bugs
That should turn into something
You should turn into something
Unrestful eve, I sipped on leaks and sat in the room had a grudge
The jumping dust made catfish bust from corners now dripping with mud
And she knocked twice and we got silly and no-one knew what would come
She said, "Oh my sweet goodness, wish you could be here every time
But don't miss me goodness because I rub away every time
Then groan at the goodness but do you mean not every time?
Then gone in the goodness wish I could stay here every time"
But you'll turn into something
You should turn into something
Maybe you can owe me? 
Or should we wait and see? 
'Cause I've been saving up for something we need, 
As long as you're open to the possibility, yeah. 
Surely, there's a story in counting all the minutes 'til July the 1st, 
But you counted all the seconds and it made you feel worse, 
I don't wanna be here, 
You just wanna be there, 
But it's awful complicated and you're warning me to beware. 
And honey, there's no hurry, 
I know it's overdue there's a key to the door, 
To the room where I'm staying, 
You can sleep on the floor, 
Half way through the night can we talk and see? 
'Cause there's no way that I'll sleep when you're near me
Hook up with me, meet at the rally
Follow the shouting, I am longing for you
Hook up with me, meet at the rally
I waited so long, I couldn't find a cause
Tired or wasted, I think you're decent
I waited so long, there'll be no decency, no
(Don't you give me those)
Shifty eyes pay attention
Dirty talk talk talk quiet
Just as long as you're gone
It won't happen at all
Remember the time we talked about everlastings?
Don't you know we'll both fall to pieces too?
April 22nd at the Avalon, you teased me
Hook up with me, meet at the rally
Shifty eyes pay attention
Dirty talk talk talk quiet
Just as long as you're gone
It won't happen at all
Don't go away we're so near
Look around, you see
There is nothing to say but the things I know
I got nothing to say but the things I know
Standing in line, I think you're pretty
Lying on your bed, I think you're pretty too
Young girl, girl, you're everything
Hook up with me, meet at the rally
(Don't you give me those)
Shifty eyes pay attention
Dirty talk talk talk quiet
Just as long as you're gone
It won't happen at all
Shifty eyes pay attention
Dirty talk talk talk louder
Just as long as you're gone
I won't leave you alone
I got a story, it's almost finished
Now all I need is someone to tell it to, maybe that's you
Our time is borrowed and spent too freely
Every minute I have needs to be made up, but how?
I'm looking for a nice way to say I'm out
I want out
I fall asleep with my friends around me
Only place I know I feel safe, I'm gonna call this home
The open road is still miles away
Hey, nothing serious, we still have our fun, or we had it once
But windows open and close
That's just how it goes
Don't it feel like sunshine after all?
The world we loved forever gone
We're only just as happy
As everyone else seems to think we are (Don't it feel like, like sunshine)
Are (Don't it feel like sunshine after all)
I'm in love with the ordinary
I need a simple space, and rest my head, and everything gets clear
I'm a little ashamed for asking
But just a little helps, it gets me straight again
Helps me get over it, over it (Helps me get over it, over it)
It might seem like a dream
But it's real to me
Don't it feel like sunshine after all? (Don't it feel like sunshine after all)
The world we loved forever gone (All you love, but it's gone)
We're only just as happy (We're happy)
As everyone else seems to think we are (Don't it feel like, like sunshine)
You should see the canals are freezing
You should see me high, you should just be here, be with me here
It doesn't seem there's hope for me, I let you down
But I won't give in now, not for any amount
Don't it feel like sunshine after all? (Don't it feel like sunshine after all)
The world we loved forever gone (All you love, but it's gone)
We're only just as happy (We're happy)
As everyone else thinks
Now don't that feel like sunshine after all? (Don't it feel like sunshine after all)
The world we loved forever gone (All you love, but it's gone)
We're only just as happy (We're happy)
As everyone else seems to think we are (Don't it feel like, like sunshine)
Are (Don't it feel like sunshine after all)
Rose-tinted view 
And satellites that compromise the truth
But I wanted more, with the cuts and the bruises
Touch my face, a hopeless embrace
Faith
Drives me away
But it turns me on
Like a strangers love
It rockets through the universe
It fuels the lies, it feeds the curse
Believes we could be 
Glorious
I need to believe
But I still want more, with the cuts and the bruises
Don't close the door, on what you adore
Faith
Drives me away
But it turns me on
Like a strangers love
It rockets through the universe
It fuels the lies, it feeds the curse
Believes we could be 
Glorious
Girl, 
You wanted,
To shut it all off and make a run for the door.
It's so hard,
To make it,
For every inch we get we need a mile more.
But there is always so much distance can't but feel it somehow,
But you have never ever felt it like you feel it right now.
I'm closing up inside and I was only just started,
And you can't be close enough unless I'm feeling your heart beat.
All of your love,
Was all that I needed.
All of your love,
Was all that I needed.
Girl,
What are you doing now?
And are you going out? 
Or has your life shut down?
Are you there?
This string keeps cutting out,
I feel like freaking out,
But we keep reaching out.
But there is always so much distance can't but feel it somehow,
But you have never ever felt it like you feel it right now.
I'm closing up inside and I was only just started,
But you can't be close enough unless I'm feeling your heart beat.
All of your love,
Was all that I needed.
All of your love,
Was all that I needed.
Girl,
It's hard enough,
Just to move around.
It's hard enough,
Just to move around.
I wanted you,
Oh, I wanted you,
Oh, I wanted you to move...
Oh, I wanted you,
Girl, I wanted you,
Oh, I wanted you to move...
Around.
Around.
All of your love,
Was all that I needed.
All of your love,
Was all that I needed.
Sugar, ah, honey, honey
You are my candy girl
And you've got me wanting you
Honey, ah, sugar, sugar
You are my candy girl
And you got me wanting you
I just can't believe the loveliness of loving you
(I just can't believe it's true)
I just can't believe the wonder of this feeling, too
(I just can't believe it's true)
Sugar, ah, honey, honey
You are my candy girl
And you've got me wanting you
Oh, honey, ah, sugar, sugar
You are my candy girl
And you got me wanting you
When I kissed you, girl, I knew how sweet a kiss could be
(I know how sweet a kiss could be)
Like the summer sunshine pour you sweetness over me
(Pour your sweetness over me)
Pour a little sugar on it, honey
Pour a little sugar on it, baby
(I'm gonna make your life so sweet) (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Pour a little sugar on it, yeah
Pour a little sugar on it, honey
Pour a little sugar on it, baby
(I'm gonna make your life so sweet) (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Pour a little sugar on it, yeah
Sugar, ah, honey, honey
You are my candy girl
And you've got me wanting you
Ohohohoho (Honey, honey, sugar, sugar)
Sugar, sugar (Honey, honey, sugar, sugar)
You are my candy girl (Para, papara)
(Paraparara)
Gave you a minute
When you needed an hour
Chose to push it aside
Instead of leaving it behind you
If any word that I said
Could've made you forget
I'd have given you them all
But it was all in your head
And we're burning all the bridges now
Watching it go up in flames
No way to build it up again
Now we're burning all the bridges now
'Cause it was sink or swim
And I went down, down, down
And we're burning all the bridges
Burning all the bridges now
And we're burning all the bridges
Burning all the bridges now
If I hadn't hit it
Would you still say you needed me?
Guess I walked right into it
Guess I made it too easy
If any word that you said
Could've made me forget
Would I get up off the floor?
'Cause this is all in my head
And we're burning all the bridges now
Watching it go up in flames
No way to build it up again
And we're burning all the bridges
Burning all the bridges now
And we're burning all the bridges
Burning all the bridges now
Can we forget about it?
Can we forget?
Can we forget about it?
Can we forget?
Burning all the bridges
Burning all the bridges now
And we're burning all the bridges
Burning all the bridges now
It's just my Japanese cigarette case,
Bring a mirror to my face
Let all my memories be gone
Bring me my Japanese cigarette case,
Bring a mirror to my face,
Oh, let all my memories be gone
Saturday morning and it's time to go 
One day these could be the days but who could have known 
Loading in the back of a pickup truck 
Riding with the boys and pushing the luck 
Singing songs loud on the way to the game 
Wishing all the things could still be the same 
Chinese homeruns over the backstop 
Kakua on the ball and soda pop well... 
We used to laugh a lot 
But only because we thought 
That everything good always would remain 
Nothing's gonna change there's no need to complain 
Sunday morning and it's time to go 
Been raining all night so everybody knows 
Over to the field for tackle football 
Big hits, big hats, yeah give me the ball 
Rain is pouring, touchdown scoring 
Keep on rolling, never boring 
Karma, karma, karma chameleon 
We're talking kinda funny from helium 
Well,
We used to laugh a lot 
But only because we thought 
That everything good always would remain 
Nothing's gonna change there's no need to complain 
Monday morning and it's time to go 
Wet trunks and schoolbooks and sand on my toes 
Do anything you can to dodge the bus-stop blues 
Like driving a padiddle with a burnt-out fuse 
My best friend Kimi wants to go with you 
So meet her by the sugar mill after school 
My best friend Kimi wants to go with you 
Meet her by the sugar mill after school 
We used to laugh a lot 
But only because we thought 
That everything good always would remain 
We used to laugh a lot 
But only because we thought 
That everything good always would 
Everything good always would remain
Little deuce coupe, you don't know what I got
Well I'm not braggin' babe, so don't put me down
But I've got the fastest set of wheels in town
When somethin' comes up to me, he don't even try
'Cause if I had a set of wings, man, I know she could fly
She's my little deuce coupe, you don't know what I got
Just a little deuce coupe with a flat head mill
But she'll walk a Thunderbird like she's standin' still
She's ported and relieved and she's stroked and bored
She'll do a hundred and forty in the top end floored
She's my little deuce coupe, you don't know what I got
She's got a competition clutch with a four-on-the-floor
And she purrs like a kitten till the lake pipes roar
And if that ain't enough to make you flip your lid
There's one more thing, I got the pink slip, daddy
And comin' off the line when the light turns green
Well she blows 'em outta the water like you never seen
I get pushed out of shape and it's hard to steer
When I get rubber in all four gears
She's my little deuce coupe, you don't know what I got
She's my little deuce coupe, you don't know what I got
She's my little deuce coupe, you don't know what I got
She's my little deuce coupe, you don't know what I got
On the floor of Tokyo
Or down in London town to go, go
With the record selection
With the mirror reflection
I'm dancing with myself
When there's no-one else in sight
In the crowded lonely night
Well I wait so long
For my love vibration
And I'm dancing with myself
Oh dancing with myself
Oh dancing with myself
Well there's nothing to lose
And there's nothing to prove
I'll be dancing with myself
If I looked all over the world
And there's every type of girl
But your empty eyes
Seem to pass me by
Leave me dancing with myself
So let's sink another drink
'Cause it'll give me time to think
If I had the chance
I'd ask the world to dance
And I'll be dancing with myself
Oh dancing with myself
Oh dancing with myself
Well there's nothing to lose
And there's nothing to prove
I'll be dancing with myself
Oh dancing with myself
Oh dancing with myself
Well there's nothing to lose
And there's nothing to prove
I'll be dancing with myself
If I looked all over the world
And there's every type of girl
But your empty eyes
Seem to pass me by
Leave me dancing with myself
So let's sink another drink
'Cause it'll give me time to think
If I had the chance
I'd ask the world to dance
And I'll be dancing with myself
I'll be dancing with myself
So let's sink another drink
'Cause it'll give me time to think
Oh dancing with myself
Oh dancing with myself
Well there's nothing to lose
And there's nothing to prove
I'll be dancing with myself
Oh dancing with myself
Oh dancing with myself
Well there's nothing to lose
And there's nothing to prove
I'll be dancing with myself
Once burned, twice shunned
Too much of your line made me blind.
I'd wait all night
But you left one too many times.
I want to change my orbit
Don't care what you do now.
I want to live in darkness
Don't want to be spun around.
You go down, down, down
I fall out of love with you.
Come back round, round, round
You son of a gun.
You go down, down, down.
This time I won't save you
When you drown, drown, drown
You son of a gun.
You son of a gun.
Birds sing for you,
You can make the blue sky blush
You've got them all fooled
But I am burned out on this rush.
I want to change my orbit
Don't care what you do now.
I want to live in darkness
Don't want to be spun around.
You go down, down, down
I fall out of love with you.
Come back round, round, round
You son of a gun.
You go low, low, low.
This time I won't save you
When you go, go, go
You son of a gun.
You son of a gun.
Red sky creepin'
Disappearing
Bye-bye feeling
Heart you're stealing
You go down, down, down
I fall out of love with you.
Come back round, round, round
You son of a gun.
You go down, down, down.
This time I won't save you
When you drown, drown, drown
You son of a gun.
You son of a gun.
You son of a gun.
What a day for a daydream
What a day for a daydreamin' boy
And I'm lost in a daydream
Dreaming 'bout my bundle of joy
And even if time ain't really on my side
It's one of those days for taking a walk outside
I'm blowing the day to take a walk in the sun
And fall on my face on somebody's new-mowed lawn
I've been having a sweet dream
I've been dreaming since I woke up today
It's starring me and my sweet thing
'Cause she's the one makes me feel this way
And even if time is passing me by a lot
I couldn't care less about the dues you say I got
Tomorrow I'll pay the dues for dropping my load
A pie in the face for being a sleepy bull toad
And you can be sure that if you're feeling right
A daydream will last long into the night
Tomorrow at breakfast you may prick up your ears
Or you may be daydreamin' for a thousand years
What a day for a daydream
Custom-made for a daydreamin' boy
Now I'm lost in a daydream
Dreaming 'bout my bundle of joy
Stems and gears, oh how the daisies bloom
When chandeliers light up the engine room
Can you feel the drops as it starts to rain?
There's an underwater Ferris wheel where I found the missing link to this island chain
Home will always be here, unseen, outta sight
Where I disappear and hide
I think dreamy things as I'm waving goodbye
So I'll spread out my wings and fly
Home is a boxcar and it's so far out of reach
Hidden under umbrella beach
Home will always be here, unseen, outta sight
Where I disappear and hide
I think dreamy things as I'm waving goodbye
So I'll spread out my wings and fly
I'll spread my wings and fly
Home is a boxcar and it's so far out of reach
Hidden under umbrella beach
He was in the habit of taking things for granted
Granted, there wasn't much for him to take
And the only thing constant was the constant reminder he'd never change
Tight-fisted with his compliments, it didn't seem to bother him
That talk is even cheaper told in bulk
And the only thing constant was the constant reminder he'd never change
And so she yelled at him:
You owe me an IOU - owe me an IOU
You owe me an IOU
Don't think that I'll forget
You owe me an IOU - owe me an IOU
You owe me an IOU
Don't think that I'll forget
I know what I should get this time
She was in the habit of reapplying makeup
Makeup eaten up by crocodile tears
And the only thing constant was the constant reminder she'd never change
Overtly individual - covertly traditional
She couldn't seem to make up her mind
And the only thing constant was the constant reminder she'd never change
And so he yelled at her:
You owe me an IOU - owe me an IOU
You owe me an IOU
Don't think that I'll forget
You owe me an IOU - owe me an IOU
You owe me an IOU
Don't think that I'll forget
I know what I should get this time
Oh... Is it real? I don't know
But, I'll act as if it is
What's our deal? I don't know
But, I'll act as if it is what I think that it is
If it is, then this might just work
They were in the habit of taking things for granted
Granted, they never quite knew what they had
And the only thing constant was the constant reminder they'd never change
And so they yelled out loud:
You owe me an IOU - owe me an IOU
You owe me an IOU
Don't think that I'll forget
You owe me an IOU - owe me an IOU
You owe me an IOU
Don't think that I'll forget
I know what I should get
Yeah I know what I should get this time
So I call your name, cross my fingers
Uncross the others, hesitate
I don't think straight with nothing to prove
I don't wanna say I'm leaving
I'll stay until the weekend
And you can take all the things
The boxes and rings and get going
'Cause I've been waiting for
All the pretty girls on a Saturday night
Let it be and come to me with the look in your eyes
Will you break and take all the worlds from my mouth?
I wish all the pretty girls were shaking me down
So I call you out
Just to feel a little better about myself
(He does) And I do, baby I do.
Till their lips start to move
And their friends wanna talk music
I say "I've never heard the tune!"
But I have, I just hate the band
'Cause they remind me of you
Every single night ends up the same
I don't say much at all, but I bring up your name
(Over and over and over)
I think it's striking me out
All the pretty girls on a Saturday night
Let it be and come with me with the look in your eyes
Will you break and take all the words from my mouth?
I wish all the pretty girls were shaking me down
But not you, you still wear boots and your hair is too long
And then this one doesn't want to admit she's falling in love
Oh c'mon, oh c'mon, what's a boy to do
When all the pretty girls can't measure to you?
I don't understand your reasons
Please just stay over the weekend
You can't take all those things they define you and me
everything we've become, you're all that I need
Please don't make me face my generation alone
All the pretty girls on a Saturday night
Let it be and come with me with the look in your eyes
Will you break and take all the words from my mouth?
I wish all the pretty girls were shaking me down
But not you, I feel your faith is destroying the world
And then this one never really understood the 80s is over and done
Oh c'mon, what's a boy to do
When all the pretty girls can't measure to you?
All the pretty girls on a Saturday night
All the pretty girls on a Saturday night
All the pretty girls on a Saturday night
All the pretty girls on a Saturday night
Broken down like a war economy
Father Führer, don't be mad at me
Peasant child, you're into botany
Splitting necks and calling it dichotomy
"Beware", the sign on the door suggests
I'm better off with artificial intelligence
I invented you
I invented you
And I will destroy you
If you catch me with my hands in the till
I promise, sugar, I wasn't trying to steal
I'm just swimming in copper
To smell and pretend
Like a robot
Well, if a leopard doesn't change it's spots
You can't change my perceptions just from dots to dots
I swap the bruising for a bumping sensation
I'll be Ctrl-Alt-deleting your face with no reservations
And we'll stop fighting once your circuit board's igniting
Singing "I'm not finished, I'm not finished, no!"
Mistaking cables for veins can be quite misleading
Friction sparks from metal made it look like bleeding
If you catch me with my hands in the till
I promise, sugar, I wasn't trying to steal
I'm just swimming in copper
To smell and pretend
Like a robot
Instrumental
Here's a little song I wrote
You might want to sing it note for note
Don't worry, be happy
In every life we have some trouble
But when you worry, you make it double
Don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, be happy now
Ooh-ooh-hoo-hoo-ooh hoo-hoo-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Don't worry
Woo-ooh-woo-ooh-woo-ooh-ooh
Be happy
Woo-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Don't worry, be happy
Ooh-ooh-hoo-hoo-ooh hoo-hoo-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Don't worry
Woo-ooh-woo-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Be happy
Woo-ooh-woo-ooh-ooh
Don't worry, be happy
Ain't got no place to lay your head
Somebody came and took your bed
Don't worry, be happy
The landlord say your rent is late
He may have to litigate
Don't worry (Ha-ha ha-ha ha-ha) 
Be happy (Look at me, I'm happy)
Ooh-ooh-hoo-hoo-ooh ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Don't worry
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Be happy
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
(Here, I'll give you my phone number
When you're worried, call me
I'll make you happy)
Ooo-ooh-hoo-hoo-ooh ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Don't worry
Woo-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Be happy
Woo-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ain't got no cash, ain't got no style
Ain't got no gal to make you smile
But don't worry, be happy
'Cause when you're worried, your face will frown
And that will bring everybody down
So don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, be happy now
Ooh-ooh-hoo-ooh-ooh ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Don't worry
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Be happy
Woo-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Don't worry, be happy
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Don't worry
Woo-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Be happy
Woo-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Don't worry, be happy
Now there, is this song I wrote
I hope you learned it note-for-note, like good little children
Don't worry, be happy
A-listen to a-what I say
In your life, expect some trouble
When you worry you make it double
Don't worry, be happy, be happy now
Ooo-oo-hoo-hoo-ooh ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Don't worry
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Be happy
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Don't worry, be happy
Ooh-ooh-hoo-ooh-ooh ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Don't worry
Woo-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Be happy
Woo-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Don't worry, be happy
Ooh-ooh-hoo-ooh-ooh ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Don't worry, don't worry
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Don't do it, be happy
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Put a smile on your face
Don't bring everybody down like this
Ooh-ooh-hoo-hoo-ooh ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Don't worry
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
It will soon pass, whatever it is
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Don't worry, be happy
Ooh-ooh-hoo-hoo-ooh ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I'm not worried
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I'm happy
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Darling, what you gonna do now
Now that you noticed
It all went wrong
I've been, I've been thinking
That you don't know me anymore
Don't let the sun be the one
To change you baby
I wanna learn how to lie
If I'm to know
'Cause I wanna go where the people go
'Cause I'm forever lost
Darling, what you gonna say now
Now that you noticed
It all went wrong
Looks like I'm driving
My friends all crazy
They say that they don't know me anymore
Don't let the sun be the one
To change you baby
I wanna learn how to lie
If I'm to know
'Cause I wanna go where the people go
'Cause I'm forever lost
Oh yeah I'm forever lost
Looks like it all went wrong
Looks like it all went wrong
Looks like it all went wrong
Looks like it all went wrong
What am I to do
What am I to do
Don't let the sun be the one
To change you baby
I wanna learn how to lie
If I'm to know
'Cause I wanna go where the people go
'Cause I'm forever lost
Oh yeah I'm forever lost
Darling what you gonna do now
Now that you noticed
It all went wrong
Now that you noticed
Now that you noticed
Starting something
Thought could be fun
Started something
Couldn't go on
Danger, heartache
I always knew
There's no winner
In this game you lose
But I still wanna know
How she got in the door uninvited?
Oh, I got a rocket
Oh, you're going on it
Oh, you're never coming back
Cliches, secrets
Stories unfold
Fooled by passion
Losing control
Danger, heartache
Something has died
No good pretending
I'm leaving this time
But I still wanna know
How she got in the door uninvited?
Oh, I got a rocket
Oh, you're going on it
Oh, you're never coming back
Oh, I got a rocket
Oh, you're going on it
Oh, you're never coming back
You're never coming back
You're never coming back again, no, no
You're going out on your own
You're never coming back
You're never coming back again, oh no
You're going out on your own
Oh, I got a rocket
Oh, you're going on it
Oh, you're never coming back
Oh, I got a rocket
Oh, you're going on it
Oh, you're never coming back
You're never coming back
5, 4, 3, 2, 1
We have liftoff
The world beat you for the something nice 
You worked hard, died poor 
You mined what you died for 
Diamonds di di di di di uh 
You can whistle my name 
It's the mines, in Africa 
That are to blame 
You can Scoop out my brain 
Shape it into an ear and then tell me your pain 
I've been awake from the first day 
Stayed awake, stayed awake 
The rabbit was removed under the whole moon
Long bird, short road
Dig deep but don't dig too deep 
When it's late you'll see the hole is empty and oh so deadly 
They want me raw but smooth like glass 
They want it fast but they don't want flaws 
I'm a girl's best friend 
Can you cut, I can cut, 'cause I'm a rough gem 
Who lives in those lights in the distance? 
Watered down, the rain will help you out 
I had a dream, it was all a dream 
But it was ruined by the sun shining through me
Did you stand there all alone?
Oh, I cannot explain what's going down
I can see you standing next to me
In and out somewhere else right now
You sigh, look away
I can see it clear as day
Close your eyes, so afraid
Hide behind that baby face
Do do do, do do do
You can drive all night
Looking for answers in the pouring rain
You wanna find peace of mind
Looking for the answer
Funny how it seems like yesterday
As I recall, you were looking out of place
Gathered up your things and slipped away
No time at all, I followed you into the hall
Cigarette daydream
You were only seventeen
Soft speak with a mean streak
Nearly brought me to my knees
Do do do, do do do
You can drive all night
Looking for the answers in the pouring rain
You wanna find peace of mind
Looking for the answer
If we could find a reason, a reason to change
Looking for the answer
If you could find a reason, a reason to stay
Standing in the pouring rain
Do do, do, do, do
Do do, do, do, do
Do do, do, do, do
You can drive all night
Looking for answers in the pouring rain
You wanna find peace of mind
Looking for the answer
If we could find a reason, a reason to change
Looking for the answer
If you could find a reason, a reason to stay
Standing in the pouring rain
I'm so hard for a rich girl
My heels are high, my eyes cast low
And I don't know how to love
I get too tired after midday, lately
I take it out on my good friends
But the worst stays in
Oh, where would I begin?
My office glows all night long
It's a nuclear show and the stars are gone
Elevator, elevator, take me home
I'm so hard for the rich girl
Her heels so high and my hopes so low
'Cause I don't know how to love
I'll take her home after midnight
And if she likes, I'll tell her lies
How we'll be in love by the morning
I don't think she'll know that I'm saying goodbye
My office glows all night long
It's a nuclear show and the stars are gone
Elevator, elevator, take me home
My office glows all night long
It's a nuclear show and the stars are gone
Elevator, elevator, take me home
Don't go, say you'll stay
Spend a lazy Sunday in my arms
I won't take anything away
Don't go, say you'll stay
Spend a lazy Sunday in my arms
Don't take anything away
Hey-ay, hey-ay...
Hey-ay, hey-ay...
Hey-ay...
If you find yourself caught in love
Say a prayer to the man above
Thank him for everything you know
You should thank him for every breath you blow
If you find yourself caught in love
Say a prayer to the man above
Thank him for every day you pass
You should thank him for saving your sorry ass
If you're single, but looking out
You must raise your prayer to a shout
Another partner must be found
Someone to take your life beyond
Another TV "I Love 1999"
Just one more box of cheapo wine
If you find yourself caught in love
Say a prayer to the man above
But if you don't listen to the voices then my friend
You'll soon run out of choices
What a pity it would be (what a pity)
You talk of freedom don't you see (talk of freedom)
The only freedom that you'll ever really know (that you'll ever really know)
Is written in books from long ago
Give up your will to Him that loves you
Things will change, I'm not saying overnight
You've got to start somewhere
If you find yourself out of love
Shed a tear for the one you love
Tell your boss that you've gone away
Down your tools for a holiday
If you're going off to war then I wish you well
But don't be sore
If I cheer the other team (if I cheer the)
'Cause killing people's not my scene (not my scene)
I prefer to give the inhabitants a say (the inhabitants a say)
Before you blow their town away
I like to watch them play
I like to marvel at the random beauty of a simple village girl
Why should she be the one who's killed?
If you find yourself caught in love...
In the middle of the night
I go walking in my sleep
From the mountains of faith
To the river so deep
I must be looking for something
Something sacred I lost
But the river is wide
And it's too hard to cross
Even though I know the river is wide
I walk down every evening and I stand on the shore
I try to cross to the opposite side
So I can finally find out what I've been looking for
In the middle of the night
I go walking in my sleep
Through the valley of fear
To a river so deep
I've been searching for something
Taken out of my soul
Something I'd never lose
Something somebody stole
I don't know why I go walking at night
But now I'm tired and I don't want to walk anymore
I hope it doesn't take the rest of my life
Until I find what it is that I've been looking for
In the middle of the night
I go walking in my sleep
Through the jungle of doubt
To the river so deep
I know I'm searching for something
Something so undefined
That it can only be seen
By the eyes of the blind
In the middle of the night
I'm not sure about a life after this
God knows I've never been a spiritual man
Baptized by the fire, I wade into the river
That is running to the promised land
In the middle of the night
I go walking in my sleep
Through the desert of truth
To the river so deep
We all end in the ocean
We all start in the streams
We're all carried along
By the river of dreams
In the middle of the night
(I go walking in the middle of the...)
Spoken:
To your mother!
It's all too much 
It's all too much 
When I look into your eyes 
Your love is there for me
And the more I go inside 
The more there is to see
It's all too much for me to take 
The love that's shining all around you 
Everywhere it's what you make for us to take 
It's all too much 
Floating down the stream of time 
From life to life with me
Makes no difference where you are 
Or where you'd like to be 
It's all too much for me to take 
The love that's shining all around here
All the world is birthday cake 
So take a piece but not too much 
Sell me on a silver sun 
Where I know that I'm free 
Show me that I'm everywhere 
And get me home for tea 
It's all too much for me to take
There's plenty there for everybody
The more you give, the more you get
The more it is and it's too much
Nice to have the time to take
This opportunity
Time for me to look at you
And you to look at me
It's all too much for me to see 
The love that's shining all around here
The more I learn, the less I know 
And what I do is all too much 
It's all too much for me to take 
The love that's shining all around you 
Everywhere it's what you make for us to take 
It's all too much 
It's too much
It's too much
With your long blonde hair and your eyes of blue 
With your long blonde hair and your eyes of blue 
You're too much
We are getting better
Too much, too much
Too much, too much
Too much, too much
Too much, too much
Too much, too much
Too much, too much
Too much, too much
Too much, too much
Too much, too much
Too much, too much
Too much, too much
Too much, too much
Too much
Too much, too much
Too much, too much
Too much, too much
Too much, too much
Too much, too much
Too much, too much
Too much, too much
Too much, too much
Too much, too much
Too much, too much
Too much, too much
Too much, too much
Too much, too much
Too much, too
Baby, I feel good 
From the moment I arise 
Feel good from morning 
Till the end of the day 
Till the end of the day 
Yeah, you and me 
We live this life 
From when we get up 
Till we go sleep at night 
You and me we 're free 
We do as we please, yeah 
From morning, till the end of the day 
Till the end of the day 
Yeah, I get up 
And I see the sun up 
And I feel good, yeah 
'Cause my life has begun 
You and me we 're free 
We do as we please, yeah 
From morning, till the end of the day 
Till the end of the day 
You and me we 're free 
We do as we please, yeah 
From morning, till the end of the day 
Till the end of the day 
Till the end of the day 
Till the end of the day 
Till the end of the day 
Till the end of the day
Raindrops are falling on my head
And just like the guy whose feet are too big for his bed
Nothing seems to fit
Those raindrops are falling on my head, they keep falling
So I just did me some talking to the sun
And I said I didn't like the way he got things done
He's sleeping on the job
Those raindrops are falling on my head, they keep fallin'
But there's one thing I know
The blues they send to meet me
Won't defeat me
It won't be long 'till happiness steps up to greet me
Raindrops keep falling on my head
But that doesn't mean my eyes will soon be turning red
Crying's not for me
'Cause, I'm never gonna stop the rain by complaining
Because I'm free
Nothing's worrying me
It won't be long 'till happiness steps up to greet me
Raindrops keep falling on my head
But that doesn't mean my eyes will soon be turning red
Crying's not for me, 'cause,
I'm never gonna stop the rain by complaining
Because I'm free
Nothing's worrying me
When the half light makes for a clearer view 
Sleep a little more if you want to 
But restlessness has siezed me now, it's true 
I could watch the dreams flicker in your eyes 
Lying here asleep on a sunbeam 
I wonder if you realize you fascinate me so 
Think about a new destination 
If you think you need inspiration 
Roll out the map and mark it with a pin 
I will follow every direction 
Just lace up your shoes while I'm fetching a sleeping bag, a tent... 
Another summer's passing by 
All I need is somewhere I feel the grass beneath my feet 
A walk on sand, a fire I can warm my hands 
My joy will be complete 
I thought about a new destination 
I'm never short of new inspiration 
Roll out the map and mark it with a gin 
Made my plans to conquer the country 
I'm waiting for you to get out of your situation 
With your job and with your life 
All I need is somewhere I feel the grass beneath my feet 
A walk on sand 
A fire, I can warm my hands 
My joy will be complete
I'll be giving up, oh
Home is where the heart is
And I gave it to you in a paper bag
Even though it's tarnished
You told me it's the best you ever had
You've got my secret combination
And I don't be giving that out easily
With my deepest dedication
I can tell that you have got the same for me
So please don't let go
'Cause you know
Exactly what we found
So please don't let go
My darling
And keep it locked up underground
It's gonna be you and me
It's gonna be everything you've ever dreamed
I'm gonna be who you need
It's gonna be everything and everything we're meant to be
We're meant to be
Rolling with the punches
So they won't get inside our happiness
Love is always hunted
Well your arrows are soaring through my chest
'Cause you know you give me something
Yeah you give me exactly what I need
Got my blood pumping
You know each drop of blood I need
So please don't let go
'Cause you know
Exactly what we found
So please don't let go
My darling
And keep it locked up underground
It's gonna be you and me
It's gonna be everything you've ever dreamed
I'm gonna be who you need
It's gonna be everything and everything we're meant to be
In your big house on the hill
Where you keep your dollar bills
And you stashed my heart
Somewhere in the dark
Keep it safe I know you will
Know you will
Know you will
Know you will
I know you will
We come running
We come running
We come running
We come running
Under a pale blue sky
You never felt so cold
Another sleepless night
How could you ever let go
How do you recognize
The dirty face of gold
Behind that crooked line
Where you never knew you'd go
Headed for the open door
Tell me what you're waiting for
Look across the great divide
Soon they're gunna hear
The sound, the sound, the sound
When we come running
Never go where we belong
Echoes in the dead of dawn
Soon they're gunna know
The sound, the sound, the sound
When we come running
The sound, the sound, the sound
When we come running
When the worlds gone quiet
I see you dancing slow
Feeling satisfied
Where you never knew you'd go
Headed for the open door
Tell me what you're waiting for
Look across the great divide
Soon they're gunna hear
The sound, the sound, the sound
When we come running
Never go where we belong
Echoes in the dead of dawn
Soon they're gunna know
The sound, the sound, the sound
When we come running
The sound, the sound, the sound
When we come running
Days go by
Feeling broke and tired
Remember
Always remember
The sound, the sound, the sound
When we come running
The sound, the sound, the sound
When we come running
Headed for the open door
Tell me what you're waiting for
Look across the great divide
Soon they're gunna hear
The sound, the sound, the sound
When we come running
Never go where we belong
Echoes in the dead of dawn
Soon they're gunna know
The sound, the sound, the sound
When we come running
The sound, the sound, the sound
When we come running
You look so good in the clothes of a poser
And when you smiled all the kids fell apart here
I know a place where it's warm and it's dry, dear
Let me take you there
North of the river all the streets are the same
We can pretend that they don't know our name
And the heat is turned all the way to full
So don't pretend that you don't feel the pull
I am trying to say
What I want to say
Without having to say
"I love you"
You look so good in the shoes of an outcast
I kissed your throat every time they said it wouldn't last
But then I knew you, I knew you, I knew you
I really knew you
We fell apart in the parties of the empty heart
We danced the junkies in the shadows of bad modern art
We clicked our heels and we wished we were home
One more tab and your silk hits the chrome
I am trying to say
What I want to say
Without having to say
"I love you"
I am trying to say
What I want to say
Without having to say
"I love you"
Springs comes in when I'm rolling up another one
I draw the curtains in the glare of the same old sun
We are collapsed in the act of just being here
Three blues, two greens and a beer
We are collapsed in the act of just being here
Three blues, two greens and a beer
I am trying to say
What I want to say
Without having to say
"I love you"
I am trying to say
What I want to say
Without having to say
"I love you"
First time in the backyard
Underneath the plastic sheeting
Outside it was pouring
And we were drunk as shit
Next time, at a party
When all our friends were there
There is nothing like their mattresses
Underneath the stairs
Third time in a doorway
With the lights all on around us
And the audience beside us
And your man watching from the trees
Fourth time, I said that's that
You've agreed to give me everything
Now I've got to ask you one more thing
Keep doing that forever
Fifth time in your bedroom
And finally we rested
And you leaned upon your elbow
And began to speak to me
But you stopped yourself and kissed me
And I grabbed your wrist and told you
I know, I know, I know
I feel the same as you
And everyday, it's changed since then
In every way, I've changed since then
And everyday, it's changed since then
In every way, I've changed since then
Driven outside
I've driven you
Driven outside
I've driven you
I've driven you, I've driven you
I'm on fire and now I think I'm ready to bust a move
Check it out, I'm rocking steady
Go!
Betty won't stop listening to modern rock
Oh, she hates to be alone
I try to compensate her lack of love with coffee cake
Ice cream and a bottle of ten dollar wine
She says "Hey...
I rock the Haro sport
I rock the cow girl blues
I rock too fast for love, I'm footloose in my Velcro shoes
What's up with Will and Grace?
I don't get drum and bass
The future freaks me out."
I'm on fire and now I think ready to bust a move
Check it out, I'm rocking steady to the beat in my head
It goes oh, oh, oh, oh
I know she's the only one
I'd rather waste our time together
Yeah, 'cause we can get down
Betty can't quit carving question marks in my wrist
How come we're so alone?
We waste away the days with nicotine and television samples
Of an era we hate to admit we embrace
We fail to represent
We fail to be content
We fail at everything we ever even try to attempt
And so the story goes
As only Betty knows
It's time we take control (get down)
I'm on fire and now I think ready to bust a move
Check it out, I'm rocking steady to the beat in my head
It goes oh, oh, oh, oh
I know she's the only one
I'd rather waste my time with her
(Betty, I need you
I miss you
I'm so alone without you
To call up on the weekends with my cellular phone)
Betty, it's so hard to relate
To the whole human race
I don't know where to begin
I don't know where to begin
If we could both find a way
To do the things that we say
We might not sit in our rooms
And drink our daydreams away
Betty, I'm a dreamer
I'm not a vicious schemer
Oh Betty won't you... ah fuck it
I'm on fire and now I think ready to bust a move
Check it out, I'm rocking steady to the beat in my head
It goes oh, oh, oh, oh
I know she's the only one
I'd rather waste our time together
Yeah, 'cause we can get down
Where do I begin?
Should I tell you how bad I need you now?
You're underneath my skin but I'm confused
My head is spinning all around
I waited so long
I need to know, darling
What is on your mind?
Normally I try to run and I might even want to hide
'Cause I never knew what I wanted till I looked into your eyes
So am I in this alone?
What I'm looking for is a sign that you feel how I feel for you
Baby, please don't let me go
Baby, please don't let me go
Baby, please don't let me go
No, please don't let me go
Baby no, no, no, no
Ba, da, ba, de, ba, ba
What else can I say?
(Can I say)
My heart is b-b-b-beating double time, yeah
And do you feel the same?
(Do you feel the same)
Don't leave me in the dark, no
But baby don't put out this spark, no
I waited so long
I need to know, darling
What is on your mind?
Normally I try to run and I might even want to hide
'Cause I never knew what I wanted till I looked into your eyes
So am I in this alone?
What I'm looking for is a sign that you feel how I feel for you
Baby, please don't let me go
Baby, please don't let me go
Baby, please don't let me go
No, please don't let me go
Baby, no, no, no, no
Caught in the inquisition under these conditions
I need a definition, is it love that we're sharing?
Show me that you're caring, you see my fascination
Tell me I'm not mistaken, give me the information I need
1, 2, 3, woo
Normally I try to run and I might even want to hide
'Cause I never knew what I wanted till I looked into your eyes
So am I in this alone?
What I'm looking for is a sign that you feel how I feel for you
Baby, please don't let me go
(Don't let me go)
Baby, please don't let me go
(Please don't let me go)
Baby, please don't let me go
(Don't let me go)
No, please don't let me go
Baby, no, no, no, no
This bed is on fire with passionate love
The neighbors complain about the noises above
But she only comes when she's on top
My therapist said not to see you no more
She said you're like a disease without any cure
She said I'm so obsessed that I've become a bore, oh no
Ah, you think you're so pretty (eeeeeeeeeeeee eeeeeeeeeeeeeee)
Caught your hand inside the till
Slammed your fingers in the door
Fought with kitchen knives and skewers
Dressed me up in womens clothes
Messed around with gender roles
Dye my eyes and call me pretty
Moved out of the house so you moved next door
I locked you out, you cut a hole in the wall
I found you sleeping next to me, I thought I was alone
You're driving me crazy, When are you coming home?
Saturday Morning
Who's gonna play with me?
Six in the morning, baby
I got a long, long day ahead of me
The parents are sleeping soundly
The neighbors are dead as wood
I'm getting up and coming over
We gotta rock the neighborhood
Nothing's ever gonna happen 'round here
If we don't make it happen
Sleep away the day if you want to
But I got something that I gotta do
It's Saturday Morning
And this ain't the place for me
I'm giving you warning, baby
We got a whole big, fat world to see
Nothing's ever gonna happen 'round here
If we don't make it happen
Sleep away the day if you want to
But I got something that I gotta do
It's Saturday Morning
And who's gonna play with me?
Six in the morning, baby
I got a long, long day ahead of me
Saturday morning
Saturday morning
He was, he was in the churchyard
My father was in the first part
He came, he came to my bedroom
But I was asleep
And he woke me up again to say
"Halle, halle, hallelujah
Holy, holy is the sound
And I hope, I hope you are tired out
And I know, I know there is joy endowed"
But I was asleep
And he woke me up again
And he woke me up again to say
"Hold on, hold on to your old ways
Or put off, put off every old face
And I know, I know you are changed out
And I hope, I hope you're arranged out"
But I'm still asleep
And you woke me up again
And I'm still asleep
But you woke me up to be holy
All you want is
What you can't have
And if you just look around man
You see you got magic
So just sit back relax
Enjoy it while you still have it
Don't look back on life man and only see tragic
Because you could be better than that
Don't let it get the better of you
What could be better than now
Life's not about what's better than
You can be better than that
Don't let it get the better of you
What could be better than now
Life's not about what's better
All the time while you're looking away
There are things you can do man
There's things you can say
To the the ones you're with
With whom you're spending your today
Get your gaze off tomorrow
And let come what may
All I know is sometimes things can be hard
But you should know by now
They come and they go
So why, oh why
Do I look to the other side
'Cause I know the grass is greener but
Just as hard to mow
Life's not about what's better than.
What is her name?
That caravan girl
What is her name?
You like the sun
A hazy day
What is her name?
You're just talkin'
Like there's something
Like you know
Domino, domino
Wanna run away, oh run away you and me
Yeah get away and bring it all back
Wanna run away, oh run away you and me
Yeah get away and bring it all back
Barefoot and game
That stranger on the hill
What is her name?
You like the sun
A lazy day
Have you no name?
Don't stop talkin'
There's just something
Like you know
I'd like to know
Should I stay or should I go
It's long, wrong way to go
And I won't deny
Yeah, I won't be shy
Wanna run away, oh run away you and me
Yeah get away and bring it all back
Wanna run away, oh run away you and me
Yeah get away and bring it all back
Wanna run away
(La la la la la)
Wanna run away
(La la la la la)
And bring it all back
(La la la la la)
Wanna run away
(La la la la la)
Wanna run away
(La la la la la)
And bring it all back
(La la la la la)
Wanna run away
(La la la la la)
Wanna run away
(La la la la la)
And bring it all back
Back when all my little goals seemed so important
Every pot of gold fill and full of distortion
Heaven was a place still in space not in motion
But soon
I got you
I got everything
I've got you
I don't need nothing
More than you
I got everything
I've got you
We went walking through the hills
Tryin' to pretend that we both know
Maybe if we save up
We can build a little home
But then the hell storm came and yelled,
"You need to let go, you've got no control. No."
I got you
I got everything
I've got you
I don't need nothing
More than you
I got everything
I've got you
This weight's too much alone
Some days I can't hold it at all
You take it on for me
When tomorrow's too much
I'll carry it all
I've got you
And when tomorrow's too much
I'll carry it all
I got you
I got you
I got everything
I've got you
I don't need nothing
More than you
I got everything
I've got you
Go make your next choice be your best choice
And if you're looking for a boy with a voice, well baby I'm single
Are you in the mood for some dude, are you in the mood to be subdued
Or would you rather just mingle?
Let's get set then to go then and let us jet set we'll be like the Jetsons
You can be Jane my wife. Should I marry Jane tonight?
See I would if I could. I'd do anything spontaneously.
Or we can keep chillin' like ice cream fillin'
We can be Kool and the Gang if you'd rather hang
Ain't no thing. I can be lugubrious with you.
I got no ifs ands ors no wits or what's about it
But this place is getting crowded and my house is two blocks away
Or maybe closer
See I would if I could. I would do anything spontaneously.
You know I would, if I could. I would do anything spontaneously.
If you could be nimble, you'd have it simple just like me.
So go on and try it, do not deny yourself your freedom.
So step on up to the plate get a date with Mraz
See you better act fast because supplies they never last
Now did you know this is limited time offer
So go make your mind up before our times up
So you better start winding it up because the party's almost over
(And if you should know girl, let's get a bit lower now)
See how I would do, if I could do I'd do most anything spontaneously
You know I would, and I could prove it. That I'll do anything spontaneously.
Poor old Grandad
I laughed at all his words
I thought he was a bitter man
He spoke of women's ways
"They trap you, then they use you
Before you even know
Well, love is blind and you're far too kind
Don't ever let it show"
I wish that I knew what I know now
When I was younger
I wish that I knew what I know now
When I was stronger
The can-can such a pretty show
Will steal your heart away
But backstage back on earth again
The dressing rooms are grey
They come on strong and it ain't too long
'Fore they make you feel a man
But love is blind and you soon will find
You're just a boy again
When you want her lips, you get her cheek
Makes you wonder where you are
If you want some more then she's fast asleep
Leaves you twinkling with the stars
Poor young grandson, there's nothing I can say
You'll have to learn, just like me
And that's the hardest way, ooh la la
Ooh la la la la, yeah
I wish that I knew what I know now
When I was younger
I wish that I knew what I know now
When I was stronger
Come on girl
Let's sneak out of this party
It's getting boring
There's more to life than this
It's still early morning
We could go down to the harbour
And jump between the boats
And see the sun come up
There's more to life than this
We could nick a boat
And sneak off to this island
I could bring my little ghettoblaster
There's more to life than this
But then we'd have to rush back
To the town's best baker
To get the first bread of the morning
There's more to life than this
I broke free on a Saturday morning
I put the pedal to the floor
Headed north on Mills Avenue
And listened to the engine roar
My broken house behind me and good things ahead
A girl named Cathy wants a little of my time
Six cylinders underneath the hood crashing and kicking
Ah, listen to the engine whine
I am going to make it through this year
If it kills me
I am going to make it through this year
If it kills me
I played video games in a drunken haze
I was 17 years young
Hurt my knuckles punching the machines
The taste of scotch rich on my tongue
And then Cathy showed up and we hung out
Trading swigs from a bottle, all bitter and clean
Locking eyes, holding hands
Twin high maintenance machines
I am going to make it through this year
If it kills me
I am going to make it through this year
If it kills me
I drove home in the California dusk
I could feel the alcohol inside of me hum
Pictured the look on my stepfather's face
Ready for the bad things to come
I down-shifted as I pulled into the driveway
The motor screaming out, stuck in second gear
The scene ends badly, as you might imagine
In a cavalcade of anger and fear
There will be feasting and dancing in Jerusalem next year
I am going to make it through this year
If it kills me
I am going to make it through this year
If it kills me
I'm not going out tonight 'cause I don't want to go
I'm staying at home tonight 'cause I don't want to know
You revealed a world to me and I would never be
Dwelling in such happiness, your gift of purity
Eh-eeh-oh...
Ah...
You and me it will always be
You and me forever be
Eternally it will always be
You and me
Taylor, Taylor, Taylor, Taylor
I don't pay attention to the ones who never cared
Find your own direction 'cause there's sweetness in the air
You will be the world to me and I will always be
Dwelling in this happiness, your gift of purity
Eh-eeh-oh...
Ah...
You and me will always be
You and me forever be
Eternally will always be
You and me
Always be
You and me forever be
Eternally it will always be
You and me forever be
Eternally
Taylor, Taylor, Taylor, Taylor
Taylor, Taylor, Taylor, Taylor
When I met you I didn't know what to do
I was tired, I was hungry, I fight
Now I'm away, I write home everyday
And I see you on the TV at night
You can see that life's for us to talk about
You can leave whenever you want out
Whoa
You don't relate to me, no girl
You don't respect me, no girl
No girl, oh yeah
When I met you I didn't know what to do
But I noticed that I didn't really feel
Now you're away, you write home everyday
I don't beg, I don't borrow, I steal
You don't think that life's for us to talk about
You can leave whenever you want out
You want out
Well you don't relate to me, no girl
You don't respect me, no girl
(You can leave when ever you want out)
You don't relate to me, no girl
You don't respect me, no girl
(You can leave when ever you want out)
You don't relate to me, no girl
You don't respect me, no girl
No girl, oh yeah
Oh yeah
Cheer up, Brian
You know what they say...
Some things in life are bad
They can really make you mad
Other things just make you swear and curse
When you're chewing on life's gristle
Don't grumble, give a whistle
And this'll help things turn out for the best
And always look on the bright side of life
Always look on the light side of life
If life seems jolly rotten
There's something you've forgotten
And that's to laugh and smile and dance and sing
When you're feeling in the dumps
Don't be silly chumps
Just purse your lips and whistle, that's the thing
And always look on the bright side of life
Come on!
Always look on the right side of life
For life is quite absurd
And death's the final word
You must always face the curtain with a bow
Forget about your sin
Give the audience a grin
Enjoy it, it's your last chance anyhow
So, always look on the bright side of death
A-just before you draw your terminal breath
Life's a piece of shit
When you look at it
Life's a laugh and death's a joke, it's true
You'll see it's all a show
Keep 'em laughing as you go
Just remember that the last laugh is on you
And always look on the bright side of life
Always look on the right side of life
C'mon Brian, cheer up!
Always look on the bright side of life
Always look on the bright side of life
Worse things happen at sea, you know
Always look on the bright side of life
I mean, what have you got to lose
You know, you come from nothing, you're going back to nothing
What have you lost? Nothing!
Always look on the right side of life...
Nothing will come from nothing, you know what they say?
Cheer up you old bugger, c'mon give us a grin!
There you are, see, it's the end of the film
Incidentally, this record is available in the foyer
Some of us have to got live as well, you know
Who do you think pays for all this rubbish
They're not gonna make their money back, you know
I told them, I said to them, Bernie, I said they'll never make their money back
I've got the gift of one liners
And you've got the curse of curves
And with this gift I compose words
And the question that comes forward
Are you perspiring from the irony
Or sweating to these lyrics
And this just in
You're a dead fit
But my wit won't allow it
The inside lingo had me at hello
And we go where the money goes
The inside lingo had me at hello
And we go where the money goes
I want someone provocative and talkative
But it's so hard when you're shallow as a shower
And from what I've heard with skin you'll win
Her bone structure screams
"Touch her! Touch her!"
And she's got the curse of curves
So with the combination of my gift with one liners
And my way
My way with words
It seems I'm too hip to keep tight lips
And you're on the gossip team
You're making something out of nothing
Your jealousy's the cousin, the cousin of greed
The inside lingo had me at hello
And we go where the money goes
The inside lingo had me at hello
And we go where the money goes
I want someone provocative and talkative
But it's so hard when you're shallow as a shower
And from what I've heard with skin you'll win
Her bone structures screams (I want someone)
"Touch her! Touch her!"
And she's got the curse, the curse of (I want someone)
From what I heard with skin you'll win
We All have teeth that can bite underneath
To where the reality grows
Yeah, that's where mine go
That's where mine go
We all have teeth that can bite underneath
To where the reality grows
Yeah that's where mine go
The reality grows
From what I've heard with skin you'll win
And From what I've heard with skin you'll win
I want someone provocative and talkative
But it's so hard when you're shallow as a shower
And from what I've heard with skin you'll win
Her bone structures screams (I want someone)
"Touch her! Touch her!"
And she's got the curse, the curse of (I want someone)
From what I heard with skin you'll win
With skin you'll win
Skin you'll win
What you want is just outside your reach
You keep on searchin'
You're walking down that Pensacola beach
You keep repeatin'
While you're waiting for that sound
Apparatus to the ground
You're stealing from the lost and found
But what you find
Ain't what you had in mind
Until you find your Rolex in the sand
You won't be stopping
Until that solid gold is in your hand
You'll be happy
Call your office on the phone
Say you won't be coming home
You fell into
Vacations on our own
I feel alright, I found a place that fits tight
It feels small but I won't get sad about it
The softest voice said to me all through last night
I forget but I won't feel bad about it
I'll stay inside and find a pitch that sounds right
Bombs outside, such a small forest laughing at me
Be me, be mine
I might have not have reminded
You to feel (Mine to feel)
Be me, be mine
I might have not have reminded
You to feel (Mine to feel)
I feel alright, I found a face that fits tight
It feels small but I won't get sad about it
When everything is wrong I'll come talk to you
You make things all right when I'm feeling blue
You are such a blessing and I won't be messing
With the one thing that brings light to all of my darkness
You're my best friend
And I love you (love you)
And I love you (love you)
Yes I do
There is no other one who can take your place
I feel happy inside when I see your face
I hope you believe me
'Cause I speak sincerely
And I mean it when I tell you that I need you
You're my best friend
And I love you (love you)
And I love you (love you)
Yes I do
I'm here right beside you
I will never leave you
And I feel the pain you feel when you start crying
You're my best friend
And I love you (love you)
And I love you (love you)
Yes I do
You're my best friend
And I love you (love you)
And I love you (love you)
Yes I do
Yes I do
Yes I do
Sixteen military wives
Thirty-two softly focused, brightly colored eyes
Staring at the natural tan 
Of thirty-two gently clenching wrinkled little hands
Seventeen company men
Out of which only twelve will make it back again
Sergeant sends a letter to five
Military wives whose tears drip down from ten little eyes
Cheer them on to their rivals
'Cause America can, and America can't say no
And America does, if America says it's so, it's so
And the anchor person on TV
Goes La de da de da
Fifteen celebrity minds
Leading their Fifteen sordid, wretched, checkered lives
Will they find the solution in time
Using their Fifteen pristine, moderate, liberal minds
Eighteen academy chairs
Out of which only seven really even care
Doling out the garland to five 
Celebrity minds, they're humbly taken by surprise
Cheer them on to their rivals
'Cause America can, and America can't say no
And America does, if America says it's so, it's so
And the anchor person on TV
Goes la de da de da, de di de da de da
La de da de da, de di de da de da
Fourteen cannibal kings
Wondering blithely what the dinner bell will bring
Fifteen celebrity minds
Served on a leafy bed of sixteen military wives
Cheer them on to their rivals
Cause America can, and America can't say no
And America does, if America says it's so, it's so
And the anchor person on TV
Goes la de da de da, de di de da de da
La de da de da, de di de da de da
La de da de da, de di de da de da
La de da de da, de di de da de da
La de da de da, de di de da de da
You'll never be a better kind
If you don't leave the world behind
Waste my days (Waste my days)
You're drowned aways (Drowned aways)
It's just the thought of you
In love with someone else
It breaks my heart to see you
Hangin' from your shelf
You'll never do the things you want
If you don't move and get a job
Waste my days (Waste my days)
You're drowned aways (Drowned aways)
It's just the thought of you
In love with someone else
It breaks my heart to see you

Keep fishin' if you feel it's true
There's nothin' much that we can do
To save you from yourself
Waste my days (Waste my days)
You're drowned aways (Drowned aways)
It's just the thought of you
In love with someone else
It breaks my heart to see you
Hangin' from your shelf

Keep fishin' if you feel it's true
There's nothin' much that we can do
To save you from yourself
You'll never be a better kind

How I lost my boy
How I lost my boy
How I lost my boy
How I lost my boy
The king in I died
He kept floating past my eyes
And singing his songs
Life was good now death's all wrong
Cause you can't feel a thing
No heart flutters in late spring
You just drift and pray
For sun kissed golden days
And I can't hold what's in my hand
Don't do any good to say this isn't what I planned
And little kids sliding down the steel park slide
Little kids can't play with things that have died
Sometimes all I want is one favorite song
And two to three minutes don't seem that long
And where's my mom, I wanna hold her tight
She's so far away from crowded nights
I'm going cuckoo-ookoo-ookoo
Well I'm going cuckoo-ookoo-ookoo
Where I'm going
I said please stay
You can see me, don't go away
I can't see the landscape
Please describe it's amaranthine haze
It's odd where I am
They're people, you're not like them
They just look away
For rain-quenched golden days
My tears quench five feet of lawn
And I just creep I cannot yawn
And people gonna come and people gonna cry
He just woke and dreamt and ate and died
Don't try to erase what you have done
Put your fingers in a mouth, and kiss it if it wants
And where's my friend, I wanna hold him tight
He's so far away from mountain lights
I'm going cuckoo-ookoo-ookoo
Well I'm going cuckoo-ookoo-ookoo
Where I'm going
And I can't hold what's in my hand
Don't do any good to say this isn't what I planned
And little kids sliding down the steel park slide
Little kids can't play with things that have died
Sometimes all I want is one favorite song
And two to three minutes doesn't seem that long
And where's my mom, I wanna hold her tight
She's so far away from crowded nights
I'm going cuckoo-ookoo-ookoo
Well I'm going cuckoo-ookoo-ookoo
Where I'm going
Oh when the sunshine beckons to you
And your wings begin to unfold
The thoughts you bring and the songs you sing
Are gonna keep me from the cold
And if the sword is hidden among you
And it's words may wound my soul
You can fill me up with what you've got
'Cause my heart's been keeping old
She is love
And her ways are high and steep
She is love
And I believe her when she speaks
Love
And her ways are high and steep
She is love
And I believe, I do believe her when she speaks
You've been all my thoughts of passion
And the dreams of my delight
Whatever stirs my mortal frame
Well you keep it warm at night
I don't know where you come from
And no I haven't got a clue
All I know is I'm in love
With someone who loves me too
She is love
And her ways are high and steep
She is love
And I believe her when she speaks
Love
And her ways are high and steep
She is love
And I believe, I do believe her when she speaks
She is love
And her ways are high and steep
She is love
And I believe her when she speaks
She is love
And her ways are high and steep
She is love
And I believe, I do believe her when she speaks
I do believe her when she speaks
I do believe her when she speaks
I do believe her when she speaks
Do you hear me? I'm talking to you
Across the water across the deep blue ocean
Under the open sky oh my, baby I'm trying
Boy I hear you in my dreams
I feel your whisper across the sea
I keep you with me in my heart
You make it easier when life gets hard
Lucky I'm in love with my best friend
Lucky to have been where I have been
Lucky to be coming home again
They don't know how long it takes
Waiting for a love like this
Every time we say goodbye
I wish we had one more kiss
I wait for you I promise you I will
Lucky I'm in love with my best friend
Lucky to have been where I have been
Lucky to be coming home again
Lucky we're in love in every way
Lucky to have stayed where we have stayed
Lucky to be coming home someday
And so I'm sailing through the sea
To an island where we'll meet
You'll hear the music, fill the air
I'll put a flower in your hair
And though the breeze is through the trees
Move so pretty you're all I see
As the world keeps spinning round
You hold me right here right now
Lucky I'm in love with my best friend
Lucky to have been where I have been
Lucky to be coming home again
Lucky we're in love every way
Lucky to have stayed where we have stayed
Lucky to be coming home someday
Once in a lifetime
Been suffering the fools
To find our way home
To break in these bones
Once in a lifetime (Once in a lifetime)
Once in a lifetime
Give me a shot at the night
Give me a moment
Some kind of mysterious
Give me a shot at the night
Give me a moment
Some kind of mysterious
Once in a lifetime
We're breaking all the rules
To find that our home
Has long been outgrown
Throw me a lifeline
'Cause honey, I've got nothing to lose

Give me a shot at the night
Give me a moment
Some kind of mysterious
Give me a shot at the night
Give me a moment
Some kind of mysterious
I look at my reflection in the mirror
Underneath the power of the light
Give me a shot at the night
Give me a shot at the night
Give me a shot at the night
I feel like I'm losing the fight
Give me a shot at the night
Give me a moment
Some kind of mysterious
Give me a shot at the night
Give me a shot at the night
Give me a moment
Some kind of mysterious
Give me a shot at the night 
Give me a moment (Give me one shot)
Some kind of mysterious (Give me one shot at the night)
Give me a shot at the night
Give me a moment (Just give me one shot)
Some kind of mysterious (Give me one shot at the night)
I think I'm in love,
With the girl next door
It's driving me crazy
I can't take it any more
I hear her playing the drums late at night
The neighbours complain but that's the kind of girl I like
And maybe I should call her up
And buy her a round
Maybe I should move to another town
But when I hear those drums late at night
I know I'm in love
With a girl who lives
Two Doors Down
I think I'm in love with a girl who lives
Two Doors Down
I think I'm in love with a girl who lives
Two Doors Down
I think I'm in love with a girl who lives
Two Doors Down
I think I'm in love
She and her friends sit at the back of the bus
But I'm always to shy to work the courage up
I hear that she likes to dance around the room
To a worn out 12" of Marquee Moon
And maybe I should say "What's up?"
And buy her a round
Or take her for a spin around the town
'Cause when I hear those drums late at night
I know I'm in love
With a girl who lives
Two Doors Down
I think I'm in love with a girl who lives
Two Doors Down
I think I'm in love with a girl who lives
Two Doors Down
I think I'm in love with a girl who lives
Two Doors Down
I think I'm in love with a girl who lives
Two Doors Down
I think I'm in love
Two Doors Down
I think I'm in love
I think I'm in love with a girl who lives
Two Doors Down
I think I'm in love
Two Doors Down
I think I'm in love
I think I'm in love with a girl who lives
Two Doors Down
I think I'm in love with a girl who lives
And maybe I should call her up
And buy her a round
And one day we could move to another town
'Cause when I hear those drums late at night
I know I'm in love
In love with a girl who lives
Two Doors Down
I think I'm in love with a girl who lives
Two Doors Down
I think I'm in love with a girl who lives
Two Doors Down
I think I'm in love with a girl who lives
Two Doors Down
I think I'm in love with a girl who lives

I think I'm in love
I think I'm in love with a girl who lives
Two Doors Down
I think I'm in love with a girl who lives
(Ready, ready?)
I heard a knock at the door
It's mama calling my name
She said get up off the floor
I heard her going insane
She said your friend's on the phone
I said to her, can it wait?
But then she started to moan
No time, 'cause I'm running late
x2
Nobody's ever gonna,
I do just what I wanna
I'm bad and I'm not sorry
And you will never stop me
x2
No you will never stop me
x2
...
Nobody's ever gonna
x8
Don't change your name, keep it the same
For fear I may lose you again
I know you won't, it's just that I am unorganised
And I want to find you when
Something good happens
If you come down we'll go to town
I haven't been there for years
But I'd be fine wasting our time
Not doing anything here
Just doing nothing
We'll sit for days and talk about things important to us
Like whatever
We'll defuse bombs, walk marathons
And take on whatever together
Whatever together
Whatever together
Whatever together
Whatever together
Whatever together

I can get a record player, and a generator.
Generate the music that makes you feel better.
I don't live in poverty, I got a little bit of money and I've got a healthy body.
I'm not going to let stuff get me upset, and I won't let all the little things get me depressed.
When I was a young boy, I got a stereo and I taped all the songs straight off the radio.
The sounds that the bands made, and the melodies is all I need to make me feel free.
Sometimes you get so low, you don't know why,
Or a little upset all inside.
May I remind you that you don't live in poverty,
You got your youth, and you got food in your belly.

Well, I feel just like a child 
Yeah, I feel just like a child 
Well, I feel just like a child 
Well, I feel just like a child 
From my womb to my tomb 
I guess I'll always be a child 
Well, some people try and treat me like a man 
Yeah, some people try and treat me like a man 
Well, I guess they just don't understand 
Well, some people try and treat me like a man 
They think I know shit 
But that's just it 
I'm a child 
Well, I need you to tell me what to wear 
Yeah, I need you to help and comb my hair 
Yeah, I need you to help tie my shoes 
Yeah, I need you to come and keep me amused 
From my cave to my grave 
I guess I'll always be a child 
Well, I need you to help me reach the door 
And I need you to walk me to the store 
And I need you to please explain the war 
And I need you to heal me when I'm sore 
You can tell by my smile 
That I'm a child 
And I need you to sit me on your lap 
And I need you to make me take my nap 
Could you first pull out a book and 
Read me some of that 
'Cause I need you to make me take my nap 
And I need you to recognize my friends 
'Cause they're there even though you don't see them 
They got their own share of plate and a seat 
You know I won't touch my food unless they eat 
From the roof to the floor I'll crawl around some more 
I'm a child 
And I need you to help me blow my nose 
And I need you to help me count my toes 
And I need you to help me put on my clothes 
And I need you to hide it when it shows 
From being my daddy's sperm to being packed in an urn 
I'm a child
And when I steal you gotta smack me 'til I cry 
Don't you stop 'til the tears run dry 
See I was born thinking under the sky 
Didn't belong to a couple of old white guys 
From sucking on my mother's breast 
To when they lay my tomb to rest 
I'm a child yeah 
Well, I'm a little child
Oh, I'm a little child
I guess I'll always be 
A little child
Sara spelled without an 'h' was getting bored
On a Peavey amp in 1984
While Zak without a 'c' tried out some new guitars
Playing Sara-with-no-h's favourite song
(La da da da, la da da, la da da)
(La da da da, la da da, la da da) 
Zak and Sara
Often Sara would have spells where she lost time
She saw the future, she heard voices from inside
The kind of voices she would soon learn to deny
Because at home they got her smacked
(La da da da, la da da, la da da)
(La da da da, la da da, la da da) 
Zak and Sara
Zak and Sara
Zak called his dad about layaway plans
And Sara told the friendly salesman that:
"You'll all die in your cars,
And why's it gotta be dark?
And you're all working in a submarine"
(Asshole) 
She saw the lights, she saw the pale English face
Some strange machines repeating beats and thumping bass
Visions of pills that put you in a loving trance
That make it possible for all white boys to dance
And when Zak finished Sara's song, Sara clapped
(La da da da, la da da, la da da)
(La da da da, la da da, la da da) 
Zak and Sara
Zak and Sara
I've been all around the world
I've been a new sensation
But it doesn't really matter
In this ge-generation
The sophomore slump is an uphill battle
And someone said it ain't my scene
'Cause they need a new song
Like a new religion
Music for the television
I can't do the long division
Someone do the math
For the record label puts me on the shelf up in the freezer
Got to find another way to live the life of leisure
So I drop my top, mix and I mingle
Is everybody ready for the single and it goes
Ah, la, la, la, la
Listen closer to the verse I lay
Ah, la, la, la, la
It's all about the wordplay
Ah, la, la, la, love
The wonderful thing it does
Because, because
I am the wizard of ooh's and ah's and fa-la-la's and
The Mister A-Z
They say I'm all about the wordplay
When it's time to get ill
I got your remedy for those who don't remember me
Well, let me introduce you to my style
I try to keep a jumble in the lyrics
Never mumble
When the music's making people tongue-tied
You want a new song
Like a new religion
Music for the television
I can't do the long division
Someone do the math
For the people write me off like I'm a one-hit wonder
Got to find another way to keep from going under
Pull out the stops- got your attention
I guess it's time again for me to mention the wordplay
Ah, la, la, la, la
Listen closer to the verse I lay
Ah, la, la, la, la
It's all about the wordplay
Ah, la, la, la, love
The wonderful thing it does
Because, because
I am the wizard of ooh's and ah's and fa-la-la's and
The Mister A-Z
They say I'm all about the wordplay
I built a bridge across the stream of consciousness
It always seems to be a flowing
But I don't know which way my brain is going
Oh, the ryhming and the timing
Keeps the melodies inside me
And they're climbing
Till I'm running out of air
Are you prepared to take a dive into the deep end of my head
Are you listening to a single word I've said
Ah, la, la, la, la
Listen closely to the words I say
Ah, la, la, la, la
I'm sticking to the wordplay
Ah, la, la, la, love
The wonderful thing it does
Because, because
I am the wizard of ooh's and ah's and fa-la-la's
Yeah, the Mister A-Z
They say I'm all about the wordplay
Ah, la, la, la, la
I'm all about the wordplay
Ah, la, la, la, la
Stickin' with the wordplay
Ah, la, la, la, love
I love the wonderful thing it does
Because, because
The ooh's and ah's and fa-la-la's are back in love
For the Mister A-Z, they say
Is all about the wordplay
Just a day, just an ordinary day
Just trying to get by
Just a boy, just an ordinary boy, but
He was looking to the sky and
As he asked, if I would come along
I started to realize 
That everyday he finds, just what he's lookin' for
Like a shooting star, he shines
And he said
Take my hand  
Live while you can 
Don't you see your dreams lie right 
In the palm of your hand 
And as he spoke, he spoke ordinary words
Although they did not feel, no
For I felt what I had not felt before
And you'd swear those words couldn't heal, and
As I looked up into those eyes 
His vision borrows mine
And I know he's no stranger
For I feel I've held him for all of time, and he said
Take my hand 
Live while you can,
Don't you see your dreams lie right 
In the palm of your hand 
In the palm of your hand
Please come with me
See what I've seen
Touch the stars, for time will not flee
Time will not flee, can you see
Just a dream, just an ordinary dream
As I wake in bed
And the boy, that ordinary boy
Was it all in my head
Did he asked, if I would come along
It all seemed so real 
But as I looked to the door 
I saw that boy, standing there with a deal, and he said
Take my hand 
Live while you can
Don't you Feel your dreams lie right 
In the palm of your hand 
In the palm of your hand
In the palm of your hand
Just a day, just an ordinary day
Just tryin' to get by
Just a boy, just an ordinary boy, but
He was lookin' to the sky
What's a dad for, dad?
Tell me why I'm here dad
Whisper in my ear,
That I'm growing up to be a better man, dad
Everything is fine, dad
Proud that you are my, dad
'Cause I know I'm growing up to be a better man
Father, I will always be
That same boy that stood by the sea
And watched you tower over me
Now I'm older I want to be the same as you
What's a dad for, dad?
Taught me how to stand, dad
Took me by the hand, dad
And showed me how to be a bigger man, dad
Listened when you talked, dad
Followed where you walked, dad
And you know that I will always do the best I can... I can
Father, I will always be...(always be)
That same boy that stood by the sea
And watched you tower over me...(over me)
Now I'm older I want to be the same as you
The same as you
Father, I will always be
That same boy that stood by the sea
And watched you tower over me
Now I'm older I want to be the same as you
Father, I will always be
That same boy that stood by the sea
And watched you tower over me
Now I'm older I want to be the same as you
I've got emotion dripping out my pores
And I thought I would let you know
You are the night light
Ripping through my wicked world
How you make it sparkle and glow
Before I lose control
There's just one thing you should know
This is for real, this time I mean it
I'm coming clean, please don't let it go
I said from the start that you could take it or leave it
Prefer that you keep it
Don't let it go
Don't let it go
Don't let it go
I had some nightmares
Clawing at my skin and bones
I nearly did explode
You smote the demons
Gave me back my feelings
Now I am good to go (good to go)
Before, my face hits the floor
There's just one thing you should know
This is for real, this time I mean it
I'm coming clean, please don't let it go
I said from the start that you could take it or leave it
Prefer that you keep it
Don't let it go
This is the best thing that I've ever had for real
This is the best thing that I've ever had for real
For a physical challenge, I'm notoriously bored
Intravenous delivery, electrolytes and more
Every time it's the same routine
Out with the bad in with the clean
Before I lose all motor skills
There's one thing you should know
This is for real, this time I mean it
I'm coming clean, please don't let go
I said from the start, that you could take it or leave it
I prefer that you keep it
Don't let it go
This is the best thing that I've ever had for real
This is the best thing that I've ever had for real
This is the best thing that I've ever had for real
This is the best thing that I've ever had for real
Check your pulse It's proof
That you're not listening to
The call your life's been issuing you
The rhythm of a line of idle days
Scared of a world outside
You should go explore
Pull all the shades and
Wander the great indoors
The great indoors
Lamplight makes the shadows play
And posters take the walls away
The T.V. is your window pane
The view won't let you down
So put your faith in a late night show
I bet you didn't even know
Depends on how far out you go
The channel numbers change
Scared of a world outside
You should go explore
Pull all the shades and
Wander the great indoors
Though lately I can't blame you
I have seen the world
And sometimes wish your room
Had room for two
So go unlock the door
And find what you are here for
Leave the great indoors
Leave the great indoors
Check your pulse it's proof
That you're not listening to
The call your life's been issuing you
The rhythm of a line of idle days
Of idle days
Instrumental
If I was a different man,
If I had blood in my eyes
I could have read of your heart
I could have read of your mind
But now I'm lonely as that
I put up a fight
So pick up your battering ram
Love, I wanna see it
There's too much riding on that,
There's too much, too much, too much love
There's too much riding on that,
There's too much, too much, too much love
There's too much riding on that,
There's too much, too much, too much love
There's too much riding on that anyway
And maybe I talk too fast
Maybe I talk too much
Give me the sensitive laugh
Or give me the sensitive touch
Even if I could have kissed
Even if I couldn't apply
I'm so sorry I tried
Love, I wanna see it
There's too much riding on that,
There's too much, too much, too much love
There's too much riding on that,
There's too much, too much, too much love
There's too much riding on that,
There's too much, too much, too much love
There's too much riding on that anyway
(Love love love love)
There's too much riding on that,
There's too much, too much, too much love
There's too much riding on that,
There's too much, too much, too much love
There's too much riding on that,
There's too much, too much, too much love
There's too much riding on that anyway
There's too much riding on that
There's too much riding on that
There's too much riding on that
There's too much riding on that
There's too much riding on that
There's too much riding on that
There's too much riding on that
There's too much riding on that
There's too much riding on that, there's too much riding on that,
There's too much riding on that, there's too much riding on that,
There's too much riding on that, there's too much riding on that,
There's too much riding on that, there's too much riding on that,

She looked me over
And I guess she thought
I was all right
All right in a sort of a limited way
For an off-night
She said don't I know you 
From the cinematographer's party
I said who am I 
To blow against the wind
I know what I know
I've said what I've said
We come and we go
That's a thing that I keep 
In the back of my head
I know what I know
I've said what I've said
We come and we go
That's a thing that I keep 
In the back of my head
She said there's something about you 
That really reminds me of money
She is the kind of a girl
Who could say things that 
Weren't that funny
I said what does that mean
I really remind you of money
She said who am I 
To blow against the wind
I know what I know
I've said what I've said
We come and we go
That's a thing that I keep 
In the back of my head
I know what I know
I've said what I've said
We come and we go
That's a thing that I keep 
In the back of my head
She moved so easily 
All I could think of was sunlight
I said aren't you the woman 
Who was recently given a Fulbright
She said don't I know you
From the cinematographer's party
I said who am I 
To blow against the wind
I know what I know
I've said what I've said
We come and we go
That's a thing that I keep 
In the back of my head
I know what I know
I've said what I've said
We come and we go
That's a thing that I keep 
In the back of my head
If you got the money,
I think it would be funny
To take your girl, and spend a bit of your cash for me
(I've been watching you)
'Cause then she might be happy, and no longer lonely
And I could take her out the next day for pretty much free
An' all the boys they go:
Da-dee-doo-da-da-dee-da-doo-dah...
Da-dee-doo-da-da-dee-da-doo-dah...
I spend late nights trying to pick up love
Off the floor, where the other brothers leave it be
Though it's stuck down hard it's like chewing gum
While a girl on the floor singing R.I.P.
'Cause the songbirds don't do singing on pavements
No sweet melody the sound of spit
We Spat, Orbit, spoke of lost hopes
So toot what took man choke on it
We be near heaven at a quarter to eleven
By three we are thinking of the love we lost
By four we be high, thinking of the girl lost second
Check the odds, was it worth the cost?
Do you give a toss?
Or are you, looking away?
Wondering why you can't eat?
Why you never sleep?
Drunk all the time?
Cold in the heat?
What you sow man is what you reap
If you've got the money, I think it would be funny
To take your girl and spend a bit of your cash for me
(I've been watching you)
'Cause then she might be happy, no longer lonely
And I could take her out the next day for pretty much free
(I've been watching you)
You were always meant to walk out that job
You keep stopping, should tell your girl more often
That loving is all about doors unlocking
Now you're certain enough near a man free
With a Buddy Holly hiccup on a karaoke
Tweedle on the needle, man you're just for thread
My great granddaddy fought in Gallipoli
He's the only of his friends not shot down dead
Lovers all talk in the spits and tongues
Fight in the playgound, bully each other
Double dare kids up pollute their lungs
Threaten with the rep of their big boy brother
Some of the other stay, give it up and run away
Momma still wants you home for supper
Work all day, little to no pay
Dance up-town right down to the gutter
With the dee-dom dom-dee
Da-da-dee-dom-dom-dee
Move outta' the way man, dom-dee
Da-da-dee-dom-dom-dee
(I've been watching you)
Ah, she wants money, money, money, money, money
Ah, she wants money, money, money, money, money
Ah, she wants money, money, money, money, money
Ah, she wants money, money, money, money, money
Ah, she wants money, money, money, money, money
Ah, she wants money, money, money, money, money
Ah, she wants money, money, money, money, money
If you've got the money
I think it would be funny
To take your girl and spend a bit of your cash for me
(I've been watching you)
'Cause then she might be happy, no longer lonely
And I could take her out the next day for pretty much free
Said, ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-money, oh
Said, ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-money, oh
Said, ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-money, oh
Said, ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-money, oh
(I've been watching you)
If you've got the money
I think it should be funny, uh-oh
To take your girl and spend a bit of your cash for me
'Cause then she might be happy, no longer lonely, uh-oh
And I could take her out the next day for pretty much free
Hey, I hear the voice of a preacher from the back room
Calling my name and I follow just to find you
I trace the faith to a broken down television
And put on the weather
And I've trained myself to give up on the past
'Cause I frozen time between hearses and caskets
Lost control when I panicked at the acid test
I wanna get better
While my friends were getting high and chasing girls
Down parkway lines, I was losing my mind
'Cause the love, the love, the love, the love, the love
That I gave wasted on a nice face
In a blaze of fear I put a helmet on a helmet
Counting seconds through the night and got carried away
So now I'm standing on the overpass screaming at the cars
"Hey, I wanna get better!"
I didn't know I was lonely till I saw your face
I wanna get better, better, better, better
I wanna get better
I didn't know I was broken till I wanted to change
I wanna get better, better, better, better
I wanna get better
I go up to my room and there's girls on the ceiling
Cut out their pictures and I chase that feeling
Of an eighteen year old who didn't know what loss was
Now I'm a stranger
And I miss the days of a life still permanent
Mourn the years before I got carried away
So now I'm staring at the interstate screaming at myself
"Hey, I wanna get better!"
I didn't know I was lonely till I saw your face
I wanna get better, better, better, better
I wanna get better
I didn't know I was broken till I wanted to change
I wanna get better, better, better, better
I wanna get better
'Cause I'm sleeping in the back of a taxi
I'm screaming from my bedroom window
Even if it's gonna kill me
Woke up this morning early before my family
From this dream where she was trying to show me
How a life can move from the darkness
She said to get better
So I put a bullet where I shoulda put a helmet
And I crash my car 'cause I wanna get carried away
That's why I'm standing on the overpass screaming at myself
"Hey, I wanna get better!"
I didn't know I was lonely till I saw your face
I wanna get better, better, better, better
I wanna get better
I didn't know I was broken till I wanted to change
I wanna get better, better, better, better
I wanna get better
You quiver like a candle on fire
I'm putting you out
Maybe tonight we could be the last shout
And I'm fascinated by your style
Your beauty will last for a while
You're feeling instead of being
The more that I live on the inside there's nothing to give
I'm infatuated by your moves
I've gotta search hard for your clues
I want to repair your desire
And call it a gift
That I stole from just wanting to live
Now I see the vision through your eyes
Your innocence no longer fuels surprise
Trying to outrun your fear
You're running to lose
Heart on your sleeve and your soul in your shoes
Take a left
A sharp left and another left
Meet me on the corner, we'll start again
Staring up into the solar system,
All the stars are fixed up in the sky.
I just want to sparkle for a moment
Before I just fizzle out and die.
I'm happy because I'm stupid.
Scared of spiders, scared of flying.
If I wasn't so happy,
I wouldn't be so scared of dying.
So just be gentle with me
(I'm not as young as I was)
And I'll be gentle with you
I'm not as brave as I thought
'Cause my heart gets broken so easily.
So just be gentle, be gentle with me.
Wide awake, waiting like a target
Listening for things I cannot see.
Insects flutter up against my window.
I don't like the way they look at me
I guess I've always needed
To be needed by someone.
It's a comforting feeling
Being under someone's thumb.
So just be gentle with me
(And if I am ever mean)
And I'll be gentle with you
I never mean to be mean
'Cause I want to pick peaches off of a cherry tree.
Just be gentle, be gentle, be gentle,
Be gentle with me.
So just be gentle with me
Trouble is sometimes
And I'll be gentle with you
I just can't switch myself off
When I want to so I never do
Because I'm mental, be gentle, be gentle,
Just be gentle, be gentle, be gentle
And I'll be gentle, be gentle, be gentle, be gentle with you.
His after moan though cries oh no
He's building up a shine but he take it slow
And he knows it's time to make a change here and time to get away
And he knows it's time for all the wrong reasons and time to end the pain
But he sleep all, sleep all day, sleep all, we sleep all day over
Why don't we sleep all, sleep all day, sleep all, we sleep all day over
She said what would your mother think and how would your father react
Would he take it all back what they've done
No way they said take it, take it and he said make it with your own two hands
That was my old man and he said
If all is grounded you should go make a mountain out of it
Oh what a lovely day to have a slice of humble pie
Oh Recalling of the while we used to drive and drive here and there
Going nowhere but for us, nowhere but the two of us
And we knew it was time to take a chance here
And time to compromise our lives just a little while
And it was time for all the wrong and lonely, lonesome reasons
But time is often on my side but I give it to you tonight
And we sleep all, sleep all day, sleep all, we sleep all day over
Why don't we, sleep all, sleep all day, we sleep all day, we sleep all day over and over and over and over again
And as time goes by we get a little bit tired waking and baked another Marlboro mile wide
It's sending the boys on the run in the time in the hot summer sun
To swim beneath or over outside till they're reading between the lines
But they read none of the part in the hallmark card where they read about the dreams
And reaching for the stars to hold on a little bit closer to
Who said it was time, time to take, take love
Time to take a chance here
Time to compromise to occupy the lies
And it was time for all the wrong reasons
But time is often on my side but I give it to you, oh boy
Sleep all, we sleep all day, sleep all, we sleep all day over
So why don't we, sleep all, we sleep all day, sleep all, we sleep all day over and over
She said what did you think your mother would do this and how would your father react oh lord
Would he take it all back what they've done
No way they said take it, take it and don't break it with your own two hands
See that was my old man and he said
If all is grounded you should go make a mountain out of it

Out of gas, out of road
Out of car, I don't know how I'm gonna go
And I had a drink the other day
Opinions were like kittens, I was giving 'em away
I had a drink the other day
I had a lot to say
And I said
You will come down soon too
You will come down too soon
You will come down soon too
You will come down, you'll come down, come down
You will come down soon too
You will come down too soon
You will come down soon too
Soon enough you will come down, come down
Out of gas, out of road
Out of car, I don't know how I'm gonna go
And I had a drink the other day
Opinions were like kittens, I was giving them away
I had a drink the other day
I had a lot to say
And I said
You will come down soon too
You will come down too soon
You will come down soon too
Soon enough you will come down, come down
You will come down soon too
You will come down too soon
You'll come down, come down
You'll come down, come down
Do you remember the time I knew a girl from Mars?
I don't know if you knew that
Oh we'd stay up late playing cards
Henri Winterman Cigars
And she never told me her name
I still love you, the girl from Mars
Sitting in our dreamy daze by the water's edge
On a cool summer night
Fireflies and the stars in the sky
Gentle glowing light
From your cigarette
The breeze blowing softly on my face
Reminds me of something else
Something that in my memory has been misplaced
Suddenly all comes back
And as I look to the stars
I remember the time I knew a girl from Mars
I don't know if you knew that
Oh we'd stay up late playing cards
Henri Winterman Cigars
Cause you never told me your name
I still love you, the girl from Mars
Surging through the darkness over the moonlight strand
Electricity in the air
Twisting all through the night on the terrace
Now that summer is here
I know that you are almost in love with me
I can see it in your eyes
Strange light shimmering over the sea tonight
And it almost blows my mind
And as I look to the stars
I remember the time I knew a girl from Mars
I don't know if you knew that
Oh we'd stay up late playing cards
Henri Winterman Cigars
And she never told me her name
I still love you, the girl from Mars
Today I sleep in the chair by the window
It felt as if you'd returned
I thought that you were standing over me
When I woke there was no-one there
I still love you, the girl from...
Mars!
Do you remember the time I knew a girl from Mars?
I don't know if you knew that
Oh we'd stay up late playing cards
Henri Winterman Cigars
And she never told me her name
Do you remember the time I knew a girl from Mars?
I don't know if you knew that
Oh we'd stay up late playing cards
Henri Winterman Cigars
And I still dream of you
I still love you, the girl from Mars
Do me this solid
If you would pretty lady
Please grab your martini
And meet me on the balcony
I've prepared a light show
You could fake a melody
We could argue over where and when
The cymbal hits should be
Hannah takes the stairs
And I usually take the elevator
Every now and then she offers me
A lemon Now and Later
Please don't play the matchmaker
Please don't be a player hater
If you dig her recent work
Then you should go congratulate her
And if you're partial to the night sky
If you're vaguely attracted to rooftops
Hannah takes the stairs
'Cause she can't tell
That it's a winding spiral case
Is she right side up
Or upside-down?
So Hannah let your roots grow
Let your blue veins show
If I need to take a breath
Then you can take a trumpet solo
I'll work on the limbs if
You work on the torso and
If it gets to be too much
Then you could lend a helping hand
And if you're partial to the night sky
If you're vaguely attracted to rooftops
Hannah takes the stairs
'Cause she can't tell
That it's a winding spiral case
Is she right side up
Or upside-down?
Hannah takes the stairs
'Cause she can't tell
That it's a winding spiral case
Is she outside-in
Or inside out?
Met my match today
Felt the blood rushing and mingling
A curious and enigmatic thing
Now spiders in my dreams
Synchronicity weaves like a web
When you were meant to be a meal
I want you bad
I want you bad
I understand why they say
"High school never ends"
I'll never act my age
But you can tell by the lines in my smile
That I have been around for awhile
So, insecurities
Are about as useful as trying
To put the pin back in the grenade
I want you bad
I want you bad
I understand why they say
"High school never ends"
I want you bad
I want you bad
I understand why they say
"High school never stops"
Whoa, ooo yeah
Whoa
This isn't coincidence
There's no such thing
This isn't coincidence, no
This isn't coincidence
There's no such thing
This isn't, no
I want you bad
I want you bad
I understand why they say
"High school never ends"
I want you bad
I want you bad
I understand why they say
"High school never ends"
Yeah, never ends
It's not as if New York City
Burnt down to the ground
Once you drove away
It's not as if the sun won't shine
When clouds up above
Wash the blues away
Are we breakin' up? (Breakin' up)
Are we breakin' up? (Breakin' up)
Is there trouble between you and I?
Did my heart break enough? (Break enough)
Did it break enough (Break enough)
This time?
Here's to all the pretty words
We will never speak
Here's to all the pretty girls
You're gonna meet
Am I breakin' up? (Breakin' up)
Am I breakin' up? (Breakin' up)
Is there trouble on the line?
Did your heart break enough? (Break enough)
Did it break enough (Break enough)
This time?
Ooh, it feels good to be free
Ooh, it feels good to be free
Ooh, it feels good to be free
Betrayal is a thorny crown 
You wear it well
Just like a king
Revenge is the saddest thing
Honey, I'm afraid to say
You deserve everything
Am I breakin' up? (Breakin' up)
Are we breakin' up? (Breakin' up)
Is there trouble between the lines?
Did your heart break enough? (Break enough)
Did it break enough (Break enough)
This time?
Ooh, it feels good to be free
Ooh, it feels good to be free
Ooh, it feels good to be free
Ooh, it feels good to be free
Ooh, it feels good to be free
Ooh, it feels good to be free
Ooh, it feels good to be free
Ooh, it feels good to be free
Ooh, it feels good to be free
Ooh, it feels good to be free
Ooh, it feels good to be free
Ooh, it feels good to be free
Ooh, it feels good to be free

Love don't come so easily
This doesn't have to end in tragedy
I have you and you have me
We're one in a million
Why can't you see?
I'm waiting, waiting for nothing
You're leaving, leaving me hanging
When did your heart go missing?
When did your heart go missing?
I treat you like a princess
But your life is just one big mess
When did your heart go missing?
When did your heart go missing, yeah?
I meant every word I said
I never was lying when we talked in bed
I'm retracing every step in my head
What did I miss back then?
I was so, so misled
I'm waiting, waiting for nothing
You're leaving, leaving me hanging
When did your heart go missing?
When did your heart go missing?
I treat you like a princess
But your life is just one big mess
When did your heart go missing?
When did your heart go missing?
I don't understand
How could you forget what we had,
It's so wrong
I'm waiting, waiting for nothing
You're leaving, leaving me hanging
When did your heart go missing?
When did your heart go missing?
I treat you like a princess
But your life is just one big mess
When did your heart go missing?
When did your heart go missing?
Yeah!
Things were so good
We had a little dream
A little dream together
Buy a house, settle down, do our thing
But you disappeared on me
And your heart, your heart went missin'
I don't know how to find it
I don't know where it is
I don't know where your heart went
It was here just the other day
Now it's gone
I'm gonna call the police
Call the investigator, the heart investigator
Here in this diary I write you visions of my summer
It was the best I ever had
There were choruses and sing alongs
And that unspoken feeling of knowing
That right now is all that matters
All the nights we stayed up talking
Listening to 80's songs
And quoting lines from all those movies that we love
It still brings a smile to my face
I guess when it comes down to it
Being grown up isn't half as fun as growing up
These are the best days of our lives
The only thing that matters is just following your heart
And eventually you'll finally get it right
Breaking into hotel swimming pools
And wreaking havoc on our world
Hanging out at truck stops
Just to pass the time
The blacktop singing me to sleep
Lighting fireworks in parking lots
Illuminate the blackest nights
Cherry cokes under this moonlit summer sky
2015 Riverside, it's time to say goodbye
Get on the bus, it's time to go
Being grown up isn't half as fun as growing up
These are the best days of our lives
The only thing that matters is just following your heart
And eventually you'll finally get it right
(Get it right)
Being grown up isn't half as fun as growing up
These are the best days of our lives
The only thing that matters is just following your heart
And eventually you'll finally get it right
I try so many times
But it's not taking me
And it seems so long ago
That I used to believe
And I'm so lost inside of my head
And crazy
But I can't get out of it
I'm just stumbling
And I'm juggling all the thoughts in my head
I'm juggling and my fears are on fire
But I'm listening as it evolved in my head
I'm balancing on one fine wire
And I remember the time my balance was fine
And I was just walking on one fine wire
And I remember the time my balance was fine
And I was just walking on one fine wire
And It's frayed at both the ends
And I'm slow unraveling
Life plays such silly games inside of me
And I've felt some distant cries following
And they're entwined between the night and sun beams
I wish I were free from this pain in me
And I'm juggling all the thoughts in my head
I'm juggling and my fears are on fire
But I'm listening as it evolved in my head
I'm balancing on one fine wire
And I remember the time my balance was fine
And I was just walking on one fine wire
And I remember the time my balance was fine
And I was just walking on one fine wire
And it's frayed at both the ends
And I'm slow unraveling
And I remember the time my balance was fine
And I was just walking on one fine wire
And I remember the time my balance was fine
And I was just walking on one fine wire
(And I remember the time my balance was fine)
And I'm juggling all the thoughts in my head
(And I was just walking on one fine wire)
I'm juggling and my fears are on fire
(And I remember the time my balance was fine)
But I'm listening as it evolved in my head
(And I was just walking on one fine wire)
I'm balancing on one fine wire...
Got a tattoo that said, 'together through life'
Carved in your name with my pocket knife
And you wonder when you wake up will it be all right?
Feels like there's something broken inside
All I know
All I know
Is that I'm lost
Whenever you go
All I know
Is that I love you so
So much that it hurts
Got a tattoo and the pain's all right
Just want a way of keeping you inside
All I know
All I know
Is that I'm lost
In your fire below
All I know
Is that I love you so
So much that it hurts
I see the road begin to climb
I see your stars begin to shine
I see your colours, and I'm dying of thirst
All I know
Is that I love you so
So much that it hurts
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
So much that it hurts
So much that it hurts
Frenchy, I'm faking, 
Been longing to stir you up, 
Changing looks slightly like back in the '90s, 
Far and away whistle delayed delights. 
The prospect of lightning was ever so frightening, 
I said your kisses are nice, 
But I'm looking for hills to roll, 
Down with abandon and no understanding. 
I borrowed your suitcase and filled it with pearls and gold, 
You let me down lightly, 
I killed you politely
Eka sadi asha jena sadi sooksa bella nah dinner bonothia ha! Kimmir kar ke
There's dancing

From the morning
Past the evening
To the end of the light
Brimful of Asha on the forty five
Well, it's a brimful of Asha on the forty five
Brimful of Asha on the forty five
Well, it's a brimful of Asha on the forty five
And singing
Illuminate the main streets
And the cinema aisles
We don't care about no
Government warning
'Bout their promotion of the simple life
And the dams they're building
Brimful of Asha on the forty five
Well, it's a brimful of Asha on the forty five
Brimful of Asha on the forty five
Well, it's a brimful of Asha on the forty five

In the midnight, moonlight hour
Be walking along that lonely mile
And every time I do
I keep seeing this picture of you
Here comes my baby, here she comes now
And it comes as no surprise to me
With another guy
Here comes my baby, here she comes now
Walking with her love, with her love, that's oh-so fine
Never to be mine, no matter how I try
You never walk alone
And you're forever talking on the phone
I tried to call you names
But every time it comes out the same
Here comes my baby, here she comes now
And it comes as no surprise to me
With another guy
Here comes my baby, here she comes now
Walking with her love, with her love, that's oh-so fine
Never to be mine, no matter how I try
I'm still waiting for your heart
'Cause I'm sure that some day it's gonna start
You'll be mine to hold each day
But till then this is all I can say
Here comes my baby, here she comes now
And it comes as no surprise to me
With another guy
Here comes my baby, here she comes now
Walking with her love, with her love, that's oh-so fine
Never to be mine, no matter how I try
Here comes my baby, here she comes now
And it comes as no surprise to me
With another guy
Well here comes my bab...
I had a dream we went away,
Left this city for a day,
You took me southwards on a plane,
And showed me Spain or somewhere.
But in reality you're,
Not so keen to show me anything,
And I thought you liked me.
Hey show some love,
You ain't so tough,
Come fill my little world,
Right up,
Right up.
Someday you're going to realise.
(I want you to) To fill my little world,
Right up,
Right up,
Right up.
So what you gonna to do with all this stuff,
Pilling up, filling up, taking up. (My little ...)
You misunderstand me,
All I wanted was some evidence,
That you really like me. (You really liked me)
Hey show some love
You ain't so tough,
Come fill my little world,
Right up,
Right up.
Someday you're going to realise.
(I want you) To fill my little world,
Right up,
Right up,
Right up.
Maybe it's all too much,
How come we're so messed up.
Maybe I'm not enough,
Maybe I'm just too much.
Hey show some love,
You ain't so tough,
Come fill my little world,
Right up...
Ooh ooh.
Yeah.
Hey show some love,
You ain't so tough,
Come fill my little world,
Right up,

Someday you're going to realise
That I'm passing you by, so fill your little world,
Right up,
Right up,
Right up,
Come on and show,
Come on and show,
Come on and show
The way your hair swings over your eyes
The motor in my head turns
Wanting you for such a long time
In my mind, a hard lesson to learn
Do do do do do do do do
You'll never know I'm after you
Do do do do do do do do
You'll never know
And you smell like
How angels oughta smell
And you look like
You're ready to go
So hold my hand
I'll take you everywhere
Anywhere
You wanna go
The way your words keep me in line
I know what I'm here for
Waking up to the green of your eyes
Is something I'll get used to, oh!
Do do do do do do do do
You'll never know I'm after you
Do do do do do do do do

You'd better know

You're ready to go
So hold my hand

Anywhere
You wanna go
Stranger danger, danger stranger
When you gonna follow through?
The mistake you don't make or the rain cloud covers above your house
Steal the feeling and focus on the flames, girl
Have I failed to impress you?
Could've sworn that wine and one and four made two,
But it's 5!
It's 5!
Can I ride with you until the sunset gets all red?
And we'll get chased by the moon
Hope the passion don't fade since you decided he's your spouse
Wheeling, dealing, joking things will change, girl
Have I failed to impress you?
Could've sworn that wine and one and four made two,
But it's 5!
It is 5!
Don't let your white dress wear you out
Oh it hurts to look in your eyes
'Cause honey I can see him
All my life
I'd hurt the ones I'd loved
Oh but baby you can turn it round
She don't love me like you
She don't know what you do
And it's so hard
She don't care what you say
So just say it, say it anyway
It's so hard
All my life, they tried to push me down
Oh but baby you can turn it round
Oh but honey I still see him
Don't let your friends tell you why
'Cause I'm a bad, bad, bad
I'm the one
Oh but baby you can turn it on
She don't love me like you
She don't know what you do
And it's so hard
She don't care what you say
So just say it, say it anyway
It's so hard
All those years gone by
I only wanna find a way
To make it hard for you
All those years gone by
I only wanna find a way
To make it hard for you
You'll never forget it
The way that she let
She don't feel the same
I only wanna find a way
To make it hard for you
You'll never forget it
The way that she let
She don't feel the same
I only wanna find a way
To make it hard for you
She'll never forget it
The way that she let
She don't feel no pain
I only wanna find a way
To make it up to you
She'll never forget it
The way that she let
She don't feel the same
I only wanna find a way
I only wanna find
I only wanna find
She don't love me like you
She don't love me like you
She don't love me like you
She don't love me like you
She don't love
She don't
We are here to save your life
The fool, the drunk, the child, and his wife
We won't let the sun go down
We gonna chase the demons out of town
Singing when you feel alone
Backwards through the megaphone
Singing to the ones you love
And the ones you'd like to be rid of.
We are here to take the blame
To take the taunts and if the shame
We are here to make you feel
It terrifies you, but its real
It will keep you up all night
And in the flood of morning light
Spilling out across your room
You say the words will get there soon
The revolution wasn't bad
We hit the streets with all we had
A tape recording of the sound
Of the Velvet Underground
A K-Way jacket torn to shreds
And a dream inside our heads
And after changing everything
They couldn't tell we couldn't sing
After changing everything
They couldn't tell we couldn't sing
They couldn't tell we couldn't sing
And that changes everything.
Everything's always better
Whenever you're [underdressed]
And I wanted to tell you then
To try a bird's nest
And it's the truth you know
It's always the issue
And when it starts getting blurry
One's never better than two
There's a place in this world
Where people like me are found by people like you
So find a place as this forever divine
Oh yeah you're the best damn friend that I'll ever have
You'll always smile upon me when the seasons bad
You'll always make me feel best even when I'm blue
You'll always smile upon me and I'll smile upon you too
I don't know what are you now
Since everything has changed
If I did know one thing
It's me who's feeling strange
Yes everything is different
And I don't react well
The changes that come when
Your life's becoming hell
There's a place in this world
Where people like me are found by people like you
So find a place as this forever divine
Oh yeah you're the best damn friend that I'll ever have
You'll always smile upon me when the seasons bad
You'll always make me feel best even when I'm blue
You'll always smile upon me and I'll smile upon you too
The cat calls through the night
And two chicks in the parking lot
Crack wise on the price of fame
They stood to gain
The phonebook's been ripped off
And two shapes in the dark across the way
Know the price of flight
Its weight and size
If you've got something that sheds some light
Use it tonight
Tonight
Heads down, thumbs up
Two sips from the cup of human kindness
And I'm shit-faced
Just laid to waste
So wait here, wait up
Stock tips from the credit checks
Come next in the logic's line
And all on my dime
If you've got will and a little time
Use it tonight
Tonight
You had to send a wrecking crew after me
I can't walk right
You had to send a wrecking crew after me
I can't walk right
A phantom of the heart
Four beats from the party line
Been mine since I was a child
It just grew there wild
So heads down, thumbs up
Four beats from soft
And I get set to exercise your right
Use it tonight
If there's a choice between a chance and flight
Choose it tonight
Tonight
You had to send a wrecking crew after me
I can't walk right
You had to send a wrecking crew after me
I can't walk right
I can't walk right
Use it tonight
Tonight
Tonight
Tonight
Night
Night
(Four, three, two, one)
Don't hide the treasures you've found in a hole in the ground
How 'bout the tree back your house where the owls go
Or in between the attic and the basement
Somewhere it's not dark, dark, dark, dark
Attic in a basement with a knife serrated, I'll protect you
Don't hide the pleasures you've found in your rolling around
Where all the leaves have been swept and the flowers grow
And don't go finding a replacement,
I promise I'll show you heart, heart, heart, heart
Finding replacement with a heart sedated, I'll forget you
And you won't make a sound or be nervous around piles of pictures
So old that that it feels like it is ending
(Four, three, two, one)
Attic in a basement with a knife serrated, I'll protect you
And you shout out loud
And you're bursting with pride
'Cause they don't let you talk
And your heart is finally mending
It's not too late now to change your mind
The grass gets greener when you get to the finish line
An attic in a basement
Attic in a basement
And you won't make a sound or be nervous around piles of pictures
So old that it feels like it is ending
It shouldn't feel like it is ending

Your hands in the pocket

I don't need no tv, I don't need no news
All I need is a bumpin beat to bump away my blues
I don't give a damn what the people say
I'm gonna do it, gonna do it my way
Gonna let it all out an do my thing
Boom boom boom an a bang bang bang
Ooh-do your thing
Do your thing, make my body sing
Do your thing, your thing, my thing, oh oh oh oh
Say shut your mouth you're in a fatal tiz
Free the mayhem in your mind, release the need inside of you You're gonna suffer
Do your thing, do you
Boom boom boom an a
Ooh-Do your thing
Do your thing, make
Do your thing, your
Give me ying-yang
Do your thing, make

I put into Nashville, Tennessee
But you wouldn't even come around to see me
And since you're headin' up to Carolina
You know I gonna be right there behind you
'Cause I always have to steal my kisses from you
Always have to steal my kisses from you
Always have to steal my kisses from you
Always have to steal my kisses from you
Now I love to feel that warm southern rain
Just to hear it fall is the sweetest sounding thing
And to see it fall on your simple country dress
It's like heaven to me I must confess
'Cause I always have to steal my kisses from you
Always have to steal my kisses from you
Always have to steal my kisses from you
Always have to steal my kisses from you
Now I've been hangin' around you for days
But when I lean in you just turn your head away
I know you didn't mean that
She said I love the way you think but I hate the way you act
'Cause I always have to steal my kisses from you
Always have to steal my kisses from you
Always have to steal my kisses from you
Always have to steal my kisses from you
Always have to steal my kisses from you
Always have to steal my kisses from you
Always have to steal my kisses from you

Take those things that cannot stick and 
Keep leftovers in the fridge 
While lessons learned go down the drain 
I can't believe everything 
And all the bad names gone 
And the good one's were all wrong  
And so I stayed up all night 
Slept in all day 
This is my sound 
Thinking bout tomorrow 
Won't change how I feel today 
Never let your mother race 
Cause broken legs can be replaced 
Two steps to the finish line 
Three steps till I finish mine 
A struggle always suck it out  
Close your eyes and use your mouth 
And tell me bout your song  
And so I stayed up all night 
Slept in all day 
This is my sound 
Thinking bout tomorrow 
Won't change how I feel today
Bruno Mars
I wanna be a billionaire so fuckin' bad
Buy all of the things I never had
I wanna be on the cover of Forbes magazine
Smiling next to Oprah and the Queen
Oh every time I close my eyes
I see my name in shining lights, yeah
A different city every night
Oh, I, I swear the world better prepare
For when I'm a billionaire
Travie McCoy
Yeah, I would have a show like Oprah, I would be the host of
Everyday Christmas, give Travie a wish list
I'd probably pull an Angelina and Brad Pitt
And adopt a bunch of babies that ain't never had shit
Give away a few Mercedes like, "Here lady, have this"
And last, but not, least grant somebody their last wish
It's been a couple months that I've been single, so
You can call me Travie Claus, minus the ho ho
Get it, I'd probably visit where Katrina hit
And damn sure do a lot more than FEMA did
Yeah, can't forget about me, stupid
Everywhere I go I'ma have my own theme music
Bruno Mars
Oh, every time I close my eyes
What you see? What you see, bro?
I see my name in shining lights, oh yeah
Uh-huh, uh-huh, and what else?
A different city every night
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, I, I swear the world better prepare
For what?
For when I'm a billionaire
Oh ooh oh ooh
For when I'm a billionaire
Oh ooh oh ooh
Travie McCoy
I'll be playing basketball with the President, dunkin' on his delegates
Then I'll compliment him on his political etiquette
Toss a couple milli in the air just for the heck of it
But keep the fives, twentys, tens and Bens completely separate
And yeah, I'll be in a whole new tax bracket
We in recession, but let me take a crack at it
I'll probably take whatever's left and just split it up
So everybody that I love can have a couple bucks
And not a single tummy around me would know what hungry was
Eating good, sleeping soundly
I know we all have a similar dream
Go in your pocket pull out your wallet, put it in the air and sing
Bruno Mars
I wanna be a billionaire so fuckin' bad
So bad
Buy all of the things I never had
Buy everything
Uh, I wanna be on the cover of Forbes magazine

For when I'm a billionaire
Oh ooh oh ooh
For when I'm a billionaire
Oh ooh oh ooh
I wanna be a billionaire so fuckin' bad
I really don't like your point of view
I know you'll never change
Stingin' me with your attitude
I've got the mind to walk away
I really don't like your arrogance
Or your policies
Ninety-nine percent an embarrassment 
But just one quality
'Cause I don't mind it when you [whistles]
Brings out the best in me when you [whistles]
Show your expertise
When the night always ends with a fight I'm excited
When you wind up next to me
I like it when you [whistles]
Can I have some please of that [whistles]
Satisfy my needs
Sometimes I fake that I hate you and make up
So you wind up next to me
I really don't like your skinny jeans
So take them off for me
Show me what you've got underneath
So we can do this properly
I really don't like the way you smile
When you think you're right
But I will forgive you, the yolk is in the middle
And I'm chewin' through the white
'Cause I don't mind it when you [whistles]
Brings out the best in me when you [whistles]
Show your expertise
When the night always ends with a fight I'm excited
That you wind up next to me
I like it when you [whistles]
Can I have some please of that [whistles]
Satisfy my needs
Sometimes I fake that I hate you and make up
So you wind up next to me
I dreamt that you were on a train
You were leaving, you were leaving
It made me think of what I'd miss
And you believe it, you believe it
I don't mind it when you [whistles]
Brings out the best in me when you [whistles]
Show your expertise
When the night always ends with a fight I'm excited
That you wind up next to me
I like it when you [whistles]
Can I have some please of that
Take off your skinny jeans
Sometimes I fake that I hate you and make up
So you wind up next to me
I dreamed that you were on a train
You were leaving, you were leaving
Instrumental
Well, it's all right, riding around in the breeze
Well, it's all right, if you live the life you please
Well, it's all right, doing the best you can
Well, it's all right, as long as you lend a hand
You can sit around and wait for the phone to ring (At the end of the line)
Waiting for someone to tell you everything (At the end of the line)
Sit around and wonder what tomorrow will bring (At the end of the line)
Maybe a diamond ring
Well, it's all right, even if they say you're wrong
Well, it's all right, sometimes you gotta be strong
Well, it's all right, as long as you got somewhere to lay
Well, it's all right, every day is Judgment Day
Maybe somewhere down the road aways (At the end of the line)
You'll think of me and wonder where I am these days (At the end of the line)
Maybe somewhere down the road when somebody plays (At the end of the line)
Purple Haze
Well, it's all right, even when push comes to shove
Well, it's all right, if you got someone to love
Well, it's all right, everything'll work out fine
Well, it's all right, we're going to the end of the line
Don't have to be ashamed of the car I drive (At the end of the line)
I'm just glad to be here, happy to be alive (At the end of the line)
It don't matter if you're by my side (At the end of the line)
I'm satisfied
Well, it's all right, even if you're old and gray
Well, it's all right, you still got something to say
Well, it's all right, remember to live and let live

Well, it's all right (all right), if you live the life you please
Well, it's all right, even if the sun don't shine
Well, it's all right (all right), we're going to the end of the line
I was always late
You never afraid
That we could be fallin'
All our friends would say
That maybe we should wait
But they can't see what's comin'
And to this day
When everything breaks
You are the anchor that holds me
And that is why we'll always make it
How I know your face
All the ways you move
You come in, I can read you
You're my favourite book
All the things you say
The way you shift your eyes
I never knew there was someone
To make me come alive
When the days are long
And the thunder with the storm
Can always get me cryin'
But you can make my bed
I'll fall into it
Shattered but not lonely
'Cause I never knew a home
Until I found your hands
And when I'm withered
You come to me, you're my best friend
And that is why we'll always make it
How I know your face
All the ways you move
You come in, I can read you
You're my favourite book
All the things you say
The way you shift your eyes
I never knew there was someone
To make me come alive
And when we're making love
I give everything up for your touch
How I know your face
All the ways you move
You come in
I can read you, you're my favourite book
All the things you say
The way you shift your eyes
I never knew there was someone
To make me come alive
And when you go to work
All the day I wait
For you to come home
Makin' our time
In our little place
Our little place
Our little place...
One, two, ready, go!
Grow some
Big feet
Holes in
History
Is where you'll
Find me
Is where you'll
Find
All is love
Is love x3
L, O
V, E
It's a
Mystery
Where you'll
Find me
Where you'll
Find
All is love
Is love x3
Hey!
You!
C'mon!
Whoo whee!
Hey!
You!
Whoo!
Whoo~ ooh~
Whoo~ ooh~
All is love
One, two, ready, go!
L, O

Leave the bright blue door on the white-washed wall
Leave the death ledger under city hall
Leave the joyful air in that rubber ball today
Just leave the lilac print on the linen sheet
Leave the bird you killed at your father's feet
Let the sideways rain in the crooked street remain
Leave the whimpering dog in his cold kennel
Leave the dead starlet on her pedestal
Leave the acid kids in their green fishbowls today
Leave the sad guitar in its hard-shell case
Leave the worried look on your lover's face
Let the orange embers in the fireplace remain
Cause everything must belong somewhere
The train off in the distance, bicycle chained to the stairs
Everything must belong somewhere
I know that now, that's why I'm staying here
Leave the ocean's roar in the turquoise shell
Leave the widower in his private hell
Leave the liberty in that broken bell today
Just leave the epic poem on its yellowed page
Leave the grey macaw in his covered cage
Let the traveling band on the interstate remain
Cause everything must belong somewhere
Sound-stage in California, televisions in Times Square, yeah
Everything must belong somewhere
I know that now, that's why I'm staying here
And I know that now that's why I'm staying here
Leave the secret talks on the trundle bed
Leave the garden tools in the rusted shed
Leave those bad ideas in your troubled head today
Just leave the restless ghost in his old hotel
Leave the homeless man out in that cardboard cell
Let the painted horse on the carousel remain
Cause everything must belong somewhere
Just like the gold around your finger and the silver in his hair
Yeah, everything must belong somewhere
I know that now, that's why I'm staying here
Oh I know that now, that's why I'm staying here
In truth, the forest hears each sound
Each blade of grass as it lies down
The world requires no audience
No witnesses
No witnesses
Leave the old town drunk on his wooden stool
Leave the autumn leaves in their swimming pool
Leave the poor black child in his crumbling school today.
Leave the novelist in his daydream tune
Leave the scientist in her Rubik's Cube
Let true genius in the padded room remain
Leave the horses hair on the slanted bow
Leave the slot machines on the riverboat
Leave the cauliflower in the casserole today
Just leave the hot white-trash in their shopping malls
Leave the hawks of war in their capitals
Let the organs moan in the cathedral remain
Cause everything must belong somewhere
They lock the devil in the basement, threw God up into the air
Yeah, everything must belong somewhere
You know it's true, I wish you'd leave me here
Now you know it's true, why don't you leave me here?
And it's us guys writing down a funk rhyme

I got strung up from our loving 
I wish you cared to see 
But she only cares when she's got the time 
And I fret so much about our loving 
I wish she let me be 
But our destiny got us intertwined 
And is it really my fault? 
I get a shiver when I see you with those other guys 
Wearing the jacket I bought 
I can't help but lose my temper and I don't know why 
I get jealous, but I'm too cool to admit it 
When the fellas, talk to my girl I ain't with it 
I get jealous, but I'm too cool to admit it 
When the fellas, talk to my girl I ain't with it 
I ain't with it, I ain't with it, I ain't with it 
I ain't with it, I ain't with it, I ain't with it 
I ain't with it, I ain't with it, I ain't with it 
I ain't with it, I ain't with it, I ain't with it 
What is she thinking? Too much uncertainty 
Why can't she give some sort of sign? 
You know and I know, a thing or two about loyalty 
Ooh, but that girl don't pay no mind
So is it really my fault? 
I get a shiver when I see you with those other guys 
Wearing the jacket I bought 
I can't help but lose my temper and I don't know why 
I get jealous, but I'm too cool to admit it 
When the fellas, talk to my girl I ain't with it 
I get jealous, but I'm too cool to admit it 
When the fellas, talk to my girl I ain't with it 
I ain't with it, I ain't with it, I ain't with it 
I ain't with it, I ain't with it, I ain't with it 
I ain't with it, I ain't with it, I ain't with it 
I ain't with it, I ain't with it, I ain't with it 
I get strung up from her loving 
I wish she cared to see 
But she only cares when she so inclined 
And I fret so much about her loving 
I wish she'd let me be 
But her destiny got us so intertwined 
Back in 2011, I decided 
To not let this play with my mind 
But when them boys from out of town 
They come back around 
I feel like committing a crime, yeah 
I get jealous, but I'm too cool to admit it 
When the fellas, talk to my girl I ain't with it 
I get jealous, but I'm too cool to admit it 
When the fellas, talk to my girl I ain't with it 
I get jealous, but I'm too cool to admit it 
When the fellas, talk to my girl I ain't with it 
I get jealous, but I'm too cool to admit it 
When the fellas, talk to my girl I ain't with it
Long time ago
The times we had were so and so
It was the worst date of your life
So I called you home your so called father was on the phone
He wasn't easy to ignore
But we're all happy cause the streets there are always there for us
And it's quite scary when you wake up in the same old clubs
It's getting darker and I know time wasn't meant for us
So won't you please please please come back to me
But yesterday when I saw your eyes in a black haze
You didn't even know my name
So I walked on pretending that you still belong
But it will never be the same no more
But we're all happy cause the streets there are always there for us
And it's quite scary when you wake up in the same old clubs
It's getting darker and I know time wasn't meant for us
So won't you please please please come back to me
It's like a picture of a loved one in disguise
Or it's like finding something pretty in a jar of flies
And if you want just hide your eyes behind your hair
But you can't see me then you can't find me anywhere
But we're all happy cause the streets there are always there for us
And it's quite scary when you wake up in the same old clubs
It's getting darker and I know time wasn't meant for us
So won't you please please please come back to me
Come back to me
Please please please
Please please please
If you're seeking repair, 
For figure eights in the ice in your stare, 
Seven stories we're climbing tonight, 
So if you're angry about the fact that it's red, 
I'll surrender, 
I'll change it to white. 
Sneaking looks at you sleeping around, 
At you grass stained and runk on the ground, 
So we're taking you down with the scissor, paper, rock again
I've got a sheet for my bed
And a pillow for my head
I've got a pencil full of lead
And some water for my throat
I've got buttons for my coat
And sails on my boat
So much more than I needed before
I got money in the meter and a two bar heater
Now it's getting hotter
Oh it's only getting sweeter
I got legs on my chair and a head full of hair
Pot and a pan
And some shoes on my feet
I got a shelf full of books and most of my teeth
A few pairs of socks and a door with a lock
I got food in my belly and a license for my telly
And nothing's gonna bring me down
Nothing's gonna bring me down
I got a nice guitar and tyres on my car
I got most of the means and scripts for the scenes
I'm out and about, so I'm in with a shout
I got a fair bit of chat but better than that
Food in my belly and a license for my telly
And nothing's going to bring me down
Nothing's gonna bring me down
But best of all (best of all)
I've got my baby
But best of all (best of all)
I've got my baby
She's mighty fine and says she's all mine
And nothing's going to bring me down
Best of all (best of all)
I've got my baby
Best of all (best of all)
I've got my baby
She's mighty fine and says she's all mine
And nothing's going to bring me down
She's mighty fine and says she's all mine
And nothing's going to bring me down
She's mighty fine and says she's all mine
And nothing's going to bring me down
Not today... no, no
A man walks out of his apartment
It is raining, he's got no umbrella
He starts running beneath the awnings
Trying to save his suit
Trying to save his suit
Trying to dry and to dry and to dry but no good
When he gets to the crowded subway platform
He takes off both of his shoes
He steps right into somebody's fat loogie
And everyone who sees him says, "Eww."
Everyone who sees him says, "Eww."
But he doesn't care
'Cause last night he got a visit from the
Ghost of Corporate Future
The ghost said, "Take off both your shoes
Whatever chances you get
Especially when they're wet."
He also said, "Imagine you go away
On a business trip one day
And when you come back home
Your children have grown
And you never made your wife moan
Your children have grown
And you never made your wife moan."
"And people make you nervous
You'd think the world is ending
And everybody's features have somehow started blending
And everything is plastic
And everyone's sarcastic
And all your food is frozen
It needs to be defrosted."
"You'd think the world was ending
You'd think the world was ending
You'd think the world was ending right now
You'd think the world was ending
You'd think the world was ending
You'd think the world was ending right now."
"Well maybe you should just drink a lot less coffee
And never ever watch the ten o'clock news
Maybe you should kiss someone nice
Or lick a rock, or both."
"Maybe you should cut your own hair
'Cause that can be so funny
It doesn't cost any money
And it always grows back
Hair grows even after you're dead."
"And people are just people
They shouldn't make you nervous
The world is everlasting
It's coming and it's going
If you don't toss your plastic
The streets won't be so plastic
And if you kiss somebody
Then both of you'll get practice."
"The world is everlasting
Put dirtballs in your pocket
Put dirtballs in your pocket
And take off both your shoes."
"'Cause people are just people
People are just people
People are just people like you
People are just people
People are just people
People are just people like you."
The world is everlasting
It's coming and it's going
The world is everlasting
It's coming and it's going
It's coming and it's going
With an envelope, 
We'll enter buildings we might touch, 
I've got souvenirs but yesterday can't mean too much, 
Have we missed an opportunity? 
Whispers Chinese leaves a message, leaves a metaphor, 
For what once was gold and once was rich and now is poor, 
Have we missed an opportunity? 
And the trees lean to lend, 
Can I fold you in fourteen ways to depend not defend?
Love don't come so easily
This doesn't have to end in tragedy
I have you and you have me
We're one in a million
Why can't you see?
I'm waiting, waiting for nothing
You're leaving, leaving me hanging
When did your heart go missing?
When did your heart go missing?
I treat you like a princess
But your life is just one big mess
When did your heart go missing?
When did your heart go missing, yeah?
I meant every word I said
I never was lying when we talked in bed
I'm retracing every step in my head
What did I miss back then?
I was so, so misled
I'm waiting, waiting for nothing
You're leaving, leaving me hanging
When did your heart go missing?
When did your heart go missing?
I treat you like a princess
But your life is just one big mess
When did your heart go missing?
When did your heart go missing?
I don't understand
How could you forget what we had,
It's so wrong
I'm waiting, waiting for nothing
You're leaving, leaving me hanging
When did your heart go missing?
When did your heart go missing?
I treat you like a princess
But your life is just one big mess
When did your heart go missing?
When did your heart go missing?
Yeah!
Things were so good
We had a little dream
A little dream together
Buy a house, settle down, do our thing
But you disappeared on me
And your heart, your heart went missin'
I don't know how to find it
I don't know where it is
I don't know where your heart went
It was here just the other day
Now it's gone
I'm gonna call the police
Call the investigator, the heart investigator
This escapee was never gonna stay
On an unfamiliar building on the rooftop where we lay
Where all the constellations shine to pave the way
Temptation's not a word until we've let it go astray
And I won't delete it (He won't delete it, woah-oh-oh)
Light bolts hover over you all day
Oh darkness can be difficult like needles in the hay
I need to flick the switch and show you how to hide
And love is not the answer if you're taking me for a ride
For a ride
This escapee was never gonna stay
On an island way too difficult to be stuck in a daze
And all the competition's overcome what may
Temptation's not a word until we've let it go astray
And I won't delete it (He won't delete it, woah-oh-oh)
I'm escaping, you're escaping
I'm escaping
You're taking me for a ride
For a ride (I'm escaping, you're escaping)
For a ride (I'm escaping, you're escaping)
For a ride (I'm escaping, you're escaping)
You're feelin' old
It's 1 o'clock on a Friday morning,
I'm trying to keep my back from the wall.
The prophets and their pawns have had another success
And I'm wondering why we bother at all.
And I think of you on cold winter mornings, darling
They remind me of when we were in school,
Nothing really mattered when you called out my name
In fact nothing really mattered at all
And I think about how long it will take them to blow us away
But I won't get me down!
I'm just thankful to be facing the day.
Cause days don't get you far when you're young.
It's 5 o' clock on a Friday morning
One hundred telephones shake and ring
One of those was someone who knew you
And I'll still think of you on cold winter mornings, darling
They'll still remind me of when we were in school
When they could never have persuaded me,
That lives like yours, were in the hands of these erroneous fools
And to those of you who mourn your lives through one day to the next
Well let them take you next!
Can't you live and be thankful you're here?
See - it could be you, tomorrow, next year.
They swallowed it whole, they went for the gold for the gold
We fall for the same lies, we all have the same shoes to fill
The preachers and books of your empire will fight here alone
Some day they will be forgotten and die one by one
The walls the walls are coming down, the here and now is coming round
It will some day let you down
The ships the ships are coming in, the great ideas are wearing thin
There is nothing left to do
For atoms have gone as far as atoms will go
Your books write themselves, they line up in row after row
The walls the walls are coming down, the here and now is coming round
It will some day let you down
The ships the ships are coming in, the great ideas are wearing thin
There is nothing left to do
The walls the walls are coming down, the here and now is coming round
It will some day let you down
The ships the ships are coming in, the great ideas are wearing thin
There is nothing left to do

I wandered all night, I wondered all night about you
I've been here for years just wandering around the neighbourhood
Like a fresh manifestation of an old phenomenon
A breeze whips through the trees
The rustling leaves and branches bend together
They're cued to sway
Forever by the forces of the Lord's choreography
Just for a second the combination of sights, sounds around him
Sends him hurtling back to the mirror of all of his teenager thoughts and fears
He passes big houses and family cars
They saddled the horses in cobblestone yards
He catches the moon looking down from the stars
Just like it's done for years and years
Perpetual feeling in the grown up world that's all 
Around him
That there's secrets that could be revealed with knowledge and philosophy
And Oh to be dumb, Oh to be smart
He might be nursing a broken heart
But feeling this way he's just playing a part
That's been around for centuries
I wandered all night, I wondered all night about you
I've been here for years just wandering around the neighbourhood
So sweet I can hardly speak
Due to such trauma in my teeth
But your body language is telling me that you're worth the pain
So weak I can hardly keep
Shaky legs holding up my feet
But your body language is telling me that I'm not to blame
Practice makes perfect
Practice makes perfect sense
I've become what a mother wouldn't want in a son
I have done a few things I regret
But practice makes perfect
Practice makes perfect sense to me
Wake up at first light hearing you calling out
For your criminal clothing that fled the scene
Upon being ripped free
Conversation ensued
And I want to do so many things to you
Sip after sip, you insist you're a hit
Sip after sip, yeah I swear I can feel it
Too much too much promiscuity
Can drive to insanity
Say too much too much insanity
Can drive to criminality!
Say Ooh set me free
Ooh let me be.
Too much too much promiscuity
Can drive to calamity!
Too much too much hypocrisy
Can drive to cademy
Too much too much morality
Can drive to criminality!
Say Ooh set me free
Ooh let me be.
Too much too much hypocrisy
Can drive to calamity!
Ooh set me free
Ooh let me be X3
Too much too much Wiliwili
Can drive to big family
Too much too much morality
Can drive to the flies and bees
People on the street now
Faces long and grim
Souls are feeling heavy
And faith is growing thin
Fears are getting stronger
You can feel them on the rise
Hopelessness got some by the throat you can see it in their eyes
I said how come
How come
Everybody on a shoestring
Everybody in a hole
Everybody on an old jet plane crossing their fingers and toes
Government man spin his politics till they got you pinned
Everybody trying to reach out to each other
But they don't know where to begin
I said how come
I can't tell
The free world
From living hell
I said how come
How come
All I see
Is a child of god
In misery
I said how come
The pistol now as prophet
The bullet some kind of lord and king
But pain is the only promise that this so called savior is gonna bring
Love can be a liar
And justice can be a thief
And freedom can be an empty cup from which everybody want to drink
I said how come
I can't tell
The free world
From living hell
I said how come
How come
All I see
Is a child of god
In misery
I said how come
It's just man killing man
Killing man
Killing man
Killing man
Killing man
I don't understand it
It's just man killing man
I'm on the rocky road
Heading down off the mountain slope
And as my steps echo echo,
Louder than before
Another day is done,
Say goodbye to the setting sun
See what I found,
Turn back to the ground
Just like before
And Hey hey hey hey hey hey
Hey beautiful day, hey beautiful day
Hey hey hey hey
Hey beautiful day, hey beautiful day
When the night feels my song
I'll be home, I'll be home
Into the undergrowth,
Twist and turn on a lonely road
In the twilight
The day turns to night
And I'm alone
And when the light has let
I'm not sure of my every step
Follow the wind that pushes me west
Back to my bed
And Hey hey hey hey hey hey
Hey beautiful day, hey beautiful day
Hey hey hey hey
Hey beautiful day, hey beautiful day
When the night feels my song
I'll be home, I'll be home
When the night feels my song
I'll be home, I'll be home
When the night feels my song
I'll be home, I'll be home
Whether or not the weather is on my side
We could be together if I stay bright eyed
I can feel the summer sending signs of fall
I see a happy ending if I stand up tall
Whether or not this cold front is moving in
Or its just vacation and we'll soon be friends
I know I can't avoid her she's in the air
May as well polaroid her with the way I stare
Ooh, Tonight the stars are so bright.
I've gotta get outdoors while the weathers still here
I've gotta take in the starlight before it disappears
A chance lasts a finite time in the cool July night time
So take in all you can
Whether or not our season will soon be done
I think I've got a reason to enjoy the sun
I hear the forecast ain't as bad as it seems
It should be clearing up soon if only in dreams
Ooh, Tonight the stars are oh so bright.
I've gotta get outdoors while the weathers still here
I've gotta take in the starlight before it disappears
A chance lasts a finite time in the cool July night time
So take in all you can
I've gotta get outdoors while the weathers still here
I've gotta take in the starlight before it disappears
A chance lasts a finite time in the cool July night time
So take in all you can
It is the passion flowing right on through your veins
And it's the feeling like you're oh so glad you came
And it's the moment you remember you're alive
It is the air you breathe, the element, the fire
It is that flower that you took the time to smell
It is the power that you know you got it well
It is the fear inside that you can overcome
This is the orchestra, the rhythm and the drum
Com uma força, com uma força
Com uma força que ninguem pode parar
Com uma força, com uma forca
Com uma fome que ninguem pode matar
It is the soundtrack of your ever-flowing life
It is the wind beneath your feet that makes you fly
It is the beautiful game that you choose to play
When you stepped out into the world to start your day
You show your face and take it in and scream and pray
You're gonna win it for yourself and us today
It is the gold, the green, the yellow and the grey
The red and sweat and tears, the love you got. Hey!
Com uma força, com uma força
Com uma força que ninguem pode parar
Com uma força, com uma força
Com uma fome que ninguem pode matar
Força, força, força, força, força
Closer to the sky 
Closer, way up high
Mais perto do céu
Mais perto do céu
Com uma força, com uma força
Com uma força que ninguem pode parar
Com uma força, com uma força
Com uma fome que ninguem pode matar
It is the passion flowing right on through your veins
And it's the feeling like you're oh so glad you came
It is the moment you remember you're alive
It is the air you breathe, the element, the fire
Força (oh), força (oh), força, força, força
Pode parar
Este amor... Este amor...
É tão grande, é tão forte
Come on!
I don't wanna be the reason,
We don't get down.
So I'ma let you do the leading,
And follow you now
See I just don't usually do this,
But you're bringing me out.
All the doubts I had have gone away
When you're touching me I'm not afraid,
Know this ain't going away, here to stay,
I just wanna be your girl
I can be all you want,
Will you say,
I just wanna be your girl, yeah.
'Cause you got my heart unlocked,
It's so unreal you know,
Don't want this to stop,
You're so damn keepable
Feel your magic touch
It's unbelievable
I gotta have you, like abracadabra
You got my heart unlocked,
It's so unreal you know,
Don't want this to stop,
You're so damn keepable
Feel your magic touch
It's unbelievable
I gotta have you, like abracadabra
I didn't even see you coming,
It was such a surprise,
I wasn't expecting nothing,
Now I'm lit up inside
You're bringing out all the colours,
No more black and white
You won the race and got the gold,
So here I am, we're good to go
Know this ain't going away, here to stay,
I just wanna be your girl
I can be all you want,
Will you say,
I just wanna be your girl, whoa yeah
'Cause you got my heart unlocked,
It's so unreal you know,
Don't want this to stop,
You're so damn keepable
Feel your magic touch
It's unbelievable
I gotta have you, like abracadabra
You got my heart unlocked,
It's so unreal you know,
Don't want this to stop,
You're so damn keepable
Feel your magic touch
It's unbelievable
I gotta have you, like abracadabra
I don't wanna take my time,
I don't wanna wait in line,
I just want you by my side
Come and give me what I like
I don't wanna take my time,
I don't wanna wait in line,
I just want you by my side
Come and give me what I like
'Cause you got my heart unlocked,
It's so unreal you know,
Don't want this to stop,
You're so damn keepable
Feel your magic touch
It's unbelievable
I gotta have you, like abracadabra
You got my heart unlocked,
It's so unreal you know,
Don't want this to stop,
You're so damn keepable
Feel your magic touch
It's unbelievable
I gotta have you, like abracadabra
Hey yeah, oh yeah, yeah.
I left my heart in San Fransisco 
It's at some motherfucking disco 
The people there where dancin' on it 
And that's including Ms. Matronic 
Hell if music is the victim then so am I 
Of lovin' and a cheatin' the snake gon' bite 
I beg and I scream and I cuss and I cry 
If music is the victim then so am I 
Of your bad fun 
Money's all gone but you need some 
Lover's on the phone but they got none 
Daddy ain't home from the dog run 
And you're riding through the city with a shotgun 
I left my bag in Pasadena 
Where all them girls was doin' Tina 
Them bitches sure were crunked up on it 
I said I'd rather smoke some chronic 
Hell if music is the victim then so am I 
Of lovin' and a cheatin' the snake gon' bite 
I beg and I scream and I cuss and I cry 
If music is the victim then so am I 
Of your bad fun 
Money's all gone but you need some 
Lover's on the phone but they got none 
Daddy ain't home from the dog run 
And you're riding through the city with a shotgun 
I left my man in Houston Texas 
Just before he finished breakfast 
He said; oh baby fry some more eggs 
But I was runnin' on my own two legs 
Hell if Jesus had the power then so do I 
To rise up from the dead and take up to the sky 
I'm bustin' for the money so I get by 
If music is the victim then so am I
Ooh, Ooh, Ooh, hey!
It's 72 degrees,
Zero chance of rain,
It's been a perfect day
We're all spinning on our heels,
So far away from real
In California
We watched the sunset from our car, we all took it in
And by the time that it was dark, you and me had something, yeah!
And if this is what we've got,
Then what we've got is gold
We're shining bright and I want you,
I want you to know
The morning's on it's way, our friends all say goodbye
There's nowhere else to go,
I hope that you'll stay the night
Ooh, you'll stay the night, Ooh, yeah!
We've been singing Billie Jean
Mixin' vodka with caffeine
We've got strangers stopping by
And though you're out of tune
Girl you blow my mind, you do
And all I say is I don't wanna say good night
If there's no quiet corner to get to know each other
Then there's no hurry I'm a patient man
As you'll discover
'Cause if this is what we've got,
Then what we've got is gold
We're shining bright and I want you,
I want you to know
The morning's on it's way, our friends all say goodbye
There's nowhere else to go, I hope that you'll stay the night
Ooh, you'll stay the night, Ooh, yeah!
Just like the song on the* radio said
We'll share the shelter of my single bed
But it's a different tune that's stuck in my head
And it goes...
If this is what we've got, then what we've got is gold
We're shining bright and I want you, I want you to know
The morning's on it's way, our friends all say goodbye
There's nowhere else to go, I hope that you'll stay the night
[Ooh] If this is what we've got
[Ooh] Then what we've got is gold
[Ooh] We're shining bright and I want you, I want you to know
[Ooh] The morning's on it's way
[Ooh] Our friends all say goodbye
[Ooh] There's nowhere else to go, I hope that you'll stay the night
(* He sings "the radio" but mimes "my radio" in the official video.)
Bones bones brittle little bones
It's not the milk you seek
It's the sun you need
And the sleek sleek skeleton I hold
Where are the hidden folds
Where's the meat
Did you eat?
Total void
Tells me stories
Sometimes they make me sorry
I need another
I need another
Sugar dumpling and muffin baby
This world is going crazy
I think I'm through listening to you
Bones bones brittle little bones
It's not the milk you see
Its just the sun you need
And the sleek sleek skeleton I hold
Where are the hidden folds
Where is the meat that you eat
Gonna make some plans
Wait and see
Turn it off
Turn me on
Open your eyes look around you
Fuck what you heard
You were lied to
Sweetheart
Sick body part
Sickheart
Sweet body part
Bones bones brittle little bones
It's not the milk you seek
It's the sun you need
And the sleek sleek skeleton I hold
Where are the hidden folds
Where's the meat
Did you eat?
I'm standing in Brooklyn just waiting for something to happen
I can't help but look, thinking that everyone doesn't get it
To my left is a window, where did I go?
My reflection just blends in to roads of gold
And bad ideas, but ideas nonetheless and so
I put one foot in front of the other one
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I don't need a new love or a new life
Just a better place to die
I put one foot in front of the other one
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I don't need a new love or a new life
Just a better place to die
I happened to stumble upon a chapel last night
And I can't help but back up when I think of what happens inside
I got friends locked in boxes, that's no way to live
What you're calling a sin, isn't up to them
After all, after all
I thought we were all your children
But I will die for my own sins, thanks a lot
We'll rise up ourselves, thanks for nothing at all
So up off the ground, our forefathers are nothing but dust now
I put one foot in front of the other one
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I don't need a new love or a new life
Just a better place to die
I put one foot in front of the other one
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I don't need a new love or a new life
Just a better place to die
Maybe I should learn to shut my mouth
I am over 25
And I can't make a name for myself
Some nights I break down and cry
I'm lucky that my father's still alive
He's been fighting all his life
And if this all I've ever known
Then may his soul live on forever in my song
La-di-da da da da da
La-di-da da da da
La-di-da da da da
I put one foot in front of the other one
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I don't need a new love or a new life
Just a better place to die
I put one foot in front of the other one
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I don't need a new love or a new life
Just a better place to die
In front of the other one
In front of the other one
Just a better place to die
Sensitive heart, you're doomed from the start
Meant to play the penitent part
Inquisitive mind, you're destined to find
Tempted fate and knowledge divine
View in there, a pitied pair
Denoted by a scene unfair
Will you make my children bear
The consequences everywhere?
Is it so hard to forgive
The way we've been made to live?
How much is required to set things right?
Have you confused your power with might?
Oh-whoa-oh
View in there, a pitied pair
Denoted by a scene unfair
Will you make my children bear
The consequences everywhere?
Imminent, you seem you seem to be
A picture of fragility
What is it that you think of me?
Is it a woman that you see?
Is it so hard to forgive
The way we've been made to live?
How much is required to set things right?
Have you confused your power with might?
Is it so hard to forgive
The way we've been made to live?
How much is required to set things right?
Have you confused your power with might?
Oh-whoa-oh
Oh-whoa-oh
Oh-whoa-oh
Oh-whoa-oh
Billy Liar's got his hands in his pockets
Staring over at the neighbor's, knickers down
He's got his knickers down
So the summer is eternity for you?
Sleeping in until your father's shaking you down
He's shaking you down
And the mail room shift gets a real short shrift
As you dole out the packages, no-one seems to want you around
All skulking around
Let your legs loll on the lino
Till your sinews spoil
Will you stay here, for awhile, dear
Till the radio plays something familiar?
Plays something familiar
All a-drifting, he's a no-good boyo
Sent a-fishing for a whalebone corset frame
His only catch all day
So he sits and lets the current take him
A gentle breeze will leave his pants in disarray
And at his ankles laid
As he drifts to sleep with a moan and a weep
He is decked by a Japanese geisha with a garland of pearls
How she twists and twirls!
Let your legs loll on the lino
Till your sinews spoil
Will you stay here, for awhile, dear
Till the radio plays something familiar?
Plays something familiar
Plays something familiar
Plays something familiar
Spread your love and fly
Spread your love and fly
Spread your love and fly
Spread your love and fly
All around the world statues crumble for me
Who knows how long I've loved you
Everywhere I go people stop and they see
Twenty-five years old, my mother God rest her soul
(Lord have mercy)
I just want to fly
Put your arms around me baby
Put your arms around me baby
I just want to fly
Put your arms around me baby
Put your arms around me baby
Spread your love and fly
Spread your love and fly
Spread your love and fly
Dance a little stranger show me where you've been
Love can make you hostage, wanna do it again
There's no time to think 'bout the starting or the end
We'll find out I'm told, my mother she told me so
I just want to fly
Put your arms around me baby 
Put your arms around me baby 
I just want to fly
Put your arms around me baby
Put your arms around me baby
I just want to fly
Spread your arms and fly
I just want to fly
All around the world statues crumble for me
Who knows how long I've loved you
Everyone I know's been so good to me
Twenty-five years old, my mother God rest her soul
I just want to fly
Put your arms around me baby 
Put your arms around me baby 
I just want to fly
Put your arms around me baby
Put your arms around me baby 
I just want to fly
I just want to fly
I just want to fly
I just want to fly
All around the world statues crumble for me
I just want to fly
I just want to fly

I see the walls, then see them fall
You break through them all
I see you crawl, now you stand tall
Grow and grow till tall
In storm we scream against the stream, our eyes watering
Jump into lakes, the surface breaks
We swim underwater, and our mouths - In tune
We all want to grow with the seeds we will sow
We all want to go with the breeze we will blow
We all want to know when we're all meant to go
To a place you and I - Will call home
I see forest, a treasure chest full of labyrinth
I see a door, holes in the floor
We'll break seeds, we'll grow
There's songs, sounds you bring to us
You pin both the wings on us
I hear, I see you sing for us
You go tie a string around us
There's songs, sounds you bring to us
You pin both the wings on us
I hear, I see you sing for us
You go tie a string around us
We all want to grow with the seeds we will sow
We all want to go with the breeze we will blow
We all want to know when we're all meant to go
To a place you and I...
We all want to grow with the seeds we will sow
We all want to go with the breeze we will blow
We all want to know when we're all meant to go
To a place you and I...
I see you grow : I see you grow : Grow taller
(And our mouths - In tune)

It takes a crane to build a crane
It takes two floors to make a story
It takes an egg to make a hen
It takes a hen to make an egg
There is no end to what I'm saying
It takes a thought to make a word
And it takes some words to make an action
It takes some work to make it work
It takes some good to make it hurt
It takes some bad for satisfaction
Ah, la, la, la, life is wonderful
Ah, la, la, la, life goes full circle
Ah, la, la, la, life is wonderful
Ah, la, la, la
It takes a night to make it dawn
And it takes a day to make you yawn, brother
And it takes some old to make you young
It takes some cold to know the sun
It takes the one to have the other
And it takes no time to fall in love
But it takes you years to know what love is
And It takes some fears to make you trust
It takes those tears to make it rust
It takes the dust to have it polished, yeah
Ah, la, la, la, life is wonderful
Ah, la, la, la, life goes full circle
Ah, la, la, la, life is wonderful
Ah, la, la, la
It is so...
It takes some silence to make sound
And it takes a loss before you found me
And it takes a road to go nowhere
It takes a toll to make you care
It takes a hole to make a mountain
Ah, la, la, la, life is wonderful
Ah, la, la, la, life goes full circle
Ah, la, la, la, life is wonderful
Ah, la, la, la, life is meaningful
Ah, la, la, la, life is wonderful
Ah, la, la, la
It is so wonderful
It is so meaningful
It is so wonderful
It is meaningful
It is wonderful
It is meaningful

She woke me up with a bang bang
Lookin' over crossed eyed
Had a big hunch that the world was a big lie
When I got up all the blood to my head
I got so dizzy fell back into my bed
I went over to the wayside
Lookin' for the high tide
What will I find
Will I find
Will I find find
All I saw was a man that had a hat that had a pompom
He's been there for years
Can someone tell me how long?
Wake up to tell me
Wake up to show me what I could not find
Wake up to tell me
Wake up to show me what I could not
You see this woman woke me up at a quarter to three
And I didn't know it then but she put a spell on me
Said I had to go down to where the cliffs meet the sea
And meet an old man to present my plea
So I headed way down to the big pier
To await and confront my big fear
I wheeled around behind to my blind side
To find an old man with a lime and a kind eye
Said "Mister, mister, with your beard so long
Won't you be a saint and tell me just where I'm goin'"
He pointed to a conch shell and then to the lime
And said, "This is all I really need to get by"
Wake up to tell me
Wake up to show me what I could not find
Wake up to tell me
Wake up to show me what I could not
Hey (hey) mister man
I know ya don't know who ya, think I think I am
But I can safely say
That I shoulda been sleepin', been sleepin', been sleepin'
The day away
Hey Hey
I said excuse me
Have you got the time?
He shrugged his shoulders, said "Get a spine"
Coconut hit me on the head jonesin' for a fig
"I got booked last night... I need another fix, dig?"
Yeah
Just then I see a twinkle twinkle in the old man's eye
And a wave tossed bottle is thrown to the sky
I caught it on the rebound and landed with a soft sound
I took out the message and put the bottle down
Inside was an antidote to the spell
And I read it to the man 'cause he couldn't read so well
Said don't worry about a thing ya know your path is true
Just ease your mind have a banana or two
Well goodness, goodness woe is me
The man nearly flipped to learn that he was free
But just before we left and started kickin' it
I picked up the bottle and star sixed it
Kick kick shuffle shuffle back to the beach with a
Tune on my lips and my quest in reach
That woman come to see you with her song so sweet
Say "Damn" and let the poor sucker sleep... let him sleep
Wake up to tell me
Wake up to show me what I could not find
Wake up to tell me
Wake up to show me what I could not find
You tell lies thinking I can't see
You can't cry 'cause you're laughing at me
I'm down (down) (I'm really down)
I'm down (down) (down on the ground)
I'm down (down) (I'm really down)
How can you laugh when you know I'm down?
(How can you laugh) when you know I'm down?
Man buys ring, woman throws it away
Same old thing happen every day
I'm down (down) (I'm really down)
I'm down (down) (down on the ground)
I'm down (down) (I'm really down)
How can you laugh when you know I'm down?
(How can you laugh) when you know I'm down?
We're all alone and there nobody else
She will still moan, "Keep your hands to yourself"
I'm down (down) (I'm really down)
Oh babe, I'm down (down) (down on the ground)
I'm down (down) (I'm really down)
How can you laugh when you know I'm down?
(How can you laugh) when you know I'm down?
Wowow!
Carry on, John!
Whoo!
Baby, you hear me?
Oh, baby, you know I'm down (down) (I'm really down)
I guess I'm down (down) (I'm really down)

I'll be back tomorrow
I'll be back in the ballroom swingin'
I'll be back with my Superman action
And I'm off to save the world
Silly me, I left a message with no return number
For my boys in blue in case of an emergency
In case the shit goes down, yeah
I'll be back tomorrow
I'll be back in the ballroom swingin'
I'll be back with my Superman action
And I'm off to save the world
I'll be back tomorrow
I'll be back in the ballroom swingin'
I'll be back with a capital H
It stands for hero, and the hero is me
I'll be back tomorrow
I'll be back at a quarter to 11
I'm half drunk and I can't see straight
A hero zero with a capital Z (that's me)
Singing songs from the balcony as the city crumbles
Under the powers of an evil doctor rocket science monster with capabilities to destroy the entire universe
I'll be back tomorrow
I'll be back in the ballroom swingin'
I'll be back with my Superman action
And I'm off to save the world
I'll be back tomorrow
I'll be back in the ballroom swingin'
I'll be back with a capital H
It stands for hero, and the hero is me (not)
Yeah
Yeah
I'll be back tomorrow
I'll be back in the ballroom swingin'
I'll be back with my Superman action
And I'm off to save the world
I'll be back tomorrow
I'll be back in the ballroom swingin'
I'll be back with a capital H
It stands for hero, and the hero is me
Good morning to you, I hope you're feeling better baby
Thinking of me while you are far away.
Counting the days until they set you free again,
Writing this letter hoping you're okay.
Saved you the room you used to stay in every Sunday,
The one that is warmed by sunshine every day.
And we'll get to know each other for a second time,
And then you can tell me 'bout your prison stay.
Feels so good you're coming home soon.
It's gonna be good to have you back again with me,
Watching the laughter play around your eyes.
Come up and fetch you, saved up for the train fare money,
Kiss and make up and it will be so nice.
Walking the way we used to walk,
And it could be so nice.
We're talking the way we used to talk,
And it could be so nice.
Well he used to be somebody
And now he's someone else
Took apart his old life
Left it on the shelf
Sick of being someone
He did not admire
Took up all his old things
Set 'em all on fire
He's gonna change
Gonna change his ways
Gonna change
Gonna change his ways
And it feels like his new life can start
And it feels like heaven
Left his house at midnight
Resolute and young
In search of something greater
Than the person he'd become
Threw his bags on to the back
Of his run down eighties car
Headed out to god knows where
The distance is too far
He's gonna change
Gonna change his ways
Gonna change
Gonna change his ways
And it feels like his new life can start
And it feels like heaven
And it feels like his new life can start
And it feels like heaven
(Your life is your life gotta live like it's your life)
And it feels like his new life can start
And it feels like heaven
And it feels like his new life can start
And it feels like heaven
Sometimes, the feeling is right,
You fall in love for the first time
Heartbeat, and kisses so sweet,
Summertime love in the moonlight.
Aye yippey aye ooh

Please come and see me again, I never felt more alone.

I see the place that we belong together
Together, like we were something more
And it felt maybe we could last forever
Forever
But you led them to our hideout
They forced their way inside
Now they want us to surrender
Us to surrender
But I could go all night
Right here between their crossfire
We'll send them up a message
I'll send a message
Saying "Give it up, give it up!"
We've got no place to go
Caught up in a rodeo
Oh no! Please God, tell me we're dreaming
We've got nowhere to run
They've all got loaded guns.
Oh no! Please God, tell me we're dreaming
Oh-ooh
Ah-ah
Please God, tell me we're dreaming
Wait for the dust to settle down around us
Around us, and stick to what we know
I think the air is finally safe to breathe again
To breathe again
The world is in your palm now
So take a breath and calm down
'Cause you have been selected
You've been selected
A few will ever find out
And if you don't see why, well
At least you got your nest and
You've got your nest and
So live it up, live it up!
We've got no place to go
Caught up in a rodeo
Oh no! Please God, tell me we're dreaming
We've got nowhere to run
They've all got loaded guns.
Oh no! Please God, tell me we're dreaming
Oh-ooh
Ah-ah
Please God, tell me we're dreaming
Oh-ooh
Ah-ah
Please God, tell me we're dreaming
Well, then give it up, give it up
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
But you led them to our hideout
They forced their way inside
Now they want us to surrender
Us to surrender
But I could go all night
Right here between their crossfire
We'll send them up a message
I'll send a message
Saying "Give it up, give it up!"
We've got no place to go

Oh no! Please God, tell me we're dreaming

Oh no! Please God, tell me we're dreaming
Oh-ooh
Ah-ah
Please God, tell me we're dreaming
Oh-ooh
Ah-ah
Please God, tell me we're dreaming
Sorry I couldn't be there, I was tied to a rocking chair 
I was beat down to a pulp, rocking back and forth somewhere 
If you knew, if you saw, you'd have said it was the final straw
There my life was bound and tethered on a porch by the shore 
But there's no, no, no, no, no 
Easy way to tell one so
The things you know 
And run, run, run, run, run, run 
When they say they think they know exactly so 
It's not right, it's not right 
How'm I the only one who sees a fight? 
What are we? Who are they? 
Who says those bastards don't deserve to pay? 
"Well it's the numbers, it's the numbers;
We don't stand a chance 
So long as they're around, 
You're just another song and dance"
It's not fair (it's not fair)
It's not fair (it's not fair)
Still I'm the only one who seems to care 
It's funny being funny,
Makes you feel like up and running 
When your past lingers like rain clouds casting shadows below 
I could live with so many burdens 
I'd take all your hope and yearning 
But there's no way I'll let'em take me for their petty little woes 
Oh, I used to glow, glow, glow, glow, glow 
Once I had a love to show
A love they'd know 
But they're slow, slow, slow, slow, slow 
So slow that they'd never know where I'd go! 
It's not right, it's not right 
How'm I the only one who sees a fight? 
What are we? Who are they? 
Who says those bastards don't deserve to pay? 
"Well it's the numbers, it's the numbers;
We don't stand a chance 
So long as they're around, 
You're just another song and dance"
It's not fair (it's not fair)
It's not fair (it's not fair)
Still I'm the only one who seems to care 
I know that it's always something 
I'm just working with what I've been given 
It's not my fault, I'm happy 
Don't call me crazy, I'm happy! 
It's not right, it's not right 
How'm I the only one who sees a fight? 
What are we? Who are they? 
Who says those bastards don't deserve to pay? 
"Well it's the numbers, it's the numbers;
We don't stand a chance 
So long as they're around, 
You're just another song and dance"
It's not fair (it's not fair)
It's not fair (it's not fair)
Still I'm the only one who seems to care
I count the days, the Great Frontier
Forgiving, faced the seventh year
I stand in awe of gratefulness
I can and call forgetfulness
And when I, and when I call
The patient, the patient fall
The spirit, the carpenter
Invites us to be with her
What have we become America?
Soldiers on the Great Frontier
Carpenter and soldier, one on one
It's the battle, volunteer
The prairie, the frontier (Run from yourself, from your friends)
The perfect farm, it's from here (From ya)
The fortress, the faker (Run for your life, for your friends)
The cornerstone, the baker (Run for your life, for your friends, for ya)
The dancer, the fisher (American, 'Merica)
Audition and the disher ('Meri)
The boxer, the fetcher (Oh Illinois, Illinois)
The chewing gum, dream catcher (Illi')
I count the days the Great Frontier
Forgiving, faced the seventh year
I stand and strain to make ends meet
Five spirits on the Grand Marquee
And when I, and when I call
The Patient, the Patient fall
The Spirit, the Carpenter
Invites us to be with her
There was a man at the wall
He was grateful for us all
I saw the wise woman sing
She wasn't asking anything
She wasn't asking anything
How she made the nations sing
What have we become America?
Soldiers on the Great Frontier
The mattress, the floozies (Run from yourself, from your friends)
The actress at the movies (From ya)
The lantern, the lotion (Run for your life, for your friends)
The wind that wakes the ocean (For ya)
The Standard Edition (American, 'Merica)
The architect's rendition ('Meri)
The fashion, the fevers (Oh Illinois, Illinois)
The house we got at Sears (Illi')
Oh Great Fire of Great Disaster
Oh Great Heaven, oh Great Master
Oh Great Goat, the curse you gave us
Oh Great Ghost, protect and save us
Oh Great River, green with envy
Oh Jane Addams, spirit send thee
Oh Great Trumpet and the singers
Oh Great Goodman, King of Swingers (Given what you lost are you better off?)
Oh Great Bears and Bulls, Joe Jackson (Given what you had, has it made you mad?)
(Celebrate the few, celebrate the new)
Oh Great Illinois (It can only start with you)
I took my sister down to the ocean
But the ocean made me feel stupid
Those words of wisdom I had prepared
All seemed to vanish into thin air
Into the waves I stared
I picked up a seashell
To illustrate my homelessness
But a crab crawled out of it
Making it useless
And all my metaphors fell flat
Down on the rocks where we sat
She asked where're you at?
But sister, it's the opposite of hallelujah
It's the opposite of being you
You don't know 'cause it just passes right through you
You don't know what I'm going through
You don't know what I'm going through
You don't know what I'm going through
We made our way home on the bikes we had borrowed
I still never told you about unstoppable sorrow
You still think I'm someone to look up to
I still don't know anything about you
Is it in you too?
You've got so much to live for, little sister
You've got so much to live for
But sister, it's the opposite of hallelujah
It's the opposite of being you
You don't know cause it just passes right through you
You don't know what I'm going through
You don't know what I'm going through
You don't know what I'm going through
I don't always tell the truth
They don't mind it if you're told where I'm from
Anyone I find intrusive
You will bother if you choose me
I don't always think of you
As untitled, insecure, chloroform
I would rather stand if you stay
Why would I lie to you?
My love, my love, my love, my love is
My love, my love, my love it is
My love, my love, my love, my love is
Cruel
Buckle up, we'll chase each other
It's not a lot, it's just enough to matter
Anyway you want the truth is
I will marry you on Tuesdays
I don't always tell the truth
If you want it you can lose, don't bother
I don't like it if you miss me
Why would I long for you?
My love, my love, my love, my love is
My love, my love, my love it is
My love, my love, my love, my love is
Cruel
My love, my love, my love, my love is
My love, my love, my love it is
My love, my love, my love, my love is
Cruel
Would I long for you?
Is it up to you, oh?
Is it up to you, oh?
Oh
Oh
Instrumental
Well I-I, I wanna be your lover
I wanna be your man
I want you to understand
And I-I, I wanna open your door
And love you 'til you're sore
That works for - wait a minute, wait a minute!
Yeah
I wanna be your thing, your anything your everything oh yeah
And I-I, I wanna fill your cup (cup cup cup)
Fill it up, fill it up to the brim with love
That works for - wait a minute, wait a minute!
You'll never have to ask
I'll give you my sweet grass
I'm gonna mesmerize your ass
Just give me my first chance, it's gonna be the last
I'm gonna make you wanna stay
I-I I wanna be your cow
Give you all the milk around town
Let me see, let me see you drink it down
I-I, I wanna be the pear tree
I want you to climb all over me
Try my fruit and taste my seed
Climb right on me, lay it on me
C-climb right on me, l-lay it on me!
Just let my do my thing
Until you start to sing
I'm going down all you night long
I'm gonna build a bond
I'm pullin' out my wand
Feels so right it can't be wrong!
Yeah!
Well I-I, I wanna be your lover
I wanna be your man
I want you to understand
And I-I, I wanna be you lover baby
I wanna be your girl
Blow a kiss and change the world, yeah
We're gonna make it through
You got me and I got you
Your bleedin' heart's at my command
If you don't love me to
Then bein' friends will do
Long as you let me in your bed!
There exists a melody
That just might change your mind
Oh if only I knew the key
To sing to make you mine
Then I saw it on your keyboard
And you saw it on my sleeve
I never knew a heart existed
Outside of make believe
Till I read it on your keyboard
I knew at least I might just have a chance
To catch a shooting star
There exists a star above
That always steals my stare
And there exists a star on stage
That never seems to care
And then I saw it on your keyboard
And you saw it in my eyes
I didn't mean to scare you
You just seem really nice
And then I read it on your keyboard
I knew at least I might just have a chance
To catch a shooting star
Baby, you're sailing today
Baby, you're sailing away
Sugar, wish I could go too
But honey you know
I'm happy for you
Wish I, I wish I, I wish I
Wish I was going too
Baby, your ship has come in
Baby, adventures will begin
Sugar, don't you worry 'bout me
'Cause honey you know
Want you to be happy
Wish I, I wish I, I wish I
Wish I was going too
But if you find that you don't like it
That the people there aren't inviting
Or that city life is too frightening
Won't you come home
But if you find that you don't like it
That the people there aren't inviting
Or that city life is too frightening
Won't you come home
Please come home
Wish I, I wish I, I wish I
Wish I was going too
Wish I, I wish I, I wish I
Wish I was going too
I'm a legionnaire, camel in disrepair
Hoping for a frigid air to come passing by
I am on reprieve, lacking my joie de vivre
Missing my gay Paris in this desert dry
And I wrote my girl, told her I would not return
I've terribly taken a turn for the worse now, I fear
It's been a year or more since they shipped me to this foreign shore
Fighting in a foreign war so far away from my home
If only some rain would fall on the houses and the boulevards
And the sidewalk bagatelles, it's like a dream
With the roar of cars and the lolling of the café bars
The sweetly sleeping sweeping of the Seine
Lord, I don't know if I'll ever be back again
Medicating in the sun, pinched doses of laudanum
Longing for the old fecundity of my homeland
Curses to this mirage, a bottle of ancient Shiraz
A smattering of distant applause is ringing in my poor ears
On the old left bank, my baby in a char-à-banc
Riding up the width and length of the Champs-Élysées
If only some rain would fall on the houses and the boulevards
And the sidewalk bagatelles, it's like a dream
With the roar of cars and the lolling of the café bars
The sweetly sleeping sweeping of the Seine
Lord, I don't know if I'll ever be back again
If only some rain would fall on the houses and the boulevards
And the sidewalk bagatelles, it's like a dream
With the roar of cars and the lolling of the café bars
The sweetly sleeping sweeping of the Seine
Lord, I don't know if I'll ever be back again
Be back again
Be back again
Be back again
Oh
Oh
Oh
I've forgotten what it feels like to feel normal
To be normal
And I've forgotten what food tastes like
The way it tastes right
The taste buds taste right
Well, I wake up in so much spit and sweat
It is not normal
What is normal?
Well, I go to bed
When I wake up
After cleaning all
All the spit and sweat
Now I'm, now
I'm sh-sh-shakin', sh-shakin'
I'm sh-sh-shakin', sh-shakin'
I'm sh-sh-shakin', sh-shakin'
I'm sh-sh-shakin', sh-shakin' now
I tossed and turned all night
'Cause I, 'cause I was looking for, for an ending
This was so because, because I watched all day
The Neverending Story with Atreyu
The next day came but not a beam of light
Because the blinds were shut
Sh-sh-sh-shut so tight
Well, I fell out of bed laced in spit and sweat
It made me very cold
It made me very cold
Now I'm, now
I'm sh-sh-shakin', sh-shakin'
I'm sh-sh-shakin', sh-shakin'
I'm sh-sh-shakin', sh-shakin'
I'm sh-sh-shakin', sh-shakin'
I'm sh-sh-shakin'
I'm supposed to feel better
This nightmare's supposed to end
I am holdin' on
I am holdin' on
I am holdin' on
I am holdin' on
I'm sh-sh-shakin', sh-shakin'
I'm sh-sh-shakin', sh-shakin'
I'm sh-sh-shakin', sh-shakin'
I'm sh-sh-shakin', sh-shakin'
Now, yeah
Now, yeah
I'm shakin' (I'm sh-sh-shakin', sh-shakin')
I'm shakin' (I'm sh-sh-shakin', sh-shakin')
I'm shakin' (I'm sh-sh-shakin', sh-shakin')
Oh yeah
Instrumental
When I met you, I was just a kid -- hadn't built up my defenses.
So I gave my heart completely -- Vaseline all over the lenses.
Memories don't go away; I remember every day.
I never ever stop wondering, wondering if you still think of us.
I don't need a photograph 'cause you've never left my mind.
No, you've never left my mind.
I remember feeling like a ship whose captain was too drunk to steer.
And you watched as I was sinking, waving sadly from the pier.
Memories don't go away; I remember every day.
I never ever stop wondering, wondering if you still think of us.
I don't need a photograph 'cause you've never left my mind.
No, you've never left my mind.
It's such a burden to carry 'round the vestiges of dead dreams,
And I don't want to make a wake out of my life.
I just had to let you go...
Everybody's got a secret to hide
Everyone is slipping backwards
I drank the water and I felt alright
I took a pill almost every night
In my mind I was waiting for change
While the world just stayed the same
Everybody's got a secret to hide
Everyone is slipping backwards
I can't remember if I like what I said
I can't remember it went straight to my head
I kept a bottle by the foot of the bed
I put a pillow right on top of my head
But I killed for love
Everybody's got a secret to hide
Everyone is slipping backwards
You say you see it almost every time
A little number counting back to nine
I can't remember if I like what I said
I can't remember it went straight to my head
But I killed for love
Mind waves rolling through, carry me far into the tide
Where all my thoughts are found
Colored haze slowly looms, piercing through like sulfur fumes
While I'm just contemplating sounds
Distant looks from your face, take me to another place and time
Where we were never found
Night drains just to wake in the end, it's always fake
And all your thoughts been left to drown
I'm bouncing off the walls again, whoa oh
And I'm looking like a fool again whoa oh
I threw away my reputation
One more song for the radio station
I'm bouncing off the walls again, whoa oh
And I'm looking like a fool again, whoa oh
Waking up on the bathroom floor
Pull myself back together just to fall once more
And my heart's beating out of my chest, whoa oh
And this town is still making me sick, whoa oh
And every penny from my last paycheck
I've blown it on you
I'm bouncing off the walls again, whoa oh
And I'm looking like a fool again, whoa oh
So go ahead and take a picture
And hang it up so you can tear me down
I don't care, whoa oh oh oh
'Cause I'm still, here whoa oh oh oh
And I've got nothing left to lose
With all the years I've wasted on you
Go! Go! Go!
Mommy and Daddy's got the best cocaine
Ritalin's never gonna feel the same
Twenty-four hours on an empty brain
I got my finger on the trigger and you're in my way
I'm bouncing off the walls again, whoa oh
And I'm looking like a fool again, whoa oh
I threw away my reputation
One more song for the radio nation
I'm bouncing off the walls again, whoa oh
And I'm looking like a fool again, whoa oh
I'm bouncing off the walls again, whoa oh
And I'm looking like a fool again
I'm bouncing off the walls again
Don't come up to me and say you like it
It's better if you say you hate it, that's the truth exactly
When we go out dancing I don't want to be bothered
I just want to be bothered with real love
So I heard it's no good to run
But it feels so much better now that it's done
And tonight I have to leave it
Yes, tonight I have to leave it
So I've heard you know how to write it
Does it mean you're good at putting things on paper?
Rumors say that you're very sorry
Oh no, you're not sorry, no you're not
So I heard it's no good to run
But it feels so much better now that it's done
And tonight I have to leave it
Yes, tonight I have to leave it
And tonight I have to leave it
And tonight I have to...
And tonight I have to leave it!
Give love, give love
Why won't you give love?
Give love
Why don't you give love?
Give love, give love
Why won't you give love?
Give love, give love!
Yes, tonight I have to...
Tonight I have to leave it
Come on, break it up
It's gone on long enough
What has it changed for you?
What has it changed for you?
The tubes tag along
The radar's got it wrong
What hasn't changed for you
What hasn't changed for you
Can you wait for the sidewalk?
Waiting for you
Can you wait for the sidewalk?
Can it wait for you?
Can you wait for the sidewalk?
Can it wait for you?
Can you wait for the sidewalk?
Can it wait for you?
Come on, break it up
It's gone on long enough
What has it changed for you?
What has it changed for you?
The tubes tag along
The radar's got it wrong
What hasn't changed for you
What hasn't changed for you
Can you wait for the sidewalk?
Waiting for you
Can you wait for the sidewalk?
Can it wait for you?
Can you wait for the sidewalk?
Can it wait for you?
Can you wait for the sidewalk?
Can it wait for you?
If I retreat
Words, wars, and symphonies
Make room we're taking over here
And you're the galentine
Cold and alone, it suits you well
You won't find me perching here again
May your feet serve you well,
And the rest be sent to hell
Where they always have belonged
Cold hearts brew colder songs
Fate will play us out
With a song of pure romance
So stomp your feet and clap your hands...
Let's kill tonight!
Kill tonight!
Show them all you're not the ordinary type
Let's kill tonight!
Kill tonight!
Show them all you're not the ordinary type
Let's kill tonight!
May your feet serve you well,
And the rest be sent to hell
Where they always have belonged
Cold hearts brew colder songs
Fate will play us out
With a song of pure romance
Stomp your feet and clap your hands...
Let's kill tonight!
Kill tonight!
Show them all you're not the ordinary type
Let's kill tonight!
Kill tonight!
Show them all you're not the ordinary type
Let's kill tonight!
Kill tonight!
Show them all you're not the ordinary type
Let's kill tonight!
Kill tonight!
Show them all you're not the ordinary type
Let's kill tonight!
(Whoa...)
Let's take this back two thousand five
Drinks are pouring, girls so fine
So many dimes, got dollars signs
And there she goes right on the spot
Got a taste so sweet I swear this beat
Will make you wanna drop
She wears a new dress everyday
No, she won't stop making the crowd scream
I can't hear anything, but hey, hey
It's Miss L.A. again, again
Chelsea, Chelsea, tell me you love me
Chelsea, Chelsea, are you feeling me now?
Chelsea, Chelsea, I think it's 'bout time
We get down, get down, I want more
I wrote her a song
Not Delilah, not Kelsey
Had 'em both in my palm
But I dropped them for Chelsea
Hey, hey, what'd you say
You've been looking good today
Let's go around town
I'll tell the girls that I'm taken
Chelsea, Chelsea, tell me you love me
Chelsea, Chelsea, are you feeling me now?
Chelsea, Chelsea, I think it's 'bout time
We get down, get down
There ain't no stopping us now
Get down, get down, I want more
And if it's worth your time, I've got ten digits
I'd like you to find
But no, I won't get that call
You've got so much to give
I've got nothing at all
Chelsea, Chelsea, tell me you love me
Chelsea, Chelsea, are you feeling me now?
Chelsea, Chelsea, I think it's 'bout time
We get down, get down
There ain't no stopping us now
Get down, get down, I want more
Chelsea, Chelsea, tell me you love me
Chelsea, Chelsea, are you feeling me now?
Chelsea, Chelsea, I think it's 'bout time
We get down, get down
There ain't no stopping us now
Chelsea, Chelsea, tell me you love me
Chelsea, Chelsea, are you feeling me now?
Chelsea, Chelsea, I think it's 'bout time
We get down, get down
There ain't no stopping us now
Get down, get down, I want more
Andy would bicycle across town 
In the rain to bring you candy 
And John would buy the gown 
For you to wear to the prom 
With Tom the astronomer, who'd name a star for you
But I'm the luckiest guy 
On the Lower East Side 
'Cause I've got wheels 
And you want to go for a ride
Harry is the one I think you'll marry 
But it's Chris that you kissed after school
Well, I'm a fool, there's no doubt 
But when the sun comes out 
And only when the sun comes out
I'm the luckiest guy 
On the Lower East Side 
'Cause I've got wheels 
And you want to go for a ride
The day is beautiful and so are you 
My car is ugly but then I'm ugly too
I know you'd never give me a second glance
But when the weather's nice all the other guys don't stand a chance 
I know Professor Blumen makes you feel like a woman 
But when the wind is in your hair you laugh like a little girl 
So you share secrets with Lou, but we've got secrets too 
Well, one: I only keep this heap for you 
'Cause I'm the ugliest guy 
On the Lower East Side 
But I've got wheels 
And you want to go for a ride
Want to go for a ride?
Want to go for a ride?
Want to go for a ride?
Do you believe in magic in a young girl's heart
How the music can free her whenever it starts?
And it's magic if the music is groovy
It makes you feel happy like an old-time movie
I'll tell you about the magic, and it'll free your soul
But it's like trying to tell a stranger 'bout-a rock and roll
If you believe in magic, don't bother to choose
If it's jug band music or rhythm and blues
Just go and listen, and it'll start with a smile
That won't wipe off your face no matter how hard you try
Your feet start tapping, and you can't seem to find
How you got there, so just blow your mind
If you believe in magic, come along with me
We'll dance until morning till there's just you and me
And maybe, if the music is right
I'll meet you tomorrow, sort of late at night
And we'll go dancing, baby, then you'll see
How the magic's in the music and the music's in me
Yeah
Do you believe in magic?
Yeah
Believe in the magic of the young girl's soul
Believe in the magic of-a rock and roll
Believe in the magic that can set you free
Ohh, talking 'bout the magic
(Do you believe like I believe?) Do you believe in magic?
(Do you believe like I believe?) Do you believe, believer?
(Do you believe like I believe?) Do you believe in magic?
(Do you believe like I believe?) Do you believe in magic?
Have you ever wondered about our old
Nu-metal friends and what became of them?
Turns out I saw them a couple of days ago
They were laughing and drinking and smoking and singing
C'mon, can you count all the notches in your belt?
I'd rather not, let's just say I'm starving myself
Baby, put your name down on a piece of paper
I don?�t want no savior baby, I just wanna have a good time
Oh, oh
At least I?�m not as sad as I used to be
And they said, "Hey Nate, yeah, it?�s been a while,
Are you gonna sing?"
And I began to smile and I said
"You should?�ve seen me a couple of years ago,
I was laughing and drinking and smoking and singing."
C'mon can you count all the loves that didn?�t last?
It?�s such a gas when you bring up the past
Baby, put your name down on a piece of paper
I don?�t want no savior baby, I just wanna get it out
Oh oh, oh
At least I?�m not as sad as I used to be
Oh oh, oh
At least I?�m not as sad as I used to be
At least I?�m not as sad as I used to be
Just get it out
Doo doo doo
Wooh ooh
At least I?�m not as sad as I used to be
And they said we would?�ve seen you two years ago
Had you stuck around or come out to a show
But youth?�s taken over by rock and roll
While we were laughing and drinking and smoking and singing
So I left, that is it
That?�s my life, nothing is sacred
I don?�t keep friends, I keep acquainted
I?�m not a prophet but I?�m here to profit
That?�s all, I?�m gone!
That?�s my life, nothing is sacred
I don?�t fall in love, I just fake it
I don?�t fall in love, I don?�t fall in love
You're everywhere and nowhere, baby
That's where you're at
Going down a bumpy hillside
In your hippy hat
Flying across the country
And getting fat
Saying everything is groovy
When your tyres are flat
And its hi - ho silver lining
And away you go now baby
I see your sun is shining
But I won't make a fuss
Though it's obvious
Flies are in your pea soup baby
They're waving at me
Anything you want is yours now
Only nothing's for free
Lies are gonna get you some day
Just wait and see
So open up your beach umbrella
While you're watching TV
And its hi - ho silver lining
And away you go now baby
I see your sun is shining
But I won't make a fuss
Though it's obvious
And its hi - ho silver lining
And away you go now baby
I see your sun is shining
But I won't make a fuss
Though it's obvious
I wish that I could swim and sleep like a shark does
I'd fall to the bottom and I'd hide 'til the end of time
In that sweet cool darkness
Asleep and constantly floating away
I wish that I could break and bend like the world does
I'd fall to the bottom and I'd chase all my dreams away
And I'd let you crush me
My dreams would be constantly wilting away
I wish that I could swim and sleep like a shark does
I'd fall to the bottom and I'd hide 'til the end of time
In that sweet cool darkness
Asleep and constantly floating away
And the world is made of energy

How am I doin'?
You're doin' fine
I'm beginnin' to see a, er, point of light on the horizon
It's, er, gettin' larger
Erm, I'm gettin' some pretty good oscillations
Oh it's, it's, it's comin' quicker now

Any second now.

Beautiful
Feel like a million dollars
You can see that you're being surrounded from every direction
Love was just something you found to add to your collection
It used to seem we were number one, but now it sounds so far away
I had a dream we were running from some blazing arrows yesterday
You said fight fire with fire, fire with fire, fire with fire
Through desire, desi- sire, desire, through your desire
Now the city blocks out the sun that you know is rising
You can show me the work that you've done, your fears have been disguising,
Is it just me or is everyone, hiding out between the lights
Where will we be when we've come undone? Just a simple meeting of the minds
Singing we'll fight fire with fire, fire with fire, fire with fire
Through desire, desi- sire, desire, through your desire
We'll fight fire with fire, fire with fire, fire with fire
Your desire, desi- sire, desire, through your desire
Underneath your stars
There's a million lies burning brightly just like fireflies
It's cold and heaven surround you from every direction
Cause there's someone behind every hand that you've made a connection
And now we're free to be number one, the morning isn't far away
I had a dream we were holding on and tomorrow has become today, become today
And now we're free to be number one, the morning isn't far away
We've got a reason to keep holding on, tomorrow has become today
And we'll fight with fire, fire with fire, fire with fire
Through desire, desi- sire, desire, through your desire
We'll fight fire with fire, fire with fire, fire with fire
Your desire, desi- sire, desire, through your desire
Well I know when you're around 'cause I know the sound
I know the sound, of your heart
Well I know when you're around 'cause I know the sound
I know the sound, of your heart
I can't believe I forgot your name
Oh baby won't you cum again?
She said "I got a problem with your shoes and your tunes
But I might move in" and
"I thought you were straight, now I'm wondering"
You're so conceited
I said "I love you"
What does it matter if I lie to you?
I don't regret it but I'm glad that we're through
So don't you tell me that you 'just don't get it'
'Cause I know you do.
Well I know when you're around 'cause I know the sound
I know the sound, of your heart
Well I know when you're around 'cause I know the sound
I know the sound, of your heart
It's not about reciprocation it's just all about me
A sycophantic, prophetic, Socratic junkie wannabe
There's so much skin to see
A simple Epicurean Philosophy
And you say I'm such a cliche,
I can't see the difference in it either way.
And we left things to protect my mental health
But you call me when you're bored and you're playing with yourself
You're so conceited
If I said "I love you"
What does it matter if I lie to you?
I don't regret it but I'm glad that we're through
So don't you tell me that you 'just don't get it'
'Cause I know you do.
Well I know when you're around 'cause I know the sound
I know the sound, of your heart
Well I know when you're around 'cause I know the sound
I know the sound, of your heart
Well I know when you're around 'cause I know the sound
I know the sound, of your heart
Well I know when you're around 'cause I know the sound
I know the sound, of your heart
Well I know when you're around 'cause I know the sound
I know the sound, of your heart
Well I know when you're around 'cause I know the sound
I know the sound, of your heart
Well I know when you're around 'cause I know the sound
I know the sound, of your heart
Well I know when you're around 'cause I know the sound
I know the sound, of your heart
You don't wanna be
I don't wanna see
Baby get your feet on the floor
Shut the door, count to four
There's ice
(On your shoulders)
I don't wanna fall face down in the flood
Of the tears from the years that we loved and we messed up
(Don't mess this up)
Let's get older
Remember the foggy window?
Remember lightning and wet clothes?
Remember the house we used to live in:
The cemetery? The cemetery?
There's a shadow on the wall and it's nine feet tall
And our hearts won't sink 'cause it's obviously nothing at all
And in a roundabout way we can disappear towards the coast
The most I have to say isn't really that revealing at all
Everyone you forgot
Everything you could need
Everybody's gonna make it to the cemetery
There's a Fab, there's a Yick
There's a Jenny, there's a Karen
There's a Paul, there's a Jack
There's a Denny
Everyone you forgot
Everything that you need
Everybody gonna make it to the cemetery
There's a Ross, there's a Neil
There's a Lenny, there's an Aaron
There's a Saul, there's a Chip
There's a Benny
Oh whoa whoa whoa, way oh, way oh
Oh whoa whoa whoa, way oh, way oh
Oh whoa whoa whoa, way oh, way oh
Do you remember?
Oh whoa whoa whoa, way oh, way oh
Oh whoa whoa whoa, way oh, way oh
Oh whoa whoa whoa, way oh, way oh
Do you remember?
Remember the foggy window?
Remember lightning and wet clothes?
Remember the house we used to live in:
The cemetery? The cemetery?
There's a shadow on the wall and it's nine feet tall
And our hearts won't sink 'cause it's obviously nothing at all
And in a roundabout way we can disappear towards the coast
The most I have to say isn't really that revealing at all
I can see clearly now, the rain has gone
I can see all obstacles in my way
Gone are the dark clouds that had me blind
It's gonna be a bright, bright sun-shining day
It's gonna be a bright, bright sun-shining day
I think I can make it now, the pain has gone
All of the bad feelings have disappeared
Here is that rainbow I've been praying for
It's gonna be a bright, bright sun-shining day
Look all around, there's nothing but blue sky
Look straight ahead, nothing but blue sky
I can see clearly now, the rain has gone
I can see all obstacles in my way
Gone're the dark clouds that had me blind
It's gonna be a bright, bright sun-shining day
It's gonna be a bright, bright sun-shining day
Gonna be a bright, bright sun-shining  day
Gonna be a bright, bright, bright sun-shining day
Would it take a bakers dozen to get my point to you?
Would it take a half a pound to roll a joint for you?
Would it take some hailing Mary's so full of grace to get my sound to you?
Will you help me break it down and get on through?
Now to the other side
Its easy if you only try, try, try, try
Well don't lie down on the job, oh yeah
Because once we hit the top there's no stopping us, no
Ain't no stopping us
Should I address all my letters to the well to be?
Should I say return to sender is just a well be done?
Should I better not take it so personally if all the good loving is never received?
Baby if it was me well I wouldn't think twice
No not I, I, I, I, I, I
Its easy if you only try, try, try, try
Well don't lie down on the job or worse
Because once we hit the top there's no stopping us, No
There's no stopping us
There's no stopping us, no
No stopping us
Ooh, I will drive a thousand miles or I'll meet you at the station
If only you would take a vacation from this thing you have created
I promise to make it worth your while
(You know, you know that I'll try)
So c'mon try try. Baby baby won't you try
It's easy if you do not run
Well I promise you you'll have your fun fun
Because once we hit the top we've just begun
Ooh, there's no stopping us
There's no stopping us yeah,
There's no stopping us.

Sweat?
Oh!
As you brush your shoes, stand before the mirror
And you comb your hair, grab your coat and hat
And you walk wet streets, tryin' to remember
All the wild night breezes in your mem'ry ever
And everything looks so complete
When you're walkin' out on the street
And the wind catches your feet
Sends you flyin', cryin'
Ooh-woo-wee, wild night is calling
Ooh-ooh-wee, wild night is calling
And all the girls walk by, dressed up for each other
And the boys do the boogie-woogie on the corner of the street
And the people passin' by stare in wild wonder
And the inside jukebox roars out just like thunder
And everything looks so complete
When you're walkin' out on the street
And the wind catches your feet
Sends you flyin', cryin'
Ooh-woo-wee, wild night is calling
Ooh-ooh-wee, wild night is calling
The wild night is calling
The wild night is calling
Come on out and dance
Whoa, come on out and make romance
Come on out and dance
Come on out, make romance
Thinking about the time we share
And how I wasn't there
It hurt me
These people overwork me
Then I heard maybe soon you'll leave
Excuse me lord if you have tricks up your sleeve
I'm not ready to be bereaved
I know I'm always asking for something
Or another
But this time, it's just time
'Cause I love her
But baby if he don't change his mind
Or fate or time
Yo I want to leave you with this line
It goes while you're here
I wanna tell you something
It's that I love you girl
Yeah, and I wish we could run to the sun
And never come back
Yeah
Yesterday I tied two rocks together
That symbolize our lives
And threw them in the ocean
Now they're on the ocean floor coastin'
Till they stop rollin' so far
That no sonar would list them
To the point that no one would even believe that we existed
I know that may sound twisted
But my neglect is killin' me
I feel so guilty
Please have faith in if you feel me
Though you're probably feelin' blue
And you'll do what you must do
I hope you know
I'd hand the skies to you
I'm so embarrassed for mankind
They have the nerve to let their weapon shine
They're so stupid
Do they not know you're about to fly high
Away
With the wings that god will give you someday
I'm not jealous
I just can't take it
S.o.s. to your ears, the only thing I ever feared was this day
And having to say
Coming home again
To see a girl that's prettier than a diamond shining in the sun
Oh what fun!
I wonder if she's been naked in her room since I've been gone
I wonder if she's said to them as she said to me before
However much you use me baby, come on use me more
However much you use me baby, come on use me more
Getting off the train
To see a girl that's sweeter than an apple picked from Adam's tree
Oh glory be!
And I wonder if she's been pressed against an unfamiliar wall
And said to all those men as she said to me before
However much you want me, I swear I'll make you want me more
However much you want me, I swear I'll make you want me more and more and more and more
Arriving at the door
Just to be told that the girl I'm missing has been in London for a while
No more northern skies for her
They say she's left a letter up the stairs for everyone
It's pinned against her bedroom door for all the world to see and she says
However much I loved you, you will always love me more
However much I loved you, you will always love me more
And I guess it's true
However much she loves me I will always love her more
I'll love you more and more, I'll love you more
I'll love you more and more, I'll love you more
I'll love you more and more, I'll love you more
I'll love you more and more, I'll love you more and more and more...
I have returned to the Northern skies
Where the summer had not touhed the clouds that pass above
Oh and I have returned to the somber greens
Of the days too early to come and too early to stay
And I have left a million stars
And I know shine so lightly, so clearly blue
And I have left the warmth of the sun
And a million adventures not yet begun
The great sense of passing through
The great sense of passing through
The great sense of passing through
Oh for once there was beauty here for me
Under these white Northern skies
And I felt the green was blacker and the blue was darker still
My roots are lying deeper than I ever think they will again
Heartache and poetry
Under these Northern skies
The great sense of passing through
The great sense of passing through
The great sense of passing through
Slow down, lie down,
Remember it's just you and me
Don't sell out, bow out,
Remember how this used to be
I just want you closer is that all right,
Baby let's get closer tonight
Grant my last request and just let me hold you
Don't shrug your shoulders, lay down beside me
Sure I can accept that we're going nowhere
But one last time let's go there, lay down beside me
And I've found, that I'm bound,
To wander down that one-way road
And I realized all about your lies,
But I'm no wiser than the fool that I was before
I just want you closer is that all right,
Baby let's get closer tonight
Grant my last request and just let me hold you
Don't shrug your shoulders, lay down beside me
Sure I can accept that we're going nowhere
But one last time let's go there, lay down beside me
Baby, baby, baby,
Tell me how can, how can this be wrong?
Grant my last request and just let me hold you
Don't shrug your shoulders, lay down beside me
Sure I can accept that we're going nowhere
But one last time let's go there, lay down beside me
One last time let's go there, lay down beside me
Down on Bowery they lose their
Ball-eyes and their lip-mouths in the night
And stumbling through the street they say
"Sir, do you got a light?"
And if you do then you're my friend
And if you don't then you're my foe
And if you are a deity of any sort
Then please don't go
Ne me quitte pas mon cher
Ne me quitte pas
Ah-ah-ah, ne me quitte pas mon cher
Ne me quitte pas
Down on Lexington they're wearing
New shoes stuck to aging feet
And close their eyes and open
And not recognize the aging street
And think about how things were right
When they were young and veins were tight
And if you are the ghost of Christmas past
Then won't you stay the night
Ne me quitte pas mon cher
Ne me quitte pas
Ah-ah-ah, ne me quitte pas mon cher
Ne me quitte pas
Oo-oo-oo, ne me quitte pas mon cher
Ne me quitte pas
Ah-ah-ah, ne me quitte pas mon cher
Ne me quitte pas
Down in Bronxy Bronx the kids go
Sledding down snow covered slopes
And frozen noses, frozen toes
The frozen city starts to glow
And yes they know that it'll melt
And yes they know New York will thaw
But if you're a friend of any sort
Then play along and catch a cold
Ne me quitte pas mon cher
Ne me quitte pas
Ah-ah-ah, ne me quitte pas mon cher
Ne me quitte pas
Oo-oo-oo, ne me quitte pas mon cher
Ne me quitte pas
Ah-ah-ah, ne me quitte pas mon cher
Ne me quitte pas
I love Paris in the rain
I love Paris in the rain
I love, I love, in the rain, oh
I love Paris in the rain
I love Paris in the rain
I love, I love, in the rain, oh
I love, I love, in the rain, oh
I love, I love, in the rain, oh
I love, I love, in the rain, oh, oh, oh
Early in the mornin' risin' to the street
Light me up that cigarette and I'll strap shoes on my feet
Got to find the reason, the reason things went wrong
Got to find the reason why my money's all gone
I got a dalmatian, I can still get high
I can play the guitar like a motherfuckin' riot
Well life is too short so love the one you got
'Cause you might get run over and you might get shot
Never had a battle with my bulletproof vest
Never start static gots to get it off my chest
Take a small example... a tip from me
Take all of your money give it off to charity-ty-ty-ty
Love's what I got, it's within my reach
The SUBLIME style still straight from Long Beach
It comes back to you your gonna get what you deserve
Try and test that, you' re bound to get served
Love's what I got don't start a riot
You feel it when the dance gets hot, hot
Lovin' is what I got, I said remember that
Lovin' is what I got, I said remember that
Well I don't cry when my dog runs away
I don't get angry at the bills I have to pay
I don't get angry when my mom smokes pot
Hits the bottle and goes right to the rocks
Fuck it, fight it, it's all the same
Livin' with louie dogs the only way to stay sane
Let the lovin', let the lovin' come back to me...
Lovin' is what I got, I said remember that
Lovin' is what I got, I said remember that
Lovin' is what I got, I said remember that
Lovin' is what I got, I said remember that
Lovin' is what I got, I said remember that
Lovin' is what I got, I said remember that
Lovin' is what I got, I said remember that
Lovin' is what I got, I said remember that
I got, I got, I got, I got...

It makes my life complete
'Cause I know, I know

All the things I wanna say
Come on baby, let me tell you
All the things I wanna say, and

Theologians
They don't know nothing
About my soul
About my soul
I'm an ocean
An abyss in motion
Slow motion
Slow motion
Inlitterati lumen fidei
God is with us everyday
That illiterate light
Is with us every night
Theologians
Oh, they don't know nothing
About my soul
Oh, they don't know
They fill my heart with little things
And my life with change
Oh, in so many ways
I find more missing every day
Theologians
I'm going away
Where you will look for me
Where I'm going you cannot come
No one's ever gonna take my life from me
I lay it down
A ghost is born
A ghost is born
A ghost is born
I'm an ocean
All emotion
I'm a cherry ghost
Cherry ghost
Hey, I'm a cherry ghost
A cherry ghost
Yeah, there's blood on the wall but I'm happy
Yeah, there's blood on the wall but I'm happy
I'm happy, I'm happy, I'm happy, I'm happy
Yeah, my name's on the wall but I'm happy
Yeah, my name's on the wall but I'm happy
I'm happy, I'm happy, I'm happy, I'm happy
You, you make me happy, happy, happy, happy
Yeah, your name's on the wall but you're happy
Yeah, your name's on the wall but you're happy
You're happy, you're happy, you're happy, you're happy
When I wake you up you're so cranky
When I wake you up you're so cranky
But you're happy, you're happy, you're happy, you're happy
You, you make me happy, happy, happy, happy
You, you make me happy, happy, happy, happy
And even when you're gone I listen to my favorite songs
And think about you all night long 'cause you're the one for me
You're the one for me, you make me so very happy
You make me happy, you make me happy
You make me happy, you make me happy, no
The renegade feelin' satisfied
You blinked and closed your eyes
You like the feeling of Saturday
You love the danger in the night
The restless corpse is collapsing wind
The breath is daffodil
What won't be coming is lapsing
Into the universal fill
Or maybe just no intention
Or maybe just no intention
When I am full with endeavor
Nothing can stop gestalt
The freshness of my reality
Makes me feel tingly and hot
When you wake up shouting "Idea!"
Is that a punishment?
You represent saying "I'm real!"
But is that what you meant?
Maybe you meant no intention
Maybe you meant no intention
No intention
No intention
Instrumental
Trying to pick up the pace
Trying to make it so I never see your face again
Trying to throw this away
Want to make sure that you never waste my time again
How does it feel?
Oh how does it feel to be you right now, dear?
You brought this upon
So pick up your pace and go away from here
Please just let me go now.
Please just let me go
Would you please just let me go now?
Please just let me go
I'm going to get you
I'm going to get you
I'm going to get you out of my head - get out
I'm going to get you.
I'm going to get you.
I've gotta get you out of my head - get out.
Never said we'd be friends,
Trying to keep myself away from you,
'Cause you're bad, bad news.
With you gone, I'm alive,
Makes me feel like I took happy pills,
And time stands still.
How does it feel?
Oh how does it feel to be the one shut out?
You broke all the rules.
I won't be a fool for you no more my dear.
Please just let me go now.
Please just let me go.
Would you please just let me go now?
Please just let me go.
I'm going to get you.
I'm going to get you.
I'm going to get you out of my head - get out.
I'm going to get you.
I'm going to get you.
I've gotta get you out of my head - get out.
She sat right down on the sofa
I said, "Where have you been? I've been waiting for you."
'Cause last night I had something so good
These days get so long and I got nothing to do
I been hanginaround this town on the corner
I been bummin' around this old town so long
I been hanginaround this town on the corner
I been bummin' around this old town for way too long
We spend all day getting sober
Just hiding from daylight, watching TV
We just look a lot better in the blue light
Well, you know I gotta get out
But I'm stuck so tight weighed by the chains that keep me
Hanginaround this town on the corner
I been bummin' around this old town too long
I been hanginaround this town on the corner
I been bummin' around this old town for way too long
Well everybody twist
He don't understand
I'm just tryin' to scurry up a little
This girl listens to the band play
She says, "Where have you been? I've been lying right here on the floor."
Well, I got all this time to be waiting for what is mine
To be hating what I am
After the light has faded
Hanginaround this town on the corner
I been bummin' around this old town so long
I been hanginaround this town on the corner
I been bummin' around this old town for way too, way
I been hanginaround this town on the corner
I been bummin' around this old town for way long
I been hanginaround this town on the corner
I been bummin' around this old town for way
Way, way, way, way too long
Way, way, way, way too long
Way, way, way, way too long
Way, way, way, way too long
Way, way, way, way too long
Way, way, way, way too long
Way, way, way, way too long
We'd hit the bottom
I thought it was my fault
And in a way I guess it was
I'm just now finding out
What it was all about
We'd moved to the West Coast
Away from everyone
She never told me that you called
Back when I was still
I was still in love
Till I opened my eyes and walked out the door
And the clouds came tumbling down
And it's bye-bye, goodbye I tried
And I twisted it wrong just to make it right
Had to leave myself behind
And I've been flying high all night
So come pick me up
I've landed
The daily dramas (Aaah)
She made from nothing (Aaah)
So nothing ever made it right (Aaah)
She liked to push me (Aaah)
And talk me back down till I believed I was the crazy one (Aaah)
And in a way
I guess I was
But I opened my eyes and walked out the door
And the clouds came tumbling down
And it's bye-bye, goodbye I tried
Dragging the sea of a trouble mind
Had to leave myself behind
Singing bye-bye, goodbye I tried
If you wrote me off
I'd understand it
'Cause I've been on
Some other planet
So come pick me up
I've landed
And you will be so
Happy to know
I've come alone
It's over
And I'll open my eyes and walk out the door (Aaah)
And the clouds came tumbling down (Aaah)
And it's bye-bye, goodbye I tried (Aaah)
Down comes the reign of the telephone czar (Aaah)
It's okay to call (Aaah)
And I will answer for myself (Aaah)
Come pick me up
Come pick me up (Bada bada)
Ba ba ba, ba ba ba
I've landed
I was picked up and then dropped off in a culture counter-clockwise turned around
Dug a hole in southern Carolina, took me straight to China safe and sound
Donated my map to the lost and found
While working for a common 'cause I only got a kamikaze state of mind
This self-defeating meeting of the minds is eating what was once so hard to find
But right then the clouds parted in the sky
The horizon took us all a little by surprise
By surprise
Watch the sky
(And as the howling winds subsided, the locals ran out, all waving their hands and singing)
Welcome to the island of the honest man
Do what you want, there is no need to impress us
Welcome to the island of the honest man
We don't believe in what the big people tell us
Wait here, stay here
I was picked up and then dropped off in a culture counter-clockwise turned around
Rolled a pair of dice in Paris that got me to paradise all safe and sound
Stole my temper back from the lost and found
No longer needed to be seated on a sinking ship just waiting there to drown
There to drown
Jump off now
(And as they lead us to their village, a thousand voices all started to sing out loud)
Welcome to the island of the honest man
Do what you want, there is no need to impress us
Welcome to the island of the honest man
We don't believe in what the big people tell us
Wait here, stay here
From the sunrise up above to the sunset below, they all sing
Welcome in, welcome back, well come on let's go
And all the people on the island they already know why they sing
Welcome in, welcome back, well come on let's go
From the sunrise up above to the sunset below, they all sing
Welcome in, welcome back, well come on let's go
And all the people on the island they all want to show why they sing,
Why they sing, why they sing, why they're singing
Welcome to the island of the honest man
Do what you want, there is no need to impress us
Welcome to the island of the honest man
We don't believe in what the big people tell us
Welcome to the island of the honest man
This is the island of the honest man
Welcome to the island of the honest man
This is the island of the honest man
Wait here, stay here
I was picked up and then dropped off in a culture counter-clockwise turned around
When you got that spiderbite on your hand
I thought we would have to break up the band
To lose your arm would surely upset your brain
The poison then could reach your heart from a vein
I was glad that it didn't destroy you
How sad that would be
'Cause if it destroyed you
It would destroy me
When you had that accident in your car
That whole thing just really seemed too bizarre
Dodging holes and telephone poles through the dash
A million to one that you could survive such a crash
I was glad that it didn't destroy you
How sad that would be
'Cause if it destroyed you
It would destroy me
When you fell in love it was so sweet
So devoted, completely swept off your feet
Love is the greatest thing our heart can know
But the hole that it leaves in its absence can make you feel so low
I was glad that it didn't destroy you
How sad that would be
'Cause if it destroyed you
It would destroy me
Sing about that, oh, love is a brittle madness
I sing about it in all my sadness 
Not falsified to say that I found god, so 
Inevitably, well it still exists, pale and fine
I can't dismiss and I won't resist 
And if I die well at least I tried 
And we just lay awake in lust
And rust in the rain 
And ponder on everything we say we trust 
Well it happened again
I listened in through hallways and thin doors 
Where the rivers unwind, rust and in the rain endure
The rust and the rain so thin, well I'm in like Flynn again 
I win
So go on and place your order now 
'Cause some other time is right around the clock 
You can stand in line
Well it finally begins, oh just around the block
You can have your pick if your stomach is sick whether you eat or not 
And it is the one thing I'd almost forgot 
Oh, see you and me, we lay awake in lust and rust in the rain 
And ponder on everything we say we trust 
Well it happened again
I listened in through hallways and thin doors 
Where the rivers unwind, the rivers unwind so easy 
Oh these are the comforts that be 
You see, well I'm feeling lucky 
Oh well, maybe that's just me 
Will you be so proud of me 
Oh well, if you could only see 
How we're gonna grow on up to be, ah yes 
We are thick as thieves 
Sing about that, oh love is a brittle madness
I sing about it in all my sadness 
Not falsified to say that I found god, so 
Inevitably, well it still exists, so pale and fine 
I can't dismiss and I won't resist 
And if I die well at least I tried 
And we just lay awake in lust and rust in the rain 
And ponder on everything we say we trust 
Well it happened again
I listened in through hallways and thin doors 
Where the rivers unwind, rust and the rain endure 
The rust and the rain endure
I'm sure, because I'm in so far to know measure of love ain't lost
Love will never ever be
In so far to know the measure of love ain't lost
Love will never ever be 
In so far to know the measure of love ain't lost
Love will never ever be lost on me, oh not tonight
Say love will never ever be lost on me
Love ... will ... never ever be lost on me
Love ... will not be
Love ... will never be lost on me
Love ... will ... not ... be ... lost ... on ... me
High rise, veins of the avenue
Bright eyes and subtle variations of blue
Everywhere is balanced there like a rainbow above you
Street lights glisten on the boulevard
And cold nights make staying alert so hard
For heaven's sake, keep me awake so I won't be caught off guard
Clearly I am a passerby but I'll find a place to stay
Dear pacific day, won't you take me away?
Small town hearts of the New Year
Brought down by gravity, crystal clear
City fog and brave dialog converge on the frontier
Make haste, I feel your heartbeat
With new taste for speed, out on the street
Find a road to a humble abode where both of our routes meet
The silver sound is all around and the colors fall like snow
The feeling of letting go, I guess we'll never know
Cheer up and dry your damp eyes
And tell me when it rains
And I'll blend up that rainbow above you
And shoot it through your veins
'Cause your heart has a lack of color
And we should've known
That we'd grow up sooner or later
'Cause we wasted all our free time alone
Your nerves gather with the altitude
Exhale the stress so you don't come unglued
Somewhere there is a happy affair, a ghost of a good mood
Wide eyed, panic on the getaway
The high tide could take me so far away
VCR's and motorcars unite on the Seventh Day
A popular gauge will measure the rage of the new Post-Modern Age
'Cause somewhere along the line all the decades align
We were the crashing whitecaps
(On the ocean) On the ocean
What a lovely seaside holiday away
A palm tree in Christmas lights
(My emotion) My emotion
Struck a sparkling tone like a xylophone
As we spent the day alone
Cheer up and dry your damp eyes
And tell me when it rains
And I'll blend up that rainbow above you
And shoot it through your veins
'Cause your heart has a lack of color
And we should've known
That we'd grow up sooner or later
'Cause we wasted all our free time alone
(Da da da dah, da da da dah)
You're such a mystery
I just want to stand and stare
Nibble on your ear
And smell the ocean in your hair (Ocean in your hair, ocean in your hair)
I know you damage me
You leave me tangled in a knot (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
But when you reappear
I see Neptunian blues that eyes forgot (Eyes forgot)
Neptunian blues that eyes forgot (Blues that eyes forgot, eyes forgot)
Still, I only feel alive when the VU is flashing
Alarms going off in my head
I want to grab you and just kiss you
Maybe I should sit down
No sense in cashing us now
Yeah, I only feel all right when the VU is flashing
And bombs going off in my head
I want to grab you, want to scream at you, no icing me down
The party's crashing us now
The party's crashing us now
Oh, well, we made love
Like a pair of black wizards
You freed me from the past
You fucked the suburbs out of me (The suburbs out of me)
And all those ugly days
That made us so sick (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
They are just fossils now
We've learned the elevating trick (Elevating trick, elevating trick)
We've learned the elevating trick (Elevating trick, elevating trick)
Still, I only feel all right when the VU is flashing
Alarms going off in my head
I want to grab you and just kiss you
Maybe I should come down
No sense in cashing us now
Still, I only feel alive when the VU is flashing
And bombs going off in my head
I want to grab you, want to scream at you, no icing me down
The party's crashing us now
The party's crashing us now
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, oh-oh
I only feel all right when the VU is flashing
Alarms going off in my head
I want to grab you, want to scream at you, no icing me down
The party's crashing us now
I only feel all right when the VU is flashing
And bombs going off in my head
I want to grab you and just kiss you
Maybe I should come down
No sense in cashing us now
The party's crashing us now

I'm gonna do the Twist (I'm gonna do the Twist)
I'm moved, man, I'm wigged
Oh I'm moved and I'm wigged
I'm crazy - I'm gonna
I'm gonna go crazy
Let's blast off
Alright!
Baby let's blast off
Baby let's blast off
Blast off on success
Blast off on success
Oh you slay me
Oh you slay me baby
Oh you slay me baby
I'm gonna do the Twist
I'm gonna do the Twist
I'm gonna hop like a frog
I'm gonna hop like a frog
I'm gonna go out in the street and do anything I want
Oh shit
In the middle of the night
In the middle of the night I call your name
Oh Yoko, oh Yoko, my love will turn you on
In the middle of the bath
In the middle of the bath I call your name
Oh Yoko, oh Yoko, my love will turn you on
My love will turn you on
In the middle of a shave
In the middle of a shave I call your name
Oh Yoko, oh Yoko, my love will turn you on
In the middle of a dream
In the middle of a dream I call your name
Oh Yoko, oh Yoko, my love will turn you on
My love will turn you on
In the middle of a cloud
In the middle of a cloud I call your name
Oh Yoko, oh Yoko, my love will turn you on
Oh Yoko, oh Yoko, oh Yoko, oh Yoko
Ambling madly all over the town
The call to arms you likened to a whisper
I likened to a radio
You were a brickbat, a Bowery tough, so rough
They culled you from a cartoon
Pulled out of your pantaloons
But you
My brother in arms
I'd rather I'd lose my limbs
Than let you come to harm
But you
My bombazine doll
The bullets may singe your skin
And the mortars may fall
But I
I never felt so much life
Than tonight
Huddled in the trenches
Gazing on the battlefield
Our rifles blaze away
We blaze away, oh
Corporal Bradley of regiment five
In proud array standing by the bathing
Soldiers and the stevedores
We laid on the mattress and tumbled to sleep
Our eyes aligned, swaddled in our civvies
Cradled in our dungarees
But you
My brother in arms
I'd rather I'd lose my limbs
Than let you come to harm
But you
My bombazine doll
The bullets may singe your skin
And the mortars may fall
But I
I never felt so much life
Than tonight
Huddled in the trenches
Gazing on the battlefield
Our rifles blaze away
We blaze away, oh
We blaze away, oh
We blaze away, oh
Elevator buttons and morning air
Strangers' silence makes me wanna take the stairs
If you were here we'd laugh about their vacant stares
But right now, my time is theirs
Seems like there's always someone who disapproves
They'll judge it like they know about me and you
And the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do
The jury's out, but my choice is you
So don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
The stakes are high, the water's rough
But this love is ours
You never know what people have up their sleeves
Ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me
Lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles
But I don't care, 'cause right now you're mine
And you'll say don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
The stakes are high, the water's rough
But this love is ours
And it's not theirs to speculate if it's wrong
And your hands are tough but they are where mine belong
And I'll fight their doubt and give you faith with this song for you
'Cause I love the gap between your teeth
And I love the riddles that you speak
And any snide remarks from my father about your tattoos will be ignored
'Cause my heart is yours
So don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
So don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
But they can't take what's ours
They can't take what's ours
The stakes are high, the waters rough
But this love is ours
When I arrived in my own set of clothes
I was half a world away from my home
And I was hunted by the wolves and I was heckled by the crows
Darlin' do not fear what you don't really know
Alongside my innocence I laid in bed awake
Conflicted in these chains with the impetus of age
But like a phantom she crept across the floor and out the window
Darlin' do not fear what you don't really know
From this place on the mantle my heart was taken down
Scattered in a thousand little pieces on the ground
And out below the streetlamp like an orphan with a halo
Darlin' do not fear what you don't really know
'Cause it won't last - the worries will pass
All your troubles they don't stand a chance
And sometimes it takes more than a lifetime to know
Darlin' do not fear what you don't really know
The confidence is full with your faith etched in stone
And I let clean comfort you from the wild unknown
So bury your burning hatred like a hatchet in snow
Darlin' do not fear what you don't really know
If you have a broken heart or a battered soul
Find something to hold on to or to let go
To help you through the hard nights like a flask filled with hope
Darlin' do not fear what you don't really know
'Cause it won't last - your worries will pass
All your troubles they don't stand a chance
And it always hurts the worst when it's the ones we love the most
Darlin' do not fear what you don't really know
Sometimes your path is marked in the sky
Sometimes you're forced to fit in between the lines
Sometimes all that you can do is say no
Darlin' do not fear what you don't really know
I said, when I arrived in my own set of clothes
I was half a world away from my home
And I was hunted by the wolves and I was heckled by the crows
Darlin' do not fear what you don't really know
I said, Darlin' do not fear what you don't really know
We said, Darlin' do not fear
I will confess to you
Because you made me think about the times
You turn the picture on to me and I'll turn over
The picture was a masterpiece of comic timing
But you wouldn't laugh at all
And I wonder what the boy was thinking
The picture was an old collage of something classical
The model with the tragic air
Because without a doubt he'd given up the fight
The ghost of somebody at his side
I will confess to you
Because I didn't think about the message
As I walked down the alleyway it was a Sunday
And all my friends deserted me because you painted me
As the fraud I really was
And if you think you see with just your eyes you're mad
'Cause Lisa learned a lot from putting on a blindfold
When she knew she had been bad
She met another blind kid at a fancy dress
It was the best sex she ever had
I'll send a dress to you
Because it's needing badly taken in
But I was so embarressed that I missed your party
It was me that paid for it eventually
Because you know how much I wanted
To meet your friend the star of stage and local press
The dream of all the bowlie kids that hang around here
And I'm no different from the rest
I'm not too proud to say that I'm okay with
The girl next door who's famous for showing her chest
You're not impressed by me
But it's a funny way for you to tell me
A whisper in a choir stall
The man was talking about you simultaneously
Frankly, I let my heavy eyelids flutter
Because I have been sleeping badly lately
I know you were historical from all the books I've read
But I thought you could be bluffing
And with this chance I've missed I feel remiss
It's days and months before I see you again
Oh, there are rocks
They will always hold in the sea
And erosion can't stop their being
Oh no, currents can defeat them
And I am thankful for the love
These rocks have always given
And although this boat is steady now
One wave can pull me under
And I'll be stranded out at sea
And I will pray that those rocks
Will be there for me
And the sun always shines down on your shoes
Could be a blue blue Christmas for you
'Cause when the sun always shines down on your shoes
Could be a blue blue Christmas for you
I love the way that your hair is always neat
And your skirts fall below your knees
And your love is so pure and so clean
Oh, it comforts me
Oh, it comforts me
Oh, it comforts me
Oh, it comforts me
Oh, the way that you're always surprised
Oh, to find truth in all my lies
'Cause you trust me and ignore my disguise
Oh well, it comforts me
Oh well, it comforts me
Oh well, it comforts me
Oh well, it comforts me
Oh, but there's no need to play with my heart
There's no need to play with my heart
There's no need to play with my heart
There's no need to play with my heart
There's no need to play with my heart
There's no need to play with my heart
There's no need to play with my heart
There's no need to play with my heart
There's no need to play with my heart
There's no need to play with my heart
The footprints over the snow
The fabric over the lonely
C-Covering only
The fables and hands
The rest is out in the cold
Holding the last of the season
F-F-F-Freezin'
Ye-ah
My-my-my heart like a kick drum
My, my heart like a kick drum
My, my heart like a kick drum
My, my love like a voice
We're walkin' into the fields
We're walkin' into the forest
The moon is before us
Up above
We're holdin' hands in the rain
S-Sayin' words like I love you
D-D-Do you love me?
Ye-ah
My-my-my heart like a kick drum
My, my heart like a kick drum
My, my heart like a kick drum
My, my love like a voice
Mother Mary heard us approaching her door
Though we didn't make a sound
There's nothing like finding gold
Within the rocks hard and cold
I'm so surprised to find more
Always surprised to find more
I won't look back anymore
I left the people that do
It's not the chase that I love
It's me following you
My, my heart like a kick drum
My, my heart like a kick drum
My, my heart like a kick drum
My, my love like a voice
My, my heart like a kick drum
I remember us alone
Waiting for the light to go
Don't you feel that hunger
I've got, so many secrets to show
When I saw you on that stage
I shiver with the look you gave
Don't you hear that rhythm
Can you, show me how we can escape
I was biding my time
I was trying to hide
I'll forget what I've done
I will be redefined
It's shaking the sky and I'm following lightning
And I'll recover if you keep me alive
Don't leave me behind, can you see me, I'm shining
And It's you that I've been waiting to find
I'm holding it all tonight
I'm folding it all tonight
You know that you make it shine
It's you that I've been waiting to find
I'm holding it all tonight
I'm folding it all tonight
You know that you make it shine
It's you that I've been waiting to find
Now that we can hear that sound
I know that you can hold me down
You can't pull me under
You can raise everything to the ground
Everything I can arrange
And every part of me you change
Just hold me together
Tell me, you'll always want me to stay
I was biding my time
I was trying to hide
I'll forget what I've done
I will be redefined
It's shaking the sky and I'm following lightning
And I'll recover if you keep me alive
Don't leave me behind, can you see me, I'm shining
And It's you that I've been waiting to find
I wanna be the one you steal
I wanna be the one you shield
I wanna be the one
That your love, that your love can heal
I wanna be the one you steal
I wanna be the one you shield
I wanna be the one
That your love, your love
It's shaking the sky and I'm following lightning
And I'll recover if you keep me alive
Don't leave me behind, can you see me, I'm shining
And It's you that I've been waiting to find
I'm holding it all tonight
I'm folding it all tonight
You know that you make it shine
It's you that I've been waiting to find
I'm holding it all tonight
I'm folding it all tonight
You know that you make it shine
It's you that I've been waiting to find
It's you that I've been waiting to find
It's you that I've been waiting to find
It's you that I've been waiting to find
From the dark end of the street
To the bright side of the road
We'll be lovers once again
On the bright side of the road
Little darlin' come with me
Won't you help me share my load
From the dark end of the street
To the bright side of the road
Into this life we're born
Baby sometimes, sometimes we don't know why
And time seems to go by so fast
In the twinkling of an eye
Let's enjoy it while we can
Won't you help me share my love
From the dark end of the street
To the bright side of the road
From the dark end of the street
To the bright side of the road
We'll be lovers once again
On the bright side of the road
We'll be lovers once again
On the bright side of the road
For so long I trailed you now here I am
But I can't stand with these jellybones
Checked myself into emergency, urgently
Drove up in my bone Camaro thinking only about you
The doctor walked her crew of surgeons to the table where I lay
When I came to, my kneecaps were off and they were soft, I had jellybones
I woke him up, broke the news, after everything was sewn
I said, "Son you've got a full blown case of what is known as jellybones"
Jelly, jelly, jelly, jelly
Jelly, jelly, jelly, jelly
Jelly, jellybones
Jelly, jelly, jelly, jelly
Jelly, jelly, jelly, jelly
Jelly, jellybones
But this is love so we'll survive
This is love so we'll survive
But this is love so we'll survive
This is love so we'll survive
This is love so we'll survive
This is love so we'll survive
This is love so we'll survive
There's a boy with his head
Pressed up to the window
Of a bus heading out of town
In his breath on the glass
He draws with his finger
A map of the roads they go down
Circles of street lights
Are the only signal
That there's people out there in the black
He waves goodbye, to the town he grew up in
He knows that he'll never come back
The night outside is five below
His heart is pumping blood
On his lips a perfect smile
His eyes begin to flood
Because tonight's the kind of night
Where everything could change
Tonight's the kind of night
Where everything could change
The rumble strip clack
And the rattling frame
Beat out a pulse on his head
The engine hums, a humble tune
A melody of rubber and lead
Under lamp light glow
And paradise stars
An infinity of dancing white light
He sees that his debt
Is to experience only
And not to those who'd plan out his life
The night outside is five below
The moon is in the sky
His heart is full of perfect joy
He whispers his goodbye
Because tonight's the kind of night
Where everything could change
Tonight's the kind of night
Where everything could change
And tonight he's not gonna come back home
Oh tonight he's not gonna come back home
Oh tonight he's not gonna come back home
Oh
Oh
Oh tonight's the kind of night
Where everything could change
Tonight's the kind of night
Where everything could change
Tonight's the kind of night
Where everything could change
Tonight's the kind of night
Where everything could change
Has it been a day or a week?
As my eyes begin to close
I am walking in my sleep
Living in a state inbetween
Do the signs begin to show
See the eyes fare in the dark
As they glow
These dreams under my pillow
In the twilight of these white nights
These dreams under my pillow 
In the twilight of these white nights
Of these white nights
Something is about to be born
There's a restlessness in me
Keeps me up until the dawn
There is no silence
I will keep following the sirens
There is no silence
I will keep following the sirens
These dreams under my pillow
In the twilight of these white nights
These dreams under my pillow 
In the twilight of these white nights
Of these white nights
These dreams under my pillow
In the twilight of these white nights
These dreams under my pillow 
In the twilight of these white nights
Of these white nights
Save me
Save me
Save me
Save me
You think I don't laugh oh
Do things I can like so
Why are we losing time?
I don't want to get up oh
Bring me what I need so
Why are we losing time?
It's like I've seen the light
But you have never known
Save me
There's a sword in your side,
That you'll ignore until blood shows,
And later on, when it's gone,
When something's wrong,
The violence grows and it's designed,
To spy and try to poke your eyes,
While laying low.
Beneath the seven different reasons for satellites,
Eleven different reasons for fists in fights,
There's never been a reason for
Shouting when it's quiet,
But no one's ever listening.
Seven different reasons for satellites,

When you need to shout
No one's ever listening
When you need to shout
No one's ever listening
And don't go dragging your name,
Through the mud and the rain,
When it dries I know some dust that
Wants to get in your eyes.
Put a stethoscope on,
You'll notice the beat is gone,
All that's left is hesitations
From your previous life.

In no solid state
You know we can't cop to
The frequency of your inner debate
It was all out of tune
You're entering this town
You saw the weeping clown
You play along to songs written for you
But you're all out of tune
You're all out of tune
See the cars on the 95
Cut through them like a sharpened knife
You go
You're all out of tune
See the cars on the 95
Cut through them like a sharpened knife
You go
You're all out of tune
In no solid state
You know we can't cop to
The frequency of your inner debate
It was all out of tune
You're entering this town
You saw the weeping clown
You play along to songs written for you
But you're all out of tune
You're all out of tune
I feel a cold flush going through my hair
And hey you know what
I don't even care
The time has passed me by
Its gone with the wind
Its only 'cause the sun shined once again
Now the party's on
Everybody's there
And if you don't know anyone
You'll still meet some new friends
That's the way it is
When I have myself a drink
Its only 'cause the sun shines once again
Let the sun shine
Let the sun shine baby
Let it all go
Let it all go baby
Let the sun shine
Let the sun shine baby
Let it all go
Let it all go baby
So turn the lights off
Ain't no one afraid
When the night comes
It'll be just like the day
And without the day
I am glowing from within
Only 'cause the sun shined once again
So play that sweet tune
Play it through the air
And the volume
Blaze it up
Don't you ask me twice
You know I'm gonna bid
Only 'cause the sun shined once again
Let the sun shine
Let the sun shine baby
Let it all go
Let it all go baby
Let the sun shine
Let the sun shine baby
Let it all go
Let it all go baby
I know that the world is gonna smile again
When we go from the darkness into the light
Oh
Let the sun shine
Let the sun shine
Let the sun shine
Let the sun shine baby
Let it all go
Let it all go baby
Let the sun shine
Let the sun shine baby
Let it all go
Let it all go baby (x2)
Let the sun shine yeah eh ey yeah
Only when the goal is unattainable
Do I start to feel like I'm losing myself
And this deep secret that hasn't come out yet
Is buried down deep with the rest
I can't coerce you into this one
Jealousy lay all your spells to bed
I'll choose unloved instead
If only songs were sung to guide the doubtful ones
Beyond the rough where not as much is good enough
Oh if you find yourself amongst the lonely ones
I will be waiting here with open arms
I can't coerce you into this one
Jealousy lay all your spells to bed
I'll choose unloved instead
I've got a cupboard with cans of food
Filtered water and pictures of you
And I'm not coming out until this is all over
And I'm looking through the glass
Where the light bends at the cracks
And I'm screaming at the top of my lungs
Pretending the echoes belong to someone
Someone I used to know
And we become silhouettes when our bodies finally go
Ba ba ba...
I wanted to walk through the empty streets
To feel something constant under my feet,
But all the news reports recommended that I stay indoors
Because the air outside will make
Our cells divide at an alarming rate
Until our shells simply cannot hold
All our insides in, and that's when we'll explode
(And it won't be a pretty sight)
And we'll become silhouettes when our bodies finally go
Ba ba ba...
And we'll become silhouettes when our bodies finally go
Ba ba ba...
And we'll become silhouettes when our bodies finally go
Ba ba ba...
And we'll become silhouettes when our bodies finally go
Ba ba ba...
And we'll become
And we'll become
Shake it, shake it
And we're moving again
Been a long time coming for the working man
So shake it, shake it
And we're moving again
When the money is high, we can start to spend
(x2)
Every little bit goes a little of a long way
Life gets hard and I'm headed for the highway home, home
Caught up in the middle of a headache and a heartbreak
Just when I thought I was clear of the mistakes,
No, no oh oh
So tell me, tell me, tell me
What am I to do
I think that this life is darker than the view
So help me, help me, help me
Be a little more like you
When everything is falling
I'm gonna do the things you do
Shake it, shake it
And we're moving again
Been a long time coming for the working man
Shake it, shake it
And we're moving again
When the money is high, we can start to spend
(x2)
Shake it
Everything is serious and everything is fatal
That's what they tell you
And that's how they make you know, know
I'm tired of the books and I'm tired of the tables
Everything is made with the same old labels
No, no oh oh
So tell me, tell me, tell me
What am I to do
I think that this life is darker than the view
So help me, help me, help me
Be a little more like you
When everything is falling
I'm gonna do the things you do
Shake it, shake it
And we're moving again
Been a long time coming for the working man
Shake it, shake it
And we're moving again
When the money is high, we can start to spend
(x2)
Shake it
Shake it, shake it
And we're moving again
Been a long time coming for the working man
Shake it, shake it
And we're moving again
When the money is high, we can start to spend
(x4)
Shake it
Another day, another way
For me to open up to you
Another day, another way
For me to open up to you
I used to worry I would wake up all day
Only to find you'd nothing more to say
Now I'm letting silence do the talking
Now I'm letting silence do the walking
Another day, another way
For me to open up to you
Another day, another way
For me to open up to you
I used to scream when a whisper would do
Only wanted noise, all over you
Now I'm letting silence do the talking
Now I'm letting silence do the walking
Another day, another way
For me to open up to you
Another day, another way
For me to open up to you
Workin' all day for a mean little man
With a clip-on tie and a rub-on tan
He's got me runnin' around the office like a dog around a track
But when I get back home you're always there to rub my back
Hey Julie, look what they're doing to me
Tryin' to trip me up, tryin' to wear me down
Julie I swear it's so hard to bear it
And I'd never make it through without you around
No, I'd never make it through without you around
Hours on the phone making pointless calls
I got a desk full of paper that means nothing at all
Sometimes I catch myself staring into space
Countin' down the hours 'til I get to see your face
Hey Julie, look what they're doing to me
Tryin' to trip me up, tryin' to wear me down
Julie, I swear it's so hard to bear it
And I'd never make it through without you around
No, I'd never make it through without you around
How did it come to be
That you and I must be
Far away from each other every day
Why must I spend my time
Fillin' up my mind
With facts and figures that never add up anyway
They never add up anyway
Workin' all day for a mean little guy
With a bad toupee and a soup-stain tie
He's got me runnin' around the office like a gerbil on a wheel
He can tell me what to do but he can't tell me what to feel
Hey Julie, look what they're doing to me
Tryin' to trip me up, tryin' to wear me down
Julie, I swear it's so hard to bear it
And I'd never make it through without you around
No, I'd never make it through without you around
No, I'd never make it through without you around
The road is pulling me into her open where
And for a moment I escape and I forget
The silhouettes behind the dust clouds call me friend
But even fools know here they're far and few between
She has abandoned me on highways and desert plains
Of lonely creatures singing for the summer rain
And at the end of all your knees fall down to me
Yeah it's something in you always ask for someone real
Oh I need your love, I need your love,
I need you now, I need you
Oh I need your love, I need your love,
I need you now, I need you
She is my salvation in the dark
But at night with lips of honey calls the devil's heart
And I am a war of flesh and heart that's left undone
Between the person that I was and have become
Oh I need your love, I need your love,
I need you now, I need you
Oh I need your love, I need your love,
I need you now, I need you
I need your love
Oh I need your love, I need your love,
I need you now, I need you
Oh I need your love, I need your love,
I need you now, I need you
There's no resting in my heart
There's no resting in my heart
There's no resting now

I'm singing in the rain
Just singin' in the rain
What a glorious feeling
I'm happy again
I'm laughing at clouds
So dark up above
The sun's in my heart
And I'm ready for love
Let the stormy clouds chase
Everyone from the place
Come on with the rain
I've a smile on my face
I walk down the lane
With a happy refrain
Just singin', singin' in the rain
Dancing in the rain
I'm happy again
I'm singin' and dancing in the rain
I'm dancing and singin' in the rain
Picture yourself when you're getting old
Sat by the fireside, a-pondering on

In sunny Southend

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Woke up this morning feelin' fine
There's something special on my mind
Last night I met a new girl in the neighborhood, whoa yeah
Something tells me I'm into something good
(Something tells me I'm into something)
She's the kind of girl who's not too shy
And I can tell I'm her kind of guy
She danced close to me like I hoped she would
(She danced with me like I hoped she would)
Something tells me I'm into something good
(Something tells me I'm into something)
We only danced for a minute or two
But then she stuck close to me the whole night through
Can I be fallin' in love?
(She's everything I've been dreamin' of)
She's everything I've been dreamin' of
I walked her home and she held my hand
I knew it couldn't be just a one-night stand
So I asked to see her next week and she told me I could
(I asked to see her and she told me I could)
Something tells me I'm into something good
(Something tells me I'm into something)
(Something tells me I'm into something, ah)
I walked her home and she held my hand
I knew it couldn't be just a one-night stand
So I asked to see her next week and she told me I could
(I asked to see her and she told me I could)
Something tells me I'm into something good
(Something tells me I'm into something)
Something tells me I'm into something good
(Something tells me I'm into something)
To something good, oh yeah, something good
(Something tells me I'm into something)
To something good, something good, something good
Here we stand
Like an Adam and an Eve
Waterfalls
The Garden of Eden
Two fools in love
So beautiful and strong
The birds in the trees
Are smiling upon them
From the age of the dinosaurs
Cars have run on gasoline
Where, where have they gone?
Now, it's nothing but flowers
There was a factory
Now, there are mountains and rivers
You got it, you got it
We caught a rattlesnake
Now, we got something for dinner
We got it, we got it
There was a shopping mall
Now, it's all covered with flowers
You've got it, you've got it
If this is paradise
I wish I had a lawnmower
You've got it, you've got it
Years ago
I was an angry young man
I'd pretend
That I was a billboard
Standing tall
By the side of the road
I fell in love
With a beautiful highway
This used to be real estate
Now, it's only fields and trees
Where, where is the town?
Now, it's nothing but flowers
The highways and cars
Were sacrificed for agriculture
I thought that we'd start over
But I guess I was wrong, hey
Once there were parking lots
Now, it's a peaceful oasis
You got it, you got it
This was a Pizza Hut
Now, it's all covered with daisies
You got it, you got it
I miss the honky tonks
Dairy Queens and 7-Elevens
You got it, you got it
And as things fell apart
Nobody paid much attention
You got it, you got it
I dream of cherry pies
Candy bars and chocolate chip cookies
You got it, you got it
We used to microwave
Now, we just eat nuts and berries
You got it, you got it
This was a discount store
Now, it's turned into a cornfield
You got it, you got it
Don't leave me stranded here
I can't get used to this lifestyle
Well I saw you with your hands above your head 
Spinning around, trying not to look down 
But you did, and you fell, hard on the ground 
Then you stumbled around for a good ten minutes 
And I said I'd never seen anyone look so dumb before 
And you laughed and said I still know how to turn you on though 
You're the only one who 
Drags me kicking and screaming through fast dreams 
You're the only one who 
Knows exactly what I mean 
And I probably forgot to tell you this 
Like that time I forgot to tell you about the scar 
Remember how uncomfortable that made you feel? 
See you're not what I expected 
But you're the only one who knows how to handle me 
And you're such a great kisser and I know that you agree 
You're the only one who 
Drags me kicking and screaming through fast dreams 
You're the only one who 
Knows exactly what I mean 
I hope you can forgive me for that time 
When I put my hand between your legs 
And said it was small 
'Cause its really not at all 
I guess there's just a part of me that likes to bring you down 
Just to keep you around 
'Cause the day you realize how amazing you are 
You're gonna leave me 
You're the only one who 
Holds my hair back when I'm drunk and get sick 
You're the only one who 
Knows exactly what I mean 
You're the only one who 
Drags me kicking and screaming through fast dreams 
You're the only one who 
Knows exactly what I mean 
Exactly what I mean 
Well I saw you with your hands above your head 
Spinning around, trying not to look down 
But you did, and you fell, hard on the ground
Hey DJ
Tonight, to the stars
Tonight, I'm seein' stars
Tonight, to the stars
Tonight, I'm seein' stars
Tonight, to the stars
Tonight
Once again, I find myself with my friends
Dancin' the night away it's like the party never ends
Then again we don't want it to stop
'Cause tonight's the night it goes
Sweatbox, laser beams, flashin' lights
Wild cards, men from Mars, dressed in stars and stripes
(Eclectic electric, ladies of the evenin', drinkin' booze and minglin')
Mashin' to the music, I can do anything
Freaky dicky star speckles and pink butterflies
And life is nice, so nice
I walk into a club and I've found paradise
I'm seein' stars, I can't believe my eyes
(I'm seein' stars)

Now the record always spins on the trails we blaze
The walls are closin' in but that's okay
'Cause I've been waitin' all week to feel this way
And it feels so good, so good I'm on top of the world
The coolest kid in the neighborhood
So let me be your star for one night that's right
Sweatbox, laser beams, flashin' lights
You've got to feel the rush, feel the spice of life
Love-life, Shifty rolls the dice snake eyes surprise
Icein' mesmerizin' the minds are sick ones
'Cause what we are, is victims of fun
Come on, come on, the fun is just begun
Come on the fun is just begun
Oh my starry eyed surprise, sundown to sunrise
Dance all night, we gonna dance all night, dance all night to this DJ
Ah sugar, dance all night to this DJ

People in love get fast and foolish
People in love get everything wrong
People in love get scared and stupid
People in love get everything wrong
At least they're not lonely
At least they're not lonely
Never be lonely
B-b-b-baby, I think I'm going c-c-c-crazy
And why should I be sane without you
They tell me to fight it
But they can bloody well just try it
I'll never be the same without you
People in love get special treatment
People in love get everything wrong
People in love, their hearts get eaten
People in love get everything wrong
At least they're not lonely
At least they're not lonely
Never be lonely
B-b-b-baby, I think I'm going c-c-c-crazy
And why should I be sane without you
They tell me to fight it
But they can bloody well just try it
I'll never be the same without you
Never be lonely
Never be lonely
Never be lonely
Never be lonely
Do you think, everything, everyone, is going mental?
It seems to me that it's spiralling outta control and it's inevitable
Now don't you think
This time is yours, this time is mine?
It's temperamental
It seems to me, we're on all fours
Crawling on our knees
Someone help us please
Oh Jesus Christ almighty
Do I feel all right? No not slightly
I wanna get a flat I know I can afford it
It's just the bureaucrats who won't give me a mortgage
It's very funny 'cause I got your fuckin' money
And I'm never gonna get it just 'cause of my bad credit
Oh well I guess I mustn't grumble
I suppose that's just the way the cookie crumbles.
Oh yes, I'm fine
Everything's just wonderful
I'm having the time of my life
Don't you want something else?
Something new, than what we've got here
And don't you feel it's all the same,
Some sick game and it's not insincere?
I wish I could change the ways of the world
Make it a nice place
Until that day, I guess we stay
Doing what we do
Screwing who we screw
Why can't I sleep at night?
Don't say it's gonna be all right
I wanna be able to eat spaghetti bolognaise
And not feel bad about it for days and days and days
In the magazines they talk about weight loss
If I buy those jeans I can look like Kate Moss
Oh no it's not the life that I chose
But I guess that's the way that things go
Oh yes, I'm fine
Everything's just wonderful
I'm having the time of my life
Oh yes, I'm fine
Everything's just wonderful
I'm having the time of my life
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba [etc.]
Oh Jesus Christ almighty
Do I feel all right? No not slightly
I wanna get a flat I know I can afford it
It's just the bureaucrats that won't give me a mortgage
It's very funny 'cause I got your fuckin' money
And I'm never gonna get it just because of my bad credit
Oh well I guess I mustn't grumble
I suppose that's just the way the cookie crumbles
Well I guess it's just the way that things go
I suppose it's the way the cookie crumbles
Well I guess it's just the way that things go
I suppose that's the way the cookie crumbles

We weren't particularly cool

To write bad poetry
Dancing on a Friday night
Mass romantic fool wears Foster Grants, his books on tape ring true,
Like everyone wants to say I love you to someone on the radio, radio.
First choice on the haunted stars, now the one true loves,
And author of "My Life Among the Kids Who Go to Shows",
This is not the way.
In the streetlight dawn,
In the streetlight dawn, this beat turns on.
Mass romantic fool separated by sheets when the curtain calls you,
Speaking on the themes of stolen virtue missing from the radio, radio.
Now this romantic duel is into the streets, bon appetit, you've eaten me alive.
You realize this is not the way.
In the streetlight dawn
In the streetlight dawn, this beat turns on.
This boy's life among the electrical lights...
When you come I feelin' better
Sky is blue you say forever
Ooh ooh, I've been trapped by love
Then you go so change the weather
Sky is grey bit more than ever
Ooh ooh, I've been trapped by love...
I've been trapped by love
I've been trapped by love
I've been trapped by love...!
So my beer now taste so bitter
But I can't find anything sweeter
Ooh ooh, I've been trapped by love
Then you come and I feel better
See my eyes they're full of water
Then again you go
So change the weather...
Askin for the next together
I've been trapped by love
I've been trapped by love
I've been trapped by love...!
When you come I feelin' better
Sky is blue you say forever
Ooh ooh, I've been trapped by love
Then you come and I feel better
See my eyes they're full of water
Then again you go
So change the weather...
Askin for the next together
Askin for the next together
I've been trapped by love
I've been trapped by love
I've been trapped by love!
I've been trapped by love!
Some people get up at the break of day
Gotta go to work before it gets too late
Sitting in a car and driving down the road
It ain't the way it has to be
But that's what you do to earn your daily wage
That's the kind of world that we're living in today
Isn't where you wanna be
And isn't what you wanna do
Just give me one more day (one more day)
Give me another night (just another night)
I need a second chance (second chance)
This time I'll get it right (This time I'll get it right)
I'll say it one last time (one last time)
I've got to let you know (I've got to let you know)
I've got to change your mind (I've got to change your mind)
I'll never let you go
You've got to look at life the way it oughta be
Looking at the stars from underneath the tree
There's a world inside and a world out there
With that on tv you just don't care
They've got violence, wars and killing too
All shrunk down in a two-foot tube
But out there the world is a beautiful place
With mountains, lakes and the human race
And this is where I wanna be
And this is what I wanna do
Just give me one more day (one more day)
Give me another night (just another night)
I need a second chance (second chance)
This time I'll get it right (This time I'll get it right)
I'll say it one last time (one last time)
I've got to let you know (I've got to let you know)
I've got to change your mind (change your mind)
I'll never let you go
Just give me one more chance (one more chance)
Give me another night (just another night)
With just one more day (one more day)
Maybe we'll get it right (You know I'll get it right)
I'll say it one last time (one last time)
I've got to let you know (I've got to let you know)
If I could change your mind (change your mind)
I'll never let you go

One, two, three, four
Tell me that you love me more
Sleepless long nights
That is what my youth was for
Old teenage hopes are alive at your door
Left you with nothing but they want some more
Oh, oh, oh
You're changing your heart
Oh, oh, oh
You know who you are
Sweetheart, bitterheart now I can't tell you apart
Cozy and cold, put the horse before the cart
Those teenage hopes who have tears in their eyes
Too scared to own up to one little lie
Oh, oh, oh
You're changing your heart
Oh, oh, oh
You know who you are
One, two, three, four, five, six, nine, or ten
Money can't buy you back the love that you had then
One, two, three, four, five, six, nine, or ten
Money can't buy you back the love that you had then
Oh, oh, oh
You're changing your heart
Oh, oh, oh
You know who you are
Oh, oh, oh
You're changing your heart
Oh, oh, oh
You know who you are
Who you are, are, are, are
For, for the teenage boys
They're breaking your heart
For the teenage boys
They're breaking your heart
Come fly with me, let's fly let's fly away
If you can use some exotic booze
There's a bar in far Bombay
Come fly with me, let's fly let's fly away
Come fly with me, let's float down to Peru
In lama land, there's a one man band
And he'll toot his flute for you
Come fly with me, let's take off in the blue
Once I get you up there,
Where the air is rarefied
We'll just glide
Starry eyed
Once I get you up there
I'll be holding you so near
You may hear the angels cheer 
Because we're together
Weatherwise it's such a lovely day 
Just say the words, and we'll beat the birds
Down to Acapulco Bay
It's perfect, for a flying honeymoon - they say
S'Come fly with me, let's fly let's fly away
Once I get you up there,
Where the air is rarefied
We'll just glide
Starry eyed
Once I get you up there
I'll be holding you so near
You may hear all the angels cheer 
Because we're together
Weatherwise it's such a lovely day
You just say those words, and we'll beat those birds
Down to Acapulco Bay
It's so perfect, for a flying honeymoon - they say
Come fly with me
Let's fly let's fly
Pack up let's fly away

I don't care if I'm alone here singing songs to myself
There's nobody else around, around
Meet you up at the Indian part of the town
The town's shut down, the people left with their bags
Their kids so there's not a sound a sound
But I must get from there to here
There's a small voice crying on the other side of the river from here
It's too late to phone her now
What went wrong, your grades were good
It would take a left wing Robin Hood to pay for school
Your dad's a boozer and you keep him alive
Just a minute close your eyes
If we settle for this compromise I'll stay with you
The river looks so good tonight
I don't know what's with your friend
She met a boy and at the summer's end
She said she'd had enough of playing games
I don't care 'cause I'm by myself
All the dancers left but I can't dance
So I will stay and clean the mess they left behind
But I dream as I set to scrub all the floors, the walls
I'm thinking of a song or two, a boy a girl and a rendezvous
Are you coming or are you not?
There is nothing that would sort you out
There's nothing I could say or do
You're going to crash, I'll set the bails in front of you
Are you coming or are you not?
There is nothing that would sort you out
An interesting way of life
Deny yourself the benefits of being alive
You slept better in a sleeping train in a shed in a station
With a torch and a Woman's Realm to keep you warm
To keep you company
You slept better in a sleeping train in a shed in a station
With a torch and a Woman's Realm to keep you company tonight
Well, it's 4 AM,
The paper boy's at it again, but I can't get no sleep.
I mean what's the point,
If I can't even dream up a dream that's worth the keep?
And so there's no need even going,
'Cause I'm better off never knowing.
The media are getting really good at lying,
This time around, well I'm not buying it.
'Cause this life is a beautiful one,
And though I see it coming undone.
I know most definitely,
That it's gonna be you, it's gonna be me soon.
Better keep your head up, keep it on the up and up,
'Cause you've got all my love, love, love.
We're all just lovers and takers,
Breaking hearts to make the papers.
She won't stop until we stop trying,
'Cause the reasons for your tears aren't worth crying.
And this life is a beautiful one,
And though I see it coming undone.
I know most definitely,
That it's gonna be you, it's gonna be me soon.
Better keep your head up, keep it on the up and up,
'Cause you've got all my love, love, love.
With loving all around me,
Well I think that love has found me.
With loving all the time.
And when the summer's here, the waves are crashing.
No time for thinking, don't even ask me.
Gonna let it all roll right past me.
'Cause when I'm here I'm always something.
This life is a beautiful one,
And though I see it coming undone.
I know most definitely,
It always works out the way it's meant to be.
So better keep your head up, keep it on the up and up,
'Cause you've got all my love, love, love.
Maryanne, do you remember
The tree by the river
When we were seventeen?
The dark canyon wall, the call and the answer
And the mare in the pasture
Pitch black and baring its teeth
I recall the sun in our faces
Stuck and leaning on graces
And being strangers to change
The radio and the bones we found frozen
And all the thorns and the roses
Beneath your window pane
Now I'm asleep in a car
I mean the world to a potty-mouthed girl
And a pretty pair of blue-eyed birds
"Time isn't kind or unkind," you liked to say
But I wonder to who
And what it is you're saying today
Now I'm asleep in a car
I mean the world to a potty-mouthed girl
A pretty pair of blue-eyed birds
"Time isn't kind or unkind," you liked to say
But I wonder to who
And what it is you're saying today
Maryanne, do you remember 
The tree by the river 
When we were seventeen?
Dark canyon road, I was coy in the half-moon
Happy just to be with you
And you were happy for me
I got a gnome in the backyard
I put him right on the X mark
He's supposed to show me where the money is
Hey won't you show me where the money is
I got it all on the back of my hand
I want your answer so I won't forget
Then show me right where your heart is
Oh right now tell me where your heart is
Oh Mandy, oh Mandy
Oh Mandy, oh Mandy
So dreamy, oh Mandy
So killing, oh Mandy
Sure I had trouble from the onset
I tried to chase things I couldn't get
Show me a rerun on the W
Show me a rerun on the WB
So what's it like to be in it
And move away to the Midwest
I gotta message for your auntie
I gotta message for your auntie
Oh Mandy, oh Mandy
Oh Mandy, oh Mandy
So dreamy, oh Mandy
So killing, oh Mandy
Oh Mandy, oh Mandy
Can read me, and has me
Oh Mandy, oh Mandy's
Completely out of reach
And now I know I'm at the end of my wits
Don't gotta tell me where this is going
'Cause I know nothing ever falls apart
Yeah I know nothing ever falls apart
Remind me once more where this is going
Before I fling it out into the ocean
It's kind of level but it's wavy
It's looking more blue than it is green
It's looking quiet as I jump in
So I can finally hear you scream
You got a gnome in the backyard
You put him right on the X mark
You're eating brains out the back of my head
Oh yeah, that's where the money is
Oh Mandy, oh Mandy
Oh Mandy, oh Mandy
So dreamy, oh Mandy
So killing, oh Mandy
Oh Mandy, oh Mandy
Can read me, and has me
Oh Mandy, oh Mandy's
Completely out of reach
If it's not with you
There is no thing that makes wanna settle down
I thought it was a bad cough
But never knew how much illusions hide a torture
Lonesome and forsaken with no gratitude
Who's goin' to tell, devotion's not your problem
It's me against a wardrobe
Focused on the pain to see how we can get along
Doing things, getting better
I'll move on
Together
The more I try the less I care about it
Together
And if you don't see yourself in the mirror, forget what you did
Together
The more I try the less I care about it
I'm giving up my conscience for another
The only one I want is you
Things I wouldn't do
Try to treat me like a friend, get another late call
I'll lose you for another
Cause you can't believe how much your pleasure is a factor
Writing down the logic of my solitude
As far as I'm concerned I'd like to leave it random
I'm acting like an orphan
Let me get to know you better to make me less attracted
Doing things, getting better
I'll move on
Together
The more I try the less I care about it
Together
And if you don't see yourself in the mirror, forget what you did
Together
The more I try the less I care about it
I'm giving up my conscience for another
The only one I want is you
Parisians all gone
Words they're all gone
Let me tell you
Uh... uh... uh...
I found a switch
You turned it on
I hit the ditch
You carried on
I was so near
Now you're so far
Are you quite sure
Just who you are
O iiiii
O you could chose a friend but you don't seem to have the time
O iiiii
I wonder if you ever get to say what's on your mind
O take a little time, take a little time
I love it when you call
I love it when you call
I love it when you call
But you never call at all
So what's the complication it's only conversation
I love it when you call
But you never call at all
Remember me, I used to be the best time buddy
That you couldn't wait to see
But getting old, it takes its toll
And hearts getting broken lead to people growing cold
O iiiiii
I'm flipping with a coin that's got a tail on either side
O iiiiii
I'm gonna be the one who makes you stop and realise
You could have it all
We should have it all
I love it when you call
I love it when you call
I love it when you call
But you never call at all
So what's the complication it's only conversation
I love it when you call
But you never call at all
Yeah I wonder where you been
Yeah I wonder who you seen
And I hope you find your train
When you do I really hope it's all it seems
I love it when you call
I love it when you call
I love it when you call
But you never call at all
So what's the complication it's only conversation
I love it when you call
But you never call at all
It's always been about me, myself, and I
I thought relationships were nothing but a waste of time
I never wanted to be anybody's other half
I was happy saying I had a love that wouldn't last
That was the only way I knew 'til I met you
You make we wanna say
I do, I do, I do, do do do do do do do
Yeah, I do, I do, I do, do do do do do do
'Cause every time before it's been like maybe yes and maybe no
I can't live without it, I can't let it go
Ooh what did I get myself into?
You make we wanna say I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do
Tell me, is it only me, do you feel the same?
You know me well enough to know that I'm not playing games
I promise I won't turn around and I won't let you down
You can trust I've never felt it like I feel it now
Baby there's nothing, there's nothing we can't get through
So can we say
I do, I do, I do, do do do do do do
Oh baby, I do, I do, I do, do do do do do
'Cause every time before it's been like maybe yes and maybe no
I won't live without it, I won't let it go
What more can I get myself into?
You make we wanna say
Me, a family, a house, a family
Ooh, can we be a family?
And when I'm eighty years old I'm sitting next to you
And we'll remember when we said
I do, I do, I do, do do do do do do
Oh baby, I do, I do, I do, do do do do do
'Cause every time before it's been like maybe yes and maybe no
I won't live without it, I won't let us go
Just look at what we got ourselves into
You make me wanna say I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do
Love you
Okay, yeah
I remember way back, I mean, way back, ages
8th grade I think, feels like yesterday
Bowl cuts was the craze, I was crazy
Long blonde hair all over the place
And I'm pale as I ever was, baby face
With a frame like a skeleton
Skinny kid, no, friends with bout everyone
No shit, I was cool, I had plenty fun
But one wish, I would grow up big
No, not built, but they say drink my milk
Didn't get nowhere, switched up diet
Started having hip-hop, pops didn't buy it
Wanted more Springsteen, Earth, Wind, Fire
Felt that was fine but to rhyme, had to try it
Couldn't hide the fact I wanted to rap
Bought Jay-Z's CD with my own cash, man
And that was back around '98
With the Annie sample and Money ain't A Thang
And even though I really couldn't relate
I kept studying and listening and
Stuffing my face and now
I don't feel like I'm fallin' ('Cause I'm so high that)
I don't feel like I'm fallin' (And I'm so fly that)
I don't feel like I'm fallin' ('Cause I'm so high that)
I don't feel like I'm fallin'
Then came high school
Started picking up a mic, thought I was cool
My friends said homie you know that your white, dude
I said What? Fa real? Oh it's all good
Cause like this, when I tried it, liked it
Flipped it, hyped it, insisted the mic
Cause this shit's just right
Just like that, 9th grade footy heard
Straight from the Philly burbs, feel me? pretty sure
Suburban Threat was the name and we really were
Steady wasting the day spittin' silly verses
No curses, writing bout our girlfriends
Ballpoint pen, mines spinning like a whirlwind
Getting on the mic, I'm a wizard like merlin
Breaking barriers, tearing walls like it's berlin
And I think it was the summer of 12th grade
When Uncle C passed away, leaving us empty
And it hurt real bad
Disturbed real sad
But we had to move on
So infact, real fast, we wrote this song
Bout fallen ones and miscues and misviews
Of the misuse of words used to diss dudes
So true, in a serious face
I'm convinced God works in mysterious ways
Like everything happens for a reason
I had to believe it cause that would
Explain why they leave us
As in people that mean everything
I got love for them all, they'll
Be there if I fall but
She gave you everything she had,
But she was young and dumb, she'd just turned twenty-one
She didn't care to hang around,
So when the shit came down why she was nowhere to be found
This life can turn a good girl bad
She was the sweetest thing that you had ever seen
You're such a delicate boy,
In the hysterical realm,
Of an emotional landslide,
In physical terms
With your cherry lips and golden curls,
You could make grown men gasp when you'd go walking past
And in your hotpants and high-heels,
They could not believe that such a body was for real
It seemed like rainbows would appear,
Whenever you came near the clouds would disappear,
Because you looked just like a girl,
Your baby blues would flash and suddenly a spell was cast
You're such a delicate boy,
In the hysterical realm,
Of an emotional landslide,
In physical terms
You hold a candle in your heart,
You shine a light on head and heart,
You make the whole world wanna dance,
You've bought yourself a second chance
Go baby, go go, we're right behind you,
Go baby, go go, yeah we're looking at you,
Go baby, go go, oh we're right behind you,
Go baby, go baby, yeah we're right behind you
Go baby, go baby, oh we're right behind you
Go baby, go baby, yeah we're looking at you
Go baby, go baby, oh we're right behind you
Go baby, go baby, yeah we're looking at you
You hold a candle in your heart
(Go baby, go go)
You shine a light on head and heart
(Go baby, go go)
You make the whole world wanna dance
(Go baby, go go)
You've bought yourself a second chance
(Go, baby, go baby, go)
You expected my war diaries
But time ran out and I, I let you down
A small thanks note written in French is no shorthand for
"This thing gave me writer's cramp"
Another dream about shapeshifting
Well we move with such elegance, with such grace
With all our dignity just in place
Deer die with their eyes wide open, eyes wide open, eyes wide open
Deer die with their eyes wide open
Drawing tiny little pictures of skeletons
To get across the sense of impending doom
And the leaves like the artwork to "Major Leagues" look like dead foxes on the hard shoulder
And for some reason I think that I attributed this story
To the bypass of the town I hadn't visited
So goes the backing track of all the sighs we'd ever sighed
Deer die with their eyes wide open, eyes wide open, eyes wide open
Deer die with their eyes wide open
Drawing tiny little pictures of skeletons
To get across the sense of impending doom
And I am 17 pages through this notebook now
And there are little more than pictures of how I see you in an X-ray machine
That's more like a television screen
And you're in a rut, and I know that you know what I mean
And then the realisation hits that not even two gospel choirs could save us now
Turn up on your doorstep
Feeling like roadkill
Tasting like postage stamps
And when I touch you
You fold up like an envelope
With everything I ever wrote
Pouring out of your mouth.
In my dreams
I see myself hitting a baseball
In a green field somewhere near a freeway
I'm all tan and smiling and running from 3rd base
And it's hot and
The kids keep on playing the driving game
And they're singing the same goddamn refrain
And the sky is a bluish grey.
And it's become just like a chemical stress
Tracing the lines in my face for
Something more beautiful than is there
I've barely been gone.
In my dreams
I see you at the foot of some mountains.
And we're taking some pictures or something
And we'd better hurry up
And it's late and
The sun keeps on shooting through pine trees
And the grass stains are wet on your new jeans
And we'd better hurry up
And I've become just like a terrible mess
Searching the lines in my face for
Something more beautiful than is there
The crowds keep me coming back
Cheering
In my dreams
I see you asleep on a twin bed
The covers pulled up over your head
Am I asleep or awake?
And it's morning
And the captain is playing the radio
And he's just put the paint on his new boat
Am I asleep or awake?
And it just feels good when you're waking up
And it just feels good when you're next to me
And it just feels good when you're coming home
And it just feels good when you're waking up
And I've become just like a chemical stress
Tracing the lines of my face for
Something more beautiful than is there
I've barely been gone
And I'm not a failure
I swear
I wish you could see it from over there
I've got a lot over here without you
I've barely been gone
Gone
Dreaming
Way across the plains
The lights spell out a code.
No one knows where they take us,
But we'll search 'til we grow old.
All the paths they lead
To the single solemn place.
Then we'll stay for a weekend
And leave without a trace.
Just for tonight.
Just maybe we've made it.
Sing like you want this,
Sing like you want this.
Just for tonight.
Just maybe we've made it.
Sing like you want this,
Sing like you want this.
We can take tonight,
Take our time.
So sing like you need this
And be who you want to.
All the paths they lead
To a little standing place.
If you stay for a weekend
You'd leave without a trace.
Just for tonight.
Just maybe we've made it.
Sing like you want this,
Sing like you want this.
Just for tonight.
Just maybe we've made it.
Sing like you want this,
Sing like you want this.
Lalalala lalalalala.
Lalalala lalalalala.
Lalalala lalalalala.
Just for tonight,
Just for tonight.
Just maybe we've made it.
Sing like you want this,
Sing like you want this.
Just for tonight.
Just maybe we've made it.
Sing like you want this,
Sing like you want this.
Oh, fuck it
I'm gonna have a party
Oh, fuck it
I'm gonna have a party
I had the blankest year
I saw life turn into a T.V. show
It was totally weird
The person I knew I didn't really know
Time don't move
We're the only ones who do
Bending reason
'Cause it's all we hold on to
I had the blankest year
I saw life turn into a T.V. show
It was totally weird
The person I knew I didn't really know
And now it's lonely
Thank god the band's doing well
But you don't own me
I'd like to return this spell
'Cause it's not my size
And your lies are so much bigger than my lies
And your ties are made of things that shouldn't make ties
Oh, fuck it (fuck it)
I'm gonna have a party
Oh, fuck it (fuck it)
I'm gonna have a party
Oh, fuck it (fuck it)
I'm gonna have a party
Ocean man
Take me by the hand
Lead me to the land that you understand
Ocean man
The voyage to the corner of the globe
Is a real trip
Ocean man
The crust of the tan man imbibed by the sand
Soaking up the thirst of the land
Ocean man
Can you see through the wonder of amazement
At the oberman
Ocean man
The crust is elusive when it casts forth
To the childlike man
Ocean man
The sequence of a life form braised in the sand
Soaking up the thirst of the land
Ocean man
Ocean man
Ocean man
Ocean man
Take me by the hand
Lead me to the land that you understand
Ocean man
The voyage to the corner of the globe
Is a real trip
Ocean man
The crust of a tan man imbibed by the sand
Soaking up the thirst of the land
Ocean man
Can you see through the wonder of amazement
At the oberman
Ocean man
The crust is elusive when it casts forth
To the childlike man
Ocean man
The sequence of a life form braised in the sand
Soaking up the thirst of the land
Ocean man
The wilted flowers that I gave
Were not as nice as your bouquet
All the lyrics that I wrote
Not as smart as the words you spoke
The starlight above my hometown
Ain't as bright as the star I've found
Every drawing that I drew
Was never ever as cute as you
Oh, oh, serious as a heart attack
I'm looking in my almanac
I've gotta find out all the things
And find out where she got her wings
Shimmy, shimmy, quarter turn
I feel like I will never learn
How can I check lost and found
When I'm too busy getting down
Gotta get it back to
A back up plan to find you
Start acceleration
Take it back to square one
Gotta get it back to
A back up plan to find you
Start acceleration
Take it back to square one
I swear that I'm not kidding
We're just looking to fit in
With all the other answers
To questions never confirmed
States that keep us far apart
Track down the beating of my heart
Mark the places in my book
With photographs we never took
I swear that I'm not kidding
Night time is so pretty
With all the stars above your eyes
I'm sneaking out and making ties
States that keep us far apart
Track the beating with a chart
Mark the rhythms that I shook
Every time I caught you look
Gotta get it back to
A back up plan to find you
Start acceleration
Take it back to square one
Gotta get it back to
A back up plan to find you
Start acceleration
Take it back to square one
Gotta get it back to
A back up plan to find you
Start acceleration
Take it back to square one
Gotta get it back to
A back up plan to find you
Start acceleration
Take it back to square one
I was never young, even as a child.
Said, I was never young; I've always felt beguiled.
Oh, I just never smiled, but you have a glow, a glow from an inner sense I'll never know.
'Cause I was never young, even as a boy.
No, I was never young; kindness seemed no ploy to temper or annoy.
But you, you have a mind full of wonderment I'll never find 'cause I was never young.
I was never young
Ever since I was a kid, I've been a brooding basket case.
Ever since I was a kid, I've been a brooding basket case.
Ever since I was a kid, I've been a brooding basket case.
On, it's on
I declare my room a scene
Gone, then gone
It's too much that they say you need
It's not perfection, yeah
How boring if it is
Nothing new for me
Light on up
With everybody watching you
Lights go down
Everything is yours to lose
First dancer takes the floor
Laugh but you can't ignore
Whatcha' gonna do
Waiting for attention, I'm not
Cut it to the left and I rock
Need an invitation, I don't
Slide it to the right and I roll
Here it goes
Crowning of the cool kid queen
There it goes
The competition show their teeth
I'll let them fight it out
It's just my party now
What I want to be
Step on up
Everyone in queue, in costume
Step on out
Don't get sucked in for a second
The bright lights might say your name
But they only light the stage
Nothing there to prove
Waiting for attention, I'm not
Cut it to the left and I rock
Need an invitation, I don't
Slide it to the right and I roll
Waiting for attention, I'm not
Cut it to the left and I rock
Need an invitation, I don't
Slide it to the right and I roll
Hey hey hey hey
Don't accept critique or credit
Hey hey hey hey
Their definition always changes
Hey hey hey hey
It's not the same as yours
You could be so much more
The closer that you get
Waiting for attention, I'm not
Cut it to the left and I rock
Need an invitation, I don't
Slide it to the right and I roll
Waiting for attention, I'm not
Cut it to the left and I rock
Need an invitation, I don't
Slide it to the right and I roll
Me and the ocean, me and the sea
I don't think so, I don't think it was meant to be
Take me off somewhere cold
Gradually just growing old
And someday maybe make of me an honest man
Yeah? Well...
I don't see no ring on these fingers
I don't see no ring on these fingers
Love in this town - it's like a joke
I must've had fun 'cause now I'm broke
Down by the ocean, walk by and see
All these people - they look so, they look so happy to me
What if all I want in this world
Turned out just to be an honest girl?
Turned out just to make of me an honest man?
Oh yeah? Well...
I don't see no ring on these fingers
I don't see no ring on these fingers
Love in this town - it's like a joke
I must've had fun 'cause now I'm broke
I don't see no ring on these fingers
I don't see no ring on these fingers
Life in this town makes it hard to see
Things that are right in front of me
Yeah
(Ba ba ba bada)
Love in this town - it's like a joke
I must've had fun 'cause now I'm broke
I find in this town that it's hard to see
Things that are right in front of me
You're such a lovely cup
Why don't cha fill me up
All these reasons too hard to explain
So, I'll drink you up my dear
We got it all right here
Here is now, and now is where I want to be
Allure see, you belong to me
And I had to get away from this here masquerade
Comes a time when a man loses his mind
It's such a mystery my, my philosophy
What to do when we do have some time
Allure see, you belong to me
Allure saw, never let you go
No, never let you go
You're such a lovely cup
(Such a lovely cup)
Why don't cha fill me up
(Why don't cha fill me up)
You're such a lovely cup
(It's such a lovely cup)
Why don't cha fill me up
(Why don't cha, why don't cha)
You're such a lovely cup
(Why don't cha, why don't cha)
Why don't you fill me up
It's a perfect day for letting go
For setting fire to bridges boats
And other dreary worlds you know
Let's get happy
It's a perfect day for making out
To wake up with a smile
Without a doubt
To burst grin giggle bliss skip jump sing and shout
Let's get happy
"But it's much too late" you say
"For doing this now
We should have done it then"
Well it just goes to show
How wrong you can be
And how you really should know
That it's never too late
To get up and go
It's a perfect day for kiss and swell
For rip-zipping button-popping kiss and well
There's loads of other stuff can make you yell
Let's get happy
It's a perfect day for doing the unstuck
For dancing like you can't hear the beat
And you don't give a further thought
To things like feet
Let's get happy
"But it's much too late" you say
"For doing this now
We should have done it then"
Well it just goes to show
How wrong you can be
And how you really should know
That it's never too late
To get up and go
Kick out the gloom
Kick out the blues
Tear out the pages with all the bad news
Pull down the mirrors and pull down the walls
Tear up the stairs and tear up the floors
Oh just burn down the house
Burn down the street
Turn everything red and the beat is complete
With the sound of your world
Going up in the fire
It's a perfect day to throw back your head
And kiss it all goodbye
It's a perfect day for getting wild
Forgetting all your worries life
And everything that makes you cry
Let's get happy
It's a perfect day for dreams come true
For thinking big
And doing anything you want to do
Let's get happy
"But it's much too late" you say
"For doing this now
We should have done it then"
Well it just goes to show
How wrong you can be
And how you really should know
That it's never too late
To get up and go
Kick out the gloom
Kick out the blues
Tear out the pages with all the bad news
Pull down the mirrors and pull down the walls
Tear up the stairs and tear up the floors
Oh just burn down the house
Burn down the street
Turn everything red and the dream is complete
With the sound of your world
Going up in the fire
It's a perfect day to throw back your head
And kiss it all goodbye
I came up like everyone
They taught us all the same
I said what they told me to say
And then from that, they grade
Give up repeating the facts
Fact can be arranged
Here I am, I'll take my chance
Now play the record straight
Give it up
Oh oh, oh oh oh oh, oh oh, oh
Give it up
Oh oh, oh oh oh oh, oh oh, oh
Talking points from talking heads
With automated smiles
"There's no higher ground to stand
Than bottom of the pile"
Give up acting unaware
You can't ignore the crime
The enemy is you as well
The enemy is I
Give it up
Oh oh, oh oh oh oh, oh oh, oh
Give it up
Oh oh, oh oh oh oh, oh oh, oh
Give it up
Oh oh, oh oh oh oh, oh oh, oh
Give it up
Oh oh, oh oh oh oh, oh oh, oh
Not in my name
You don't speak for me
I am my voice
And I want to scream
You want my air?
You want my love?
I act as one
But I'm not alone
Oh oh, oh oh oh oh, oh oh, oh
Give it up
Oh oh, oh oh oh oh, oh oh, oh
Give it up
Oh oh, oh oh oh oh, oh oh, oh
Give it up
Oh oh, oh oh oh oh, oh oh, oh
Give it up
Oh oh, oh oh oh oh, oh oh, oh
Give it up
Oh oh, oh oh oh oh, oh oh, oh
Taking a ride to another clime
Knees in my back 'cause we're flying high
Did I give it all?
I guess I gave it all
Seeing the mountains through the fog
Watching a film with a talking dog
'Cause if I fall
Then I guess I fall
Hawaiian air
Hawaiian air
Hawaiian air
Hawaiian air
Leaving the world down beneath the clouds
Hawaiian notes, don't need no pounds
Did I give them all?
Oh, did I give them all?
Ache in my leg from a broken seat
Skipping the meal for a G&T
'Cause if I fall
I'm beggin' not to fall
Hawaiian air
Hawaiian air
Hawaiian air
Hawaiian air
Touchin' down
Hit the ground
I'm breathing new air
Can I take this all in?
Can I take this all in?
As we land, you pinch my hand
I'm still here
Can I take this all in?
Can I take this all in?
Up in the sky Honolulu bound
Steel guitar and the mele sound
Did I give it all?
I guess I gave it all
Feeling the shapes keeps me reticent
Stuck in my seat from the turbulence
And if I fall
Then I fall
Breaking open skies of green earths
...? All of the fruit
Deserts,
In our eyes we're falling
Our hearts in our?
Hawaiian air
Hawaiian air
Hawaiian air
Hawaiian air
Touchin' down
Hit the ground
I'm breathing new air
Can I take this all in?
Can I take this all in?
As we land, you pinch my hand
I'm still here
Can I take this all in?
Can I take this all in?
As the wheels, hit the ground
I'm breathing Hawaiian air
Can I take this all in?
Can I take this all in?
As the heat fills my lungs
I'm breathing Hawaiian air
Can I take this all in?
Can I take this all in?
Hawaiian air
Hawaiian air
Hawaiian air
Hawaiian air
The youngest was the most loved
The youngest was the shielded
We kept him from the world's glare
And he turned into a killer
Retroussé nose
Turned up and mischievous
Forget-me-not eyes
That cried if we ever left his side
There is no such thing in life as normal
There is no such thing in life as normal
The youngest was the most loved
The youngest was the cherub
A small boy from a poor house
Who turned into a killer
A blush, it rose
If he had to say 'hello'
A lop-sided grin
Strained to keep the shyness in
There is no such thing in life as normal
There is no such thing in life as normal
The youngest was the most loved
The youngest was the cherub
The luck was all before him
With a lovely wife beside him
The youngest was the most loved
The youngest was the cherub
We kept him from the world's glare
And he turned into a killer
There is no such thing in life as normal
There is no such thing in life as normal

She says I remind her of her father,
And I know she likes it.
She wants a man that's got his game locked tight.
I think she reminds me of my mother,
When she knows I like it.
I want a woman with the same brown eyes.
And girl, you got it so bad
When the only boy you know is your dad.
And boy, you got it so wrong
When you look into her eyes
And all you really see is your mom. (Oh)
'Cause you're a momma's boy, momma's boy.
She tried to take me to the movies,
But I couldn't enjoy it.
I didn't even let her sneak a touch.
She asked me "What's the problem,
Maybe we can talk about it.
You're thinking 'bout your mother way too much."
And girl, you got it so bad
When the only boy you know is your dad.
And boy, you got it so wrong
When you look into her eyes
And all you really see is your mom. (Oh)
'Cause you're a momma's boy, momma's boy.
Momma's boy, momma's boy.
You're a momma's boy, momma's boy.
You're just a momma's boy, momma's boy. x3
You're just a... Oww
She says I remind her of her father,
And I know she likes it.
She wants a man that's got his game locked tight.
Drinking stolen gin from the rich people's bar next door
And awkwardly
I'm leaning on the shoulder of the cousin who you choose to ignore
And she says won't you calm down
City city won't you calm down
We're never gonna get to the bottom while there's traffic around
Passed a little lonely cleanse
If we play our cards right we can be more than friends
Still
Oh so s-u-d-d-e-nly
So suddenly
Ways of calculating, ways of catapulting you and me
Out of this town
City city won't you calm down
They'll never know we're in here if we don't make a sound
Faster we'll divide all the sense
Into tiny parcels are you hoping it's tense, girl?
When my pass came in, you dropped the ball
It didn't change the way I feel
And I was wishing I'd break down your walls
The kiss will know if lips stay still
There is a line I crossed
And when you missed I lost
I'm not a loser
Girl, you know that I'll be back again
My dear, I went for the steal
Maybe it was rushed
Oh my crush, I've gotta crush
I suppose that I could hold it in
But you excite my every cell
Sources say that senses are your friends
My senses say that I should tell
You that I'm not ashamed
You might just feel the same
But you have to try it
If you're ever really gunna know
My dear, I went for the steal
Maybe it was rushed
Oh my crush, I've gotta crush
I want to
I need to
I have to have you
You're so much to touch
Girl, you're too much
And I can't control it- you've got me all over the road
My dear, I went for the steal
Maybe it was rushed
Oh my crush
Damaging my soul
You blew me off, but I don't mind
I just get better with time
And so do you
So do you
So do you
My crush
The language of the frost lobs dead balloons over ruins today,
In view of wan wordless crowds that chase waifs to spires with fiery plumes,
And incite the firmament's portrait of a drowning in Styx that gives impotents kicks.
Boredom murders the heart of our age while sanguinary creeps take the stage...
Boredom strangles the life from the printed page.
Masking vapor trails from Mercury for a killer on Umbria,
Who crippled birch mares now briars replace their old cotton limbs.
Who will tell? I mean, would it make a difference?
Look, metal flower-petal tears do not even appear in the myopic mirror.
Boredom murders the heart of our age while sanguinary creeps take the stage...
Boredom strangles the life from the printed page.
The moon was sagging in the sky as I held her face to mine,
All our thoughts were coming in so clear beyond the myopic mirror.
We were darting from the place where we just couldn't fit,
Far away from all the violence, safely flying in our own orbit.
Why do I always have to tell you -- forget about the prescient signs, forget about the life we knew.
May we never be stripped of anything we love, may we grow so gentle, never go mental.
May we never go, go mental... may we always stay, stay gentle...
May we never go, go mental... may we always stay, stay gentle...
May we never go, go mental... may we always stay, stay gentle...
May we never go, go mental... may we always stay, stay gentle
Gentle
Gentle
Boredom murders the heart of our age while sanguinary creeps take the stage...
Boredom strangles the life from the printed page.
What was my number? What was my number? I don't care!
Why, I wonder, is my heart full of holes?
And the feeling goes but my hair keeps growing
Will I set the sun
On a big-wheeled wagon
I'm bragging
I'm always in love
When I let go of your throat-sweet throttle
When I clean the lash of your black-belt model
Will I catch the moon
Like a bird in a cage
It's for you I swoon
I'm always in love
I don't get the connection
If this is only a test
I hope I do my best
You know I won't forget
When I fold the cold in my jet-lag palm
When I soak so long I forget my mother
Will I set the sun
On a big-wheeled wagon
I'm bragging
I'm always in love
It's a drag I sang
I'm always in love
I'm worried
I'm always in love
I'm worried
I'm worried
I'm worried
Always in love
I'm worried
I'm worried
I'm worried
Always in love
I'm worried
I'm worried
I'm worried
Always in love
I'm worried
I'm worried
I'm worried
Always in love
When we climbed to the peak we planted a flag
But the moment we had, I felt bad
And then night came, so we got into our sleeping bags
And then someone told a story about something dead and gory
There was heat
From the fire
But I still froze when I saw the ghost
(X2)
I told the gang we weren't welcome
The ghost made that clear
So we stepped back, but it was drawing near
And it lunged for our throats
So we packed our things, made tracks,
Undid our footprints, even furled our flag, and...
We were gone! but what was on the top of the mountain,
The mountain top?
(X2)
Sweet nothing! I made it up
So we would make it down with no claim on Ghost Mountain
I'm walking all by myself
I was talking to myself
About you
What am I gonna do
I was singing this song about you
I was thinking about singin' this song for you
The more I think about it
The more I know it's true
The more I think about it
The more I know it's you
Honey I think you're just right
I was walking, like I said, by myself
I was talking to myself
About you
The more I think about it
The more I know it's true
The more I think about it
The more I know it's you
Honey I think you're just right
It's automatic when I talk with old friends
The conversation turns to girls we knew when
Their hair was soft and long and the beach
Was the place to go
Sun-tanned bodies and waves of sunshine
The California girls and a beautiful coastline
Warmed up weather, let's get together
And do it again
Dom da doo ron
With a girl the lonely sea looks good with moonlight
Makes your nighttimes warm and out of sight
Been so long
(Hey now, hey now, hey now)
(Hey now, hey now, hey now)
(Hey now, hey now, hey now)
(Hey now, hey now, hey now)
Well, I've been thinking 'bout all the places 
We've surfed and danced and all the faces 
We've missed, so let's get back together 
And do it again
Come and do it
(Hey now, hey now, hey now)
(Hey now, hey now, hey now)
(Hey now, hey now, hey now)
(Hey now, hey now, hey now)
Dom da doo ron
Nico, come back home
Show me that you care
And love's not just a flare on my sleeve
Sleep well, I pray that cardboard boxes,
Set the perfect stage.
'Cause wood grain makes all man made things seem so out of date
Life is not a play, it's what we
Make of the people we love.
Snails see the benefits
The beauty in every inch
Oh why, why, why, why, oh, why
Are you quick to kiss?
She bites at blades and leaves
God damn you shrubbery
Well I'm sick of vanity plays
Should we move to the UK?
'Cause life here in the states has escaped
All the people above us.
What we make of those people we love
Snails see the benefits
The beauty in every inch
Oh why, why, why, why, why
Are you quick to kiss?
Baby, maybe I spoke too soon
I'll touch you once you make the first move
Snails see the benefits
The beauty in every inch
I watch her as she runs
My mother jumps the gun
She puts her in her arms
That is just like my mom
Never lets go, never lets me grow old
I wanna pay her back
But love is nothing you can tax
My family's not rich by any means
But I feel we won the lottery, that day
The rock swallowed the girl
And I cried as cameras caught my eyes
My tears turned into butterflies
They fly away as caskets close
A new day comes you'll wake unfold
Smile when you feel the sunlight
You feel the sunlight
You feel the sunlight
You feel the sunlight
Snails see the benefits
The beauty in every inch
Oh why, why, why, why, why
Are you quick to kiss?
Baby, maybe I spoke too soon
I'll touch you once you make the first move
Snails see the benefits
The beauty in every inch, oh
Snails see the benefits
The beauty in every inch
I see you hidden in the night I found you
I see you separate from the others
Bent crooked in the light around you
Bathing in the sight of the others
I couldn't say what I was thinking
My heart shrinking
Two sad sparks blinking in the sun
Wait one minute
I had to listen for it
It was hidden in the fall
Waiting on love to call
I met you in the dead of winter
I stood stranded in the water
Dug deeper than a crooked splinter
I turned away from all the others
Sad hopes I'd hidden under
Tangled inside of me
You spoke like broken thunder
Deep into the center of me
I hear it call in the center of it all
You're the love of my life
I feel it all in the center of my heart
You're the love of my life
Hey girl, you've got a smart way
About you that makes me wish that I was smart enough for you
Hey girl, you've got a fine laugh
And I think that I can get used to that
And you're already used to laughing at me
So what if your friends think I'm crazy, well
I wasn't trying to impress those girls anyway
They're all theory, no action
Where I'm from we live
Like it's the latest attraction
Hey girl, you've got a short fuse
And I've got designs on lighting you up
And setting you off
And watching you burn for me
The world lives for the weekends
Well I watched as my weeks bleed right into them
Without a line to divide what is theirs
And what is mine
So what if your friends think I'm crazy, well
I wasn't trying to impress those girls anyway
They're all theory, no action
Where I'm from we live like it's the latest attraction
Go on, go on, your cruel intentions
Won't solve your problems,
Everyone's gotta get bottom
Bottomed out in the long run
And those are the times you need love
Go on, go on, your cruel intentions
Won't solve your problems,
Everyone's gotta get bottom
Bottomed out in the long run
And those are the times you need love
Go on, go on, your cruel intentions
Won't solve your problems,
Everyone's gotta get bottom
Bottomed out in the long run
And those are the times you need love
Feel sick after every meal I'd say
'Cause I know the life from your burning wheel won't wane
Sleep, I sleep every day
Wipe the cobwebs away
I need to be loved
Christ, I'm out of my mind
I need to be loved
I need to be loved
As I turn to you and I say
Thank goodness for the good souls
That make life better
As I turn to you and I say
If it wasn't for the good souls
Life would not matter
Dive straight in on your girlfriend
Making her feel like there's gonna be a war, oh
Dive straight in at the deep end
Making you feel like there's gonna be a war
As I turn to you and I say
Thank goodness for the good souls
That make life better
As I turn to you and I say
If it wasn't for the good souls
Life would not matter
One good day of the week
And I'll be up again
One good day of the week
I'll be higher than the government
As I turn to you and I say
Thank goodness for the good souls
That make life better
As I turn to you and I say
If it wasn't for the good souls
Life would not matter
As I turn to you and I say
If you're messing with a good heart
You've got to take what's due
Everything was ready but he had to run away
Shot for the money on the very same day
Le garage, le garage-rage
Le garage, le garage-rage
Everything was ready but he had to run away
Shot for the money on the very same day
Le garage, le garage-rage
Le garage, le garage-rage
Bullshit, bullshit, bullshit, bullshit
You, you are the thing
With you tight skin, making me jealous when you're asleep
And I agree, I never think now when I'm with you
And I won't say a word of its true if it's not true
Le garage, le garage-rage
And things pushed in my face
With locked arms, making me nuder to everything
You you give me sound, smashing my styles
I always think now when I'm with you
And I won't say a word of its true if it's not true
Le garage, le garage-rage
And I won't say a word of its true if it's not true
Le garage, le garage-rage
And it all
Comes down to hope
Came down on me
I'm beggin you now
I'm beggin you please
Comes down to hope
Came down on me
Someday spare change
Won't feel the same
Stand up real tall
And wait to be called
Thoughts so strong
I feel them when you're gone
And these
Old walks in the park
And meetings after dark
A sore sight
For sore eyes
Wild and free, you've got no place to be
Oh, comes down to hope, came down on me
Happy, spinning, clapping,
Laughing, dancing, in the blackness of magic.
Get it, have it, bag it,
Throw yourself on the aeroplane and fly like magic.
No sleep, no chance, no need forget about it.
One life, live free,
Big dreams we're all about 'em.
You're finding it, take it,
Take it in it's all a hit
You and me, no one else,
It's nothing else but us right now.
And I ain't need nothing else,
No one else but you and I.
And it ain't me, it ain't you,
It's only us, it's us right now.
You're findin it, take it,
Take it in it's all a hit.
You and me, no one else,
Nothing else but us right now.
And I ain't need nothing else,
No one else but you and I.
And it ain't me, it ain't you,
It's only us, it's us right now.
You and me, no one else,
Nothing else but us right here.
You and I, no one else,
Nothing else but you and I.
(You and I x4)
Time is not the constant my friend,
You can't tell me out of that one again.
Yeah like we gave ourselves the Benz.
To a line I'll never understand.
Speed it up, or if you mean it slow it up a little bit just to speed it back up again.
Ham me up or send me down
And I won't ham it up or simmer down with it brethren.
Nothin' else but us right now
And I ain't need nothing else,
No one else but you and I.
And it ain't me, it ain't you,
It's only us, it's us right now.
You're findin it, take it, take it in it's all a hit.
You and me, no one else, nothing else but us right now.
And I ain't need nothing else, no one else but you and I.
And it ain't me, it ain't you, it's only us, it's us right now.
You and me, no one else,
Nothing else but us right here.
You and I, no one else,
Nothin' else but you and I.
(You and I x6)
Hard to find the words to tell oh-ooh-oh
The story of you and I... oh yeah
Oh there's nothing left just you and I,
No one else, nothing else but you and I.
(You and I x2)
Ain't nobody else
(You and I)
You and I, no one else,
Nothing else but you and I (you and I)
(You and I)
To me ain't nothing else
(You and I)
Yeah nobody else
(You and I)
You and I, no one else,
Nothing else but you... (you and I)
Well, since time had a mind I've been lazy
And times before that I was cruel
And times before that I was mean, I was mad
Honey, I ain't never had nobody like you
And in times before that, well, I was crazy
I saw the dark side of the moon
And the stars in the sky, they never caught my eye
'Cause I ain't never had nobody like you
I ain't never had nobody like you
Now it's just like ABC
Life's just like 123
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I watched my old habits die and it was painful
Sometimes it's painful in the light of the truth
But you kept my fast to the right, I want to thank you tonight
Honey, I ain't never had nobody like you
I ain't never had nobody like you
Now it's just like ABC
Life's just like 123
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I trusted liars and thieves in my blindness
Honey, I was wasting away in a room
But now that I've been through that hell I got a story to tell
Honey, I ain't never had nobody like you
I ain't never had nobody like you
I am the red in the rose
The flowers on the blankets on your bedroom floor
And I am the gray in the ghost
That hides with your clothes
Behind your closet door
I am the green in the grass
That bends back from underneath your feet
And I am the blue in your back alley view
Where the horizon and the rooftops meet
If you cut me, I suppose I would bleed
The colors of the evening stars
You can go anywhere you wish
'Cause I'll be there, wherever you are
(Wherever you are)
I will always keep your gaze
When we are lost in the Technicolor phase
I am the black in the book
The letters on the pages that you memorize
And I am the orange in the overcast
A color that you visualize
I am the white in the walls
That soak up all the sound
When you cannot sleep
And I am the peach in the starfish on the beach
That wish the harbor wasn't quite so deep
If you cut me, I suppose I would bleed
The colors of the evening stars
(My darling)
You can go anywhere you wish
'Cause I'll be there, wherever you are
(My darling)
(Wherever you are)
Living in a city of sleepless people
Who all know their limits and won't go too far
Outside the lines, 'cause they're out of their minds
I wanna get out and build my own home
On a street where reality is not much different
From dreams I've had, the dream is all I have
Daydreaming, daydreaming all the time
Daydreaming, daydreaming into the night
Daydreaming, daydreaming all the time
Daydreaming, daydreaming into the night and I'm alright
Creep past the hours like the shorter hand on the clock
Hanging on the wall of a schoolhouse somewhere
We wait for the bell and we dream of somewhere else
Daydreaming, daydreaming all the time
Daydreaming, daydreaming into the night
Daydreaming, daydreaming all the time
Daydreaming, daydreaming into the night and I'm alright
It's not that I won't remember where I'm from
Just don't wanna be here no more, it's not enough
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (We're only half alive)
I'm gonna go
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (We're only half alive)
Where the rest of the dreamers go
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (We're only half alive)
Where the dreamers go, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Ooh-oh-oh
Daydreaming, daydreaming all the time (A dream is all I have)
Daydreaming, daydreaming into the night and I'm alright
Daydreaming, daydreaming all the time (A dream is all I have)
Daydreamer, we used to be half alive, now I'm alright
I'm alright, I'm alright
It must be getting early
Clocks are running late
Paint-by-number morning sky
Looks so phony
Dawn is breaking everywhere 
Light a candle, curse the glare
Draw the curtains, I don't care
'Cause it's alright
I will get by
I will get by
I will get by
I will survive 
I see you've got your list out
Say your piece and get out
I guess I get the gist of it
But it's alright
Sorry that you feel that way
The only thing there is to say
Every silver lining's got a
Touch of grey
I will get by
I will get by
I will get by
I will survive 
It's a lesson to me
The Ables and the Bakers and the C's
The ABC's we all must face
Try to keep a little grace
It's a lesson to me
The Deltas and the East and the Freeze
The ABC's we all think of
And try to win a little love
I know the rent is in arrears
The dog has not been fed in years
It's even worse than it appears
But it's alright
Cow is giving kerosene
Kid can't read at seventeen
The words he knows are all obscene
But it's alright
I will get by
I will get by
I will get by
I will survive 
The shoe is on the hand it fits
There's really nothing much to it
Whistle through your teeth and spit
'Cause it's alright
Oh well, a touch of grey
Kinda suits you anyway
And that was all I had to say
And it's alright
I will get by
I will get by
I will get by
I will survive 
We will get by
We will get by
We will get by
We will survive 
We will get by
We will get by
We will get by
If you gotta run, run from hope
I know I'll never be lonely
I've got songs in my blood
I'm carrying all the love of an orchestra
Gimme the love of an orchestra (x3)
So now in my deepest sorrow
There's no need for despair
I'm carrying all the love of an orchestra
Gimme the love of an orchestra (x3)
If you gotta run, run from hope
If you don't have a song
To sing you're okay
You know how to get along
Humming
Hmmm
If you don't have a date
Celebrate
Go out and sit on the lawn
And do nothing
'Cause it's just what you must do
Nobody does it anymore
No I don't believe in the wasting of time,
But I don't believe that I'm wasting mine
If you don't have a point to make
Don't sweat it
You'll make a sharp one being so kind
And I'd sure appreciate it
Everyone else's goal's to get big headed
Why should I follow that beat being that I'm
Better than fine
Ooh...
There's a black rainbow upon my house
Match the curtains and the floors
Think I'm glass I think I'm breaking it
Wrecking ball outside the door
Let the children act like furniture
For the ladies of the lawn
But I can't see them, I can't see at all
It's night time all the time
Bird outside the kitchen, fighting his reflection
Tell him I got nothing for him
Bird outside the kitchen, fighting his reflection
What's he gonna win when he wins?
Unkissed boys and girls of paradise
Lining up around the block
Back pockets full of dynamite
While neighbors talk and talk and talk
Bird outside the kitchen fighting his reflection
Tell him I got nothing for him
Bird outside the kitchen fighting his reflection
What's he gonna win when he wins?
Throw the phone out the window
If you want the neighbors woke
You'll have to shout out loud
And set the bell and slow
If you want the neighbors woke
You'll have to shout even louder
Everybody is waiting for everybody to get out
I'll join 'em talking 'bout the people everybody talk about
And all the pretty people party while the petty people pout
Pickin' it up but then I put it back down
Pickin' it up but then I put it back down
Pickin' it up but then I put it back down
We could have given up early when it was dark still, not light
Now it's the 48th hour of a two-day night
And all the pretty people party while the petty people fight
Pickin' it up but then I put it back down
Pickin' it up but then I put it back down
Pickin' it up but then I put it back down
A jack-of-all-trades and a master of none
Why do I have to be bored with being foolish and young? 
The show isn't over, but I'm long since gone
I feel like I let them down when I don't wanna trade my sunshine for a cloudy night
But everybody's pretending the sun won't ever come out
I'll join 'em talking 'bout whatever everybody talks about
And all the pretty people party while the petty people shout
Pickin' it up but then I put it back down
Pickin' it up but then I put it back down
Pickin' it up but then I put it back down
You lost your focus but I got a plan for it
With a secret ingredient
And you are infinitely invited
Just leave alone the Geminis
Two of them and four of eyes
And you are infinitely invited
No one could not agree
It's unanimously decided
They've come for you and me
That we're dangerously surrounded
Their boats are full of flames
They paint the grasses green
Repeating history
They don't say what they mean
Is it amnesia?
Amanaemonesia
Mistaken for magic?
Mistaken for magic
Silver hours, silver hours
Becoming a habit?
Chasing the rabbit
Is it amnesia?
Amanaemonesia
Mistaken for magic
Mistaken for magic
Spacing out in a nook and cranny
It's officially uncanny
It's a fish in a sea of granite
Just leave alone the Geminis
Two of them and four of I's
No one could not agree
It's unanimously decided
They've come for you and me
That we're dangerously surrounded
Their boats are full of flames
They paint the grasses green
Repeating history
They don't say what they mean
Is it amnesia?
Amanaemonesia
Mistaken for magic?
Mistaken for magic
Silver hours, silver hours
Becoming a habit?
Chasing the rabbit
Is it amnesia?
Amanaemonesia
Mistaken for magic
Mistaken for magic
Mistaken for magic
Mistaken for magic
Mistaken for magic
There's a system of symbols that no one can vouch for
Everyone uses and no one believes
There's a dog in the yard with a manner that rough
Yet there's something about you that he understands
The girl at the window
Covered in ashes
Smiles grotesquely in the light of the day
Singing in German the cold summer warning
But I can't remember what I meant to say
Is it amanaemonesia?
Mistaken for magic
Amanaemonesia
Chasing the rabbit
Amanaemonesia
Mistaken for magic
Mistaken for magic
Mistaken for magic
Mistaken for magic
Mistaken for magic
Mistaken for magic
Oh, oh
Hey, hey
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Hey, you, sittin' in your tree
Mummy always wants you to come for tea
Don't be shy, straighten up your tie
Get down from your tree house sittin' in the sky
I wanna know just what to do
Is it very big, is there room for two?
I got a house with windows and doors
I'll show you mine if you show me yours
Gotta let me in, hey, hey, hey
Let the fun begin, hey
I'm the wolf today, hey, hey, hey
I'll huff, I'll puff, I'll huff, I'll puff and blow you away
Say you will, say you won't
Say you'll do what I don't
Say you're true, say to me c'est la vie
Say you will, say you won't
Say you'll do what I don't
Say you're true, say to me c'est la vie
Do you play with the girls, play with the boys?
Do you ever get lonely playing with your toys?
We can talk, we can sing
I'll be the queen and you'll be the king
Hey, boy, in your tree
Thrown down your ladder, make a room for me
I got a house with windows and doors
I'll show you mine if you show me yours
Gotta let me in, hey, hey, hey
Let the fun begin, hey
I'm the wolf today, hey, hey, hey
I'll huff, I'll puff
I'll huff, I'll puff and blow you away
Say you will, say you won't
Say you'll do what I don't
Say you're true, say to me c'est la vie
Say you will, say you won't
Say you'll do what I don't
Say you're true, say to me c'est la vie
Say you will, say you won't
Say you'll do what I don't
Say you're true, say to me c'est la vie
Say you will, say you won't
Say you'll do what I don't
Say you're true, say to me c'est la vie
C'est la vie
C'est la vie
He left a card, a bar of soap and a scrubbing brush next to a note
That said "use these down to your bones"
And before I knew I had shiny skin and it felt easy being clean like him
I thought "this one knows better than I do"
A triangle trying to squeeze through a circle
He tried to cut me so I'd fit
And doesn't that sound familiar? Doesn't that hit too close to home?
Doesn't that make you shiver; the way things could've gone?
And doesn't it feel peculiar when everyone wants a little more?
And so that I do remember to never go that far,
Could you leave me with a scar?
So the next one came with a bag of treats,
She smelled like sugar and spoke like the sea
And she told me don't trust them, trust me
Then she pulled at my stitches one by one,
Looked at my insides clicking
Her tongue and said "This will all have to come undone"
A triangle trying to squeeze through a circle
She tried to blunt me so I'd fit
And doesn't that sound familiar? Doesn't that hit too close to home?
Doesn't that make you shiver; the way things could have gone?
And doesn't it feel peculiar when everyone wants a little more?
And so that I do remember to never go that far,
Could you leave me with a scar?
I think I realized just in time, although my old self was hard to find
You can bathe me in your finest wine but I'll never give you mine
'Cause I'm a little bit tired of fearing that I'll be the bad fruit nobody
Buys
Tell me, did you think we'd all dream the same?
And doesn't that sound familiar? Doesn't that hit too close to home?
Doesn't that make you shiver; the way things could have gone?
And doesn't it feel peculiar when everyone wants a little more?
And so that I do remember to never go that far,
Could you leave me with a scar?
Could you leave me with a scar?
All those bugs buzzin' 'round your head
Well, they fly in the air as you comb your hair
And the summertime will make you itch the mosquito bites
The buzz of love is busy buggin' you
Well, they fly in the air as you comb your hair
And they're splattered up and down your windshield and the headlights
Well, they bite
Yeah, they bite
But you can tell they're there
Does love buzz because that's what it does?
Well, they fly in the air as you comb your hair
And the summertime will make you itch the mosquito bites
Well, they fly in the air as you comb your hair
And they're splattered up and down your windshield and the headlights
Fly in the air, comb your hair
Flies in the air, comb your hair
That girl is giving you the eye, and I and I and I
Don't like it how she makes you laugh so much
How when you're talking, that you touch
She's instantly more pretty and more interesting than me
She is thinking before she speaks
She is not all red and angry
I bet she doesn't like to eat
I bet her feet don't even stink!
I know your eyes are just for me... but...
Kiss that girl and I will shrink up
And I will Die and I will think up
A thousand ways that I can hurt you
And you will never touch my hand
(x2)
Tonnight we have not got on well
I know I have given you hell
I wish, we should have stayed at home
Cause now I'm standing on my own
And you are having a nice time
With a girl I really don't like
I know your eyes are just for my but (t)
Kiss that girl and I will shrink up
And I will Die and I will think up
A thousand ways that I can hurt you
And you will never touch my hand
(x2)
And Baby please don't break my heart
Cause you are the only one I love
I'll be by your side till the very end
'Cause you're my only friend...
Kiss that girl and I will shrink up
And I will Die and I will think up
A thousand ways that I can hurt you
And you will never touch my hand

Always when we fight
I try to make you laugh
Till everything's forgotten
I know you hate that
Ba ba da da ba ba ba ba (2x)
Always when we fight
I kiss you once or twice
And everything's forgotten
I know you hate that
I love you Sunday sun
The week's not yet begun
And everything is quiet
And it's always
You and me always, and forever
You and me always, and forever
Ba ba ba ba da ba, it was always
You and me always
You tell me I'm a real man
And try to look impressed
Not very convincing
But you know I love it
Now we watch TV
Till we fall asleep
Not very exciting
But it's you and
Me and we'll always be together
You and me always, and forever
Ba ba ba ba da ba, it was always
You and me always, and forever
You and me always, and forever
Ba ba ba ba da ba, it was always
You and me always, and forever
You and me always, and forever
Ba ba ba ba da ba ba

It was crime at the time, but the laws, we changed 'em
Though the hero for hire's forever the same one
Introducing for the first time
Pharoah on the microphone. Sing all hail.
What'll be revealed today
When we peer to the great unknown
From the land of the throne
Awakened to cheers after years on the fault line
We are shocked to be here in the face of the meantime
Pharaoh, all your methods have taught me
Is to separate my blood from bone, it will all fail
Feel what I feel today
When we peer to the great unknown
From the land of the throne
Form a line through here
Form a line through here
Form a line to the throne
Form a line to the throne
Form a line through here
Form a line through here
Form a line to the throne
Form a line to the throne
Alone in the chain, it remains to be seen how
How well you can play when the pawn takes a queen now?
Introducing for the first time
Pharoah on the microphone. Sing all hail
What will be revealed today
When we peer into the great unknown
From the land of the throne
Sing all hail
What will be revealed today
When we peer into the great unknown
From the land of the throne
Form a line through here
Form a line through here
Form a line to the throne
Form a line to the throne
Form a line through here
Form a line through here
Form a line to the throne
Form a line to the throne
It was crime at the time but the laws have changed, yeah
It was crime at the time but the laws have changed, yeah
Shake down, you make me break, for goodness sake
I think I'm on the edge of something new with you
Shout out, don't drown the sound
I'll drown you out, you'll never scream so loud
As I want to scream with you
Standing there with your smile blinding your eyes from seeing
My face as I'm dying to figure out a girl
But she drifts so far away, I'm on her coast
So maybe I should stay and map around your world
So Don't Say, These currents are still killing me
And you can't explain
How the wind went and pulled me into your hurricane
Into your hurricane
Stand up don't make a sound, your ears might bleed
There's sweet fluorescent enemies that live inside of me
The world moves faster than I knew, not fast enough
To not creep up on you and the space we put between
So pull me under your weather patterns
Your cold fronts and the rain don't matter
Because a sun burns what I needed
So Don't Say, These currents are still killing me
And you can't explain
How the wind went and pulled you into the hurricane
Into the hurricane
You don't do it on purpose but you make me shake
Now I count the hours until you wake
With your babies breath
Breathe symphonies
Come on sweet catastrophe
Well maybe this time I can follow through
I can feel complete, stop paying dues
Stop the rain from falling
Keep my ocean calm
This time I know nothings wrong
So Don't Say, These currents are still killing me
And you can't explain
How the wind went and pulled me in and no
You Don't Say, These currents are still killing me
And you can't explain
How the wind went and pulled me into your hurricane
Into your hurricane, into your hurricane

Well, I've heard
That the devil is walking around
I sold my soul way down in the dirt
But stole it back now forever in debt
And for a moment I don't even care
Until I felt his breath at my neck
And maybe even you can feel it too
He's on a strike and looking at you
Holding on to his words but baby
I saw an angel become the devil
Still they walk pretty good hand in hand
But baby I don't need any of them
Heaven nor hell
Well I've heard
That the morning star of a prince
Was invoked on a Monday on earth
I found his business card in the mud
And for a moment I don't even care
Until I felt his breath at my neck
And maybe even you can feel it too
He's on a strike and looking for you
Holding on to his words but baby
I saw an angel become the devil
Still they walk pretty good hand in hand
But baby I don't need any of them
Heaven nor hell
Evil came down on earth
And it beholds more than you love, more than you love
Heaven don't fall on earth
What you behold is no longer a word, no longer a word
Well I've heard
That the devil is walking around
I sold my soul way down in the dirt
But stole it back now forever in debt
And for a moment I don't even care
Until I felt his breath at my neck
And maybe even you can feel it too
He's on a strike and looking at you
Holding on to his words but baby
I saw an angel become the devil
Still they walk pretty good hand in hand
But baby I don't need any of them
Heaven nor hell
One, two, three, four
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

And if I lose my patience, oh yeah

There's times I need for you to phone (oh)
Sometimes you make me feel so high
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
There's times I ask myself why
Sometimes I need to be alone
I found a tape in my back garden
A blue cassette covered in dirt
And through the dust the reels start turning
And played some memories stored in it
As I hear your voice 
It sets my heart on fire
That with all the noise
It sets my heart on fire
And I can't stop the reels from turning
I can't stop the tape machine
As I hear your voice it sets my heart on fire
I found a place
I thought was stolen
A place that's built on noise and needs
And in my hand it spins so gently
Fills a void rewinding me
As I hear your voice
It sets my heart on fire
That with all the noise
It sets my heart on fire
And I can't stop the reels from turning
I can't stop the tape machine
As I hear your voice it sets my heart on fire
Lay back down I told myself
How could I ever forget you?
As I hear your voice
It sets my heart on fire
That with all the noise
It sets my heart on fire
And I can't stop the reels from turning
I can't stop the tape machine
As I hear your voice it sets my heart on fire
I found a tape in my back garden
A blue cassette covered in dirt
Is it OK if I speak to you today?
You've been pissed off for a week now
But nothing I could say could make you look up
Or crack up
Is there anything that I can do
Anything to show you
You're a bitch
But I love you anyway
Oh you can't sing
But you still put me to sleep
Baby
You're a bitch
Hey hey
Hey hey
You make me sick
But don't ever go away
So you tell me that there's nothing left to say
I drive you face the window
Then you're in my face telling me to grow up
I wish you'd grow up
I can't wait until you fall asleep
I wonder if you know that
You're a bitch
But I love you anyway
Oh you can't sing
But you still put me to sleep
Baby
You're a bitch
Hey hey
Hey hey
You make me sick
But don't ever go away
You're a bitch
But I love you anyway
Oh you can't sing
But you still put me to sleep
Baby
You're a bitch
Hey hey
Hey hey
You make me sick
But don't ever go away
Yeah you're a bitch but I love you anyway
So why don't you...
Stay
Well look out, Sunshine, here they go
They got yesterday's heroes in last night's clothes 
You're a game old boy, judging by the way you walk 
Well there's no use telling me to leave 
I've seen a half a dozen ghosts but I don't believe 
I'm a cynical cunt and I'm much too lazy to change
And tell my friends I'll be around 
Getting nowhere sleeping somewhere 
With a girl I dreamed oh yeah 
And sing that old song, how does it go? 
Look out, Sunshine, here's the punchline 
No one gets you anymore
Well look out, Sunshine, here they come 
But they only play for money, you better not run 
It's the sell out show that no one wants to go to, yeah 
Well there's none so blind as them that don't agree 
They steal the money from your pockets almost viciously 
You're a sane old boy, you're much too crazy to change
And tell my friends I'll be around 
Getting nowhere sleeping somewhere 
With a girl I dreamed oh yeah 
And sing that old song, how does it go?
Look out, Sunshine, here's the punchline 
No one gets you anymore
But what do you mean? 
You were born to love this scene 
And they would string you up gladly 
If they knew just how lazy you'd been
Tell my friends I'll be around 
And tell my friends I'll be around 
Getting nowhere, sleeping somewhere 
With a girl I dreamed oh yeah 
And sing that old song, how does it go? 
Look out, Sunshine, here's the punchline 
No one gets you any, no one needs you any 
No one gets you anymore

Yeah
Let me through, paper in fist
Jessica numbers tell me if we're clear
Write me a storm, just tape the letter to the door
This thing is your mission
The lone-wishin' condition
Brave another road
Jessica numbers to the wall slip through
Ever the thief is posed to hero, but we'll see
This thing is your mission
The lone-wishin' condition
Push me through, counting the miles
Measuring all my shadows by old star shifting to red
Just tape the numbers to the bed
Head-tripping on the sadness as it passes
As word across the window frosting out
Starting to feel the kicking here at last
Yes, something worth keeping an eye on
Let me through, paper and fist
Jessica numbers give me this
Let's fall, look where we land
Just write the answer on my hand
This thing is your mission
The lone-wishin' condition
This thing is your mission
The lone-wishin' condition
Jessica numbers are due
Jessica numbers are due
Jessica numbers are due
Oregon girl I've been around the world 
But I've never seen another Oregon girl.
Oregon girl with your lips and curls;
I want a taste of that Oregon girl.
There's a mountain.
There's a time to.
They were put up there to keep us apart.
So I watch you making plans and I make plans.
You could kick a drum but
You just try to stop me now 
From movin' on with an Oregon girl.
Hey!
Wait for me another year or two
I will graduate and marry you.
You roll the number and I'll buy the lumber
To build a house up on an Oregon hill.
There's a mountain.
There's a time to.
They were put up there to keep us apart.
So I watch you making plans and I make plans.
You could grow a thumb
But you just try to stop me now
From movin' on with an Oregon girl
(Spoken:) Mira papi, tranquilo ok, vos boludo que te pasa? Venite para aca
Y dale a esos hijos de puta un sonrisita
Take back what they've taken if you wanna play it safe
Keep on money makin'
Gotta save for rainy days
Take it slow, oh yeah you never know
Strike while it's hot
There ain't that much room at the top
Oh yeah gotta make your way to the top
Gotta get to the top
Party queens
If you wanna be seen
Take a shit where you sleep
And smile real wide for the pa-pa-pa-pa-paparazzi
Pa-pa-pa-pa-paparazzi everywhere
Hear hear! Now you're famous
Do you know the price you pay?
Hope that ain't contagious
I ain't gonna live that way
Thank you, no
But I don't need to go to that spot
Get these climbers off my jock
Oh yeah gotta stay away from my jock
Step the fuck off of my jock
Party queens
If you wanna be seen
Take a shit where you sleep
And smile real wide for the pa-pa-pa-pa-paparazzi
Pa-pa-pa-pa-paparazzi everywhere
Party queens

Sample: - So hard to say goodbye
Meaning it today
I've said goodbye before
Leaving you alone
By the sea
So hard to say goodbye
SFA: - Hello sunshine
Come into my life 
In honesty 
It's been a while
Since we had reason left to smile
Hello sunshine
Come into my life
I'm a minger
You're a minger too
So come on minger
I want to ming with you
In honesty it's been a while
Since we had reason left to smile
Hello sunshine
Come into my life
You're not so innocent
You're a disgrace to your country
If you fled a million miles
I'd chase you for a day
(If I could be bothered)
Hello sunshine
Come into my life
We should get jerseys, 'cause we make a great team
But yours would look better than mine, 'cause you're outta my league
And I know that it's so cliche to tell you that everyday
I spend with you is the new best day of my life
Everyone watching us just turns away with disgust
It's jealously, they can see that we've got it going on
And I'm racking my brain for a new improved way
To let you know you're more to me than what I know how to say
You're ok with the way this is going to be
Cause this is going to be the best thing we've ever seen
If anyone can make me a better person you could
All I gotta say is I must've done something good
I came along one day and you rearranged my life
All I gotta say is I must've done something right
I must've done something right
Maybe I'm just lucky, 'cause it's hard to believe
Believe that somebody like you'd end up with someone like me
And I know that it's so cliche to talk about you this way
But I'll push all my inhibitions aside
It's so very obvious to everyone watching us
That we have got something real good going on
And I'm racking my brain for a new improved way
To let you know you're more to me than what I know how to say
You're ok with the way this is going to be
Cause this is going to be the best thing we've ever seen
If anyone can make me a better person you could
All I gotta say is I must've done something good
I came along one day and you rearranged my life
All I gotta say is I must've done something right
I must've done something right
If anyone can make me a better person you could
All I gotta say is I must've done something good
I came along one day and you rearranged my life
All I gotta say is I must've done something right
I must've done something right
If anyone can make me a better person you could
All I gotta say is I must've done something good
I came along one day and you rearranged my life
All I gotta say is I must've done something right
I must've done something right
Wind is cold all right back in Dallas
When neon light from the building
Lets you know you're home
You'd go way back when
If you wanted to be my friend
Do you call me
I'll understand it's true
I don't feel like I'm falling
No I don't feel like I'm falling
No I don't feel like I'm falling down
Just say hello to the ground
Bah bah bah bah bah bah
Wait there, I'll be right back
Down in Times Square
It's a heart attack
All the feeling
That makes you feel so new
Hey, trees fall and so do men
Even the walls start caving in
And you feel like there's no pretend for you
I don't feel like I'm falling
No I don't feel like I'm falling
No I don't feel like I'm falling down
Just say hello to the ground
We could talk if days weren't so fast
And mistakes just leave it so unsure
Wanna hold you like never before
'Cause we're falling and I love you more and more
Do you feel like you're falling down
Do you feel like you're falling down
I don't feel like I'm falling falling falling down
I don't feel like I'm falling
No I don't feel like I'm falling
No I don't feel like I'm falling down
Just say hello to the ground
Bah bah bah bah bah bah
I don't feel like I'm falling
No I don't feel like I'm falling
No I don't feel like I'm falling down
Do you feel like you're falling down
Do you feel like you're falling down
I don't feel like I'm falling falling falling
Just say hello to the ground.
Windows down as the night blows in
Tap the beat on the wheel as the tires spin
Until we're there crank the radio
We'll join in with the songs we know
Hey, everything's right, said everything's right tonight
Hey, everything's right, said everything's right tonight
Smiles light up as we walk in
Old conversations begin again
Nostalgia's thick as the August air
It takes us back to a time when we didn't care, we didn't care
Hey, everything's right, said everything's right tonight
Hey, everything's right, said everything's right tonight
Oh, everything's right, said everything's right tonight
Hey, everything's right, said everything's right tonight
Hey, everything's right, said everything's right tonight
Hey, everything's right, said everything's right tonight
Hey, everything's right, said everything's right tonight
Everything's right...
Just the memory of you
It feels like poison
Still the memory of you
It feels like poison
It kills like poison
Why you do the things you do?
It feels like poison
I can only love you
It feels like poison
If not for you
No love in front of me
Nobody told you
It's not how it's supposed to be
Make a wish and blow it out
Love will begin again
I don't want to be a clown
The whole town is laughing
Behind my back, you're supposed to be a friend
If not for you
No love in front of me
Nobody told you
It's not how it's supposed to be
It's not how it's supposed to be
It's not how it's supposed to be
It's not how it's supposed to be
It's not how it's supposed to be
It feels like poison
Why you do the things you do?
It feels like poison
Why you do the things you do?
It feels like poison
Why you do the things you do?
It feels like poison
Some philosophies fuel the belief in the self
Constructed to keep one's goods on one's own shelf
Built well, you're a strong letter "I"
With your feet on the ground and your head to the sky
Now and then you can bend
It's okay to lean over, lean over my way
You fear that you can't do it all
And you're right
Even day takes relief every day
from its work making light from the night
And when you're holding me
We make a pair of parentheses
There's plenty space to encase
Whatever weird way my mind goes
I know I'll be safe in these arms
When you're holding me
We make a pair of parentheses
There's plenty space to encase
Whatever weird way my mind goes
I know I'll be safe in these arms
If something in the deli aisle makes you cry
Of course I'll put my arm around you
And I'll walk you outside
Through the sliding doors
Why would I mind?
If something in the deli aisle makes you cry
Of course I'll put my arm around you
And I'll walk you outside
Through the sliding doors
Why would I mind?
You're not a baby if you feel the world
All of the babies they can feel the world
That's why they cry
And when you're holding me
We make a pair of parentheses
There's plenty space to encase
Whatever weird way my mind goes
I know I'll be safe in these arms
When you're holding me
We make a pair of parentheses
There's plenty space to encase
Whatever weird way my mind goes
I know I'll be safe in these arms
If something in the deli aisle makes you cry
Of course I'll put my arm around you

When you're holding me
We make a pair of parentheses
There's plenty space to encase
Whatever weird way my mind goes
I know I'll be safe in these arms
It's morning

We may never find our reason to shine
But here and now this is our time
And I may never find the meaning of life
But for this moment I am fine 
So, come on over
Down to the corner
My sisters and my brothers of every different color
Don't ya feel that sunshine telling you to hold tight
Things will be alright
Try to find a better life
Come on over
Down to the corner

Nice day for a walk in the park.
Nice day for a drive through the city.
This world is a warm, sunny park.
Nice day for a talk with your girl.
Nice day for your shop to get busy.
This world is of no empty part.
Please don't ask me all those questions I don't know.
Please don't ask me all those questions I don't know.
And when you wake up early and the sun is shining,
Are you ready for a day that's comin'?
It's comin'.
Nice day for a walk in the dark.
Nice day for a drive-by shooting.
This world has a warm, sunny heart.
Yeah.
Found a flaw in the ending of a book that I've read twice, 
I set her straight, it's not based on your life. 
There's tension in this room, 
We'll have butterflies soon, 
Fumbling 'round in the dark with a flashlight. 
No need to be uncalm, 
We'll leave it by the phone, 
A message you can swallow, 
A letter to sign, 
No need to be alarmed, 
We'll leave this all alone, 
And all the guilt will follow you in a line. 
There's tension in this room, 
We'll have butterflies soon, 
Fumbling 'round in the dark with a flashlight
After six hours of school I've had enough for the day

We going to the disco
We gonna eeeelope to Meeeexico
Called up my mama, said I'm in love with a stripper, yo
Ten grand, let me see you shake it like you got no
Bones in your body and you was made to be a celebrity
Twenty grand, know it's a sin, but before me you show
Me a little more skin it would fulfill my fantasy
Thirty grand, to the highest bidder but Chris Rock
Said, 'There's no sex in the champagne room'
Forty grand, looked into her eyes, I saw tears falling
Down, type of tears that money couldn't buy
Just 'cause she dances go go

Wyclef:
Excuse me, what is your name?
(Ho)
Uh, my name is ho, yo
I was blessed with the body of the Goddesses
Have you any idea how hard this is?
I could flex in 25 positions
But I only work here to pay my tuition
Yo, tantalizing teaser
Table-top pleaser
Give me what I need a
Mastercard or Visa
Lap dance fantasy
Picture us unda your white canopy
Wyclef extended his hand to me
Like Billy D. said he's feelin' me
Take me away from here, so far
Where they ride horses, no cars
No more stripping in bars
Me and you 'Clef, against the odds
Just 'cause she dances go go

Fronting like the Budweiser commercial
Talking bout, 'IIIIIII, I don't be going to the strip joints'
You lying man! You'd be surprised who you see up in there man.
I got one question for you liars, man)
Shot callers, What are you a preacher?
You calling her a hooker? He without sin cast the first stone.
I met her on the subway, she gave me that VIP card

Got nothing but funny money, man. New York Dogs.)
I know he knocks you off your feet
You're so bitter; you think he's sweet
Well he's wrong for you, I swear
Did you forget to read the script?
There was never a role for him
It was always you and me, just me
Popular mechanics for broken hearts could help me now
I know you never felt romance
And we always lack suspense
I can edit those parts out
I never made you feel complete
I would fall beneath your feet
I would never bring you down, so down
Popular mechanics for broken hearts could help me now
Just because he loves you too
He would never take a bullet for you
Don't believe a word he says
He would never cut his heart out for you
I heard he wrote you a song
But so what
Some guy wrote 69
And one just ain't enough 
And there's so sense in trying
I know 'cause I've been 
Trying all the time to find something that would make you mine
But all I ever find my love
Are cliches that don't rhyme 
Popular mechanics for broken hearts could help me now
Just because he loves you too
He would never take a bullet for you
Don't believe a word he says
He would never cut his heart out for you
And so begins, begins our odyssey...
And we begin, begin our odyssey...
And so begins, begins our odyssey...
The aria is bleeding and the boyish voice is leaving.
I've been an evil tenor, I filled the innocent's doe-eyes with glue.
You're my only softness, you're my only pleasure, it's true.
And I never want to be your little friend, the abject failure.
And so begins, begins our odyssey...
And we begin, begin our odyssey...
And so begins, begins our odyssey...
The chrysalis is breaking and the superego's waking.
I've been a gloomy Petrarch, with a quill as weepy as Dido.
You're my mousy aesthete, you're my buoyant cherub, it's true.
And I never want to be your little friend, the abject failure.
The aria is bleeding and the boyish voice is leaving.
I've been an evil tenor, I filled the innocent's doe-eyes with glue.
You're my only softness, you're my only pleasure, it's true.

Wakin' up in someone else's bed,
Was what I was waitin' for
Oh my days what have I done,
She saw me sneaking out the door
What have I been waiting for,
Been wasting all my time
Watchin' my youth slip away
Surely is a crime
And no, she don't know what we do in our spare time
No she don't know that we've been up all night
All night, all night, all night
We go on and on and on and on and on
Never knowing where, never knowing where
We gonna, we gonna, we gonna end up in the morning
We go on and on and on and on and on
Never knowing where, never knowing where
We gonna, we gonna, we gonna end up in the morning
Sun is out while I'm walkin' home,
And my heads up in the clouds
Trying to get my self to bed
But I really don't know how,
And no, she don't know what I do in my spare time
No she don't know that we've been up all night
All night, all night, all night
We go on and on and on and on and on
Never knowing where, never knowing where
We gonna, we gonna, we gonna end up in the morning
We go on and on and on and on and on
Never knowing where, never knowing where
We gonna, we gonna, we gonna end up in the morning
When I get myself home to my bedroom,
I'm gonna sleep all day till the sun sets
I'm gonna sleep all day till the sun sets
I'm gonna sleep all day till the sun sets
I'm gonna sleep all day till the sun sets
We go on and on and on and on and on
Never knowing where, never knowing where
We gonna, we gonna, we gonna end up in the morning
We go on and on and on and on and on
Never knowing where, never knowing where
We gonna, we gonna, we gonna end up in the morning
If yer always tryin' to get to the top
You don't get to the bottom of nothin'!
Then you're gone before you know it;
You'd better stop! (STOP!)
Learn a little givin' and lovin'
It's been done before
C'mon, do it again!
'Cause if it's good
Then you should share it round
What's the use of keeping
All the good things that you've found to yourself?
Learn a little, learn a little
Learn a little givin'
Learn a little, learn a little
Learn a little givin' and lovin'
You don't gotta keep no other man down
For you to get up
There's no need to worry
Just don't give away your self-respect
'Cause if it's all you've got left
The rest don't really matter now anyway honey!
But give away love (GIVE IT!)
And give it for free
No strings attached
Just don't ask for it back
Learn a little, learn a little
Learn a little givin'
Learn a little, learn a little
Learn a little givin' and stop!
Givin'! Learn a little givin'
It's been done before
C'mon do it again!
Learn a little, learn a little
Learn a little givin' and lovin'
Wake up, you know I feel OK
Go to sleep, it's just another day
I know someday I'll find it
Where I, I least expect it
My doctor says that I should take it
At least I won't have to keep faking
I know someday I'll find it
Where I, I least expect it
Today I know I feel OK
Baby, look at me with those eyes of grey
But I'll keep trying to stay this way
I know it's love that's got me feeling OK
I took my own advice for once
I gave it up, I gave it up
I know someday I'll find it
Where I, I least expect it
Today I know I feel OK
Baby, look at me with those eyes of grey
When I get down, I get so down
But I'll keep trying to stay this way
I know it's love that's got me feeling OK
Feeling OK, feeling OK
Feeling OK, feeling OK
You won't count to seven 
It's usually 'til ten 
To hell with Sydney girls 
You're much better than them 
On my mattress I've been drawing a line 
Where I'll shut my eyes and where you should lie 
You should lie 
If you should lie 
I'll be a lighter of fires 
You be the fighter of fires 
I'll be the lighter of fires 
You be the fighter of fires 
Should I choose to stay here now all depends 
On buildings, buses, streets, trees, rain and friends 
On my mattress I've been drawing a line 
Where I'll shut my eyes and where you should lie 
You should lie 
If you should lie 
I'll be a lighter of fires 
You'll be a fighter of fires 
I'll be a lighter of fires 
You be a fighter of fires
Six in the morning
The men started working
I can't sleep
No, I can't sleep
I keep feeling the lights
So I think I should get up and call you
Going to find you
And it's fun
Thinking of you like a movie star
And it's dumb
Thinking of you like the way that you were
Everyone loves you
The boy in the corner
The postman
The policeman
It does me no good 
To keep looking ahead at your future
Adoration
And it's fun
Thinking of you like a movie star
And it's dumb
Thinking of you like the way that you were
Every moment like a sudden pleasure
Every moment that will get you by
And it's going to cause a crisis
Might just lose a little faith
I've seen all kinds of strangers
The rich and the famous
They don't count
No, they don't count
Now I'm back on my beat
On the same greasy street
There's an angel on my shoulder
Saying, "Ho, have you ever said an honest word?"
Saying, "Yo, have you ever said a pretty word?"
Every moment like a sudden pleasure
Every moment that will get you by
And it's going to cause a crisis
Might just lose a little faith
Don't touch me
If you touch me you could never go back
Faith
Come on, sister have a drink
Have a seat at the bar
Tell me all about your men
And your hopes 
And the hours of your life
You could love
After all that's what you're looking for
You can love
It's a currency unspoken of
But it's hard to form a good opinion
Yet you're going to look at me that way
And it's going to cause a crisis
Might just lose a little faith
Don't touch me
If you touch me you can never go back
Faith
Come on, sister have a drink
Have a seat at the bar
Tell me all about your men
And your hopes 
And the hours of your life
Back on the road again
Feeling kinda lonely
And looking for the right guy
To be mine
Friends say I'm crazy cause
Easily I fall in love
You gotta do it different J

Give me all your love now
'Cause for all we know
We might be dead by tomorrow
I can't
Go on wasting my time
Adding scars to my heart
'Cause all I hear is
"I'm not ready now"
And I can tell
That you didn't have
To face your mother
Losing her lover
Without saying goodbye
Without saying goodbye
'Cause she didn't have time
I don't want to judge
What's in your heart
But if you're not ready for love
How can you be ready for life?
How can you be ready for life?
So let's love fully
And let's love loud
Let's love now
'Cause soon enough we'll die
'Cause soon enough we'll die
'Cause soon enough we'll die
'Cause soon enough we'll die
'Cause soon enough we'll die
'Cause soon enough we'll die
Alors tu vois comme tout se mêle
Et du cœur à tes lèvres je deviens un casse-tête
Ton rire me crie de te lâcher
Avant de perdre prise et d'abandonner
Car je ne t'en demanderai jamais autant
Déjà que tu me traites comme un grand enfant
Et nous n'avons plus rien à risquer
? part nos vies qu'on laisse de côté
Mais il m'aime encore
Et moi je t'aime un peu plus fort
Mais il m'aime encore
Et moi je t'aime un peu plus fort
C'en est assez de ces dédoublements
C'est plus dur à faire qu'autrement
Car sans rire c'est plus facile de rêver
? ce qu'on ne pourra jamais plus toucher
Et on se prend la main comme des enfants
Le bonheur aux lèvres un peu naïvement
Et on marche ensemble d'un pas décidé
Alors que nos têtes nous crient de tout arrêter
Il m'aime encore
Et toi tu m'aimes un peu plus fort
Mais il m'aime encore
Et moi je t'aime un peu plus fort
Et malgré ça il m'aime encore
Et moi je t'aime un peu plus fort
Mais il m'aime encore
Et moi je t'aime un peu plus fort
Encore
Et moi je t'aime un peu plus fort
Mais il m'aime encore
Et moi je t'aime un peu plus fort
Et malgré ça il m'aime encore
Et moi je t'aime un peu plus fort
Mais il m'aime encore
Et moi je t'aime un peu plus fort
Et malgré ça il m'aime encore
Et moi je t'aime un peu plus fort
Mais il m'aime encore
Et moi je t'aime un peu plus fort
Et malgré ça il m'aime encore
Et moi je t'aime un peu plus fort
Mais il m'aime encore
Et moi je t'aime un peu plus fort
Aw you've got flaws
That you won't admit
Yet you tell me it's a sin
That I don't believe in...
Yet you traded in your cross
For a chance to dance with stars
Now nothing is sacred
I've given thought to leaving
F-f-f-for sometime
If only I could read a map
My moat is New Mexico
So it's you I wrote
I starting sending you a note
Oh how I hope that you're happy
I hear you're somewhere in the sand
And how I wish I was an ocean
Maybe then,
I'd get to see you again
And all my friends
They break and they bend
They take shape and they tend
To get better with time
And I say
"Who am I to work so much less
You get more
You all deserve what I am walking towards
If you want you should move away"
This has become a weakness
The golden state wins again
Perhaps its time I settle
Say "it's blue
At least that's a plus"
Plus
I miss you so much
I starting sending you a note
Oh how I hope that you're happy
I hear you're somewhere in the sand
And how I wish I was an ocean
Maybe then,
I'd get to see you again
Why am I scared of people in a room?
Why can't they see a good time
Are the people close to you?
Why don't I just give in?
Have a drink and shake some hands
Oh ey oh
Oh ey oh
Why am I scarred from what she did to me?
Why can't I trust anyone?
No, not even me
Why don't I just give in?
Have a drink and shake some hands
Oh ey oh
Oh ey oh
I've given thought to leaving
F-f-f-for sometime
Maybe it's time I put a profile up
Of who I want to be
Fool everyone
I could start over clean
I could hide behind a big blue screen
Or you could return to me
Return to me
Oh how I hope that you're happy
I hear you're somewhere in the sand
And how I wish I was an ocean
Oh no
How I hope that you're happy
I hear you're somewhere in the sand
You know I wish I was an ocean
Maybe then,
I'd get to see you again
I'd get to see you again...
You 
You think it's cool to be crazy 
I say you're born rich 
Stay rich 
There's no point in taking chances 
And me 
I wouldn't call it a sophomore slump 
I'd say I'm one step closer to being just 
Where I want 
To be 
Away from this scene 
Away from this machine 
Meet me in the middle 
C'mon let's make up a dance 
We'll agree to call it The Compromise 
Step one: 
Find a partner 
Grab a pen 
Don't you dare ask questions 
Just sign on the dotted line 
Step two: 
Throw your partner behind a desk 
Where they'll do absolutely nothing 
So it's your job to dance and smile 
The whole time 
Don't call it a trend 
It's the only way we think to get ahead 
Meet me in the middle 
C'mon let's make up a dance 
We'll agree to call it The Compromise 
There's no sense in complaining 
It doesn't change our mind 
Take me by the hand 
Let's Compromise 
I can feel your feet touching mine 
If you can't dance 
There's someone else in line
Oh life, with your shoulders in the mirror
From the park when Dakota ran and brought you there
In the car when your mother lost her temper
The catalog and the catastrophic smile
Let the bugles play the sermon on the raid
I kissed you on the face
I kissed you on the playground
Oh Father John, you cannot tell me
What's right and wrong
You cannot tell me
I jump before I get around you
Oh Father John
Pick it up with the band on the Ronald Reagan Tollway
(Don't give up, let's go forget about yourself)
Illinois in it ran from the Ronald Reagan Tollway
Forget about yourself and all your plans
Oh life, with your colorful surprises
Eleanor, how you put one on disguises
Oh Father John, you cannot tell me
What's right and wrong
You cannot tell me
In the mortal life
Far in the morning light
We're back from Bloomington
We let the runners win
Far in the morning light
We let the movies play
A weekend from the holiday
Pick it up with the band 
On the Ronald Reagan toll way
(Don't break down, let's go: forget about yourself)
Illinois in it ran from the Ronald Reagan toll way
(If I'm wrong makes nothing right about yourself)
Snowmobile on the field where the gunners throw their weight around
Forget about yourself and all your plans
You're such a strange girl
I think you come from another world
You're such a strange girl
I really don't understand a word
You're such a strange girl
I'd like to shake you around and around
You're such a strange girl
I'd like to turn you all upside down
You're such a such a such a strange girl
The way you look like you do
You're such a strange girl
I want to be with you
I think I'm falling
I think I'm falling in
I think I'm falling in love with you
With you
You're such a strange girl
I want to be with you
Early in the morning clouds are dropping on my head
Remind me the things last night I should have left unsaid
So please forgive the words I use, my mind it tends to run
Away with the small ideas, I know I'm not the only one
So dear, oh dear
My head it tends to stray away sometimes I can't see clear
Oh dear, oh dear
In spite of all the things I said, I always want you near
Sometimes it rains, sometimes it pours
Sometimes I'm not that sure
But anytime you look at me
Your thoughts I can't ignore
The second hand would pass us by
Should one of us had blinked
But in a minute realize that true love always waits
My dear, oh dear
My head it tends to stray away, sometimes I can't see clear
Oh dear, oh dear
In spite of all the things I said, I always want you near
Early in the morning clouds are dropping on my head
Remind me the things last night I should have left unsaid
So please forgive the words I use my mind it tends to run
Away with the small ideas I know I'm not the only one
Leaf by leaf and page by page
Throw this book away
All the sadness, all the rage
Throw this book away
Rip out the binding and tear the glue
And all of the grief we never even knew
We had it all along
Now it's smoke
The things we've written in it
Never really happened
All the things we've written in it
Never really happened
And all of the people come and gone
Never really lived
All the people come have gone
No one to forgive
Smoke
We will not write a new one
There will not be a new one
Another one, another one
Here's an evening dark with shame
(Throw it on the fire)
Here's the time I took the blame
(Throw it on the fire)
Here is the time when we didn't speak
It seems, for years and years
And here's a secret
No one will ever know
The reasons for the tears
They are smoke
Smoke
Smoke
We will not write a new one
There will not be a new one
Another one, another one 
Where do all the secrets live?
They travel in the air
You can smell them when they burn
They travel
Those who say the past is not dead
Can stop and smell the smoke
You keep saying the past is not dead
Well, stop and smell the smoke (you keep saying)
You keep on saying the past is not even past (you keep saying)
And you keep saying (you keep saying)
We are smoke
Smoke
Smoke
When I get you home
I'll never let you go
Too bad it never lasts long
When I'm all alone
You creep into my mind
And I pretend it's you by my side
You look a little better, each day to me
And you try a little harder each day to be
Everything that I wanted in you
And do everything that I need you to do
Morning dreams come true
'Cause I wake up next to you
And only for your eyes
Do I sing these lullabies
Everything you do is all I need to know
'Cause I'm yours
I'll never let you down
Anywhere you are is where I want to be
Anywhere, anytime or place
You look a little better, each day to me
And you try a little harder each day to be
Everything that I wanted in you
And do everything that I need you to do
Morning dreams come true
'Cause I wake up next to you
And only for your eyes
Do I sing these lullabies
You look a little better, each day to me
And you try a little harder each day to be
Morning dreams come true
'Cause I wake up next to you
And only for your eyes
Do I sing these lullabies
Morning dreams come true
Morning dreams come true
Morning dreams come true
Morning dreams come true
Well, there's nothing more to add before I leave
This thing of ours is dead, but don't you grieve
Is it me, or are they younger every night?
Just because they can doesn't make it all right
I'm hanging by my teeth
Waiting on quick relief
While the kids don't sleep for days
I could die in a hundred odd ways
And I'm so sick of hearing how your love for this has died
But don't tell me you could do it if you tried
It's a shame or a sham, he's half as old as I am
But don't tell me he could look good if he tried
Well, it terrifies the life from out of me
It's really such a lazy way to be
Hiding in the bedroom
Climbing up the walls
You've got to kick it out of me gently
Till it begs and pleads and crawls
And I'm so sick of hearing how your love for this has died
But don't tell me you could do it if you tried
It's a shame or a sham, he's half as old as I am
But don't tell me he could look good if he tried
And I'm so sick of hearing how your love for this has died
But don't tell me you could do it if you tried
It's a shame or a sham, he's half as old as I am
But don't tell me he could look good if he tried
And would you make sure my mother gets half my weight in gold?
Tell her I just did what I was told
Grab you expensive coat, and bury it inside
But don't tell me you could do it if you tried
Somebody remind me where I am
Miami or Timbuktu?
Did I ever tell you my uncle's monkey ran away from the zoo?
Would you tell me what this all means
What happens if I go through that door?
'Cause I'm looking up at the ceiling, but it's turning into the floor
When I'm bored, I, kinda drift away
I'm not sure, quite, why we work all day
I've been thinking, and I've got this plan
Let's go, right now
Come meet me in the sky I'll be waiting for you
And we can't hear what they say
Up in my air balloon, air balloon, air balloon, air balloon (ha)
Sing, sing along, along any song you want to
Now we're so high, it can't rain
Up in my air balloon, air balloon, air balloon (ha)
Na na na na na na... mmmm
Na na na na na na... mmmm
I don't like dropping names but Kurt Cobain is all in my face
How the hell am I gonna tell him Elvis already took first base?
In and out of the blue this cruise is losing altitude, all we need
Is a little more elevation, take me back to where I can breathe
When I'm bored, I, kinda drift away
I'm not sure, quite, why we work all day
I've been thinking, and I've got this plan
Let's go, right now
Come meet me in the sky I'll be waiting for you
And we can't hear what they say
Up in my air balloon, air balloon, air balloon (ha)
Sing, sing along, along any song you want to
Now we're so high, it can't rain
Up in my air balloon, air balloon, air balloon (ha)
Na na na na na na... mmmm
Na na na na na na... mmmm
Na na na na na na... mmmm
Na na na na na na... mmmm
Shake it, sh- shake shake it now
Gimme, gimme some
Sailing sa-sailing through the clouds
Trippin' trip trip it now
Shake it, sh- shake shake it now
Gimme, gimme some
Sailing sa-sailing through the clouds
Trippin' trip trip it now
Yeah
Come meet me in the sky I'll be waiting for you
And we can't hear what they say
Up in my air balloon, air balloon, air balloon (ha)
Sing, sing along along any song you want to
Now we're so high it can't rain
Up in my air balloon, air balloon, air balloon (ha)
Come meet me in the s...
Up in my air balloon, air balloon, air balloon (ha)
Come meet me in the s...
Up in my air balloon, air balloon, air balloon (ha)
T-t-t-t-t-t-touch
If one of these two walls could speak
I'd turn the, lights down long enough to hit repeat (babe)
Right now my vision is gone, and magic's to blame
It's silent down here, hey I want to get loud again
You'll hold the thunder while I bring the rain
I might be busy doing nothing but I've had my share
You've got a strange infatuation with a love that's in the air
Contact high
I'm done dreamin' that we can fly
Am I guilty? Boy you decide
I've got nothing to hide
Four letter words won't hold any sway (uh uh)
Here in a paradise that shakes the word romantic to the bone
Mystical forces are circling me, while perfect nostalgia is dating the enemy
Lost in the ether with no one to blame
It's silent down here, maybe I want to get loud again
Contact high
I'm done dreamin' that we can fly
Am I guilty? Boy you decide
I've got nothing to hide
(When we touch I get a)
Contact high
I'm done leaving if we can try
Am I guilty? Boy you decide
I've got nothing to hide
I might be busy doing nothing but I've had my share
You've got a strange infatuation with a love that's in the air
Contact high
I'm done dreaming that we can fly
Am I guilty? Boy you decide
I've got nothing to hide
(When we touch I get a)
Contact high... contact high... contact high
Your heart is broken
To your surprise
You're sick of crying
For blue eyes
So tired of living
Misunderstood
Think hard woman
I think you should
Come, sorrow is so peculiar
It comes in a day, then it'll never leave you
You take a pill, wonder if it will fix you
They wonder why sorrow has never left you
I'm talkin' bout blue eyes, blue eyes
What's the matter, matter
Blue eyes, blue eyes
What's the matter matter
So blind, so blind
What's the matter, matter
Blue eyes, blue eyes
What's the matter with you?
Your heart got broken,
On the underground
Go find your spirit
In a lost and found
Oh I've been watching
How you behave
Not much like a lover
More like a slave
Come, sorrow is so peculiar
It comes in a day, then it'll never leave you
You take a pill, wonder if it will fix you
They wonder why sorrow has never left you
I'm talkin' bout blue eyes, blue eyes
What's the matter, matter
Blue eyes, blue eyes
What's the matter matter
So blind, so blind
What's the matter, matter
Blue eyes, blue eyes
What's the matter with...
Blue eyes, blue eyes
What's the matter matter
Blue eyes, blue eyes
What's the matter matter
So blind, so blind
What's the matter, matter
Blue eyes, blue eyes
What's the matter with you?
What's the matter with you?
What's the matter with you
Instrumental
(Now this is all me, now this is all me)
(Yeah, yeah)
Watch out for late phone calls
Wheat paste and concrete walls
Go too far, live too long
Time's too short, right and wrong
Block after block
Block after block
Roll-down gates look the same
Different trips, different trains
Hey friends, break in the back door
And turn it up while the lights are out
Eyes closed and shouting right now
Lights turn on and dark turns up
Side by side, dream bigger
Next in line, it's late
Now this is all me
Now this is all me
Lights turn on and dark turns up
Side by side, dream bigger
Next in line, it's late
Now this is all me
Now this is all me
Eat when you're hungry and
Sleep when you're slipping like
Tired dogs rest their paws
Today we show our flaws
Block after block
Block after block
It's one way, now on Wythe
What was left now is right
Hey friends we'll jump the turnstiles
And cut it down
While the lights are out
Eyes closed and shouting right now
Lights turn on and dark turns up
Side by side, dream bigger
Next in line, it's late
Now this is all me
Now this is all me
Lights turn on and dark turns up
Side by side, dream bigger
Next in line, it's late
Now this is all me
Now this is all me
I think it takes a pile of bricks
For us to make a home
And I'm not sure but I hear
Mountains grow from just a stone
Block after block
Block after block
Everything I've learned
Every step I took and street I've walked
Lights turn on and dark turns up
Side by side, dream bigger
Next in line, it's late
Now this is all me
Now this is all me
Lights turn on and dark turns up
Side by side, dream bigger
Next in line, it's late
Now this is all me
Now this is all me
I shoulda known better not to wait around
Why did I come home, 'cause I hate it here
I shoulda known better not to wait around
I'm getting rid of my phone, and I made it clear
I shoulda known better not to wait around
Never did, never did I ever love anyone other than you
But secretly I always want to see you cry
So I push you until you do
Check it out
I shoulda never came, I shoulda never
Shoulda never came but you insisted for (you insisted for) me to (me to)
Crossed the line, didn't mean to
Take it back if I thought it'd make it work
Never did but I meant to, I, I, I give up...
I never did what you said that I did when I was gone for so long
(You did what you said that I did when I was gone)
I never said what you did was either right or wrong
It's wrong, you dreamt of him
If it's just me, adjust me baby
Find the words that define these feelings
Roll your eyes when you look at me
Hard to talk when you're staring at the ceiling
Push through, push through baby
Everything we've been through lately
I'll be there when close your eyes
Hold you tight, say goodnight
I never did what you said that I did when I was gone for so long
(You did what you said that I did when I was gone)
I never said what you did was either right or wrong
It's wrong, you dreamt of him
I never did what you said that I did when I was gone for so long
(You did what you said that I did when I was gone)
I never said what you did was either right or wrong
It's wrong, you dreamt of him
I, I needed, I, I, I needed someone to talk to
And you, you needed you, you, you needed me to hold you
I, I needed, I, I, I needed someone to talk to
And you, you needed you, you, you needed me to hold you
I never did what you said that I did when I was gone for so long
(You did what you said that I did when I was gone)
I never said what you did was either right or wrong
It's wrong, you dreamt of him
I never did what you said that I did when I was gone for so long
(You did what you said that I did when I was gone)
I never said what you did was either right or wrong
It's wrong, you dreamt of him
I'll believe when the walls stop turning
I'll believe when the storm is through
I believe I hear them say
David won't you stop writing songs 
I never wanna shake their hands and stay
I never wanna shake their hands and stay
Oh no let's go
We are young
We are one
Let us shine for what it's worth
To your place, place, place
We're on our way, way, way
We're on our way, way, way
We're on our way somehow
Hold me close, close, close
We're losing time, time, time
We're losing time, time, time
I'm falling to the ground
I'll believe when the sky is burning
I'll believe when I see the view
I believe that I hear them say
David won't you stop dreaming now
And everybody clap your hands and shout
And everybody clap your hands and shout
Oh no they shout
We are young, we are one
Let us shine for what it's worth
To your place, place, place
We're on our way, way, way 
We're on our way, way, way
We're on our way somehow
Hold me close, close, close
We're losing time, time, time
We're losing time, time, time
I'm falling to the ground
We are young, we are one
Let us shine for what it's worth
To your place, place, place
We're on our way, way, way
We're on our way, way, way
We're on our way
Hold me close
We're losing time
Hold me close
We're falling to the ground
Taxi driver, sun is rising
Damn the sirens, keep on driving
Flashing light, oh what a night
I miss her bed, I lost my head
And it's sunning, we're still running
For her rooftop, our last stop
Barefoot, naked, don't you let me go
To your place, place, place
We're on our way, way, way
We're on our way, way, way
We're on our way somehow
Hold me close, close, close
We're losing time, time, time
We're losing time, time, time
We're falling to the ground
We are young, we are one
Let us shine for what it's worth
To your place, place, place
We're on our way, way, way
We're on our way, way, way
We're on our way
(La la la la la)
This night will never end
This night will never end
This night will never end
This night will never end
Hold me close, we're losing time
Hold me close, we're falling to the ground
Na-na, na-na-na (oh)
Na-na, na-na-na (oh)
Na-na, na-na-na (oh)
Na-na, na-na-na
Oh, been trying to let it go
Trying to keep my eyes closed
Trying to keep it just like before
The times we never even thought to speak
Don't wanna tell you what it is
Oh wee, it felt so serious
Got me thinking just too much
I wanna set it off, but
It's this one thing that got me trippin'
It's this one thing that got me trippin'
(You did) This one thing my soul may be feeling
It's this one thing you did (oh-oh, oh-oh, oh)
It's this one thing that caught me slippin'
It's this one thing, I want to admit it
(You did) This one thing and I was so with it
It's this one thing you did (oh-oh, oh-oh, oh)
Hey, we don't know each other well
So why I keep thinking to myself
Memories just keep ringing bells
(Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh)
Hear voices I don't want to understand
My car keys are jingling in my hand
My high heels are clicking towards your door
(Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh)
It's this one thing that got me trippin'
It's this one thing that got me trippin'
(You did) This one thing my soul may be feeling
It's this one thing you did (oh-oh, oh-oh, oh)
It's this one thing that caught me slippin'
It's this one thing, I want to admit it
(You did) This one thing and I was so with it
It's this one thing you did (oh-oh, oh-oh, oh)
Maybe I just can't believe it
It's this one thing you did (oh-oh, oh-oh, oh)
I can't deny, tired of tryin'
Nothing left to do but to keep on seein' uou
I'm hoping you can keep a secret
For me, for me, for me
But what you did, yeah
It's this one thing that got me trippin'
It's this one thing that got me trippin'
(You did) This one thing my soul may be feeling
It's this one thing you did (oh-oh, oh-oh, oh)
It's this one thing that caught me slippin'
It's this one thing, I want to admit it
(You did) This one thing and I was so with it
It's this one thing you did (oh-oh, oh-oh, oh)
(Oh whoa, whoa) I can't help it, it's just, uh
(Oh whoa, whoa) It's just, uh
(Oh whoa, whoa) It's that
(Oh whoa, whoa) I don't wanna fight
Na-na, na-na-na (oh)
(Oh)
Na-na, na-na-na (oh)
Na-na, na-na-na (oh)
Na-na, na-na-na (oh)
Oh, whoa
It's this one thing that got me trippin'
It's this one thing that got me trippin'
(You did) This one thing my soul may be feeling
It's this one thing you did (oh-oh, oh-oh, oh)
It's this one thing that caught me slippin' (oh no)
It's this one thing, I want to admit it
(You did) This one thing and I was so with it
It's this one thing you did (oh-oh, oh-oh, oh)
It's this one thing that got me trippin'
It's this one thing that got me trippin'
(You did) This one thing my soul may be feeling
It's this one thing you did (oh-oh, oh-oh, oh)
It's this one thing that caught me slippin'

Oh, whoa, whoa (oh-oh, oh-oh, oh)
Tell them I'm doing great;
Doing well is pretty vague.
Single Mom I wanna get that number;
You look as strong as you did before;
But you know we're all tied, one to one:
Class Historian.
You cut in line, you're cutting cake;
You cut a line, was a big mistake;
But you can get back home, you can get back down;
You know that you're cutting ties when you cut in town,
And you know we're all tied, and it's tied at one:
Class Historian.
You know you really gonna live yo' suenos;
You know you really gonna wet my dream;
But you know you got it up, you gotta get that number.
You look as strong as you did before;
But you could get back home, you can get back down;
You know that you're cutting ties when you cut in town;
But you could get back down, you can get back down.
You know you're catching the fever, you know you're catching the fever,
You know that we're all tied, and it's tied at one:
Class Historian.
We're all tired, and I wonder one,
Who knows this as Class Historian.
We're all tied, and it's one on one,
But you know this as Class Historian.
Well you could get back down,
You could get back down ('storian)
Back down, you could get back down, ('storian)
And you could get back down, you could get back down,
And you could get back down, you could get back down,
And you could get back down, you could get back down,
And you know this Class Historian.
I lost the signal and put you away
Swore upon the sun I'd save you for a rainy day
Loosen the noose then let go of the rope
I know if it's never coming back, it has to go
I keep calling your name (Keep calling your name)
I wanna hold you close but I never wanna feel ashamed
So I keep calling at night (Keep calling at night)
I wanna hold you close, I just never wanna hold you tight
Goodness gracious I can't seem to stop
Calling it off
Calling it off just to keep crawling to your arms
I've found the weakness and put it to play
Swore upon the stars I'd keep you till the night was day
Shake my head dizzy so I'll never know
You said if you're never coming back you have to go
I keep calling your name (Keep calling your name)
I wanna hold you close but I never wanna feel ashamed
So I keep calling at night (Keep calling at night)
I wanna hold you close, I just never wanna hold you tight
Goodness gracious I can't seem to stop
Calling it off
Calling it off just to keep crawling to your arms
Oh my goodness, here I go again
Pulling you back to me
Pulling you back into my arms so selfishly
I don't think I understand, 'cause I don't really know myself
I keep calling you up, calling you up
Calling you up
Calling you up
Calling you up
(So, I can call)
Some plans were made and rice was thrown
A house was built, a baby born
How time can move both fast and slow
Amazes me
And so I raise my glass to symmetry
To the second hand and its accuracy
To the actual size of everything
The desert is the sand
You can't hold it in your hand
It won't bow to your demands
There's no difference you can make
There's no difference you can make
And if it seems like an accident
A collage of senselessness
You aren't looking hard enough
I wasn't looking hard enough
An argument for consciousness
The instinct of the blind insect
Who makes love to the flower bed
And dies in the first freeze
Oh I want to learn such simple things
No politics, no history
Till what I want and what I need
Can finally be the same
I just got myself to blame
Leave everything up to fate
When there's choices I could make
When there's choices I could make
Yeah, my heart needs a polygraph
Always so eager to pack my bags
When I really wanna stay
When I really wanna stay
When I wanna stay (x4)
The arc of time, the stench of sex
The innocence you can't protect
Each quarter note, each marble step
Walk up and down that lonely treble clef
Each wanting the next one
Each wanting the next one to arrive
Each wanting the next one
Each wanting the next one to arrive
An argument for consciousness
The instinct of the blind insect
Who never thinks not to accept its fate
That's faith, there's happiness in death
You give to the next one
You give to the next on down the line
You give to the next one
You get to the next on down the line
The levity of longing that
Distills each dream inside my head
By morning watered down again
On silver stars I wish and wish and wish
Move on to the next one
Move on to the next one down the line
Move on to the next one
Move on to the next one down the line
You get to the next one
You get to the next on down the line
You get to the next one
You get to the next on down the line
Do you know what it's like to fall on the floor
Cry your guts out till you got no more?
Hey man, now you're really livin'
Have you ever made love to a beautiful girl
Made you feel like it's not such a bad world?
Hey man, now you're really livin'
Now you're really giving everything
And you're really getting all you gave
Now you're really livin' what this life is all about
Well, I just saw the sun rise over the hill
Never used to give me much of a thrill (hey)
But hey man, now I'm really livin'
(Hey)
(Hey)
(Hey)
Do you know what it's like to care too much
'Bout someone that you're never gonna get to touch?
Hey man, now you're really livin'
Have you ever sat down in the fresh-cut grass (hey)
And thought about the moment and when it will pass? (hey)
Hey man, now you're really livin'
Now you're really givin' everything
And you're really gettin' all you gave
Now you're really livin' what this life is all about
Now what would you say if I told you that
Everyone thinks you're a crazy old cat?
Hey man, now you're really living
Do you know what it's like to fall on the floor (hey)
Cry your guts out till you got no more? (hey)
Hey man, now you're really livin'
Have you ever made love to a beautiful girl (hey)
Made you feel like it's not such a bad world? (hey)
Hey man, now you're really livin'
People, sing
(Do you know what it's like to fall on the floor
Cry your guts out till you got no more?
Hey (Hey man, now you're really living)
Well, I just saw the sun rise over the hill
Never used to give me much of a thrill
Hey man, now I'm really living
(Hey
Hey)
People, hey (hey)
(Hey)
(Hey)
One! Two! Three! Four!
One! Two! Three! Four!
One! Two! Three! Four!
Any more tears for the birthing pool?
Bear this child directly into misery
Kiss him in the face with no lips and no tongue
But with your little, middle, index and ring fingers
Singing "I see songs in shapes and colours
Like nuclear physics or pottery ovens
Fluid lines that soar like towers
Patterns reformed just like child actors"
Plunge your hand, rip out my spine
Replace it with a UV light
So I can be the beacon of hope that you'd always expected
These constant broken heartbeats sound like breakbeats
Looping round and round to me
You know he's so much more like Spiderman than you will ever, ever be
So stick with your instincts
Stick with the imprints
With the hieroglyphics that the fan clubs sent us
And roll with the toppers
Just like steady choppers
Bat it with your eyelids
And lose it with your static
Go b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b - honeeeeey!
I'm taking far too many chances
On these less than idealistic romances
Plunge your hand, rip out my spine
Replace it with a UV light
So I can be the beacon of hope that you'd always expected
These constant broken heartbeats sound like breakbeats
Looping round and round to me
You know he's so much more like Spiderman than you will ever, ever be.
I got troubles oh, but not today
'Cause they're gonna wash away
They're gonna wash away
And I have sins Lord, but not today
'Cause they're gonna wash away
They're gonna wash away
And I had friends oh, but not today
'Cause they're done washed away
They're done washed away
And oh, I've been cryin'
And oh, I've been cryin'
And oh, no more cryin'
No, no more cryin' here
We get along Lord, but not today
'Cause we gonna wash away
We gonna wash away
And I got troubles oh, but not today
'Cause they gonna wash away
This old heart gonna take them away
When I can work out how it was
Then I'll tell you
TV stained my memories
Yeah, I don't fit the shoes
Remember through sounds, remember through smells
Remember through colors, remember through towns
With fear and fascination on what was here
And what's replacing them now
Interchange plazas, and malls, and crowded chain restaurants
More housing developments go up named after the things they replace
So welcome to Meadow Brook and welcome to Shady Space
Well, it all seems a little abrupt, well no, I don't like this change of pace
É só isso
Não tem mais jeito
Acabou, boa sorte!
Não tenho o que dizer
São só palavras
E o que eu sinto
Não mudará
Tudo o que quer me dar
É demais
É pesado
Não há paz
Tudo o que quer de mim
Irreais
Expectativas
Desleais
That's it
There's no way
It's over, Good luck!
I've nothing left to say
It's only words
And what l feel
Won't change
Tudo o que quer me dar / Everything you want to give me
É demais / It's too much
É pesado / It's heavy
Não há paz / There is no peace
Tudo o que quer de mim / All you want from me
Irreais / Isn't real
Expectativas /expectations
Desleais
Mesmo se segure
Quero que se cure
Dessa pessoa
Que o aconselha
Há um desencontro
Veja por esse ponto
Há tantas pessoas especiais
Now even if you hold yourself
I want you to get cured
From this person
Who advises you
There is a disconnection
See through this point of view
There are so many special people in the world
So many special people in the world, in the world
All you want
All you want
Tudo o que quer me dar / Everything you want to give me
É demais / It's too much
É pesado / It's heavy
Não há paz / There's no peace
Tudo o que quer de mim / All you want from me
Irreais / isn't real
Expectativas / That expectations
Desleais
Now we're falling, falling, falling , falling into the night, into the night
Falling, falling, falling, falling into the night
Um bom encontro é de dois
Now we're falling, falling, falling , falling into the night, into the night
Falling, falling, falling, falling into the night
Some people ride the wave of generosity,
Some people ride the wave of mediocrity.
Me, I ride the wave of never gonna drown,
Oh, just fooling around.
Now I gots the balloons,
And you, you gots the mud.
And me I gots the snail,
And you, you gots the stuff.
Well you got so much more than I figured was in store,
Oh, I ain't foolin no more.
Now some people ride the cat when asleep or when awake,
Some people ride a cat for riding a cat's sake.
Me I ride this cat 'cause its claws have got my eyes,
I'll get 'em back in a few more tries.
Oh, I'll get 'em back in a few more tries.
Some people write the books that tenderize their names,
Some people write the books that bastardize our claims.
Me, I write the book that's sifting in the sand,
Aw, some day I'll understand.
Aw, some day I'll understand.
Some people write the songs that stay inside our souls,
Some people write the songs that really ain't songs at all,
Me, I write the song that ends right when it starts,
They'll split before they part.
Oh, they'll split before they part.
On the table
The deal that kept the courts at arm's length
Stealing our thoughts with the force of their non sequiturs
Amateurs
On the table
The view behind the legs of dancers
Windows of chance there, lost on the trail of dissent
Innocent
Do re mi, innocent
On the table
The deal between the thieves and exits
Common and breathless, shrugging at what they've become
Number one
On the table
The steal that kept the courts at arm's length
Stealing our hearts with the force of the new evidence
Innocent
Do re mi, innocent
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Now the plain blondes are playing along with you
Now the plain blondes are playing along with you
With you
On the table
Our hopes become a starting pistol
Though we have missed all the minutes, we know what we've won
Are we done?
On the table
The deal between the legs of mankind
Walking a straight line, copping a plea as they went
Innocent
Do re mi, innocent
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Now the plain blondes are playing along with you
Now the plain blondes are playing along with you
On the table
On the table
On the table
On the table
We shall walk again
Down along the lane
Down the avenue
Just like we used to
With our heads so high
Smile at the passers by
And we'll softly sigh
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay
Everyone, everyone, everyone, everyone
Everyone, everyone, everyone, everyone
By the winding stream
We shall lie and dream
We'll make dreams come true
If we want them to
Yes, all will come
Play the pipes and drum
Sing a happy song
And we'll sing along
Everyone, everyone, everyone, everyone
Everyone, everyone, everyone, everyone
We shall walk again
Down along the lane
Down the avenue
Just like we used to
With our heads so high
Smile at the passers by
And we'll softly sigh
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay
Everyone, everyone, everyone, everyone
Everyone, everyone, everyone, everyone
Oh yeah you look at me
When my baby
Is taking my hand
And we're walking and talking
And my parents
They don't wanna see me
My friends say I'm uncool
But I let love rule
Oh yeah
It's just because I'm crazy in love
Crazy in love
Oh yeah
It's just because I'm crazy in love
Crazy in love
Oh no
Don't you touch my boyfriend
He's not your boyfriend
He's mine
Oh no
Don't you touch my boyfriend
He's not your boyfriend
He's mine
Oh yeah you look at me
When my baby
Is taking my hand and we're walking and talking
A-and my parents
They don't wanna see me
My friends say I'm uncool
But I let love rule
Oh yeah
It's just because I'm crazy in love
Crazy in love
Oh no
Don't you touch my boyfriend
He's not your boyfriend
He's mine
Oh no
Don't you touch my boyfriend
He's not your boyfriend
He's mine
This boy really drives you mad
And you know that ain't bad, oh yeah
You'll love him till you die
This boy really drives you mad
And you know that ain't bad, oh yeah
You'll love him till you die
This boy really drives you mad
And you know that ain't bad, oh yeah
You'll love him till you die
Don't you touch my boyfriend
He's not your boyfriend
He's mine
Oh no
Don't you touch my boyfriend
He's not your boyfriend
He's mine
Oh no
O-o-oh

O-o-o-i-o-i-oh
O-o-o-i-oh
O-o-oh
O-o-oh
O-o--o-i-o-i-oh
O-o-o-i-oh
And if I die today I'll be the happy phantom
And I'll go chasing the nuns out in the yard
And I'll run naked through the streets without my mask on
And I will never need umbrellas in the rain
I'll wake up in strawberry fields every day
And the atrocities of school I can forgive
The happy phantom has no right to bitch
The time is getting closer
The time to be a ghost
Every day we're getting closer
The sun is getting dim
Will we pay for who we've been?
So if I die today I'll be the happy phantom
And I'll go wearing my naughties like a jewel
They'll be my ticket to the universal opera
There's Judy Garland taking Buddha by the hand
And then these seven little men get up to dance
They say Confucius does his crossword with a pen
I'm still the angel to a girl who hates to sin
The time is getting closer
The time to be a ghost
Every day we're getting closer
The sun is getting dim
Will I pay for who I've been?
Or will I see you, dear, and wish I could come back?
You found a girl that you could truly love again
Will you still call for me when she falls asleep
Or do we soon forget the things we cannot see?
The time is getting closer
The time to be a ghost
Every day we're getting closer
The sun is getting dim
Will I pay for who I been?
And if I die today
And if I die today
And if I die today
Chasing nuns out in the yard
Woke up with rain on my head
Can't drive off so what should I do instead?
Swim to the biggest flower there
To warm (?) you and kiss you, my love
So when the storm clouds dissolved into thin air
Like when my hands got lost in your thick hair
The dogs barked long days, not dark
The sky's blue so what should we do?
We can do anything we want to
Millions of sunsets, but the one I'll remember
The one where you told me you'd love me forever
Took a long walk into the woods
Climbed in the world's biggest tree
And then they tried to cut it down
But we didn't make a sound
The sun blinded them
They couldn't see
Woke up next to you in your bed
Another day to do it all again
Creeped out into the sun
Another day to give you all my love
Millions of sunsets but the one I'll remember
Millions of sunsets but the one I'll remember
Millions of sunsets but the one I'll remember
Is the one where you told me you'd love me forever
Come on, come out of the rain
You're not impressed, you're just too learned
And I took the book, I lit the page
Your sabbatical was burning
Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet fires in the street
Let's sully every stage
Lick my lips and twist my hips
But contessa, I already did
Some things work, but me
I choose to lose my skin in the dirt
This whiskey priest, he burned the church
To keep his girls alive
Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet fires in the street
Let's sully every stage we meet
Lick my lips and twist my hips
But contessa, I already did
Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet fires in the street
Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet fires in the street
Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet fires in the street
Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet fires in the street
Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet fires in the street
Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet fires in the street
Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet fires in the street
Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet fires in the street
Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet fires in the street
Love bird, you flew into my window
Now in the sticky love nest sits a widow
The tree it fell on all the people
Who'd gathered there to watch it topple
Now turn around, it's burning down
The city we live in
Should we mobilize?
Take them by surprise?
Let them have their way with us?
Wounds be by old enemies
Broke my heart to see
Foundations ripped apart
And investments fade away
I guess we got off to a bad start
No oxygen
What is the outcome?
Hungry humans
We've got to eat some of them
We'll burn those bridges
When we come to them
I'm not just their leader
I'm also one of them
The food supply has been depleted
The river's ran dry just when it was needed
The rats come out to take it over
Singing, squeaking, "We built this city"
It's hard to breathe
But we couldn't leave
Nowhere left to go
Almost everybody died
Drank the tears from those who cried
We shriveled from the sodium
And a map was found with an X on it
So we followed it there
And what did we find?
An underground design
As we entered in to our surprise
Oxygen
Rivers and playgrounds (?)
The ancients just stayed down
They never stopped moving
We stumbled towards them
But they locked all the barn doors
So we had to dig deeper
We had to dig deeper
And the deep was dark
I wanted to sleep forever
Wake up later, maybe never
We had to build a civilization
Let the planet focus on the planet's rotation
We tried, we tried
We really tried
But no one could do it
Not really alive
Never learned how to survive
We were humans being useless
No oxygen
What is the outcome?
Hungry humans
We've got to eat some of them
We'll burn those bridges
When we come to them
I'm not just their leader
I'm also one of them
We fade into oblivion
No traces of civilized living eating the earth
We're fading to oblivion
No traces of civilized living eaten by earth
Everything you are to me
Makes me think that you could be
The end to all my
Everything you touch turns right
Underneath your very eyes
Everybody's life rolls by
Like a melancholy song
Can you see me differently?
I believe that you see me
Everything you are to me
Makes me think that you could be
The end to all my
Everything you touch turns right
Underneath your very eyes
All around I see raining
Things don't seem to go my way
Got a dark cloud that's hanging
And it seems to follow me
Oh won't you just wake up
Feel the humming
This cruel world is killing you
Better start running
Catch up with your life, catch on up
Before the whole thing is through
Have you once? Have you twice?
Have you even considered
It be really good for you
To go out and go on
Take another better look around
You are just another white boy
Thinking you're so hardcore
Take step outside see what's shaking in the real world
Go take a step outside see what's shaking in the real world
But you don't know
How my heart laments
I really got a good excuse
To complain
My parents got divorced
Can't heal the pain
And now there is only cheap regrets
I guess that's just the way it be
Is it the world or how I see me
Boy now you are really, really bugging
Yes you are bugging me,
Can't you just shut right up
Your cup is overflowing, overflowing
And you think it is indeed
You don't even know what side
You are fighting for
Boy won't you turn your game boy off
Start pretending
It's you against the world
I am sick and I am tried of hearing
I really got a good excuse to complain
My parents got divorced
Can't heal the pain
And now there is only cheap regrets
I guess that's just the way it be
Is it the world or how I see me
Go take a step outside see what's shaking in the real world
I walked all morning to lift my heart, 
'Cause the world keeps dancing with the paperman.
I love you never talk in dreams, 
But now it's here your happiness is real.
Oh make some big jumps, big jumps,
You're afraid to break some bones.
Come on make some big jumps, big jumps,
Life is yours alone.
You hold your head up, your head up high, like you think I do.
Sometimes I feel so confused,
I'm under the illusion that I have to choose.
I love you always know the way,
The way back home always is the same.
Oh make some big jumps, big jumps,
You're afraid to break some bones.
Come on make some big jumps, big jumps,
Life is yours alone.
You hold your head up, your head up high, like you think I do.
Tick-tock, this clockwork will stop, 
You're the key for winding up my heart.
Brick-brack, if you don't wind me up,
The sky will lie upon me like a passed-out drunk.
Without you I would never rise again.
Without you I would never rise.
Hey there sunshine lift my heart,
I know life is long but it goes so fast.
I love you never feeling old,
You never bought the rubbish that they sold.
Oh make some big jumps, big jumps,
You're afraid to break some bones.
Come on make some big jumps, big jumps,
Life is yours alone.
You hold your head up, your head up high, like you think I do.
Oh make some big jumps, big jumps,
You're afraid to break some bones.
Come on make some big jumps, big jumps,
Life is yours alone.
You hold your head up, your head up high, like you think I do.
Hey Annie, well look at you
Is that a new boy stuck on your shoe?
Come on Annie, how is it so?
You've always got a new bubble to blow
I'm gonna tell you how it's gonna get done
I'm just a girl that's only chewing for fun
You spit it out when all the flavor has gone
Wrap him round your finger like you're playing with gum
Oh no, oh no, you've got it all wrong
You think you're chocolate when you're chewing gum
Oh no, oh no, a slip of the tongue
You think you're chocolate but you're chewing gum
Oh no
Was there anything else?
Hey Annie, you used to be
The only girl to take it seriously
Come on Annie, tell us your trick
On how you keep on getting boys to stick
Okay I'll tell you why I never look back
It's my selection, it's my pick of the pack
Well hot dog, I'm a chewing machine
It makes me smile and it keeps my teeth clean
Oh no, oh no, you've got it all wrong
You think you're chocolate when you're chewing gum
Oh no, oh no, a slip of the tongue
You think you're chocolate but you're chewing gum (I just wanna chew gum)
Oh no, oh no, you've got it all wrong
You think you're chocolate when you're chewing gum
Oh no, oh no, no you're not the one
You think you're chocolate but you're chewing gum
Oh no
I don't want to settle down
I just wanna have fun
I don't want to settle down
I just wanna chew gum
I don't want to settle down
I just wanna have fun
I don't want to settle down
I just wanna chew gum
Oh no, oh no, you've got it all wrong
You think you're chocolate when you're chewing gum
Oh no, oh no, a slip of the tongue
You think you're chocolate but you're chewing gum
Oh no, oh no, you've got it all wrong
You think you're chocolate when you're chewing gum
Oh no, oh no, no you're not the one
You think you're chocolate but you're chewing gum
Oh no
La (X46)
Oh no!
Tell me that we'll always be together
We'll be riding horses all the way
'Cause boy I feel that men are meant to be
More than the shadows of each other
This road is finally standing up to the sky
Boy we're free, so what is fate to say
How things are gonna turn out now?
If storms are breaking over great escapes
Boy, we'll find how to make it with the rain
This rage will lead us through the burning plains
No matter what they say, we're heroes, boy we'll get to break out
Now we're finally standing up to the sky
Look at me, boy, so what is fate to say
How things are gonna turn out now?
Can't you see that we're dead until we wake up
All your dreams are about to happen now
We are racing to the break of dawn
RedOne
Pixie
All my friends are going out but I've been thinking
Maybe I better stay in bed
The ceiling's spinning 'round like I've been drinking
I've got this banging in my head
Boom, boom, boom
I need my medicine
And the cure ain't aspirin
I don't care about tomorrow
Here we go again, here we go again
I'll be the last one on the dance floor
When this party ends, when this party ends
I don't even care, no, I don't even care, no
Never wanna say I wish that I'd been there
I don't even care, no, I don't even care, no
Never wanna say I wish that I'd been there
I'll sleep through the alarm head under pillow
I know I'm gonna pay for this
I can't stand missing out so when you call me, call me
I'll say okay if you insist
Boom, boom, boom
I need my medicine
And the cure ain't aspirin
I don't care about tomorrow
Here we go again, here we go again
I'll be the last one on the dance floor
When this party ends, when this party ends
I don't even care, no, I don't even care, no
Never wanna say I wish that I'd been there
I don't even care, no, I don't even care, no
Never wanna say I wish that I'd been there
Never wanna say I wish that I was there
Never wanna say I wish that I was there
Never wanna say I wish that I was there
I don't care about tomorrow
Here we go again, here we go again
I'll be the last one on the dance floor
When this party ends, when this party ends
I don't even care, no, I don't even care, no
Never wanna say I wish that I'd been there
I don't even care, no, I don't even care, no
Never wanna say I wish that I'd been there
All I need, all all I need
All I need, all all I need
All I need, all all I need
All I need, all all I need
All I need, all all I need
All I need, all all I need
It's early in the morning
I'm laughing at the sun.
My mirror disappoints me, and
Am I the only one?
All I need, all all I need
All I need, all all I need
All I need, all all I need
Is you smiling at me
All all I need,
All I need, all all I need
All I need, all all I need
Is life, love, with you
I think I'm getting closer
But the scenery's the same
Am I a disappointment?
I'll blame it on the pain
It's all I need, all all I need
All I need, all all I need
All I need, all all I need
Is you smiling at me
All all I need,
All I need, all all I need
All I need, all all I need
Is life, love, with you
 
All I need is you
Is all I need, 
If you could simply believe
In me, and we would be forever together
All I need, all all I need
All I need, all all I need
All I need, all all I need
Is you smiling at me
All all I need,
All I need, all all I need
All I need, all all I need
Is you smiling at me
All I need is you
Is all I need
All I need is you
Is all I need
All I need is you
Is all I need
Is life, love, with you.

And I could never tell as a kid
What that window door went to
Only told to stay away
I almost had an accident, age 6
When I found the key in the attic
And now the smell of these wood frames
Is the only sense I've left
So as you pull me from the bed
Tell me I look stunning and cadaverous
And since you are my friend
I would ask that you lower me down slow
And tell the man in the black cloak
He doesn't need to trouble his good soul
With those Latin conjugations
And if it's all the same to them
You should tell your gathering friends
Please not to purse their faces grim
On such a lovely Sunday
Don't fix my smile, life is long enough
We will put this flesh into the ground again
Don't fix my smile, life is long enough
We will put this flesh into the ground again
Don't fix my smile, life is long enough
We will put this flesh into the ground again
Don't fix my smile, life is long enough
We will put this flesh into the ground again
Don't fix my smile, life is long enough
We will put this flesh into the ground again
Don't fix my smile, life is long enough
We will put this flesh into the ground again
(Hey, hey)
Hey, I see you working it
I see you strutting down the street, you look important, huh?
I walk the other way, I don't wanna bother you with my sobriety
(Hey, hey)
We used to share the summers nights riding our stolen bikes
But now I don't interest you, I'm like a blog from 1999
I only see you when you're walking, walking to somewhere
You're so restless, what can be over there?
I only see you when you're walking, walking to somewhere
You're so restless, it must be special there
(Hey, hey)
And the next night I see you sitting over there with girl #115
Your fashion caught her eye? Another conquest of your personality
I've tried to indicate that she could be someone for me
But every weekend I see you walking with her quarter to three
I only see you when you're walking, walking to somewhere
You're so restless, what can be over there?
I only see you when you're walking, walking to somewhere
You're so restless, it must be special there
I just want to conversate with you but you keep on talking to your phone
You're so restless, you're gonna end up alone
I only see you when you're walking, walking to somewhere
You're so restless, what can be over there?
I only see you when you're walking, walking to somewhere
You're so restless, it must be special there
Life is like a rollercoaster
It does flips and throws you over
Board your ship that's going nowhere
If you stop, you'll end up somewhere
Everybody wants to go to Japan
Everybody wants to go to Japan
Everybody wants to go to Japan
Everybody, just hold hands
Now everybody wants to go to Californ-i-a
To live their life on a sunny day
Dreaming of someone else's wife and kids (kids and wife)
But they'll be bringing you the same old shit (strife)
Everybody wants to go to Japan
Everybody wants to go to Japan
Everybody wants to go to Japan
Everybody, just hold hands.
Everyone wants to go to Jamaica
Queens in drag will surely fake ya
Take you home, and then they'll rape you
But you like it, so say "Thank you"
Everybody wants to go to Japan
Everybody wants to go to Japan
Everybody wants to go to Japan
Everybody, just hold hands.
Everybody wants to go to Iraq
But once they go, they don't come back
Bringing peanut butter jelly and other snacks
We might have our freedom, but we're still on crack.
Everybody wants to go to Japan
Everybody wants to go to Japan
Everybody wants to go to Japan
Everybody just hold hands.
Everybody just hold hands.
Everybody just hold hands.
Everybody just hold hands.
Everybody just hold hands...
Keisha:
Somewhere in the back of my mind
Secretly I know you will find
Me amongst the blusher and glow
Deep beyond the things I don't show
Mystery's a beautiful thing
What a gift a woman can bring
Never let it out just like that
Let him slowly figure it out
Heidi:
How can a flower bloom in
Just over a day and a night?
You gotta let the water drain in
All:
I didn't wanna fall in love with you
I didn't wanna know the things I knew
It wasn't 'til I looked into the mirror
Denial 
Amelle:
You were like a power of nature
Telepathic beautiful creature
Understanding all of my weakness
Patient, loving, knowing you'd reach it
Cynical when hurt was just me
You were never supposed to be
Part of what I would call amazing
Took so long to finally see
Heidi:
How can a flower bloom in
Just over a day and a night?
You've gotta let the water drain in
ALL:
I didn't wanna fall in love with you
I didn't wanna know the things I knew
It wasn't 'til I looked into the mirror
Denial
I didn't wanna fall in love with you
I didn't wanna know the things I knew
It wasn't 'til I looked into the mirror
Denial
Heidi:
I see the way the wind blows
Like open minds for us
No complicated barriers
To hold us back
All:
I didn't wanna fall in love with you
I didn't wanna know the things I knew
It wasn't 'til I looked into the mirror
Denial
 
I didn't wanna fall in love with you        
I didn't wanna know the things I knew       
It wasn't 'til I looked into the mirror     
Denial                            
I didn't wanna fall in love with you        
I didn't wanna know the things I knew       
It wasn't 'til I looked into the mirror     
Denial                                      
I didn't wanna fall in love with you        
I didn't wanna know the things I knew       
It wasn't 'til I looked into the mirror     
Denial
And so it goes another lonely day
Your savin' time but your miles away
Your fly was drownin in some bitter tea
For seeing lost opportunity
Find your mirror go and look inside
And see the talent you always hide
Don't go kidd yourself well not today
Satisfaction's not to far away
Hold on now your exits here
It's waiting just for you
Don't pause too long
It's fading now
It's ending all too soon you'll see
Soon you'll see
Your coffee's warm but your milk is sour
Life is short but your here to flower
Dream yourself along another day
Never miss opportunity
Don't be scared of what you cannot see
Your only fear is possibility
Never wonder what the hell went wrong
Your second chance may never come along
Hold on now your exits here
It's waiting just for you
Don't pause too long
It's fading now
It's ending all too soon you'll see
Soon you'll see
Hold on now your exits here
It's waiting just for you
Don't pause too long
It's fading now
It's ending all too soon you'll see
Soon you'll see [x5]
I've played that song from long ago
When every morning longed to fall
It broke my sighs and my regrets
It stumbled on the steps
You've build for climbing towards me
Now it feels like sinners in the sun
When I say -
I said I'd die for you
Or was it in my head
I took you down on ouzo
And now I think I'd rather see you dead
I said I die for you
Or was it in my head
You took me down on oszo
And then you say you'd rahter see me dead
If my depression stood the wind
I spat the devil up his chin
It couldn't do me any harm
It roughed my steel and shut my mouth
My late impression
Oh, that rain that's iching on my skin
When I say-
I said I die for you'
Hold me, scratch my shoulder
Fold me, sue me, watch me going mad
I said I'd die for you
Or was it in my head
I took you down on ouzo
And now I think I'd rather see you dead
Whatever gets you through the night, it's alright, it's alright
It's your money or life, it's alright, it's alright
Don't need a sword to cut through flowers, oh no, oh no
Whatever gets you through your life, it's alright, it's alright
Do it wrong or do it right, it's alright, it's alright
Don't need a watch to waste your time, oh no, oh no
Hold me, darlin', come on, listen to me
I won't do you no harm
Trust me, darlin', come on, listen to me
Come on, listen to me
Come on, listen, listen
Whatever gets you to the light, it's alright, it's alright
Out the blue or out of sight, it's alright, it's alright
Don't need a gun to blow your mind, oh no, oh no
Hold me, darlin', come on, listen to me
I won't do you no harm
Trust me, darlin', come on, listen to me
Come on, listen to me
Come on, listen, listen
Hey Mr. Tough
Don't you think we've suffered enough?
Why don't you meet me on the dancefloor
When it's Tiny Tom time?
And if you need to tell me something once
You won't have to say it twice
And if you ask for a nickel
I'm gonna hand you a dime
And we'll forget about our problems
Ignore them for a little while
And leave our worries in the corner
Leave them in a big big pile
Pretend everything can be alright
Hey Mrs. Blue
Time to think of something new
The Possum's spinning our hips
The old soft shoe
And if you wanna lose the rest of the night
There's nothing better I have to do
And if I tell you something
You won't have to ask if it's true
And we'll forget about our problems
Ignore them for a little while
And leave our worries in the corner
Leave them in a big big pile
Pretend everything can be alright
Alone in our pad on Saturday night
Hemmed in by the room
But hiding at a crowded party
The record's playing for just me and you
Hey Mr. Tough
Don't you think we've suffered enough?
Why don't you meet me on the dancefloor
When it's Toddophonic time?
And if you need to tell me something once
You won't have to say it twice
And if you ask for a nickel
I'm gonna hand you a dime
And we'll forget about our problems
Ignore them for a little while
And leave our worries in the corner
Leave them in a big big pile
Pretend everything can be alright
Pretend everything can be alright
Pretend everything can be alright
In the backyard
In the living room
Residential neighborhood
I've come for you
In the margins
Of the freeway
I have sat alone and wondered
Where are you?
Yeah I want to remake the horizon
Remake the horizon
In the medicine
In the weddings
Like the cormorant in evening
I see her silhouette
In the market
In the parking lot
In the uniform
You're nowhere now
Yeah I want to remake the horizon
Remake the horizon
Tossed aside the mirrored life
Echo it out, echo it out
Yeah I want to remake the horizon
Remake the horizon
Why can't we be friends?
Why can't we be friends?
Why can't we be friends?
Why can't we be friends?
I seen ya, I seen ya, I seen ya 'round for a long, long time
I really, I really, I really remember when you drank my wine
Why can't we be friends?
Why can't we be friends?
Why can't we be friends?
Why can't we be friends?
I seen ya, I seen ya, I seen ya walkin' down to Chinatown
I called ya, I called ya, I called ya but you did not look around, yeah, yeah
I paid my, I paid my, I paid my money to the welfare line
I seen ya, I seen ya, I seen ya standing in it every time
Why can't we be friends?
Why can't we be friends?
Why can't we be friends?
Why can't we be friends?
The color, the color, the color of your skin don't matter to me
As long as, as long as, as long as we can live in harmony, yeah, yeah
I kinda, I kinda, I kinda like to be the president
Then I could, then I could, then I could show you how your money's spent
Why can't we be friends?
Why can't we be friends?
Why can't we be friends?
Why can't we be friends?
Sometimes I don't speak right
But did I know what I was talking about?
I know you're workin' for the C.I.A.
They wouldn't have you in the mafia
Why can't we be friends?
Why can't we be friends?
Why can't we be friends?
Why can't we be friends?
You're repeating me lines that you think I wanna hear
But I don't wanna hear anymore
As if sorry is any consolation
For what it's worth, you're stringing me along
Sh sh shouldn't need anyone
Shouldn't need anyone
Just scared of being alone
But by the time you figure this out
And I'm already gone
Adelaide, Adelaide, you really had me going this time
Adelaide, Adelaide, you need to quit, quit making a scene
Adelaide, Adelaide, you really had me going this time
Adelaide, Adelaide, you need to quit, quit making a scene
You keep giving me signs that you think I wanna see
But you're nothing like you seem
Hide behind your half smile
But the truth is so undeniable
Sh sh shouldn't need anyone
Shouldn't need anyone
Just scared of being alone
But by the time you figure this out
And I'm already gone
Adelaide, Adelaide, you really had me going this time
Adelaide, Adelaide, you need to quit, quit making a scene
Adelaide, Adelaide, you really had me going this time
Adelaide, Adelaide, you need to quit, quit making a scene
Like lipstick traces on pillow cases
Some things in life are unforgettable
Like love, loss, lies and us and woh oh
Some things in life are undeniable
Like lipstick traces on pillow cases
Some things in life are unforgettable
Like love, loss, lies and us and woh oh
Some things in life are undeniable
Adelaide, Adelaide, you really had me going this time
Adelaide, Adelaide, you need to quit, quit making a scene
Adelaide, Adelaide, you really had me going this time

What are you waiting for?
She's said, she's a star,

The snow,
Has come down,
On top of everything
The town,
Is alive and well without you. (she's said)
The lights
They peer out
Of the leafless trees
And you won't
Be alone, I am beside you. (beside you)
Yowayohwayohwayoh
Yowayohwayohwayoh
Yowayohwayohwayoh
Yowayohwayohwayoh
(True love)
The stars in the sky, illuminate below
The light is the sign, that love will guide you home.
The stars in the sky, illuminate below
If the world were to die, the light will guide you.
Tears,
Spilling out,
Across a dead end street
Your house,
Is a lonely box that holds you. (she's a star)
A star,
Bright and loud,
Is in dire need
Of the fear,
It is an empty fear inside you.
Yowayohwayohwayoh

Girl I wanna be good to you,
I never wanna do you no harm,
I'm caught up in this fascination,
Helping with your alarms,
Ignore life if you want to babe,
Do what you've got to do,

I wanna feel so brand new,
You make me runaway,
You make me runaway,
You make me runaway baby,

You talk of them as your friends,
Dangle me from your wrist chain,
Another one lost to the winds of change,
You make me runaway,
You make me runaway,
You make me runaway baby,

You'll always be my friend,

Feeling so lost, ticking you off
Now boy, you know me well
Said, I'm that kind of feeling
That kind of soft, that kind of silly
But when I'm in doubt, I open my mouth
And words come out, words come out like
Baby, there's a shark in the water
There's something underneath my bed
Oh, please believe I said
Baby, there's a shark in the water
I caught them barking at the moon
Better be soon
High in the sky, the song that I'm singing
A sweet little lie, I cry wolf, cry
Rabbit in the hat yeah, so that's why I'm bringing
Some tricks up my sleeve, for noticing me
I wouldn't cause you any harm, I just want you in my arms
I can't help, I can't myself
Baby, there's a shark in the water
There's something underneath my bed
Oh, please believe I said
Baby, there's a shark in the water
I caught them barking at the moon
Better be soon
(Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do)
(Better be soon)
(Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do x2)
Right is right
Rules are rules
This is more like April fools
I'm just winding you up, oh
Jack be nimble, Jack be quick
Please don't make too much of it
It ain't that serious
Baby, there's a shark in the water
There's something underneath my bed
Oh, please believe I said
Baby, there's a shark in the water
I caught them barking at the moon
You better get here soon
Baby, there's a shark in the water
Baby, there's a shark in the water
Baby, there's a shark in the water
I caught them barking at the moon
Better be soon
Hey you know my friend lisa
She's down from LA
We've been places like this
There always the same
We'll loosen the rope just enough to make you pay
When my memory is hazy
We're moving away
To rent a display home
Avoid all the grey
2 bees in a storm
The honey's stuck us by the hair
Hold music
Give it to me baby don't you dare lose it
When we're sleeping in daily
There's ice on the road
I bought us a dragon
To lighten the load
He's keeping us warm
The blood keep flowing to your head
Say I've never been stately
I'm legless at sea
My spirit has felt you since 1903
I'm trying to be normal
But there's evil in my head
Hold music
Give it to me bay don't you dare lose it
You're so dangerous
Everybody's gonna hide out back
It doesn't matter that you're serious
Move along sad face your cover's blown
C'mon there you are
And we're outta space and you're out of space
Change the beat fast
Or your enemies will see you naked
Hold music hold music hold
When we were out drinking
I found you a home
4 million in prizes
You left me alone
When we were forlorn
I found some poison in your bed
Though you may mistake me
I'll never be free
I'm stuck in the crossfire
Between you and he
Tattoos on his arms
He got a needle for a head
Hold music
Give it to me bay don't you dare lose it
Oh baby you're too pure
You're too pure for this wicked world
Your data's uncorrupted
But does something skip inside you?
That's what takes up time in this life
Add up the sum of the slights and 
Sooner or later
Love comes inside you, gets behind you
Takes you under it's wing
Is it some kind of function?
A reconstruction of where you've always been?
Sense memory, that's so passe
Is that what passes for vision these days?
I engineer no strangeness
I don't have that modern streak
What fills up this space in your life? 
Does the sum of the slights hurt? 
Sooner or later
Love comes inside you, gets behind you
Takes you under it's wing
Is it some kind of function?
A reconstruction of where you've always been?
Time can't hurt you
I can't be bothered to get you alone in this world
You can do it yourself, but make your ends known to your means and your lovers
Drop your guard, get over yourself
Kick your shoes to the floor and
Run from your cover, run to the other side of your head and I'll stand right by you
Love comes inside you, gets behind you
Takes you under it's wing
Is it some kind of function?
A reconstruction of where you've always been?
Love comes inside you, gets behind you
Takes you under it's wing
Is it some kind of function?
A reconstruction of where you've always been?
Time can't hurt you
I can't be bothered to get you alone in this world
Ah... Ooh...
This is the way
I always dreamed it would be
The way that it is, oh
When you are holding me
I never had a love of my own
Maybe that's why when we're all alone
I can hear music
I can hear music
The sound of the city baby
Seems to disappear, oh when
I can hear music
Sweet sweet music
Whenever you touch me baby
Whenever you're near
Loving you
It keeps me satisfied
And I can't explain, oh no
The way I'm feeling inside
You look at me, we kiss and then
I close my eyes and here it comes again
I can hear music
I can hear music
The sound of the city baby
Seems to disappear, oh when
I can hear music
Sweet sweet music
Whenever you touch me baby
Whenever you're near
I hear the music all the time, yeah
I hear the music hold me tight now baby
I hear the music all the time
I hear the music
I hear the music (baby)
Ah...
I can hear music
I can hear music
The sound of the city baby
Seems to disappear, oh when
I can hear music
Sweet sweet music
Whenever you touch me baby
Whenever you're near
Hello Seattle, I am a mountaineer
In the hills and highlands
I fall asleep in hospital parking lots
And awake in your mouth
Hello Seattle, I am a manta ray
Deep beneath the blue waves
I'll crawl the sandy bottom of Puget Sound
And construct a summer home
Hello Seattle, I am the crescent moon
Shining down on your face
I will disguise myself as a sleeping pill
And descend inside of you
Hello Seattle, I am a cold seahorse
Feeling warm in your sand
I sing about the tide and the ocean surf
Rolling in the evening breeze
Hello Seattle, I am an albatross
On the docks and moored boats
I sail above your inlets and interstates
Through the rain and open wind
Hello Seattle, I am an old lighthouse
Throwing beams of bright light
Red in the morning, blue in the evening sun
Taking heed for everyone
(Hello Seattle, I am a mountaineer)
(In the hills and highlands)
(I fall asleep in hospital parking lots)
Take me above your light
Carry me through the night
Hold me secure in flight
Sing me to sleep tonight
Take me above your light (Hello Seattle, I am a mountaineer)
Carry me through the night (In the hills and highlands)
Hold me secure in flight (I fall asleep in hospital parking lots)
Sing me to sleep tonight (and awake)
C-C-C-Cinnamon lips and candy kisses, on my tongue, fun!
B-B-B-Buttery eyes, if only cries could come from those eyes, oh!
Have you landed yet and, if so, would you let me know?
I'm tired of looking up into those starry eyes
Does it rain where you are? Does it snow?
And, if so, remind me not to go there, the weather affects my knee
I've never felt this way before
C-C-C-Cinnamon Lips, go powder your cheeks and meet your new beau, oh!
C-C-C-Counting sheep, if only sheep could put me to sleep, oh!
I've never felt this way before
I've never felt this way before
Some day (one day) you'll miss me
Mundane Sundays, when I'm gone
One day (some day) you'll miss me
One day when I'm gone (adieu and so long)
One day when I'm gone!
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Have you landed yet and, if so, would you let me know?
I've never felt this way before
One, two, three, four
Tell me that you love me more
Sleepless long nights
That is what my youth was for
Old teenage hopes are alive at your door
Left you with nothing but they want some more
Oh, oh, oh
You're changing your heart
Oh, oh, oh
You know who you are
Sweetheart, bitterheart now I can't tell you apart
Cozy and cold, put the horse before the cart
Those teenage hopes who have tears in their eyes
Too scared to own up to one little lie
Oh, oh, oh
You're changing your heart
Oh, oh, oh
You know who you are
One, two, three, four, five, six, nine, or ten
Money can't buy you back the love that you had then
One, two, three, four, five, six, nine, or ten
Money can't buy you back the love that you had then
Oh, oh, oh
You're changing your heart
Oh, oh, oh
You know who you are
Oh, oh, oh
You're changing your heart
Oh, oh, oh
You know who you are
Who you are, are, are, are
For, for the teenage boys
They're breaking your heart
For the teenage boys
They're breaking your heart
I can't get enough of you, baby
I can't get enough of you, baby
A-yes, it's true
Oh, baby, yes, it's true
Whenever we kiss, I get a feeling like this
I get to wishing that there were two of you
My heart cries out more, baby
It feels so nice
I want your arms to wrap around me twice
I can't get enough of you, baby
I can't get enough of you, baby
A-right or wrong
Oh, baby, right or wrong
When you had to go, I hated the thought
I always wished the night was twice as long
My heart cries out more, baby
I love you so much
I wish that there was more of you to touch
I can't get enough of you, baby 
(Can't get enough of you, baby)
I can't get enough of you, baby 
Yeah!
Whenever we kiss, I get a feelin' like this
I get to wishing that there were two of you
My heart cries out more, baby
I love you so much
I wish that there was more of you to touch
I can't get enough of you, baby
(I can't get enough of you, baby)
I can't get enough of you, baby

I can't get enough of you, baby
(I can't get enough of you, baby)
I can't get enough of you, baby
(I can't get enough of you, baby)
I can't get enough of you, baby
Don't get me started love
I've had too much to drink
Had too much time to think
So leave me alone
Crying when you're by yourself
Cause of what they think
About you
Makes time go slow, slow, slow
Makes time go slow, slow, slow
Slow
Something's gotta give soon
Or I'm gonna lose it
Substance abusing
And never come down
Fall off the deep end
And forget my English
What's the point of language
If you don't say what you feel
So with that being said
To all the bitch ass hoes that hate me the most
Oh yeah, I hate you too
To all the punk ass fucks that just want to talk shit
I hate you too
To all the high class ass that's too hard to pass
Oh yeah, I hate you too
Doses and Mimosas
Champagne and cocaine
Help to get me through
Ten in the morning
And I'm skipping breakfast
And drinking a beverage
To ignore it all
Guess ignorance is bliss and
I've come to embrace it
It's all overrated
Except drugs and alcohol
So with that being said
To all the bitch ass hoes that hate me the most
Oh yeah, I hate you too
To all the punk ass fucks that just want to talk shit
I hate you too
To all the high class ass that's too hard to pass
Oh yeah, I hate you too
Doses and Mimosas
Champagne and cocaine
Help to get me through
Music is power, let it flow through your mind
You're just like a flower, yeah, in the deep sunshine
Are you invited to the party of life
Now you've been sighted, oh, do you live till you die?
These are wild, wild, wild days we live in
Yes, I know sometimes we all wanna give in
These are strange, strange vain days of living
Yeah, I know sometimes we all wanna give in
Don't give up, oh no, all right
Let the melody flow all night, all night
'Cause music is power, it's easily sold
Rocking like a cradle, yeah, it won't let you go
If the melody's timeless it won't let you down
Feel the air moving, submit to the sound
These are wild, wild, wild days we live in
Yes, I know sometimes we all wanna give in
These are strange, strange vain days of living
I know sometimes we all wanna give in
Don't give up, oh no, all right
Let the melody flow all night, all night
After all we go through the endless crime
Bad days good fortune, yeah, are things you find
'Cause music is the mantra unwinding your head
Music is the question to things unsaid
These are wild, wild, wild days we live in
Yes, I know sometimes we all wanna give in
These are strange, strange vain days of living
Yeah, I know sometimes that ya just don't fit in
Don't give in, don't give up, don't pack it up, stop cracking up
Let the song carry you on and keep you strong
Don't wanna control ya, oh-oh
'Cause music is the power, power, submit to the sound
Feel the air moving, moving, submit to the sound
Feel the air moving, moving, submit to the sound
Feel the air moving, moving...
Well I've been making some cold calculations regarding our body heat
It's not easy, believe me
You liken me to a vampire
My left hand was wearing fake plastic teeth, all winter
I've taken you for all you were worth
Well I'm afraid I'm not qualified to do any of these things for you
Well I'm afraid I'm not gonna give you back any of those kilojoules
Late nights and weekends our hearts only walk slowly on the local track
So I've arranged for your phobias to be performed by a string quartet
Shoot me one of those glances I need to interpret
I've been feeling well-rested and healthy
Well I'm afraid I'm not qualified to do any of these things for you
And I'm afraid I'm not gonna give you back any of those kilojoules
Late nights and weekends our hearts only go so slowly on the local track
So I've arranged for your phobias to be performed by a string quartet
(This one goes out to you and yours, worldwide)
I say hey, I'll be gone today
But I'll be back all around the way
It seems like everywhere I go
The more I see, the less I know
But I know one thing
That I love you (baby girl)
I love you, I love you, I love you
I've been a lot of places all around the way
I've seen a lot of joy and I've seen a lot of pain
But I don't want to write a love song for the world
I just want to write a song about a boy and a girl
Junkies on the corner always calling my name
And the kids on the corner playing ghetto games
When I saw you getting down, well, I hope it was you
And when I look into your eyes I knew it was true
I say hey, I'll be gone today
But I'll be back all around the way
It seems like everywhere I go
The more I see, the less I know
But I know one thing
That I love you (baby girl)
I love you, I love you, I love you
Now I'm not a highly metaphysical man
But I know when the stars are aligned you can
Bump into a person in the middle of the road
Look into their eyes and you suddenly know
Rocking in the dance hall moving with you
Dancing in the night in the middle of June
My momma told me don't lose you
'Cause the best luck I had was you
I say hey, I'll be gone today
But I'll be back all around the way
It seems like everywhere I go
The more I see, the less I know
But I know one thing
That I love you (baby girl)
I love you, I love you, I love you
And I say, rocking in the dance hall, moving with you
I say, hey momma, hey momma, close to you
Rocking in the dance hall, moving with you
I say, hey poppa, hey poppa, close to you
Rocking in the dance hall moving with you
I say, hey momma, hey momma, close to you
Rocking in the dance hall moving with you
I say, hey momma, hey momma, hey momma, hey momma
Hey momma, hey momma, hey momma, hey momma
My momma told me don't lose you
'Cause the best luck I had was you
And I know one thing
That I love you
I say hey, I'll be gone today
But I'll be back all around the way
It seems like everywhere I go
The more I see, the less I know
I say hey, I'll be gone today
But I'll be back all around the way
It seems like everywhere I go
The more I see, the less I know
But I know one thing
That I love you (baby girl)
I love you, I love you, I love you
I love you, I love you, I love you
I love you, I love you, I love you
I love you, I love you, I love you
(Rocking in the dance hall moving with you
I say, hey poppa, hey poppa
Hey momma, hey momma
Rocking in the dance hall moving with you
Come on, hey poppa, hey poppa)
I love you, I love you, I love you
I love you, I love you, I love you
I love you, I love you, I love you
First thing I remember, I was lying in my bed
Couldn't have been no more than one or two
And I remember there was a radio 
Coming from the room next door
And my mother laughed the way some ladies do
Well it's late in the evening 
And the music's seeping through
The next thing I remember, I am walking down the street 
I'm feeling all right, I'm with my boys, I'm with my troops, yeah
And down along the avenue some guys are shootin' pool
And I heard the sound of acapella grooves, yeah
Singin' late in the evening
And all the girls out on the stoops, yeah
Then I learned to play some lead guitar
I was underage in this funky bar 
And I stepped outside and smoked myself a J
And when I come back to the room everybody just seemed to move
And I turned my amp up loud and I began to play
And it was late in the evening
And I blew that room away
The first thing I remember when you came into my life
I said, "I'm gonna get that girl no matter what I do"
Well I guess I've been in love before
Once or twice I've been on the floor
But I never loved no one the way that I love you
And it was late in the evening 
And all the music seeping through.
I tried to discover, a little something to make me sweeter,
Oh baby refrain from breaking my heart.
I'm so in love with you, I'll be forever blue.
That you give me no reason, you know you're making me work so hard.
That you give me no, that you give me no,
That you give me no, that you give me no
Soul,
I hear you calling,
Oh baby please (give a little respect)
Give a little respect to me.
And if I should falter, would you open your arms out to me?
We can make love not war, and live with peace in our hearts.
I'm so in love with you, I'll be forever blue.
What religion or reason could drive a man to forsake his lover
Don't you tell me no, don't you tell me no,
Don't you tell me no, don't you tell me no
Soul,
I hear you calling,
Oh baby please (give a little respect)
Give a little respect to me
I'm so in love with you, I'll be forever blue
That you give me no reason, you know you're making me work so hard
That you give me no, that you give me no,
That you give me no, that you give me no
Soul,
I hear you calling,
Oh baby please (give a little respect)
Give a little respect to me
I hear you calling,
Oh baby please (give a little respect)
Give a little respect to me.
You should be wilder
You're no fun at all
Yeah, thanks for the input
Thanks for the call
With dull knives and white hands
The blood of a stone
Cold to the touch, right
Right down the bone
But you give me the electric twist
And it kicks, and it kicks like a pony
And true, you might get away with it
It's a risk, it's a risk, yeah
Picked from a hot grove
Packaged for sale
It drips down the sleeve
Gets under your nails
A loss of the senses
A chip off a tooth
The smells of the city
They ride in your suit
He says don't think, don't talk
Don't think
Don't think, don't talk
Don't think
Don't think, don't talk
But I don't think I want to
'Cause you give me the electric twist
And it kicks, and it kicks like a pony
And true, you might run away with it
It's a risk, it's a risk, yeah
Because it kicks, yeah
It really kicks, yeah
And the touch of your lips
It's a shock, not a kiss
It's electric twist, it's electric twist
Yeah, the touch of your lips
It's a shock, not a kiss
It's electric twist, it's electric twist
It's electric twist, it's electric twist
It's electric twist, it's electric twist
He says don't think, don't talk
Don't think
Don't think, don't talk
Don't think
Don't think, don't talk
But I don't think I want to
'Cause you give me the electric twist
And it kicks, and it kicks like
And true, let ya get away with it
It's a risk, it's a risk, yeah
You might get away with it
It's a risk, yeah
But it kicks, yeah
It really kicks, yeah
Who's around when the days feel long
Who's around when you can't be strong
Who's around when you're losing your mind
Who cares that you get home safe
Who knows you can't be replaced
Who thinks that you're one of a kind
Somebody misses you when you're away
They wanna wake up with you everyday
Somebody wants to hear you say
Ooh somebody loves you
Ooh somebody loves you
Ooh somebody loves you
Ooh somebody loves you
Ooh somebody loves you
I'm around when your head is heavy
I'm around when your hands aren't steady
I'm around when your day's gone all wrong
I care that you feel at home
'Cause I know that you feel alone
I think you're going to miss me when I'm gone
Somebody misses you when you're away
They wanna wake up with you everyday
Somebody wants to hear you say
Ooh somebody loves you
Ooh somebody loves you
Ooh somebody loves you
Ooh somebody loves you
Ooh somebody loves you
Why don't you come on over
Why don't you lay me down
Does the pain feel better
When I'm around
If I am good to you
Won't you be good to me
That's how easy this should be
Somebody misses you when you're away (Somebody misses you baby)
They wanna wake up with you everyday (They wanna wake up with you)
Somebody wants to hear you say (Oh they want you to say)
Ooh somebody loves you
Ooh somebody loves you
Ooh somebody loves you
Ooh somebody loves you
Ooh somebody loves you
On a tear, under siege, under oath, Anna Lee
Won't you come strap yourself to my side?
With our grill in disguise, we've got more lives than I
Ever dreamed you could own at one time
There's a shake with the shock and a gift off with them
They carry the dust of the failing wisdom
For you, there's not any warning
For you, there's not any warning
And love is five in the morning
For you, there's not any warning
On a tear, cautiously we advance, Anna Lee
Won't you come pass the torch? Bring your hands
Yes and no, there's no right, but we have no better light
To see through to our star bodies go
There's a shake with the shock and a gift off with them
They carry the dust of the failing wisdom
For you, there's not any warning
For you, there's not any warning
And love is five in the morning
For you, there's not any warning
Now, take me to where your sister lives
Take me to where your sister lives
Take me to where your sister lives
Take me to where your sister lives
On a tear, far from home by a thread, Anna Lee
What's been said has to stay between us
Call me over, I trust we lay here, till we must
Make our break to our star bodies go
There's a shake with the shock and a gift off with them
They carry the dust of the failing wisdom
For you, there's not any warning
For you, there's not any warning
And love is five in the morning
For you, there's not any warning
Till we skip through the towns to the bright, sweet, past on
And bury the dust of the failing wisdom
For you, there's not any warning
For you, there's not any warning
And love is five in the morning
For you, there's not any warning
Now, take me to where your sister lives
Take me to where your sister lives
I woke up with the rising sun
I was blinded by the light
Jump up and pull on my jeans
It feels good they're a little tight
Step out in a crazy world
But then the sun resets your mind
Feel the weight of it all just drift
Off on a cloud to another time
Ooh-ooh-ooh Hello hello
I'm feeling alive again
Alive again
Like the way that you drive your car
I like the way that you turn the wheel
Can't stop thinking about you, baby
You don't know you're the real deal
Here we are on a perfect night
The sky is clear and the moon is full
Looking out at the universe
I thank the stars and the heavens for you
Ooh-ooh-ooh Hello hello
I'm feeling alive again
Alive again
I wanna get you tonight
And love
Ooh We're on and on...
We can do it softcore if you want
But you should know I take it both ways
We can do it softcore if you want
But you should know that I go both ways
We can do it softcore if you want
But you should know I take it both ways
We can do it softcore if you want
But you should know that I go both ways
Georgie said romantic love is flat
(Georgie said that)
Only for people with no real ambition in their life
(No life)
But oh, but List Christie disagrees
She sees into the core of my poor machine
(I'll tell you what she sees)
Frightened cornered Gemini tactics and
Attempts to crack the party code
And there's one more thing
We can do it softcore if you want
But you should know I take it both ways
We can do it softcore if you want
But you should know that I go both ways
Our bodies became one and then we so really turned on
Became a freaky permutation
Something like Voltron
Then I was wrapped in discourse with the magazine reader
The mutual conclusion was I'm not worth knowing because I'm probably dead
So I'm exposed but no solution
Lalalalalala
Lalalalalala
We can do it softcore if you want
But you should know I take it both ways
We can do it softcore if you want
But you should know that I go both ways
Oh
Lalala lalala
Lalalalalalalalalalalalalalala
Lalalalalalalalalalalalalalala
Lalalalalalalalalalalalalalala
You're in denial, you're in denial
And I know
Well what's my name, well what's my name?
I don't know
Baby if you telephone
Maybe I can meet you in the morning
Call me if you're on your own
And maybe I can meet you in the morning
You're in denial, you're in denial
And I know
Well what's my name, well what's my name?
I don't know
Baby if you telephone
Maybe I can meet you in the morning
Call me if you're on your own
And maybe I can meet you in the morning
Mornings eleven, the feelings are severed
I can't feel anything at all
But I would die for you
Oh I would die for you
All that I've ever seen
All that I've ever been
All that I've ever was,
I would die for you
Oh I would die for you
I had it all
But I never thought I did
No, no, no, no, I never thought I did
I had it all
But I never thought I did
No, no, no, no I never thought I did
You're in denial, you're in denial
And I know
Well what's my name, well what's my name
I don't know
Baby if you telephone
Maybe I can meet you in the morning
Call me if you're on your own
And maybe I can meet you in the morning
Die for you
Die for you
I had it all
But I never thought I did
No, no, no, no, I never thought I did
I had it all
But I never thought I did
No, no, no, no I never thought I did
I had it all
His greasy fingers strung together and stretching 'cross the sky
A skunk that scratches and is leather a sign from up on high
And shivering we cling together and watch it pass us by
For falling like a spiny feather the tears begin to cry
Twisting, turning bodies burning look up from where they lie
To see the stars and heaven's journey flashing 'cross the sky
You hold my arm and wait forever and look me in the eye
For falling like a spiny feather the tears begin to cry
His greasy fingers strung together and stretching cross the sky
A skunk that scratches and is leather a sign from up on high
And shivering we cling together and watch it pass us by
For falling like a spiny feather the tears begin to cry
(Tom)
Recently I've been
Hopelessly reachin'
Out for this girl
Who's out of this world
Believe me
She's got a boyfriend
He drives her round the bend
'Cause he's 23
He's in the marines
He'd kill me
For so many nights now
I find myself thinkin' about her now oh
Cause obviously she's out of my league
But how can I win
She keeps draggin me in
And I know I
Never will be good enough for her
No no
I never will be good enough for her
(Danny)
Gotta escape now
Get on a plane now
Yeah
Off to LA
And that's where I'll stay
For two years
Put her behind me
(Put her behind me)
And go to a place where she can't find me oh
Cause obviously she's out of my league
I'm wastin my time
'Cause she'll never be mine
And I know I
Never will be good enough for her
No no
I never will be good enough for her
(Tom)
She's out of my hands
And I never know where I stand
'Cause I'm not good enough for her
Good enough for her x6
(Danny)
Cause obviously she's out of my league
I'm wastin my time
'Cause she'll never be mine
And I know I
Never will be good enough for her
(Tom)
Cause obviously she's out of my league
But how can I win
She keeps draggin me in
And I know I
Never will be good enough for her
(Danny)
Cause obviously she's out of my league
I'm wastin my time
'Cause she'll ne-ver be mine
And I know I
Never will be good enough for her
No no
I never will be good enough for her
Can't you see?
There's a feeling that's come over me
Close my eyes
You're the only one that leaves me
Completely breathless
No need to wonder why
Sometimes a gift like this you can't deny
'Cause I
Wanted to fly
So you gave me your wings
And time
Held its breath so I could see
Yeah
And you set me free
Ooh
There's a will
There's a way
Sometimes words just can't explain
This is real
(This is real)
I'm afraid
(I'm afraid)
I guess this time there's just no hiding, fighting
You make me restless
You're in my heart
The only light that shines there
In the dark
Oh
'Cause I
Wanted to fly
So you gave me your wings
And time
Held its breath so I could see
Yeah
And you set me free
When I was alone
You came around
When I was down
You pulled me through
And there's nothing that
I wouldn't do for you
'Cause I
Wanted to fly
So you gave me your wings
(So you gave me your wings)
And time
Held its breath so I could see
(So I could see)
'Cause I
Wanted to fly
So you gave me your wings
(So you gave me your wings)
And time
Held its breath so I could see
Yeah
And you set me free
Try and do the things you want,
But you never do them for me,
Try and say the things you want,
But you never say them to me,
And move on, and move on, and move on, and move on,
To someone else,
But it's always the same problem,
It's the way my heart beats,
Ever so softly,
It's the way my heart beats,
Ever so softly,
And move on, and move on, and move on, and move on,
To someone else,
But it's always the same problem, in the end,
And go on, and go on, and go on, and go on,
To your next conquest,
But we've all made the same mistakes,
It's the way my heart beats,
Ever so softly,
It's the way my heart beats,
Ever so softly,
I think yore saying that you will make me,
I think yore saying that you will make me mad,
What if you choose to use turn me round,
I think yore saying that you
Try and do the things you want,
It's the way my heart beats
Try and say the things you want,
It's the way my heart beats
And move on, and move on, and move on, and move on,
It's the way my heart beats
To someone else,
But it's always the same problem,
It's the way my heart beats
The old bastard left his ties and a suit
A brown box, moth balls and bowling shoes
And his opinions so you'd never have to choose
Pretty soon you'll be an old bastard too
You get smaller as the world gets big
The more you know you know you don't know shit
"The Whiz Man" will never fit you like "The Whiz Kid" did
So why you gotta act like you know when you don't know?
It's okay if you don't know everything
Why you gotta act like you know when you don't know?
It's okay if you don't know everything
Close your eyes, close your ears young man
You've seen and heard all an old man can
Spread the facts on the floor like a fan
Throw away the ones that make you feel bad
Kids today are getting old too fast
They can't wait to grow up so they can kiss some ass
They get nostalgic about the last ten years
Before the last ten years have passed
So why you gotta act like you know when you don't know?
It's okay if you don't know everything
Why you gotta act like you know when you don't know?
It's okay if you don't know everything
Tears land on a hand on a chest
The old bastard had a paradigm arrest
He got smaller and the world got big
The more he knew he knew he didn't know shit
"The Whiz Man" never fit him like "The Whiz Kid" did
So why you gotta act like you know when you don't know?
'Cause it's ok if you don't know everything
Why you gotta act like you know when you don't know?
It's ok if you don't know everything
Up from the basement to my best friend's farm
Where we'll work so hard, we can do no harm
We'll till the land and duck our debts
Underneath soft sun, chewing Nicorette
This will be a better year
This will be a better year
Make a little money, take a lot of shit
Feel real bad, then get over it
This will be a better year
Oh I keep pushing boulders
I stay game till sun'll shake my shoulders
Oh, I keep feeling older
I stay game, stay game, stay game
The East Coast kids, man, we just don't know
Singing wait, wait, stop, drop me, go, go, go
But I'm taken by the hand to a blue pay phone
We can break blue laws with our skin and bones
And now I'm back in the city, I'm counting frick frick frick
Heard of milk great things, speaking soft and thick
He said, "If life gives you lemons, then thus god bade.
So put a little bit of bitter in your pink lemonade"
I'm sick of thee sheep, I'm sick of thou shepherd
Sick of dressing like a human when I'm feeling like a leopard
I'm sick of slow rock, I'm sick of quick quips
Sick of holding on to nothing when I just want to hold your hips
This will be a better year
This will be a better year
Make a little money, take a lot of shit
Feel real bad, then get over it
This will be a better year
Oh I keep pushing boulders
I stay game till sun'll shake my shoulders
Oh I keep feeling older
I stay game, stay game, stay game

Got ideas to supply
And a passport to try
Everything we should but don't
Everything we could but won't
Got out backs to the pack

Will be yours now
'Cause we've gotta figure out
If we're gonna show you how
Do it, do it, all right

Do it, do it, all right
Do it, do it, all right
Got ideas to supply
And a passport to try
Everything we should but don't
Everything we could but won't
Got out backs to the pack

Leaving me, I'm sad and blue
Left with nothing but a picture
Third or fourth weekend into June, December seems to come too soon.
Will you wait until tomorrow? Will you wait until...
Head is swirling with the scene of you and him embraced in rapture.
Dirty, trying to come clean, but every thought I have is obscene.
Will you wait until tomorrow? Will you wait until...
Quilted on my hands and feet 
The little target cutie
Struck another shot up to 24 hours in June
Will you wait until tomorrow? Will you wait tomorrow?
Will you wait until tomorrow? Will you wait tomorrow?
Righteous men of the earth
Oh, have you been patient
I suppose our thoughts about United Nations
Adlai, Adlai
What did he say
And what is the answer?
Adlai, Adlai
What did he say
And what is the answer?
1952, the heart was not your master
The accident you threw
Would carry through your laughter
Evidence, evidence
I've heard of it
And what is the answer?
Evidence, evidence
I've heard of it
And what is the answer?
Adlai, Adlai
Your holiday
The greatest of men, sir
Adlai, Adlai
What did he say
And what is the answer?
When you're sad and when you're lonely,
And you haven't got a friend
Just remember that death is not the end
And all that you held sacred
Falls down and does not mend
Just remember that death is not the end
Not the end, not the end
Just remember that death is not the end
When you're standing on the crossroads
That you cannot comprehend
Just remember that death is not the end
And all your dreams have vanished
And you don't know what's up the bend
Just remember that death is not the end
Not the end, not the end
Just remember that death is not the end
When storm clouds gather 'round
And heavy rains descend
Just remember that death is not the end
And there's no one there to comfort you
With a helping hand to lend
Just remember that death is not the end
Not the end, not the end
Just remember that death is not the end
For the tree of life is growing
Where the spirit never dies
And the bright light of salvation
Up in dark and empty skies
When the cities are on fire
With the burning flesh of men
Just remember that death is not the end
When you search in vain to find
Some law-abiding citizen
Just remember that death is not the end
Not the end, not the end
Just remember that death is not the end
Not the end, not the end
Just remember that death is not the end
I've got a mild fascination for collectors
I've got a mild fascination for collectors
Where'd you find all that time,
A place for everything in the house?
I've got a mild fascination for collectors.
Your girlfriend says it's time to sell,
But everything it fits so well.
Rosewood from '75
That show the singer lost an eye.
One shrunken head from Africa,
Your girlfriend says you better not,
But you don't believe in superstition.
You find the lord in repetition.
I've got a mild fascination for collectors
I've got a mild fascination for collectors
Where'd you find all that time,
A place for everything in the house?
I've got a mild fascination for collectors.
One piece of wood from Noah's Ark,
The big collector from the start.
And if there is another flood,
Your house will float on Noah's wood.
I've got a mild fascination for collectors
I've got a mild fascination for collectors
Where'd you find all that time,
A place for everything in the house?
I've got a mild fascination for collectors.
Out on the streets, where I grew up 
First thing they teach us, not to give a fuck
That type of thinking can't get you nowhere 
Someone has to care
How I got over, where the people come apart 
Don't nobody care about 'cha, only thing you got is God
Out here in these streets, if you get down on your luck 
You can stand out, with a hand out, but nobody give a fuck
Out here in these streets, every man is for himself 
They ain't helpin' no-one else, it's a hazard to your health 
Livin' life in these cold streets
Hey, who's worryin' 'bout 'cha, babe? 
When you wildin' out, runnin' 'round in these streets
Out on the streets, where I grew up (How I got over) 
First thing they teach us, not to give a fuck (How I got o-)
That type of thinking can't get you nowhere (How I got over)
Someone has to care
Yo...
When you on the corners, there's too much drama 
Livin' with the police right behind ya
It's always more than a slight reminder 
We livin' in a war zone like Rwanda 
Before I go back to the Heavenly Father 
Pray for me if it ain't too much bother 
Whatever don't break me a-make me stronger 
I feel like I can't take too much longer
It's too much lyin', and too much fightin'
I'm all cried out 'cause I grew up cryin' 
They all got a sales pitch I ain't buyin' 
They tryin' to convince me that I ain't tryin' 
We uninspired, we unadmired 
And tired and sick of being sick and tired
Of livin' in the hood where the shots are fired 
We dyin' to live, so to live, we dyin' 
You just like I am 
Out on the streets, where I grew up (How I got over) 
First thing they teach us, not to give a fuck (How I got over)
That type of thinking can't get you nowhere (Somebody, somewhere)
Someone has to care
Somebody's gotta care
And I swear it isn't fair
In suspended animation, we ain't tryin' to go nowhere
Out here in these streets, we're so young and all alone
We ain't even old enough, to realize we're on our own
Livin' life in these hard streets
Where it's like they lost they mind
Is there anyway to find?
Are we runnin' out of time out here?
Listen...
Hey, who's worryin' 'bout 'cha, babe? 
When you wildin' out, runnin' 'round in these streets
Out on the streets, where I grew up (How I got over) 
First thing they teach us, not to give a fuck (How I got over)
That type of thinking can't get you nowhere (Somebody, somewhere)
Someone has to
Out on the streets, where I grew up 
First thing they teach us, not to give a fuck
That type of thinking can't get you nowhere 
Someone has to
Out on the streets, where I grew up 
First thing they teach us, not to give a fuck
That type of thinking can't get you nowhere 
Someone has to
Out on the streets, where I grew up 
First thing they teach us, not to give a fuck
That type of thinking can't get you nowhere 
Someone has to care
You're never gonna understand what you're seeing
But later you'll pretend you did and you'll mean it
You might think it's all in your head but you're not certain anymore
You might think it's all in your head but you're not certain anymore
I wouldn't put much stock in fact 'cause the fact is
It doesn't matter what you ask, it's who you're asking
Well I'd say don't throw it away if it's not working anymore
Well I'd say don't throw it away if it's not working anymore
I promise this is not a test, it's just I want you to be sure
It all comes back to common sense, I guess that's what you're looking for
I'll have to ask you to speak up so we're sure that
We're all perfectly clear on what we're ignoring
Well I'd say don't throw it away if it's not working anymore
Well I'd say don't throw it away if it's not working anymore
I promise this is not a test, it's just I want you to be sure
It all comes back to common sense, I guess that's what you're looking for
I promise this is not a test, it's just I want you to be sure
It all comes back to common sense, I guess that's what you're looking for
Well you've been taken and it's gonna hurt
The bluff's a classic 'cause it always works
This is a classic bluff because it always works on you
I promise this is not a test
A test
I promise this is not a test
I promise this is not a test, it's just I want you to be sure
It all comes back to common sense, I guess that's what you're looking for
I promise this is not a test, it's just I want you to be sure
It all comes back to common sense, I guess that's what you're looking for
Moi, je joue
Moi, je joue à joue contre joue
Je veux jouer à joue contre vous
Mais vous, le voulez-vous?
De tout cœur
Je veux gagner ce cœur à cœur
Vous connaissez mon jeu par cœur
Alors défendez-vous!
Sans tricher, je vous le promets
J'ai gagné, tant pis, c'est bien fait
Vous êtes mon jouet
? présent, ce ne sera plus vous mais toi
Et tu feras, ça t'apprendra
N'importe quoi pour moi
Sans m'en faire, je vais t'assurer
Un enfer de griffes et de crocs
Tu crieras bientôt: "Au secours!"
Alors décidant de ton sort
Pour m'éviter quelques remords
Je t'aimerai plus fort
Oh! Oui, plus fort
Oh! Oui oui oui, plus fort
Ah! plus fort, oui, oui, oui
The lips that slip are the lips that press
And the lips that leak seem to know you best
I put bodies into motion
Keep this skin out in the open
Liars turn me on
Bedspread bandit since '89
You wear your heart on your sleeve
I threw mine to the sky
Bounce bounce, baby, bounce back to me
You don't need this
Bounce bounce, baby, bounce back to me
You don't need this
This is it, call it quits with honesty
You don't need this
Every word is a curse let loose on me
Your mouth, it moves but fails to speak
And when you use your lips they better be on me
The lies that tied your tongue in knots
Are the words that grew to hit my spots
So filthy, dialed desire
Swallow pride but spit out fire
Liars turn me on
Bedspread bandit since '89
You wear your heart on your sleeve
I threw mine to the sky
Bounce bounce, baby, bounce back to me
You don't need this
Bounce bounce, baby, bounce back to me
You don't need this
This is it, call it quits with honesty
You don't need this
Every word is a curse let loose on me
Your mouth, it moves but fails to speak
And when you use your lips they better be on me
Bounce bounce, baby (Bounce bounce, baby)
Bounce bounce, baby (Bounce bounce, baby)
So filthy, dialed desire
Swallow pride but spit out fire
Liars turn me on
Bounce bounce, baby, bounce back to me
You don't need this
Bounce bounce, baby, bounce back to me
You don't need this
This is it, call it quits with honesty
You don't need this
Every word is a curse let loose on me
Your mouth, it moves but fails to speak
And when you use your lips they better be on me
You remember your first kiss?
Well, how can I forget?
My hand still shiver from the very thought of it
Well, sometimes I almost regret it
Like I regret my regrets
I see myself on my deathbed saying
"I wish I would have loved less"
But that's when the feeling hits
So just lick your lips
These are the good times that you'll miss
When you are sipping on the sweet nectar of your memories
Just take a sip
And let it wet your lips
You won't understand all this until you're
Sipping on the sweet nectar of your memories
Last night I ran into my old life
Still waiting for someone at the station
Someone who never made it into my new life
So I called up Lisa
'Cause she's my only friend
"Lisa I don't know anymore
Every heartbeat needs a reason"
She said: "That's when the feeling hits
So just lick your lips
Can you smell the spring time in the breeze
You gotta stop sipping on the sweet nectar of your memories"
I take a sip
I let it wet my lips
I think back on that kiss
I gotta stop sipping on the sweet nectar
That's when the feeling hits
All the boys voices cracking
Oh, the moaning half tones
Come summertime, we're all the same age here
All the tension and the terror
Thin limbed gorgeous green eyes smiling
And I'm going straight to hell
All the possibility and promise just weighs on me so heavily...
And I try but I'm not convinced and
Your lips, they pout and twist
And I die trying just to keep myself from kissing you
You take in everything with a certainty I envy
It's somehow all I need
Just keep me guessing please
Darling, all of these awkward jump start stalling conversations
Mean much more to me than anything
It comes down to me and you
And whether we're supposed to or not, we still will
We're so much better off than them
All the possibility and promise just weighs on me so heavily...
And I try but I'm not convinced and
Your lips, they pout and twist
And I die trying just to keep myself from kissing you
You take in everything with a certainty I envy
It's somehow all I need
Just keep me guessing please
A look, a laugh, a smile, a second passes by and I regret it
Words just aren't right
Sometimes I just can't explain
All the ways you devastate me
Always on my mind
I try but I'm not convinced and
Your lips, they pout and twist
And I die trying just to keep myself from kissing you
You take in everything with a certainty I envy
It's somehow all I need
Just keep me guessing please
L-O-V-E love, it's coming back, it's coming back
L-O-V-E love, it's coming back, it's coming back
Refer to our discussions
Confirm the terms of our love affair
I exercise all options
And I know I'll see you there
L-O-V-E love, it's coming back, it's coming back
L-O-V-E love, it's coming back, it's coming back
Not withstanding provisions
Of clauses one, two, three and four
Extend contractual period
Me and you for evermore
You're the Legal Man
You've got to prove that you're no liar
I'll render services
That you may reasonably require
L-O-V-E love, it's coming back, it's coming back
L-O-V-E love, it's coming back, it's coming back
Get out of the city and into the sunshine
Get out of the office and into the springtime
Get out of the city and into the sunshine
Get out of the office and into the springtime
Get out of the city and into the sunshine
Get out of the office and into the springtime
Get out of the city and into the sunshine
Get out of the office and into the springtime
You will search, babe, at any cost
But how long, babe, can you search for what's not lost?
Everybody will help you
Some people are very kind
But if I can save you any time
Come on, give it to me
I'll keep it with mine
I can't help it if you might think I am odd
If I say I'm not loving you for what you are
But for what you're not
Everybody will help you
Discover what you set out to find
But if I can save you any time
Come on, give it to me
I'll keep it with mine
The train leaves at half past ten
But it'll be back tomorrow same time again
The conductor, he's weary
Still stuck on the line
But if I can save you any time
Come on, give it to me
I'll keep it with mine
I can see your face on the wall, I hear your voice and I call
I feel the weight of it all, can't brace myself for the fall
In the silence I hear your fading call, in your eyes I see and feel it all
In my mind I try to let go, it's so hard 'cause you're all I know
You act like there's nothing wrong, you laugh when I call on the phone
Say it's time that I try to move on that the life that we had is now gone
In the silence I hear your fading call, in your eyes I see and feel it all
In my mind I try to let go, it's so hard 'cause you're all I know
In the silence I hear your fading call, in your eyes I see and feel it all
In my mind I try to let go, it's so hard 'cause you're all I know
What you gonna do when it all breaks down
Take another heart through this lonely town
What you gonna do when she turns around
And says I never ever thought that you'd be messing 'round
But then you dance dance dance with the woman that lets you
How's it gonna feel until I catch you
What you gonna do when she turns around
And says you broke another heart that was broken down
It's a crying shame, that the love you've made
Is a cross that you bear when it's cold
Why don't you leave me alone?
Take a chance with the woman that lets you
Take a chance with the woman that lets you
How you gonna feel when it's all found out
Chase another heart that was up in doubt
What you gonna do when I turn around
I said I never ever thought that you'd be messing 'round
But then you dance dande dance with the women that lets you
How's it gonna feel until I catch you
How you gonna find out what she had in mind
I you keep tearing out the pages of an alibi
It's a crying shame, that the love you've made
Is a cross that you bear when it's cold
It's a crying shame, that the love you've made
Is a cross that you bear when it's cold
Why don't you leave me alone?
Take a chance
With a woman who lets you
Take a chance
With a woman who lets you
Take a chance
Take a chance
How you gonna feel when it's all found out
Chase another heart that was up in doubt
What you gonna do when I turn around
You said I never ever thought that I'd be messing 'round
But then you dance dance dance with the woman that lets you
How's it gonna feel until I catch you
What you gonna do when she turns around
And says you broke another heart that was broken down
It's a crying shame, that the love you've made
It's a crying shame, that the love you've made
It's a crying shame, that the love won't leave me alone
If I go to Gloucester you know I will
Wait there for you
The Rhumb Line is waiting there too
You know it's worth the nights we wait there
It all falls apart, apart
Come on
Come on
If I go to Gloucester you know I will
Wait there for you
The Rhumb Line is waiting there too
You know it's worth the nights we wait there
It all falls apart, apart
Don't you think by now there's truth
In all she's said to us
Come on
Come on
Come on
Come on... and let us in
If the heather is wet then
I might be accustomed to walk
It might bet he way that we talk
The river and the rock that fell there
It all falls apart
When I arrive
Will you wake if I open the door
A tone that was taken before
The cusp and the fjords we wade through
It all falls apart
And it won't take long
Oh, and you're right
Once or twice
Sawney bean
Oh, don't you think by now there's truth
In all she's said to us
Come on
Come on
Come on
Come on... and let us in
Arms wide
Arms too wide
But oh there comes a tide
A little more
Finding a way from what's dark
In your eyes
Once or twice
It's a feel
I've a little fawn
And it won't take flight
Oh
For the brightest
Oh Christ
It's a farce
And I will flail under these lights
That seep down from the bitter sky tonight
And I will kick and beat my wrists together
And feel an ocean breathing waves,
Feel them licking at my face.
Ceilings don't exist
And there are no floors beneath me.
If I were king of this night,
Would you become my queen?
And I hope, your majesty,
That you like your position.
I'll do everything I can
To keep you by my side
And I'll stare off through the darkness
To find us a kingdom.
Just kiss me before I go.
I'll have to walk a thousand miles
Just to find the ground deserving of your feet.
You could throw me down
And walk on me.
And I'd just look on through my love
And through the haze.
And I hope, your majesty,
That you like your position.
I'll do everything I can
To keep you by my side
And Ill stare off through the darkness
To find us a kingdom.
Just kiss me before I go.
The nightingales are singing loud.
(Yeah) They're calling out our marriage
To our subjects on their knees
Their jewlry is thrown into the air.
They sigh at the release
As their shackles hit the ground.
The trumpets call out now.
We're home at last.
And I hope, your majesty,
That you like your position.
I'll do everything I can
To keep you by my side
And I'll stare off through the darkness
To find us a kingdom.
Just kiss me before I go.
The minute before we play
I'm pacing, waiting anxiously
I can't wait to hit the stage
And say "hello" to jersey
And when the last note rings
And I've sung all I have to sing
Every minute I will count
Till the next show in the next town
What can I say
That can explain
All this time
I'm loving life
There's not a day
That I can't say
All this time
I'm living out my...
The feeling of screaming out
The words of the things I think about
Hearing them coming back
From the crowds mouth is perfect
And when the curtains close
I'll realize how fast time could go
Thanks for everything
You know how much this means
What can I say
That can explain
All this time
I'm loving life
There's not a day
That I can't say
All this time
I'm living out my dream
What this is to me
Is more than words could mean
I guess dreams do come true
This song itself is living proof
What this means to me
Is more than it may seem
I guess dreams do come true
This song itself is living proof
What this is to me
Is more than words could mean
I guess dreams do come true
This song itself is living proof
What can I say
That can explain
All this time
I'm loving life
There's not a day
That I can't say
All this time
I'm singing out
A song about
A dream that has come true
Black bird slow and softly breaks a glass of wine
Broken bluesy whisper sing to me tonight
Well, everybody wants to go forever
I just wanna burn up hard and bright
I just wanna be your firecracker
And maybe be your baby tonight
Maybe be your baby tonight
Lady, your kicks of silence cough into your room
Kiss me slow and softly make me dream of you
Well, everybody wants to go forever
I just wanna burn up hard and bright
I just wanna be your firecracker
And maybe be your baby tonight
Maybe be your baby tonight
So when does the plane go down
'Cause I'm gonna ride it till it hits the ground
Then go out with a fight
'Cause I just wanna be your baby tonight
Wearing an olive drab
But feeling somehow inside opalescent
Wonder how I'm managing to smile oh
When I can't even pay my rent
Maybe it's because I've finally found
My little tulip my Norge dear
Funny how in spite of all my woes
Life can appear rosy and clear
Rosy and clear
And I'm dizzy from her kiss
So vertiginous lost in lysergic bliss
(Because it hurts me so bad)
Love the way you wear your curly hair
Sanguine and spiraling tied in a bun
Love the way it falls about your face
Mercurially gilded by the sun
If we were a pair of jigsaw puzzle pieces
We would connect so perfectly
Creating a still photo of a scene
From the Phantom of Libertay~
Of Libertay~
And I'm dizzy from her kiss
So vertiginous lost in lysergic bliss
Woman's whisper: (Okay children, remember your breathing. One, two, three, four)
If you want me to
I can hang 'round with you
If I only knew
That's what you're into
You and him, him and you
If that's what you're into
Him hangin' 'round around you
You're hangin' 'round, yeah, you're there too
And if you want me to
I will take off all my clothes for you
I'll take off all my clothes for you
If that's what you're into
How 'bout him in the nude?
If that's what you're into
In the nude in front of you
Is that what you'd want to view?
If it's cool with you
I'll let you get naked too
It could be a dream come true
Providing that's what you are into
Is that what you're into?
Him and you in the nude
That's what he's prepared to do
Is that the kind of thing that you think you might be into?
And then maybe later
We'll get hot by the refrigerator
In the kitchen next to the pantry
You think that might be what you fancy?
In the buff, bein' rude
Doin' stuff with the food
Gettin' lewd with his food
We heard that's what you are into
And then on our next date
Well, you could bring your roommate
I don't know if Stu is keen to
But if you want, we could double team you
How 'bout you and two dudes?
Him, you, and Stu in the nude
Bein' lewd with two dudes for food
Well, that's if Stu's into it too
All the things I do
The things I do for you
If I only knew
That's what you're into
Won herself a pass to some far off moon
It was second class but what's to lose
And looking out her window she could more than assume
That you can't see air or time
She's the only rocketeer in the whole damn place
They gave her a mirror so she could talk to a face
She still got plenty lonely but that's just the case
With time, time, time
Started hearing voices sometime in June
She knew she could go crazy but didn't think that soon
Now she doesn't feel lonely but she'd just as soon
Try, try, try
Man shot to the moon
I bought a paperback and want to go real soon
I'm shot to the moon
Been there a half an hour, I wanna come home soon
The cut-rate mime walking through the dirty streets
Of Paris in the hot August heat
Sun melting the fake smile away
Just looking for a place to stay
The actress gave up all her old dreams
And traded up, now she is a queen
Royal familys don't have time for that shit
Your crystal ball, you keep it hid
The tractor-trailor driver radios:
"Help me someone, I'm out here all alone."
Truck driving the black night away
Praying for the light of day
The kid in the mall works at Hawt Dawg on a Stick
His hat is a funny shape, his heart is a brick
Taking your order, he will look away
He doesn't have a thing to say
But me, I'm feeling pretty good as of now
I'm not so sure when I got here or how
Sun melting the fake smile away
I think you know, I'll be okay
So I'm a little left of center
I'm a little out of tune
Some say I'm paranormal
So I just bend their spoon
Who wants to be ordinary
In a crazy, mixed-up world
I don't care what they're sayin'
As long as I'm your girl
Hey, you were on my side
And they, they just roll their eyes
You get me
When nobody understands
You come and take the chance, baby
You get me
You look inside my wild mind
Never knowing what you'll find
And still you want me all the time
Yeah, you do
Yeah, you get me
So what if I see the sunshine 
In the pouring rain
Some people will think I'm crazy
But you say it's okay
You've seen my secret garden
Where all of my flowers grow
In my imagination
Anything goes
I, I am all you want
They, they just read me wrong
You get me
When nobody understands
You come and hold my hand, baby
You get me
You look inside my wild mind
Never knowing what you'll find
Still you want me all the time
Yeah, you do
'Cause you get me
Hey, you were on my side
They, they just roll their eyes
Yeah, yeah, yeah
'Cause you get me
When nobody understands
You come and take the chance, baby
You get me
When none of the pieces fit
You make sense of it
You get me
You look inside me wild mind
Never knowing what you'll find
And still I want you all the time
Yeah, I do
'Cause you get me
Yeah, oh, yeah, oh
Really Doe:
You motherfuckers better do your job and roll up, and watch how we roll up
And I can't control it, I can't hold it, it's so nuts
I take a sip of that 'gnac, I wanna fuck
I take a hit of that chronic, it got me stuck
But really what's amazin' is how I keep blazin'
Towel under the door, we smoke until the day's end
Puff, puff and pass, don't fuck up rotation
Hpnotiq for Henny? Now nigga that's a chaser
Turn nothin' to somethin', now pimpin' that's a savior
Best things are green now pimpin' get your paper
High off the ground from stair to skyscraper
Cool out, thinkin' we local, c'mon homey we major
Kanye West:
We major? C'mon homie we major
We major? C'mon homie we major
We major, c'mon homie we major
We major, c'mon
Feelin' better than some head on a Sunday afternoon
Better than a chick that say yes too soon
Until you have a daughter that's what I call karma
And you pray to God she don't grow breasts too soon
Projects to' up, gang signs is thrown up
Niggas hats broke off, that's how we grow up
Why else you think shorties write rhymes just to blow up?
Get they first car and then IRS show up
He ain't never had shit, but he had that nine
Nigga come through flickin' and he had that shine
Put two and two together and a little bad weather
Gon' be your whole family on that funeral line
Asked the reverend was the strip clubs cool
If my tips helped send a pretty girl through school
That's all I want, like winos want they good whiskey
I ain't in the Klan but I brought my hood with me

I heard the beat and I ain't know what to write
First line should it be about the hoes or the ice?
Fo-fo's or Black Christ? Both flows'd be nice
Rap about big paper or the black man plight
At the studio console, asked my man to the right
What this verse sound like, should I freestyle or write?
He said, "Nas what the fans want is Illmatic, Stillmatic"
Looked at the pad and pen, fell, and jotted what I feel
Been like twelve years since a nigga first signed
Now I'm a free agent and I'm thinkin' it's time
To build my very own Motown
'Cause rappers be deprived, of executive nine to five's
And it hurts to see these companies be stealin' the life
And I love to give my blood sweat and tears to the mic
So y'all copped the LP's and y'all fiends got dealt
I'm Jesse Jackson on the balcony when King got killed
I survived the livest niggas around
Last longer than more than half of you clowns
Look, I used to cook before I had the game took
Either way, my change came like Sam Cooke
Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah
Tony Williams:
Feeling better than I ever felt before today

Sun comes up on the old neighbourhood
Spray painted bricks and dead firewood
Well, I don't know where I'm gonna be next
I don't care where I'm gonna be
Next time, if you think of it
You might remember me as
The one who let you down
But never made another sound of fear
Some people like to call me Chuck
It's "Charles" and you are shit outta luck
If you think you know what happens next
You think you know what happens
Next time, if you think of it
You might remember me as
The one who let you down
But never made another sound of fear
Sun goes down on the old neighborhood
Dark damp has stopped where I once stood
I don't know where the bus stops next
And I don't care where the bus stops
Next time, if you think of it
You might remember me as
The one who let you down
But never made another sound of fear
The sound of fear
I can hear
The sound of fear
I welcome the sun
The clouds and rain
The wind that sweeps the sky clean and lets the sun shine again
This is the most magnificent life has ever been
Here is heaven and earth and the brilliant sky inbetween
Blessed is this life and I'm gonna celebrate being alive
Blessed is this life and I'm gonna celebrate being alive
Blessed is this life oh, and I'm gonna celebrate being alive
Blessed is this life oh, and I'm gonna celebrate being alive
I dwell in the darkness
I let in the light
I sleep in the afternoon and become the noise in the night
I trespass in temptation suffer in sacrifice
But I awake each day with the new sunrise
Blessed is this life oh, and I'm gonna celebrate being alive
Blessed is this life oh, and I'm gonna celebrate being alive
Blessed is this life oh, and I'm gonna celebrate being alive
Blessed is this life oh, and I'm gonna celebrate being alive
Begging like, you might
Take order in your own hands.
I stare, seems like I don't care
Drop a chance in your hands, then
I know the bad's gotta fix itself
Correct over time
And I know
'Cause I've got the cure
I've got a cure for your crimes
All I dreamed of
All that seemed like luck
Seems silly to you now
All I said to you
All I did for you
Seems so silly to me now
Screaming like
No one might
Call the cops and arrest you this time
Standing back
Against my building's back door
You're hoping for a ride
I know the world's been mean to you
I've got a cure, hold tight
I know the world's not fair to you
I've got a cure for its crimes
All I dreamed of
All that seemed like luck
Seems silly to you now
All I said to you
All I did for you
Seems so silly to me now
Oh, oh when you say it
So, so slowly to me
Oh, oh well I keep going
Oh, no I run while knowing
No, no I know you need it
So, so I need it too and
Oh, oh I must keep going
So, so you must too, and
Oh, oh when you say it
So, so slowly to me
Oh, oh well I keep going
Oh, no I run while knowing
No, no I know you need it
So, so I need it too
And oh, oh I must keep going
So you
Must too
Oh oh
I've got a cure
I've got the cure for you
I've got a cure
I've got the cure
(2x)
All I dreamed of
All that seemed like luck
Seems silly to you now
All I said to you
All I did for you
Seems so silly to me now
(2x)
I've got a cure
I've got the cure for you
Oh, Oh...

(Oh yeah, oh yeah)
(Oh yeah, oh yeah)
(Oh yeah-oh yeah)
(Oh yeah, oh yeah)
I am whole
Hot is the night
The grass is so tall
And slow
The air is wet
And I feel alive
Let the perfume drip
Let it rise!
I am whole
And I walk the night
Luscious and lost
So alone
Touch the rocks
And lick the light
Let the hot winds howl
So slow
Here am I
Looking for a lover to climb inside
Waiting like a flower to open wide
I'm in bloom!
I lie low
I'm ready to try
The tapestries turn
And grow
Creepers crawl
And kiss my thighs
And the headiness howls
Rise and rise!
Here am I
Looking for a lover to climb inside
Waiting like a flower to open wide
I'm in bloom!
Here I lie
Lying like a flower with no more time
Waiting for another to come inside
I'm in bloom!
Oh yeah! Oh yeah!
Oh yeah! Oh yeah!
Oh yeah! Oh yeah!
Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!
(Oh yeah, oh yeah)
(Oh yeah, oh yeah)
A pretty girl is like a minstrel show
It makes you laugh 
It makes you cry
You go 
It just isn't the same on radio 
It's all about the makeup and the dancing and the Oh
A pretty girl is like a violent crime 
If you do it wrong you could do time 
But if you do it right it is sublime 
I'm so in love with you, girl, 
It's like I'm on the moon 
I can't really breathe, but I feel lighter 
A melody is like a pretty girl 
Who cares if it's the dumbest in the world 
It's all about the way that it unfurls 
A pretty girl is like 
A pretty girl
And you
You're gonna walk backwards
Through the room
Does that mean I won't see you?
It means you walk backwards
Through the room
Tiffany's crying
She's dying to make it out of this hell
I just laught
'Cause it was my job to be her help
But I'm in my bedroom
Where friends won't debate my health
Like"how can he save some summer night,
When he can't save himself"
You've got to pick me up
C'mon and pick me up
When I'm falling down
You've got to pick me up
Cut to December
How can a scalpel tear into skin
Revealing walks in the park
Lord how can a heart
Come from two separate organs
And you're gonna make this simple
Do you want to make me sweeter?
I know, I know, I know, I know
I'll let you down
I'll let you down
Prescriptions scripting a timeline
Swing sets, grade schools, and black eyes
First love, heartbreak, and true love
Mistakes, heartbreak, and true love
I woke up today in a very simple way
In the morning all I could do was sing
I was thinking of things the blue ocean brings
The way it glows, the way it always knows
That when you lose something like a golden diamond ring
You will know that it will show the way the ocean always knows
Yes, I understand I cannot live on this land
But does that truly mean I have seen all that can be seen?
As for now I will stay in the oven I will bake
As you sit down to pray into the river I will wade
I woke up today in a very simple way
I woke up today in a very simple way
I woke up today in a very simple way
I woke up today in a very simple way
Who would've known the rain and the sunshine
Would ooh, baby, baby, build up these walls of mine?
And I can't see you or breathe you, 'cause there's trouble right beneath you, it's all in the night,
But ooh, baby, baby, come pick me up in your ride...
I'm a cool low Jane with a skip on my feet;
I play tough as nails with my heart on my sleeve...
I'm nothing but a sandcastle - Baby, don't blow me away... away...
Baby, I know you do that to all the girls - You know that I'm fragile...
(Ooh-ooh-ooh, hoo-hoo, hoo-hoo-hoo...)
Ba-, ba-ba-ba-baby, don't blow me away...
Baby, I know you do that to all the girls - You know that I'm fragile...
(Ooh-ooh-ooh, hoo-hoo, hoo-hoo-hoo...)
Ba-, ba-ba-ba-baby, don't blow me away...
Who would've known the storm of my past times,
Would ooh, baby, make me lose in the storm of the eye?
And I can't believe you or read you, 'cause there pleasure in your preview - It's all in your eyes...
But ooh, Mr. DJ, baby, can you meet me outside?
You're a old school dude with a kick on your shoes;
You got groove in your hand the way you spin those tunes...
I'm nothing but a sandcastle - Baby, don't blow me away... away...
Baby, I know you do this to all the girls, but baby, I'm fragile...
(Ooh-ooh-ooh, hoo-hoo, hoo-hoo-hoo...)
Ba-, ba-ba-ba-baby, don't blow me away...
Baby, I know you do that to all the girls - You know that I'm fragile...
(Ooh-ooh-ooh, hoo-hoo, hoo-hoo-hoo...)
Ba-, ba-ba-ba-baby, don't blow me away...
Ooh, and just like the ocean (Just like the ocean, baby...) lays right there behind me,
Look over my sandcastle, and there's a sight to see...
Don't blow me away!
Don't blow me, baby...
(Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba-ba-ba, ba-ba, ba-ba-ba. ba-ba...)
Ooh, baby I know you do that to all the girls - You know that I'm fragile...
(Ooh-ooh-ooh, hoo-hoo, hoo-hoo-hoo...)
Ba-, ba-ba-ba-baby, don't blow me away...
Baby, I know you do that to all the girls - You know that I'm fragile...
(Ooh-ooh-ooh, hoo-hoo, hoo-hoo-hoo...)
And ba-, ba-ba-ba-baby, please don't blow me away... away... away...
(Ba, ba-da, ba-ba, ooh-ooh...)
Away... away...
(Ba, ba-da, ba-ba, ooh-ooh...)
Away... away...
(Ba, ba-da, ba-ba, ooh-ooh...)
(Ba, ba-da, ba-ba, ooh-ooh...)
Today was a fairytale
You were the prince
I used to be a damsel in distress
You took me by the hand
And you picked me up at six
Today was a fairytale
Today was a fairytale
Today was a fairytale
I wore a dress
You wore a dark grey T-shirt
You told me I was pretty
When I looked like a mess
Today was a fairytale
Time slows down
Whenever you're around
But can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standin' there
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
Today was a fairytale
You've got a smile
That takes me to another planet
Every move you make
Everything you say is right
Today was a fairytale
Today was a fairytale
All that I can say
Is now it's getting so much clearer
Nothing made sense
Till the time I saw your face
Today was a fairytale
Time slows down
Whenever you're around, yeah
But can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standin' there
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
Time slows down
Whenever you're around
I can feel my heart
It's beating in my chest
Did you feel it?
I can't put this down
But can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standin' there
It must have been the way
But can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standin' there
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
Oh, oh, yeah, oh
Today was a fairytale
Can we take the next hour
And talk about me
Talk about me, and we'll talk about me
Talk about me, and we'll only talk about me
Can we please take this hour
And talk about me
And my hatred for corporate magazines
You know they don't speak to me
The irony is they won't speak with me
I placed you on a windowsill
Cut notches up and down the door
My surprise, I woke up one morn
In our bed
In your place
Lay a note
It read:
Baby your love
It just ain't good enough
I found sunlight six hours away
You watered me down till I drifted abound
Somewhere far from your shade
Now I shadow my former self
Once holy, now lonely
A chest full of holes
Red wax, it paints me unclear
When the big hand strikes twelve
I disappear
And the angels are fake
They'll lie to your face
Anything to keep you away
You watered me down till
I drifted abound
Oh!
It's time I accept the fact
That you on your back
It has buried the past
Can we please take this hour and talk about me
Talk about me, and we'll talk about me
Talk about me, and we'll only talk about me
Can we take the next hours and talk about me
And my hatred for corporate magazines
You know they don't speak to me
The irony is they won't speak with me
I could stick around and get along with you 
Hello 
It doesn't really mean that I'm into you 
Hello 
You're alright but I'm here darling to enjoy the party 
Don't get too excited 'cause that's all you get from me 
Hey 
Yeah I think you're cute but really you should know 
I just came to say hello 
Hello 
Hello 
Hello 
I'm not the kinda girl who'd get messed up with you 
Hello 
I'mma let you try to convince me to
Hello 
It's alright I'm getting dizzy just enjoy the party 
It's ok with me if you don't have that much to say 
Hey 
Kinda like this thing but there's something you should know 
I just came to say hello 
Hello 
Hey 
Hey 
I could stick around and get along with you 
Hello 
It doesn't really mean that I'm into you 
Hello

I just came to say hello 
Hello 
Hello 
Hello 
I'm not the kinda girl who'd get messed up with you 
Hello 
I'mma let you try to convince me to 
Hello 
It's alright I'm getting dizzy just enjoy the party 
It's okay with me if you don't have that much to say 
Hey 
Kinda like this thing but there's something you should know 
I just came to say hello 
Hey
I was sitting on the fence
And I thought that I would kiss you
I never thought I would miss you
But you never let me fall
Push my back against the wall
Every time you call, you get so emotional
I'm freaking out
Ring, ring
Is that you on the phone?
You think you're clever but you never say nothing at all
Hey, hey
The way you spin me around
You make me dizzy when you play me like a kid with a crown
You got a dangerous obsession
Now I'm in need of some protection
That was never my intention
Used to love me, now you hate me
Say I drove you crazy
Well, if I did, you made me
Won't somebody save me from you now?
Ring, ring
Is that you on the phone?
You think you're clever but you never say nothing at all
Hey, hey
The way you spin me around
You make me dizzy when you play me like a kid with a crown
It's words I wanted
Until you blasted
Why won't you leave me alone?
Hang up the phone
Just let me go
Ring, ring
Is that you on the phone?
You think you're clever but you never say nothing at all
Hey, hey
The way you spin me around
You make me dizzy when you play me like a kid with a crown
Ring, ring
Is that you on the phone?
You think you're clever but you're never saying nothing at all
Hey, hey
The way you spin me around
You make me dizzy when you play me like a kid with a crown
Ring, ring
Ring, ring
Ring, ring
Lets go
Lets go my love
We could go to the cinema
Big effects and big named stars
And we can go to that private view
But darling these days my favorite view is you
Lets just bend the invitation
And leave our bikes down at the station
Lose our sense of direction
There's nothing here to lose
Oh you will run
Come get lost with me
Slip away discreetly
You're my love
So come away with me
Let's get lost till empty
We could stay here till closing time
But the drinks are flat and the price is a crime
We could dance till our feet turn red
But the beats so boring
And I'd rather be home in our bed
This towns skipping like a record
Reruns get me so bored
So with enough that I can afford
Let's get lost
Again
Yeah we will run
Come get lost with me
Slip away discreetly
You're my love
Come get lost with me
Till we run on empty
Lets go
Lets go
You're my love come get lost with me
You're my love come till empty
Lets go
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Spending time
Convinced that it's mine with her
Just to keep her out of mind
Still I'll take care to see
Which way the wind blows
Notice how her hair curls
Pay no mind to the clown
Who sits to your side
Content to yield, despite pride
He is a fool to assume, you'd spare a thought
I'm a thief who's just been caught
I don't find it funny anymore
And so I won't play the part I played before, oh no
Not to you
Mmm, I don't see you laughing anyway
And so I won't play a part in your mistake, no way
Not unless you stay
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Let's count the days until winter comes our way
We're all tired and ready to breathe
And there's a rumor that
There's a bitter cold chill in the air.
It's haunting every breath we take.
The hint of alcohol and nicotine it keeps us warm inside.
So all your fashion sense aware, the sweaters unfold themselves.
We are all alone, but we're better off by ourselves.
It's time to roll the windows down and
Feel the cold air all around.
We are heading out of town and
Not a thing can stop us now.
Get carried away.
Let's think about all those nights on Luckie St.
We stayed up till 3 am, with all the gossip and the latest girls.
There's a bitter cold chill in the air.
It's haunting every breath we take.
The hint of alcohol and nicotine it keeps us warm inside.
So all your fashion sense aware, the sweaters unfold themselves.
We are all alone, but we're better off by ourselves.
It's time to roll the windows down and
Feel the cold air all around.
We are heading out of town and
Not a thing can stop us now.
Get carried away.
This winter is much like all the rest.
This season's changed since we've been away.
This winter is much like all the rest.
It's time to roll the windows down and
Feel the cold air all around.
We are heading out of town and
Not a thing can stop us now.
Get carried away.
Couldn't relax, couldn't sit back
And let the sunlight in my lap
I sang a hymn to bring me peace
And then it came, a melody
It felt so sweet, it felt so strong
It made me feel like I belonged
And all the sadness inside me
Melted away like I was free
I found what I'd been looking for in myself
Found a life worth living for someone else
Never thought that I could be, I could be
Happy, happy
Don't go out much at all
I've never been the type to call
I realize, to be happy
Maybe I need a little company
So now you know, you know it all
That I've been des-desperately alone
I haven't found the one for me
But I believe in divinity
I found what I'd been looking for in myself
Found a life worth living for someone else
Never thought that I could be, I could be
Happy, happy
I believe (I believe) in possibility
I believe (I believe) someone's watching over me
And finally (Finally) I have found a way to be
Happy, happy
From the concrete to the coast
I was looking for a holy ghost
Like the land joining the sea
Happiness, it followed me
I believe (I believe) in possibility
I believe (I believe) someone's watching over me
And finally (Finally) I have found a way to be
Happy, happy, happy
Ash his heart onto the ground
Pull his guts out by frustration
Be careful you might kill him
Just 'cause he can't hear what you say
Doesn't mean that he's not listening
If you listen to your words, he might like what you say
So you've been going out for years and I'm sure that you've been happy
Happy with your role
You've been looking up to him
As if you've forgotten of your own life, forgotten of your own face
Burn and start again
Just 'cause he can't hear what you say doesn't mean that he's not listening
If you listen to your words then he might like what you say
On my own again
That's what she said, that's what she said
I'm leaving you tomorrow, but she already left, she already left
On my own again
That's what she said, that's what she said
I'm leaving you tomorrow, but she already left, she already left me
She said I'm better off dead
It's your own life
Live it for yourself
It's your own life
Live for your... just 'cause he can't hear what you say
Doesn't mean that he's not listening
If you listen to your words, then he might like what you say
On my own again
That's what she said, that's what she said
I'm leaving you tomorrow, but she already left, she already left
On my own again
That's what she said, that's what she said
I'm leaving you tomorrow, but she already left, she already left me
She said I'm better off dead
I had a tension, I had a ten
I was a better honey, so I did it again
Thought my intentions were better 
Tried to put mind over matter
I lost my edge on things when I lost my head
Hey, that's what they say
Don't you know they ain't never going to help you anyway
And it's a (Get together to tear it apart)
Gave my middle finger a brand new start
I got a greeting, can't say what it's all about 
But my middle finger is going to carry it out
I got attention, I had a pen
I made history, honey and got "Please do it again"
But there is no chance I'm going to do it again
If you missed it the first time
Then it's nine to ten that you will again
And we're back at the end
Back at the end all over again
And they say Hey (Hey!)
That's what they say
Don't you know they ain't never going to but I feel okay
And it's a (Get together to tear it apart)
Gave my middle finger a brand new start
I got a greeting, can't say what it's all about 
But my middle finger is going to carry it out
(Get together to tear it apart)
Gave my middle finger a brand new start
I got a greeting, can't say what it's all about 
But my middle finger is going to carry it out
As I was walkin' by
Saw you standin' there with a smile
Lookin' shy, you caught my eye
Thought you'd want to hang for a while
Well, I'd like to be with you
And you know, it's Friday too
I hope you can find the time
This weekend to relax and unwind
My mind's tired, I've worked so hard all week (ooh, all week)
Cashed my check, I'm ready to go
I promise you, I'll show you such a good time
Come on, baby, let's get away
Let's save our troubles for another day
Come go with me, we've got it made
Let me take you on an escapade, let's go
(Escapade) We'll have a good time
(Escapade) Leave your worries behind
(Escapade) Well, you could be mine
(Escapade) An escapade
So don't hold back, just have a good time
We'll make the rules up as we go along
And break them all if we're not havin' fun
Come on, baby, let's get away (ooh)
Let's save our troubles for another day (ooh)

In the middle of nowhere
When we're looking for something
Then we raise our heads for the colour red
I am too a spirit and a wonderer
And I welcomed the dew as much as you did
When we're looking for brushwood
In the nearest neighbourhood
Then we follow the sky with the eye
We search vegetation
And surprised by the rain
We're stumbling, tripping home again
In the middle of nowhere
When we're looking for something
Then we raise our heads for the colour red
I am too a spirit and a walker
And I welcomed the dew as much as you did
We found the little man
And his aeroplane
But we never located the animal
Examined the dirty ground
Like it never been done
Modern exploring of 1991
He's got a dirty mind, just don't know what you're gonna find.
On her way from the school,
She saw him, she saw him.
In a second she knew,
She wanted him, oh she wanted him.
There was no trace on him,
Of filth, grime or dirt.
An overwhelming urge
To smile, laugh and flirt.
There she goes with a twinkle in her eye,
Don't take a genius to understand the reason why.
There she goes with a twinkle in her eye,
Don't take a genius to understand the reason why.
He's got a dirty mind, just don't know what you're gonna find.
This girl he thought she was,
Living in a dream.
It's just that he was,
Exceptionally clean.
All the boys that she, that she had known before,
Avoided hygiene.
Around at his house,
You could eat off the floor,
Which was slightly unnerving.
Hygiene boy, oh what am I to do?
I feel positively filthy standing next to you.
Hygiene boy, oh what am I to do?
I feel positively filthy standing next to you.
He's got a dirty mind, just don't know what you're gonna find.
She got to know his mind intimately,
She was surprised to find,
Something of an anomaly.
You see this perfect boy,
Wasn't quite so pristine,
He had ideas that would (He had ideas that could),
Make the Devil scream.
Dirty mind, don't know what you're gonna find,
He's got a dirty mind, just don't know what you're gonna find.
Dirty mind, don't know what you're gonna find,
He's got a dirty mind, just don't know what you're gonna find.
Dirty mind, don't know what you're gonna find,
He's got a dirty mind, just don't know what you're gonna find.
Dirty mind, don't know what you're gonna find,
He's got a dirty mind, just don't know what you're gonna find.
Home and away
Life goes on the same, bury the pain
And hold on to love
Heal the song, sing along
But what does it change
Oh this life is so confusing
Feels like I'm always losing
Come in knowing everything
But don't say a word, till they teach you the way
Words are found too close to the edge
That we don't dare sing
This will turn into something else, something else
And when it does, I'll be somewhere else, somewhere else
Where else?
And you said I should be myself
Despite all the wrong, dragging you back
Forgive and then forgone and on and on and on and on
This life is so confusing
Feels like I'm always losing
And this'll turn into something else, something else
But when it does, I'll be somewhere else, somewhere else
Where else?
Underneath the moon
Underneath the stars
Here's a little heart for you
Up above the world
Up above it all
Here's a hand to hold on to
But if I should break
If I should fall away
What am I to do
I need someone to take
A little of the weight
Or I'll fall through
You're just the one that I've been waiting for
I'll give you all that I have to give and more
But don't let me fall
Take a little time
Walk a little line
Get the balance right on
Give a little love
Gimme just enough
So that I can hang on tight
We will be all right
I'll be by your side
I won't let you down
But I gotta know
No matter how things go
That you will be around
You're just the one that I've been waiting for
I'll give you all that I have to give and more
But don't let me fall
But don't let me fall
Underneath the moon
Underneath the stars
Here's a little heart for you
Up above the world
Up above it all
Here's a hand to hold on to
You're just the one that I've been waiting for
I'll give you all that I have to give and more
But don't let me fall
You'll be the one that I'll love for ever more
I'll be here holding you high above it all
But don't let me fall
Boys had better beware
You could seem to color your hair
Or on a wig, you already spent
All the dough to cover your rent
But not so cool man if you care
For all the other boys caught in your bleach job hair
And girls better beware
Boys, you better, you better
Yeah 
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Boys had better beware
You could seem a wasted affair
And like a bitch you already spent
All the dough you promised your friends
But not so cool man if you care
For all the other boys caught in your bleach job hair
And girls, you better beware
Boys, you better, you better
Yeah 
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Ah ah
Boys said
She had
Like God's hands
A-men
Oh man it's not fair
To all the other boys caught in your bleach job hair
And girls, you better beware
Boys, you better, you better
A-heh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh
A-heh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh
Ah ah ah ah
A-heh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh
Midnight shadows

But daylight is so close

Some people say such awful things
Don't understand they're so hateful
We don't need those diamond rings
Even though they look tasteful
Chichi parties
So important
Sink a fortune
High-class apartment
One or two ooh-oohs
Make you feel so good
It's not a threat to nobody
In fact the people they should
Ooh
Don't you give me them blues
I got magic in my dancing shoes
Let me hear you say ooh
When you talk sweet things in my ear
I get so hot inside I'm burning my clothes
Measure distances with tears
The tracks'll run for miles when I feel those
Mixed emotions
In your heart
Guilty feelings
You fall apart
One or two ooh's
Nothing left to lose
I'm not a threat to nobody
Don't try to give me them blues
Ooh
Don't you give me them blues
I got magic in my dancing shoes
Let me hear you say ooh
Say honey baby don't you know
Ain't got any money left to blow
Can't buy you no snow cone
Even when it's hot outside
Wanna make love show you what I can do
Pocket that rug you'll ride the groove
Just lemme go dance and give me no blues tonight
Ooh
Don't you give me them blues
I got magic in my dancing shoes
Let me hear you say ooh
In a modern culture
My friend you must be careful
They've a million ways to kill you
In this dangerous world
There's an art to growing old
Take your chances
Magic happens
One mistake's all it takes
And your life has come undone
Walk away 'cause you're breaking up the girl
It's a drag
I know it's hard
But you're tearing her apart
Walk away 'cause you're breaking up the girl
I am afraid that there's much to be afraid of
Here today and gone tomorrow
Don't end up in the gutter
Just like the one before
You're just the same
You're such a loser
One mistake's all it takes
And your life has come undone
Walk away 'cause you're breaking up the girl
It's a drag
I know it's hard
But you're tearing her apart
Walk away 'cause you're breaking up the girl
You've gotta let her go because you're breaking up the girl
The girl
One mistake's all it takes
And your life has come undone
Walk away 'cause you're breaking up the girl
It's a drag
I know it's hard
But you're tearing her apart
Walk away 'cause you're breaking up the girl
You're breaking up the girl
You're breaking up the girl
The girl
My legs are dangling off the edge
The bottom of the bottle is my only friend
I think I'll slit my wrists again
And I'm gone, gone, gone, gone
My legs are dangling off the edge
A stomach full of pills didn't work again
I'll put a bullet in my head
And I'm gone, gone, gone, gone
Gone too far, yea I'm gone again
It's gone on too long, tell you how it ends
I'm sitting on the edge with my two best friends
One's a bottle of pills, and one's a bottle of gin
I'm twenty stories up, yea up at the top
I polished off this bottle, now it's pushing me off
Asphalt to me has never looked so soft
I bet my momma found my letter, now she's calling the cops
I've got to take this opportunity before I miss it
'Cause now I hear the sirens and they're off in the distance
Believe me when I tell you that I've been persistent
'Cause I'm more scarred, more scarred then my wrist is
I've been trying too long with too dull of a knife
But tonight I made sure that I sharpened it twice
I never bought a suit before in my life
But when you go to meet God, you know you want to look nice
So if I survive, then I'll see you tomorrow
Yea I'll see you tomorrow
My legs are dangling off the edge
The bottom of the bottle is my only friend
I think I'll slit my wrists again
And I'm gone, gone, gone, gone
My legs are dangling off the edge
A stomach full of pills didn't work again
I'll put a bullet in my head
And I'm gone, gone, gone, gone
We hit the sky, there goes the light
No more sun, why's it always night?
When you can't sleep, well you can't dream
When you can't dream well, what's life mean?
We feel a little pity but don't empathize
The old are getting older, watch a young man die
A mother and a son and someone you know
Smile at each other and realize you don't
You don't know what happened to that kid you raised
What happened to that father, who swore he'd stay
I didn't know, 'cause you didn't say
Now momma feels guilt, yea momma feels pain
When you were young, you never thought you'd die
Found out you could, but too scared to try
Looked in the mirror and you said goodbye
Climbed to the roof to see you if could fly
So if I survive, then I'll see you tomorrow
Yea, I'll see you tomorrow
My legs are dangling off the edge
The bottom of the bottle is my only friend
I think I'll slit my wrists again
And I'm gone, gone, gone, gone
My legs are dangling off the edge
A stomach full of pills didn't work again
I'll put a bullet in my head
And I'm gone, gone, gone, gone
I wish that I could fly
Way up in the sky
Like a bird so high
Oh, I might just try
I wish that I could fly
Way up in the sky
Like a bird so high
Oh, I might just try
Oh, I might just try
If this life is one act
Why do we lay all these traps
We put them right in our path
When we just wanna be free
I will not waste my days
Making up all kinds of ways
To worry about some things
That will not happen to me
So I just let go of what I know I don't know
And I know I'll only do this by
Living in the moment
Living our life
Easy and breezy
With peace in my mind
With peace in my heart
Peace in my soul
Wherever I'm going, I'm already home
Living in the moment
I'm letting myself off the hook for things I've done
I let my past go past
And now I'm having more fun
I'm letting go of the thoughts
That do not make me strong
And I believe this way can be the same for everyone
And if I fall asleep
I know you'll be the one who'll always remind me
To live in the moment
To live my life
Easy and breezy
With peace in my mind
I got peace in my heart
Got peace in my soul
Wherever I'm going, I'm already home
I can't walk through life facing backwards
I have tried
I tried more than once to just make sure
And I was denied the future I'd been searching for
But I spun around and searched no more
By living in the moment
Living my life
Easy and breezy
With peace in my mind
I got peace in my heart
Got peace in my soul
Wherever I'm going, I'm already home
I'm living in the moment
I'm living my life
Just taking it easy
With peace in my mind
I got peace in my heart
I got peace in my soul
Oh, wherever I'm going, I'm already home
I'm living in the moment
I'm living my life
Oh, easy and breezy
With peace in my mind
I got peace in my heart
I got peace in my soul
Oh, wherever I'm going, I'm already home
I'm living in the moment
Boy do you hear me say
Do you hear me say now
Love ain't far
Well I didn't mind, I didn't mind, I didn't mind
You can't hurry love
You can't hurry love
Boy do you hear me say
Do you hear me say now
Love ain't far
Well I didn't mind, I didn't mind, I didn't mind
You can't hurry love
You can't hurry love
You can't hurry love
You can't hurry love
You can't hurry love
I apologize, seem to have arrived
Home with items in my bag from your house
There's cutlery, a tablecloth, some Hennessy
And a book on Presidents deceased
I'll have them fed-exed to you
It was a strange thing to do
I hope we can still be friends
Ah, it was not me
But someone else, you see
Twisting the steering reins
Put a penny in the slot and make an artificial light shine
Leave go, my golden arm
I don't give advise
But be wise and think twice
Before getting involved in a game
Where the minority face the majority
Who are faceless and born without names
Was it not sick when we came across three men
They had church candles wrapped in newspaper
I bought two from them and I lit one for you
I hope the message made it's way down the wire
Put a penny in the slot and make an artificial light shine
Leave go, my golden arm
The soul of a dog, he's alive and not gone
To the farm like the others said
A Rhodesian Ridgeback, off the beaten track
In a furniture shop down on the quays
For the loneliness you foster I suggest Paul Auster
A book called Timbuktu
Put a penny in the slot and watch the Drunken sailor boy dance
She will not let you be
Her lover
She goes out looking for
The taxi
Her phone is ringing straight to
Message-minder
Send out a battalion
To find her
Put a penny in the slot and count the swans through a telescope
I can't help from cryin', I wish you were mine
When I was seventeen, I followed my dream
Up into a high-rise block
The adventures of Augie March, by Saul Bel-low
Was all I had for company
At night time I'd lie in Beckenham Park
With tears like flashbulbs
And recall my treasure-searching days
In the rock pools as a kid
To the remains of the Chair-o-Planes
Or around the bonfire in Nailors' cove
Good company and grief, sit like a dock leaf
Sits beside a stinging nettle
Put a penny in the slot and make an artificial light shine
Leave go, my golden arm
I'm afraid of the dark,
'Specially when I'm in a park
And there's no one else around,
Ooh, I get the shivers
I don't want to see a ghost,
It's a sight that I fear most
I'd rather have a piece of toast
And watching the evening news
Life, oh life, oh life, oh life,
Doo, doot doot dooo
Life, oh life, oh life, oh life,
Oh life, doo, doot dooo
I'm a superstitious girl,
I'm the worst in the world
Never walk under ladders,
I keep a rabbit's tail
I'll take you up on a dare,
Anytime, anywhere
Name the place, I'll be there,
Bungee jumping, I don't care!
Life, oh life, oh life, oh life,
Doo, doot doot dooo
Life, oh life, oh life, oh life,
Doo doot doo
Life
Doo doot doo, doo doot doo, doo
So after all is said and done
I know I'm not the only one
Life indeed can be fun,
If you really want to
Sometimes living out your dreams,
Ain't as easy as it seems
You wanna fly around the world,
In a beautiful balloon
Life, oh life, oh life, oh life,
Doo doot doot dooo
Life, oh life, oh life, oh life,
Doo doot doot dooo
Life, oh life, oh life, oh life,
Doo doot doot dooo
Life, oh life, oh life, oh life, oh life
Doo doot doot dooo
Doo doot doot dooo...
Oh life, oh life, oh life...
I can tell you now
When I'm here to listen
To what I've got to say
All my words unplanned
Just like us they are waiting
To come together
I don't know if we're ready to take our train
Oh I, oh I, I'm gonna fix this world up for you
I'll try, I'll try to build it all around you
You'll never gonna have to be alone
You'll alway know you got someone
To fix the world up for you
Well I've been out getting wrong
More times that I get it right
That I won't even realize it
But I've been doing all I can
To stop you falling
Even now I'm holding my breath for you
But you don't know, you don't know
That I'm ready to hold you now, hold you now
Oh I, oh I, I'm gonna fix this world up for you
I'll try, I'll try to build it all around you
You'll never gonna have to be alone
Yeah You'll alway now you got someone
To fix the world up for you
Gonna fix the world up, up for you
Gonna fix the world up, up for you
Gonna fix the world up, up for you

You can't just give it away
Like it means nothing
Love isn't this game where
You win something
I'm tired of being
On the outside
I want to know
What it's like
I'm tired of seeing
All the sights
I want to feel
Us collide
Your love washes over
Like a tidal wave
I feel the impact
As we collide
Your love washes over
Like a tidal wave
I feel the impact
As we collide
All the games that we play
You're fooling nobody
If it makes you feel good
When you're hurting somebody
I'm tired of being
On the outside
I want to know
What it's like
I'm tired of seeing
All the sights
I want to feel
Us collide
Your love washes over
Like a tidal wave
I feel the impact
As we collide
Your love washes over
Like a tidal wave
I feel the impact
As we collide
I feel the impact
As we collide
Half past one on the dancefloor,
And my thoughts have turned to murder (thoughts have turned to murder)
Total strangers feel my eyes,
Burning into them.
They know that I wanna kill them.
'Cause I can't get over you,
And I can see them looking at you.
And I just can't, can't get over you.
It hurts to see you dance so well.
Quarter to two on the dancefloor,
But my feet won't dance no more (feet won't dance no more)
I've got no spirit for dancing,
Since you walked right out the door.
Now all my moves are flawed.
'Cause I can't get over you,
And I can see them dancing up to you.
And I just can't, can't get over you.
It hurts to see you looking so fine.
It hurts to see you dance so well.
I remember the times that we kissed,
And the beats my heart missed,
But our feet never missed a beat,
When we were dancing cheek to cheek.
And you knew all the best moves,
And the funkiest grooves,
But you never knew,
How much I was in love with you.
And now it's two o'clock on the dancefloor,
And I'm going home,
I'm going home,
I'm going home alone.
Hearts need a beat, like awake needs asleep
Like a pen needs a page, to learn right you need a mistake
Oh, Yeah!
Hearts need a mind, like a clock needs the time
Like white needs black, if you leave I hope you need to come back
Oh, I swear, I know, I believe it, oh
I can't stop hearing all the singin'
Oh my soul has never had this feelin'
It feels like gold
You got so much love in you
You got so much love in you
I'm amazed that I'm talkin' to you
You look like the songs that I've heard my whole life coming true
Strike all the bells, hit 'em hard, make 'em all yell
Celebrate, infatuate, lock us up, yeah, incarcerate oh!
Oh, I swear, I know, I believe it, oh
I can't stop hearing all the singing
Oh my soul has never had this feeling
It feels like so, so,
So much love in you
You got so much love in you
I'm amazed that I'm talkin' to you
You look like the songs that I've heard my whole life coming true
You got so much love in you
You got so much love in you
I'm amazed that I'm talkin' to you
You look like the songs... oh
Yeah, oh come on...
Ah, ah...
You got so much love in you
You got so much love in you
I'm amazed that I'm talkin' to you
You look like the songs that I've heard my whole life coming true...
You look like the songs, oh oh oh oh!
Glamor and fashion
Models and magazines... a striking runway entrance
Beauty and passion
Stardust and high class scenes of popular teens
When I lived in Denver, I met a millionaire
With ribbons in her blonde hair
I still remember she was like a princess
Straight from a dreamy castle in the air
So lovely...
She was everything to me
Both alone in the dark
We long to see the sun
Rise over the Bering Strait
I was sick of the west
When I turned 21
So I moved to the Sunshine State
We played golf on the moon
And tennis on the sun
Like athletes of the afternoon 
The solar flares burned my arms 
And made her makeup run
On our super lunar honeymoon
I was the youngest son of a congressman
And everything was my fault
She was a gymnast happily swinging
On the uneven bars tucked in a somersault
So lovely...
She was everything to me
So lovely...
She was everything to me
Both alone in the dark
We long to see the sun
Rise over the Bering Strait
I was sick of the west
When I turned 21
So I moved to the Sunshine State
We played golf on the moon
And tennis on the sun
Like athletes of the afternoon 
The solar flares burned my arms 
And made her makeup run
On our super lunar honeymoon
You left your black gloves on my table
You left your dark horse in the stable
Thinking of a way to get you to stay 
And I'll promise to fight the wind and waves for you
I'm an owl with tired eyes
I'm the scarecrow in disguise
The absolute con
I would babe sing 
When all I want to do is stay inside 
And look out the window with you
There was a dead mouse in your arms
That was the moment that you lost your charm
No bear paw sitting in a jar
And your tree, it never grew any leaves
Shake my arms, shake my head
I fell asleep on your cobweb
And I'm turning from all the lights tonight
Saw you in a crowded bar, pale with hungry eyes
Hey what's the matter?
Nothing's the matter
That's why I can't leave my house
You must get lonely (No)
I don't get lonely (So)
That's why I can't leave my house
Head into the city - well, I guess it can't hurt
Nothing's on the television, on the networks
Take me outta context, take me outta here
Put the windows down, scream in doubt, really tune it out
Something going on but I don't know where
You're playing with your telephone, you're playing with your hair
The record seems broken, yeah I really don't care
Put the windows down, scream in doubt, really tune it out
Do it again, do it again
Same club, same verdict
Same DJ's working
Feels like I've been here before
Haven't you heard it? (No)
I don't think I've heard it
I'd like to hear it some more
Head into the city - well, I guess it can't hurt
Nothing's on the television, on the networks
Take me outta context, take me outta here
Put the windows down, scream in doubt, really tune it out
Do it again, do it again
One of us is gonna be here and
One of us is gonna be running
Off alone to the great unknown
You're not me, you're a model of freedom
All you need are your kicks when you need 'em
Come and go, caught that slow alright
With one hand off the side
We get farther away in the blink of an eye
And it's the time we waste
Swallowed into space
It's the time it takes to blow away
Hey, hey you, yeah you gotta be leaving,
Say what you want, what you say, say anything
No one knows just how deep it goes
We are old in your teenaged tyranny
And all you need is a hunger to feed
I've got my own secrets though, say what?
With a heart full of mess and lore
We are doomed but we wanted more
It's the ride we take
The many winged escape
It's the bough we break to blow away
And we blow away
One of us is now retreating
You knocked me down so hard
I'm seeing a thousand stars
Come out where you are
'Cause I won't ever be caught crying
And I will not be taken lying down
It blows into smoke
The time we waste
Swallowed into space
It's the time it takes to blow
It's the ride we take
The many winged escape
It's the bough we break to blow
It's the times we say
That no one's gonna take your place
It's a mistake to blow away
We blow away
When you think
Nothing could be further from the truth.
When you're sure
Nothing could be further from the cold hard truth
I kneel to condition all the feelings that I feel
Slow it down
You have a tendency to rush back into your past
Slow it down
You transfer all your weight and disappear
You kneel to condition all the feelings that you feel
I've got a red belt around my mind
My hands tied up around these words
I wish you'd call but I know that you're out tonight
My ears fill with the sound of your kneeling
My ears fill with the sound of descent
My ears fill with the sound of your arching
Slow it down,
You have a tendency to rush back into your past
Slow it down,
You transfer all your weight and disappear
Kneel to condition all the feelings that you feel
Kneel to condition all the feelings that you feel
Kneel to condition all the feelings that you feel
Kneel to condition all the feelings that you feel
If you surround yourself with negative people
You'll never feel settled in or become an equal - no.
They'll suppress you of your spirit and rinse you dry of smiles.
So reach deep and release your inner child. Yeah Yeah!
So Stand Up! For the Love, Love, Love
So Stand Up! For the Love, Love, Love
So Stand Up! Yeah
'Cause you're as old as you feel you are
And if you don't reach for the moon you can't fall on the stars
So I live my life like every day is the last, last, last
'Cause you're as old as you feel you are
And if you don't reach for the moon you can't fall on the stars
So I live my life like every day is the last, last, last
Listen!
If you let a frown become your normality, yes
You don't set an example for the youth of our humanity
If you spend every day wishing for the next to come
Aged and lifeless is what (Yes!) you'll become. Yeah Yeah!
So Stand Up! For the Love, Love, Love
So Stand Up! For the Love, Love, Love
So Stand Up! Yeah
'Cause you're as old as you feel you are
And if you don't reach for the moon you can't fall on the stars
So I live my life like every day is the last, last, last
'Cause you're as old as you feel you are
And if you don't reach for the moon you can't fall on the stars
So I live my life like every day is the last, last, last
So stand up
So ignore the bad and know the good is to come
Don't think second best
Be number one
Spread some love
Don't give to receive
Strive to be happy
And live to believe
So ignore the bad and know the good is to come
Don't think second best
Be number one
Spread some love
Don't give to receive
Strive to be happy
And live to believe. Yeah Yeah Yeah!
So Stand Up! For the Love, Love, Love
So let me see you. Yeah Yeah!

So Stand Up!
Woe oh, oh, oh!
Woe oh, oh, oh!
I gotta feel like it don't make, like it don't make
Feel like it don't make sense
I'm thinking baby you and I are undeniable
But I'm finding now love's unreliable
I'm given all I got to make you stay
Or am I just a roadblock in your way?
'Cause your a pretty little windstorm
On the boulevard
Something like a sunset
Oh yeah a shooting star
And I might drive myself insane
If those lips start speaking my name
'Cause I got some intuition
Or maybe I'm superstitious
But I think you're a pretty sweet pill that I'm swallowing down
To counter this addiction
You got me on a mission
Tell me darling can I get a break, somehow?
Can I say no?
She's got a love like woe (Woe oh oh oh)
Girl's got a love like woe (Woe oh oh oh)
(Ba da da)
I gotta feel like it don't make sense
'Cause you're bringing me in
And now you're kicking me out again
Love so strong (Woe oh oh oh)
Then you moved on (Woe oh oh oh)
Now I'm hung up in suspense
Because you're bringing me in
And then you're kicking me out again
It's like a hurricane
Speed train
She's a movie
Go catch her in the fast line
Oh I gotta know
Can I keep up with her pace?
Kick it into gear when I see that face
You can take up all my time 'cause you're the only one
That can make a storm cloud break
Pulling out the sun
And I can get caught in the rain
Can I get your lips to speak my name?
'Cause I got some intuition
Or maybe I'm superstitious
But I think you're a pretty sweet pill that I'm swallowing down
To counter this addiction
You got me on a mission
Tell me darling can I get a break, somehow?
Can I say no?
She's got a love like woe (Woe oh oh oh)
Girl's got a love like woe (Woe oh oh oh
(Ba da da)
I gotta feel like it don't make sense
'Cause you're bringing me in
And now you're kicking me out again
Love so strong (Woe oh oh oh)
Then you moved on (Woe oh oh oh)
Now I'm hung up in suspense
Because you're bringing me in
And then you're kicking me out again
Because we only have one life
the timing andthe moment
All seem so right
So would you say you're mine? (We'll be just fine)
Would you say you're mine? (We'll be just fine)
She's got a love like woe (Woe oh oh oh)
Girl's got a love like woe (Woe oh oh oh)
(Ba da da)
I gotta feel like it don't make sense
'Cause you're bringing me in
And now you're kicking me out again
Love so strong (Woah oh oh oh)
Then you moved on (Woah oh oh oh)
Now I'm hung up in suspense
Because you're bringing me in
And then you're kicking me out again
She's got a love like woe (Woe oh oh oh)
Girl's got a love like woe (Woe oh oh oh)
(Ba da da)
I gotta feel like it don't make sense
'Cause you're bringing me in
And now you're kicking me out again
Love so strong (Woah oh oh oh)
Then you moved on (Woah oh oh oh)
Now I'm hung up in suspense
Because you're bringing me in
And then you're kicking me out again
I want to be alone for a while
I want earth to breathe to me
I want the waves to grow loud
I want the sun to bleed down
See the waves go down
See the moon alone
See the world unshown
I raise my head and whisper
Rise and shine
Rise and shine my sister
I want to see the wounded moon
I want the sea to break through
I want it all to be gone tomorrow
So I've come to say goodbye...
My lover, I've been donating time to review
All the misinterpretations that define me and you
I'm thinking about you
In my secret language
'Cause I know you're the only one
Who can help me take it easy
Now I'm happy in the head
Knowing there ain't no sucker in the world
That's a threat to us
We've become material
It's like hey you were always there
Just on the tip of my tongue
And I needed you to happen, yeah
And now that you happened
And it really really really came true
I feel like I oughta thank somebody
So I'm gonna thank you
Thank you, thank you, thank you
Thank you, thank you
So I'm calling your ass up at like
Three in the morning saying
"Wake up young dragon, let's go get compromised"
You'll be my little ally and
You can have it which way you choose
Now I'm so bombed out by your paradigm kisses
How I've hacked at our southern hemispheric eleven gods
Now I'm Cracking my sweet love
I'm cracking my sweet love (3x)
If you work all day you keep the rhythm through the night
If you work all night you keep the rhythm through the day
If you sell that soul you'll be burning up right
If you ain't got no soul, that's fine, alright
If you work all day you keep the rhythm through the night
If you work all night you keep the rhythm through the day
If you sell that soul you'll be burning up right
If you ain't got no soul, that's fine, alright
All I've ever known is true
Pick it up, pack it up, put it in a bag
Stack it up like cinnamon, we'll get it real fast
Until there's nothing left for you
Pick it up, pack it up, put it in a bag
Stack it up like cinnamon, we'll get it real fast
Until there's nothing left of you
Keep the rhythm through the night
If you need a little money keep working alright
It'll help that soul, a little help may do some right
You don't need that soul, well that's fine, alright
I work all day, keep the rhythm through the night
I work all night, keep on walking, alright
If you sell that soul, that's fine, alright
If you sell that soul, that's fine, alright
All I've ever known is true
Pick it up and pack it up and put it in a bag
Stack it up like cinnamon, we'll get it real fast
Until there's nothing left for you
We'll pick it up, pack it up, put it in a bag
Stack it up like cinnamon, we'll get it real fast
Until there's nothing left of you
Pick it up, pack it up, put it in a bag
Stack it up like cinnamon, we'll get it real fast
Until there's nothing left for you
Pick it up, pack it up, put it in a bag
Stack it up like cinnamon, we'll get it real fast
Until there's nothing left of you
Until there's nothing left of you
You kissed me on the forehead, now this kiss is giving me a concussion
We were love at first sight, now it's crush, it's crushing
I traced your steps through the city of romance lazily
I took to the desert with your harshest words and they saved me
I'll bail you out again, I've got the readies
I'm not a child I know, we're not going steady
Your pain's gigantic but it's not as big as your ego
Promise not to abandon you, please let me go
Now I've been worrying about your feelings, yeah, they were worth protecting
They say I'm too kind and sentimental like you could catch affection
Oh in your eyes there's a sadness enough to kill the both of us
Are those eyes overrated? They make me want to give up on love
I'll brace myself for the loneliness
Say hello to feelings that I detest
This maudlin career has come to an end
I don't want to be sad again
This maudlin career has come to an end
I don't want to be sad again
This maudlin career has come to an end
I don't want to be sad again
This maudlin career has come to an end
I don't want to be sad again
This maudlin career has come to an end
I don't want to be sad again
Present for a presentation presented presently
There's no I in team no me in us no you in we
I'll write down letters inside letters but I can't let her see
Pass them forward with a foreword they won't mean a thing
Treasure torn out paper from the corner of a page
Measure worn out epigrams for signs of change with age
Figure out that figuratives mark figure a and b
Images I imagined with pretty imagery (means you and me)
(You and me) we could be made for this
(Just wait and see) we might be made for this
It's so far away but I've planned a date
And that's at least a start to get inside your heart
It might be you and me oh we could be a team
It might be you and me oh just wait and see
(You and me) we could be made for this
(Just wait and see) we might be made for this
And she was, like a starry night
Like a ferris wheel, full of blue-green eyes
And a heart of steel, always on her own
Almost never real
When the night will begin
The pain it won't end, even if she falls in love
Fact, you wanna turn back
Your heart will attack, even if she falls in love
And she was, like a blade of ice
Like a lonely road, clear as day, alive
Always sharp and cold, always beautiful
I am such a fool
When the night will begin
The pain it won't end, even if she falls in love
Fact, you wanna turn back
Your heart will attack, even if she falls in love
Try to look in her eyes
The light is just right, even if she falls in love
And it isn't so bad
It's driving you mad, Even if she falls in love
When the night will begin
The pain it won't end, even if she falls in love
Fact, you wanna turn back
Your heart will attack, even if she falls in love
Try to look in her eyes
The light is just right, even if she falls in love
And it isn't so bad
It's driving you mad, Even if she falls in love
It's like I never had to see it in your eyes or feel it
I could tell when you smile.
It's like I didn't need to say anything or do much, I could tell
When you smile
All of the subatomic pieces come together and
Unfold themselves in a second...
Every single molecule is right, when
All of the subatomic pieces come together and unfold
Themselves in a second.
From ocean to sky, summer and fall
I have been there through it all
From laughing and crying to pain that comes easy
From shades of gray meaning that turn out so sweetly
I wonder when I wonder what I'll find
I look up to the sun, it only hurts my eyes
Maybe it's the answer I've been wanting in disguise
The more you are with me, the more that I'm alone
I don't need the answer, I already know
Subtle and grace, desperate for change
My hand moves away, you melt dry ice for days
Something's not right with these smiles and tantrums
Hit the ground running, it's all over and been done
See I wonder when I wonder what I'll find
I look up to the sun, it only hurts my eyes
Maybe it's the answer I've been wanting in disguise
The more you are with me, the more that I'm alone
I don't need the answer, I already know
What happens next?
We stop and go, the promise is already run cold
So now you know, so now you know
I look up to the sun, it only hurts my eyes
Maybe it's the answer I've been wanting in disguise
The more you are with me, the more that I'm alone
I don't need the answer, the answer
I look up to the sun, it only hurts my eyes
Maybe it's the answer I've been wanting in disguise
The more you are with me, the more that I'm alone
I don't need the answer, I already know
On our trip to England I noticed something obscene
People still actually give a shit about the Queen
Though London girls aren't snobs at all
And Brighton's lovely in the Fall
Left alone to drive ourselves on the opposite side
Man it was a miracle that nobody died
Hanging out with Steven Drew, Theo,
Paul and Sorrel too
Eating at Welcome Breaks daily
We danced in Leeds with Brit Pop Haley
Performing with the Apples
And then crashing at the Wrights
Bitching because Steven booked us
On such early flights
Always in a foggy haze
Because we hadn't slept for days
Every single one of our London cabbies played
The most truly repellent techno music ever made
But they'll drop you without hesitation if you try changing the station
Up to our necks in crisps and litter
In the van we dubbed the Gary Glitter
Oh, d-d-d-d-darlin'
Goodnight darlin', you're so fine
Oh
Know if words could say
But darlin' I'll find a way
To let you know what you meant to me
Guess it was meant to be
I hold you in my heart
As life's most precious part
Oh darlin' (Oh, d-d-d-d-darlin')
I dream about you often, my pretty girl, babe (darlin' you're so fine)
I love the way you soften my life with your love
Your precious love, uh-huh, oh
I was livin' like half a man
Then I couldn't love but now I can
You pick me up when I'm feelin' sad
More soul than I ever had
Gonna love you every single night
'Cause I think you're too outta sight
Oh ho, darlin' (Oh, d-d-d-d-darlin')
I dream about you often, my pretty darlin' (Darlin' you're so fine)
I love the way you soften my life with your love
Your precious love, uh-huh-huh
Woah-oh
Every night, oh darlin'
Gonna love you every single night, yes I will
'Cause I think you're too doggone outta sight
Darlin' (D-d-d-d-darlin')
I dream about you often, my pretty darlin' (Darlin' you're so fine)
I love the way you soften my life with your love
Your precious love, uh-huh, oh

Momma turned her back on me
Daddy left when I was three
Go tell sis I'm out the door
I won't need 'em anymore
We can settle by the sea
Trouble's gonna bury me
Leave my sorrows in the sand
I see water, I see land

We have gone to the country 
In your old car 
We have lost our way 
So many times 
Hello, hello 
I take you on a trip 
Hello, hello 
I take you on a trip 
Eating your Chupa Chup 
A plane is making a loop 
The beavers are so cute 
A tree gave me a fruit 
Hello, hello 
I take you on a trip 
Hello, hello 
I take you on a trip
Your love, lifting me higher
Than I've ever been lifted before
So keep it it up, quench my desire
And I'll be at your side forever more
You know your love (your love keeps lifting me)
Keep on lifting (your love keeps lifting me)
Higher (lifting me higher and higher)
Higher and higher (higher)
I said your love (your love keeps lifting me)
Keep on (your love keeps lifting me)
Lifting me (lifting me higher and higher)
Higher and higher (higher)
Listen
Now once, I was downhearted
Disappointment was my closest friend
But then you came and it soon departed
And you know he never showed his face again
That's why your love (your love keeps lifting me)
Keep on lifting me (your love keeps lifting me)
Higher (lifting me higher and higher)
Higher and higher (higher)
I said your love (your love keeps lifting me)
Keep on (your love keeps lifting me)
Lifting me (lifting me higher and higher)
Higher and higher (higher)
Alright
I'm so glad I've finally found you
Yes, that one in a million girls
And I whip my loving arms around you
Honey, I can stand up and face the world
Let me tell ya, your love (your love keeps lifting me)
Keep on lifting me (your love keeps lifting me)
Higher (lifting me higher and higher)
Higher and higher (higher)
And I said your love (lifting, lifting, lifting)
Keep on (your love keeps lifting me)
Lifting me (lifting me higher and higher)
Higher and higher (higher)
Aw, now sock it to me (lifting, lifting, lifting)
Alright, lift me up woman (your love keeps lifting me)
Keep my love going (lifting me higher and higher)
Higher and higher (higher)
I said keep on lifting (lifting, lifting, lifting)
Lift me up mama (your love keeps lifting me)
Keep on lifting me (lifting me higher and higher)
Higher and higher (higher)
No words
But tears won't make any room for more
And it don't hurt like anything I've ever felt before
This is no broken heart
No familiar scars
This territory goes uncharted
Just me in a room sunk down in a house in a town
And I don't breathe
Though I never meant to let it get away from me
And now I've too much to hold
Everybody has to get their hands on gold
And I want uncharted
I'm stuck under the ceiling I made
I can't help but feeling
I'm going down
Follow if you wanna or just hang around
Like you'll show me where to go
I'm already out of foolproof ideas
So don't ask me how to get started
It's all uncharted
Each day
I'm counting up the minutes till I get alone
'Cause I can't stay in the middle of it all
It's nobody's fault but I'm so low
Never knew how much I didn't know
Oh, everything is uncharted
I know I'm getting nowhere when I only sit and stare like
I'm going down
Follow if you wanna or just hang around
Like you'll show me where to go
I'm already out of foolproof ideas
So don't ask me how to get started
It's all uncharted
Jumpstart my kaleidoscope heart
Love to watch the colors fade
They may not make sense but they sure as hell made me
I won't go as a passenger, no
Waiting for the roads to be late
Though I may be going down
I'll take in flame over burning out
Compare where you are to where you wanna be
And you'll get nowhere
I'm going down
Follow if you wanna or just hang around
Like you'll show me where to go
I'm already out of foolproof ideas
So don't ask me how to get started, oh
I'm going down
Follow if you wanna or just hang around
Like you'll show me where to go
I'm already out of foolproof ideas
So don't ask me how to get started
It's all uncharted
Another long quiet night...
Another long quiet, lonely night spent at your side.
Not a lot left to say...
There's not a lot that I still could say to change your mind.
But with a little bit of money we could buy us a car.
With a little luck we could get away from where we are.
Let's get out of here.
We'll drive, one thousand miles an hour.
We'll fly by wheat fields and water towers.
We'll go. We'll go and we'll go and we'll go. Let's go.
Now the look in your eye...
You know, the look right before you cry... it's always here.
So in the day when you wake...
In the morning when you awake, let's disappear.
With a little bit of money we could buy us a car.
With a little luck we could get away from where we are.
Let's get out of here.
We'll drive, one thousand miles an hour.
We'll fly by wheat fields and water towers.
We'll go. We'll go and we'll go and we'll go. Let's go.
You are
An easy girl to love
An easy girl to kiss
An easy girl to miss when you're gone
I say girl
You say yeah
I love you
Easy girl
Please say
I do
And in
The morning
When it's cold
An easy girl to hold
And even when we're old and gray
I said girl
You say yeah
Well I love you
Easy girl
Please say
I do
Easy girl
Easy girl
When you go
When you go
Well my heart goes blind and the sun don't shine
Easy girl if you die then too so shall I
And I'll lay next to you in that grave side by side
I say girl
You say yeah
I love you
Easy girl
Please say
I do
Oh yeah
Easy girl
Please say
That I do
Contact was questioned from the boulevard
Head colds in frozen weeks of summer holds
I'm fine, I'm fine with waiting on the line
We sent ourselves in on the gray card scale
Hold my hand
Where storms are sand
Sand is said
To be sad
Long winded Cambridge medicative care
Head-first the motor runs, the motor must run
They confiscated every accident
And turned ourselves in on our selfish turns
With visitations from the underwhelmed
Five years, she fears to hold my broken head
Why were you gone, why were you gone so long?
She is the reason that I still believe
Hold my hand
Where storms are sand
Sand is said
To be sad
Cover your eyes in the pouring rain
Cover your eyes, everyone is all the same
Cover your eyes in the pouring rain
Cover your eyes, everyone is all the same
Far away, far away, far away
There's flowers in my house and I bought them myself
No surprises in the record collection, you must have thought I was someone else
I'm still afraid to get lost, in a city I might explore
But I'm not afraid to have an eloquent boy at my door
At my door, at my door, at my door
Oh you want to be a writer - fantastic idea
You say you've never seen America, I really think you'll like it there
Maybe you should travel with me, is this the best idea?
Because you've never seen a Redwood and you've never touched a deer
A deer, a deer, dear, a deer, a deer, my dear
Are swans deceiving us all? Oh, I for one should know
I never felt myself so graceful and I never swam so slow
So slow, so slow, so slow
You walked out when I asked you to stay
As usual you'll get your way
You closed the door and stumbled down to the street
Where you wring your hands
And you drag your feet
Where the words can't find you
To crawl inside you
I'm ringing all the warning bells
Careful or you'll hurt yourself
Others lie, lie, lie, they adore you
I'll be the one to tell
Careful or you'll hurt yourself
Gonna try, try, try 'til the morning comes
But you can't hide standing under these stars
They know everything, they know where you are
You're in your head, you're all turned around with it
And they're shining down their light to bring you back again
Back where I can find you
To crawl inside you
I'm ringing all the warning bells 
Careful or you'll hurt yourself
Others lie, lie, lie, they adore you
I'll be the one to tell
Careful or you'll hurt yourself
Gonna try, try, try 'til the morning
All you want to see is make-believe, it's nothing
But way down underneath
I'm ringing all the warning bells
Careful you don't hurt yourself
Others lie, lie, lie, they adore you
I'll be the one to tell
Careful, you'll hurt yourself 
Gonna try, try, try 'til the morning comes
Mama, someday you'll be so proud of me
You'll see me hanging in the New York gallery
Someday I'm gonna draw from the left side of my brain
People are gonna ask, "Is it brilliant or plain?"
But as long as I don't know how to hang a Warhol
I keep sketching birds, that are all like herds
Very simple and true, like, you know, when we doo doo
And if you like them, yeah
But if you don't, stop there
'Cause I really don't care
I said, Papa someday I'm gonna write a symphony
48-piece band all dressed up like me
I said, I'll write someday the satyrs of old songs
I'm gonna chill the marrow in their bones
But as long as I can't get into Carnegie Hall
I keep writing songs that are all my own
Very simple and dumb, like I always have done
If you like them, yeah
But if you don't, too bad
'Cause it's all I have
Ever since I met her, I keep thinking
"God, how great it is to play a guitar"
This way I feel that she's always with me
'Cause every other song's telling me that this time is about our love
All I do is dream of you the whole night through
With the dawn I still go on dreaming of you
You're every thought you're everything you're every song I ever sing
Summer, winter, (scat) and spring
And were there more than 24 hours in a day
That'd be spent in sweet content, just dreaming away
When skies are grey, when skies are blue
Morning, noon and night-time too
All I do the whole day through is dream of you
(Big band)
When skies are grey, even when there blue
And were there more than 24 hours in a day
Oh that'd be spent in sweet content... dreaming away
When skies are grey, when skies are blue
In the Morning, (night-time too)
All I do the whole day through is dream... (I'm dreaming, dreaming a dream) of (just dreaming dreaming a little dream) you...
Tempo a gente tem quanto a gente dá
Corre o que correr, custe o que custar
Tempo a gente dá quanto a gente tem
Custa o que correr, corre o que custar, ah
O tempo que eu perdi, só agora eu sei
Aprender a dar foi o que ganhei
E ando ainda atrás desse tempo
Te...mpo de não correr, nem de me encontrar
Ah, não se mexer!
Beija-flor no ar
Thuru-tchuru, tchuru-tchuru
Thuru-tchuru, tchuru-tchuru
Thuru-tchuru, tchuru-tchuru
Thuru-tchuru, dara-dara-dara
O rio fica lá, a água que correu
Chega na maré, ele vira mar
Como se morrer fosse desaguar
Derramar no céu, se purificar
Ah, deixar pra trás
Sais e minerais, evaporar
I believe
I believe
I believe
I believe the love you talk about with me
Is it true, do I care
Honestly, you can try to wipe the memories aside
But it's you that you erase
'Cause there's no place that I could be without you
It's too far to discard the life I once knew
Honestly, all the weather storms I bring
Are just a picture of my needs
'Cause when I think of you as mine
And allow myself with time
To lead into the life we want
I feel love, honestly
I feel love, yes, honestly
I believe you mean the best that life can bring
I believe in it all
Honestly, you can try
Your heart is just as long as mine
Is it ours to let go
'Cause there's no place that I could be without you
It's too dark to discard the life I once knew
Honestly, a single wrong is not enough
To cover up the pain in us
'Cause when I think of you as mine
And allow myself the time
To lead into the life we want
I feel love, honestly
I'll make a joke so you must laugh
I'll break your heart so you must ask
Is this the way to get us back
I don't know, honestly
I don't know, yes, honestly
There's no place that I could be without you
Honestly
There's no place that I could be without you
There's no place that I could be without you
There's no place that I could be without you
There's no place that I could be without you
Honestly
You look so neat
Everyday is your birthday
You're such a treat
I'm just a drip in your faucet
Before the party's over (make it on over)
Before the highway road
Before the day begins (make it on over now)
There's something I need to say
There's no one else
There's no one quite so perfect
When you're foreign bound
I am the coin in your pocket
Just wait for me the night through (make it on over)
Like I did for you
There's no one left to cry boo hoo (make it on over now)
Play it through okay?
You're not like me (not like me)
It seems that people stick like flies to you
And my mystery (my mystery)
Is just that I've no one to cling to
I think that it's the Chinese New Year (make it on over)
Of this I'm fairly clear
And what better way to celebrate (make it on over now)
Than run away with little boy blue? 
Come along now now now now now
Don't think on an offer that you can't refuse
Yesterday's not quite the same let's make it plain
There are things that I can do (things that I can do)
Let's skim the back with a song with love
(Some day we're going to make it all right
I's the radio that tells me so)
It's just the radio-oh-oh-oh
It's just the radio-oh-oh-oh
It's just the radio-oh-oh-oh
It's just the radio-oh-oh-oh
It's just the radio-oh-oh-oh
It's just the radio-oh-oh-oh
It's just the radio-oh-oh-oh
Matières sensuelles et sans suites, matières sensuelles et sans suites
L'enfance est plus sympathique, l'enfance apporte le magique
Que faire quand on a tout fait, tout lu, tout bu, tout mangé
Tout donné en vrac et en détail, quand on a crié sur tous les toits
Pleuré et ri dans les villes et en campagne
L'enfance est plus authentique, le jardin au haut portique
Que faire quand on a tout fait, tout lu, tout bu, tout mangé
Tout donné en vrac et en détail, quand on a crié sur tous les toits
Pleuré et ri dans les villes et en campagne

I put into Nashville, Tennessee
But you wouldn't even come around to see me
And since you're headin' up to Carolina
You know I gonna be right there behind you
'Cause I always have to steal my kisses from you
Always have to steal my kisses from you
Always have to steal my kisses from you
Always have to steal my kisses from you
Now I love to feel that warm southern rain
Just to hear it fall is the sweetest sounding thing
And to see it fall on your simple country dress
It's like heaven to me I must confess
'Cause I always have to steal my kisses from you
Always have to steal my kisses from you
Always have to steal my kisses from you
Always have to steal my kisses from you
Now I've been hangin' around you for days
But when I lean in you just turn your head away
I know you didn't mean that
She said I love the way you think but I hate the way you act
'Cause I always have to steal my kisses from you
Always have to steal my kisses from you
Always have to steal my kisses from you
Always have to steal my kisses from you
Always have to steal my kisses from you
Always have to steal my kisses from you
Always have to steal my kisses from you
Always have to steal my kisses from you
She's driving away with the dim lights on
And she's making a play, she can't go wrong
She never waits too long
She's winding 'em down on her clock machine
And she won't give up 'cause she's seventeen
She's a frozen fire
She's my one desire
I don't want to hold her down
Don't want to break her crown
When she says, "Let's go, I like the nightlife, baby"
She says, "I like the nightlife, baby"
She says, "Let's go"
She's laughing inside 'cause they can't refuse
She's so beautiful now she doesn't wear her shoes
She never likes to choose 
She got wonderful eyes and a risque mouth
And when I asked her before, she said she's holding it out
She's a frozen fire
She's my one desire
I don't want to hold her down
Don't want to break her crown
When she says, "Let's go, I like the nightlife, baby"
She says, "I like the nightlife, baby"
She says, "Let's go"
Ooh
"I like the nightlife, baby"
She says, "I like the nightlife, baby"
She says, "Let's go"
Hello, I've had you on my mind
For hours there's no doubt
There's no use wasting time
Hello, how could I ever feel this way?
With so much left to say
So much on my mind
I know there's no use
In trying harder
I got to gage and barter to get out
'Cause baby you start and then you stop
And my heart beats big before it drops
And I don't know what to do
Uh uh uh
Uh uh uh
Uh uh uh, uh
Sit back,
Let me love grow good for you
Hello, my God you're beautiful
It's true, everyday I stumble
Getting caught up on you
Now I, I never been so amused
There ain't nothing left to prove
I ain't got nothing to lose
'Cause baby, I've been lightly drinking
And a little bit too heavy on the thinking
Won't you tell me something good
'Cause baby you start
And then you stop
And my heart beats big before it drops
And I don't know what's to do
Uh uh uh
Uh uh uh
Uh uh uh, uh
Sit back
And let my love grow good for you
Sit back
And let my love grow good for you
So baby whatcha waiting,
Whatcha waiting, whatcha waiting for?
Are you out there where the rainy days
Begin to feel rather sad
And the walls are closing in
Like the darkness around me
It's so hard to look away
When the daylight doesn't ever stay
Above this dull apartment view
Oh I will surround you
It's quite clear that I'm stuck here
So I'll devise a plan
And cut out a door
In my new living room floor
The porch light is so bright
That I will quickly sneak down
The dark metal shape
Of the rusty fire escape
I bought a one way ticket
'Cause I knew I'd never see the ground
Unless I was aboard a jet plane
And we were going down
When I wiped the tears from my eyes
The warm water took me by surprise
And I woke up beside the ocean
I realized: I must be in California
Aloha my happy west coast friend
Do you feel alive
When the breaking waves arrive
And wash all around you
The beach homes and ocean side
Are quite well know by the evening tide
And we can sleep where we reside
With redwoods around us
The blue air is up there
And could I bring it down
I'd bottle it up and save it
For a sweet summer night
I bought a one way ticket
'Cause I knew I'd never see the ground
Unless I was aboard a jet plane
And we were going down
When I wiped the tears from my eyes
The warm water took me by surprise
And I woke up beside the ocean
I realized: I must be in California
Am I awake or is this just a dream?
The new year is out here
And I will make a lovely
List of your charms
So I'll never feel alone in your arms
I must be in California
Imagine me and you, I do
I think about you day and night, it's only right
To think about the girl you love, and hold her tight
So happy together
If I should call you up, invest a dime
And you say you belong to me, and ease my mind
Imagine how the world could be, so very fine
So happy together
I can't see me loving nobody but you
For all my life
When you're with me, baby, the skies'll be blue
For all my life
Me and you, and you and me
No matter how they toss the dice, it has to be
The only one for me is you, and you for me
So happy together
(Call you up...) If I should call you up, invest a dime
(Ease my mind...) And you say you belong to me, and ease my mind
(Very fine...) Imagine how the world could be, so very fine
So happy together
I can't see me loving nobody but you
For all my life
When you're with me, baby, the skies'll be blue
For all my life
I can't see me loving nobody but you
For all my life
When you're with me, baby, the skies'll be blue
For all my life
For all my life
(Call you up...)
(Ease my mind...)
(Ease my mind...)
Ease my mind
I can't see me loving nobody but you
For all my life
When you're with me, baby, the skies'll be blue
For all my life
I can't see me loving nobody but you
For all my life
When you're with me, baby, the skies'll be blue
For all my life
So happy together
So happy together
So happy together
So happy together
Up in the highest of heights
O'Hara blinks and fights
This land is yours; this land is mine.
I see the Captain in red,
And Cairo at his head.
This land is yours; this land is mine.
The lightning over the park,
The waters--brash and dark
We take a swim; we take a swim.
I never meant to escape
The carpet and the trade
This land is yours; this land is mine.
And when I make up my mind
I change it all the time
I take it back; I take it back.
The numbers over the dam,
Jo Davies and the band,
I count them out; I count them out.
There was a car in the bay
By the boat that swept and swayed
Whoever you are in the light
In the water that we made
I'm counting it out
I'm counting it out
I'm working it out inside
I'm counting it out
To the floor
The ferry hatches Moline
Panola Beauty Queen
She takes a bow; she takes a bow.
In Charles, we climb the hill
And Danville window sill
I take it back; I take it back.
My sister she counts the bars,
The Macon county cars,
She takes a bow; she takes a bow.
The Mississippi amends
The Carver and the bends
This land is yours; this land is mine.
My brother punches my ear.
The injured ivory deer
I call my dad; I call my dad.
We skip inside of the store
The Mason winter door
This land is yours; this land is mine.
There was a car in the bay
By the boat that swept and swayed
Whoever you are in the light
In the water that we made
I'm holding your hand by the shore
With our collars pulled up tight
I'm counting it out
I'm counting it out
I'm working it out inside
I'm counting it out
(This land is not your land
For the right hand takes what it can,
Ransacks with the mad man.
For this land is not yours or mine to have.
This land was made for the good of itself.)
Ride it on out like a bird in the skyways
Ride it on out like you were a bird
Fly it on out like an eagle in a sunbeam
Ride it on out like-a you were a bird
Wear a tall hat like a druid in the old days
Wear a tall hat and a tattooed gown
Ride a white swan like the people of the Beltane
Wear your hair long, babe, you can't go wrong
Catch a bright star and a-place it on your forehead
Say a few spells and baby, there you go
Take a black cat and you sit it on your shoulder
And in the morning you'll know all you know
Oh
Wear a tall hat like a druid in the old days
Wear a tall hat and a tattooed gown
Ride a white swan like the people of the Beltane
Wear your hair long, babe, you can't go wrong

Today is a lovely day to run
Start up the car with the sun
Packing blankets and dirty sheets
A roomful of dust and a broom to sweep up
All the troubles you and I have seen
Cross when the drawbridge light is green
Don't look back to that messed-up scene
Packing blankets and dirty sheets
A roomful of dust and a broom to sweep up
All the troubles you and I have seen
And all our troubles will be gone
Blowing out over that bridge
Floating up into the sky
Making the storm clouds cry
La-da-da-da-da
La, la-da-da-da
Put out that smoke and breath some air
Get a new name and cut your hair
Packing blankets and dirty sheets
A roomful of dust and a broom to sweep up
All the troubles you and I have seen
Get dirty, get clean
Get some new scene to wipe the dirt from everything
That touches you and takes you far from faith
In body, in deep I saw you creeping
Little footsteps through my sleep and
Color me with images of faith
And you can be anyone or just some mother's wasted son
Oh you can be your own god if you want to
Come over come quick come laugh get sick
Come battle two swords with a stick
And when you've gone I'll put it through my chest
'Cause listen kid everybody knows you can fit good company up your nose
And we fall hardest better worst than best
And you can love anyone
You will believe me when I'm gone
Oh you can be your own god if you want to
Come on to my side you will define me with a knife
Spare me all the misery as I tear apart your life
Oh you can lose yourself in art
Or you can break somebody's heart in two
Jump on in, the water's fine for swimming
Look over look fast again look past
The motley kids and ugly cast
That smother you, all radiant with joy
'Cause somebody once said when I was young
Playing dead was just no fun
But these days I am a man, I'm not a boy
And you can be anyone
Or just some mother's wasted son
Oh you can be your own god if you want to
Come on to my side you will define me with a knife
Spare me all the misery as I tear apart your life
Oh you can lose yourself in art
Or you can break somebody's heart in two
Jump on in, the water's fine for swimming
Why I make that face? Oh why would I?
Why would I test my faith? Oh why would I?
Oh why?
I see that raincloud coming right for me
Why would I say my name? Oh why would I?
When I'm so far away? Oh why would I?
Oh why?
I guess I've always been a bit of a fighter
From now on wear my love for you loose
From now on I am just passing through
From now on trust my feeling is true
From now on call me Royal Blue
Why would I stick around? Oh why would I?
Why would I get burned down? Oh why would I?
Oh why? For me I'm always waiting in shadows
Oh why? For me I'm always looking for a way out
From now on with the sky as my roof
From now on let the risk lead me to
From now on somewhere I never knew
From now on call me Royal Blue
Hey
From now on fly as high as I want
From now on I'll show my weak spot
From now on you know that I do
From now on call me Royal Blue
From now on wear my love for you loose
From now on I am just passing through
From now on trust my feeling is true
From now on call me Royal Blue
Summertime, summertime
Brought me back to thinking you were mine, all those times.
We laid it down and left it all behind, we were blind.
Oh, the summertime.
We could ride, we could ride.
Take my hand and watch the world go by.
Laugh or cry, well we need to try, get off the line, time to fly.
Oh, the summertime.
Go on ahead and let it fade away.
No looking back you know the past will stay.
It's you and me, we could get out of here.
Jump in and go and we could drive for years.
We could feel alive...
Here we are, here we are,
Windows down we see a falling star.
Stop the car.
Waiting for nothing but our beating hearts, going far.
Oh, the summertime.
So feel the air, feel the air,
Take the map and point to anywhere.
I don't care. Fingers through your hair,
The sky I've seen blue and green.
Oh, the summertime.
Go on ahead and let it fade away.
No looking back you know the past will stay.
It's you and me, we could get out of here.
Jump in and go and we could drive for years.
We could feel alive...
Drivin' away, leaving it all behind.
Drivin' away
Drivin' away, and leaving it all behind.
And drivin' away
Drivin' away, just drive away, leaving it all behind
Drivin' away, just drive away, leaving it all behind
Drivin' away, just drive away, leaving it all behind, driving away, yeah
Just drive away, yeah yeah yeah, go...
People should smile more
I'm not saying there's nothing to cry for
And you've got
Everything laid out for you
Just close your eyes, take a deep breath, and start another war
Keep buying, keep moving
This city, is sitting
Next to me
We'll lay it out
It's gonna come, one thing is certain
I can't change the world
'Cause trying to make a difference
Makes it worse
It's just an observation
I can't ignore
That people should smile more
And people should smile more
But the lights are so bright that they blind you
Just one more
Meaningless scientific breakthrough
The more we know, the less we care, what's damaged on the way
Keep moving, keep buying
This city, is sitting
Next to me
We'll lay it out
It's gonna come, one thing is certain
I can't change the world
'Cause trying to make a difference
Makes it worse
It's just an observation
I can't ignore
That people could smile more
People should smile more

You're a part time lover and a full time friend
The monkey on your back is the latest trend
I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else
But you
Here is the church and here is the steeple
We sure are cute for two ugly people
I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else
But you
We both have shiny happy fits of rage
I want more fans, you want more stage
I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else
But you
You are always trying to keep it real
I'm in love with how you feel
I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else
But you
I kiss you on the brain in the shadow of a train
I kiss you all starry eyed, my body's swinging from side to side
I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else
But you
The pebbles forgive me, the trees forgive me
So why can't, you forgive me?
I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else
But you
Du du du du du du dudu
Du du du du du du dudu
I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else
But you

God made me, yeah
But I don't want to pray to my maker
I just want to be what I see
Not just who I am but the pink in golden land
And a five mile sky over me
Help me to the sun, hey I'm looking everywhere
See I'm looking to become not the prayer but the prayer
And now don't want to pray (no)
I say I don't want to pray (no)
And now I don't want to pray (mhmm)
I don't want to pray

But I don't want to pray to my maker
I just want to be feeling free
Not like in a book or the leaves and trees that shook
From a word that means only not a thing
Pardon god and mom
What I'm saying isn't fair
See I'm looking to become not the prayer but the prayer
And now I don't want to pray (no)
I say I don't want to pray (no)
Hey uh, I don't want to pray (no)
You don't want to pray
Not much good to talk here ought to walk it
Not much good to take better to give
We are born forgiven and forgotten of our sins
Yeah I promise you my friends
All that dies will live again
Pardon god and mom
What I'm saying isn't fair
See I'm looking to become not the prayer but the prayer
And now I don't want to pray (no)
You say I don't want to pray (no)
Oh now I don't want to pray

I was raised in a Catholic school
Learned who to fight with and pray to
I learned how to hold on
From a book of old psalms
And if you're trying to sing an old song
And you're getting all the words wrong
Well, you're just a-following along
Too closely in the book
I learned how to keep my head 
From something Paul said
About keeping the fruit in the spirit 
From the chorus down to the hook
And sometimes I wonder
What in God's name did I do
To deserve you
Oh, to deserve you
'Cause I just rolled and I tumbled
Down a long road I stumbled
While shooting in the dark
As to what's best
And finally, I found you
Without ever learning how to
I put the right foot in front of the left
And beyond that is anybody's guess
I learned how to keep my head 
From something Paul said
About keeping the fruit in the spirit 
From the chorus down to the hook
Oh, and sometimes I wonder
What in God's name did I do
To deserve you
Oh, to deserve you
'Cause I just rolled and I tumbled
Down a long road I stumbled
While shooting in the dark
As to what's best
And finally, I found you
Without ever learning how to
I put the right foot in front of the left
'Cause I just rolled and I tumbled
Down a long road I stumbled
While shooting in the dark 
As to what's best
And finally, I found you
Without ever learning how to
I put the right foot in front of the left
And beyond that is anybody's guess
I woke up today with this feeling
That better things are coming my way (way)
And if the sunshine has a meaning
Telling me not to let things get in my way
When the rainy days are dying
Gotta keep on, keep on trying
All the bees and birds are flying (ah ah ah)
Never let go, gotta hold on in
Non-stop till the break of dawnin'
Keep movin' don't stop rockin' (ah ah ah)
Get on up when you're down
Baby, take a good look around
I know it's not much, but it's okay
We'll keep on moving anyway
Feels like I should be screaming
Trying to get it through to my friends
Sometimes it feels like life has no meaning
But I know things will be all right in the end
When the rainy days are dying
Gotta keep on, keep on trying
All the bees and birds are flying (ah ah ah)
Never let go, gotta hold on in
Non-stop till the break of dawnin'
Keep movin' don't stop rockin' (ah ah ah)
Get on up when you're down
Baby, take a good look around
I know it's not much, but it's okay
We'll keep on moving anyway
When the rainy days are dying
Gotta keep on, keep on trying

We'll keep on moving anyway
Get on up when you're down
Baby, take a good look around
I know it's not much, but it's okay
We'll keep on moving anyway...
If sweet Death should ever conquer me
Let me know, boys, let me know
If you hear him coming, won't you let me flee?
Let me go, boys, let me go
One day Death is going to conquer me
I'll be down where the waters flow
I hope sweet Heaven has a place for me
Let me know, boys, let me know
If sweet Death should ever conquer me
Take me down to some place below
If you hear him coming, won't you set me free?
Let me go, boys, let me go
If you hear him coming, won't you say for me
That I just don't want to go
Movie dialog:
You are now the king, and you will be a truly great king.
Awww, it looks good on him, look! He looks great. Hey king!
You look perfect. King king king. He looks perfect. Fresh king!
...
Hey king, what's your first order of business?
Let the wild rumpus start!!!
Perfect answer!
Oh, oh, oh... (chanting)
1! Set! Off! We go!
2! Set! Off! We go!
Hit the door! Hit the floor, it's the dawn of the day!
Hey! Woo!
You can start when we say! it's a lot, I know
We don't need a ghost in the light off hope
We don't need a ghost in the light off hope
Go! Go!
Aaaaa! ...
All in a line we go, we will
Don't even know
We don't need it
All right

Yeah, uh huh

All right, kick it

Boy
Pills
Yes
So your ex's got a mansion, where you kick it on the hill
Your boy comes to see you, he's your Hollywood thrill
He's a Spanish fly who bucks like a stallion
In the suits that you got him, he looks more Italian
When you worry about your tan, when the weather's getting clammy
Summer in the city, and winters in Miami
And you get so high on the high-life pills
Cruising and boozin' and rockin' on the horse-sized pills
And you could even take more thrills
And you could even take more spills
Pills
Thrills chills
Ills, man
Kills
And rockin' on the horse-sized...
Butt's getting bigger, do you think he'll notice, maybe?
That's okay, don't worry 'bout it baby
'Cause everybody knows he pumps you for your money
That's all right, don't worry 'bout it honey
In your itsy-bitsy teeny-weenie riding-up-your-butt bikini
Keeping on the heels, 'cause you're sagging just a teeny
Bit more then the girls he pretends he doesn't thrill
Rubbing on the lotion and rocking on the horse-sized pills
And you could even take more thrills
And you could even take more spills
Pills
Thrills
Chills
Ills, man kills
And rockin' on the horse-sized...
Sometime you feel like Moses
That's when you're toasted
Yeah

Rockin' on the horse-sized
I was gazing in your eyes
Seeing butterflies melting on the wall
Strangest thing I saw
Clever little guys
Wonderful surprise
Will you come and fetch me, girl
From the brink?
I'm starting to kink
And I'm too numb to think
If this nightmare can't be stopped
Go out and find me when I'm dropped
Onto a bale of hay looking the other way
From noncoms in machines squeezing tangerines
Emitting horrid cries
Wonderful surprise
Will you come and fetch me, girl
From the brink?
I'm starting to kink
And I'm too numb to think
If this nightmare can't be stopped
Go out and find me when I'm dropped
Shoulder to shoulder, amused but not advanced
He, she, you, me, it's all just circumstance
Eager, hopeful, content to play the friend
Timid advances with mutual regret
She can't always be wrong, he can't always be right
Not a matter of choice, just a matter of time
Till they know where they stand once they've reached the end
Awkward choices with smiles from ear to ear
A faded union that won't survive the years
Timeless series of blameless accidents
Oh, the stubborn cycle of inherited mistakes
She can't always be wrong, he can't always be right
Not a matter of choice, just a matter of time
Till they know where they stand once they've reached the end
I'll be mine where I place my drafts
When the desert ends, I'll ask the dust
I'll be mine where I place my drafts
When the desert ends, I ask the dust
To be the motion actor,
Two broken strings, attracted,
To groom my face in life and doom
Hesitate to throw a coin in,
A wish could be a bad thing,
My mouth is just a mush of drool
Standing on the bridge I
Wink at you from up high
A talking fish comes as she moves
I want to be like water
And never need a doctor
And carve the earth without my tools
Do it all
All the things that I relate to well,
Like authors and painters
Transparent paper wings
That float above me while I sleep
To make the room more natural
So we could die in it and die in it and die
The color after sunset
You'd do anything to jinx it,
It'll crush your sculpture just like a willow,
He doesn't need a house
His shoes will walk for miles
There's a gypsy's face make on my pillow.
I want to be like water and slip into your throat
And make you feel alive and good
I want to be like water and never have a doubt and
Reflect what is around my pool
Do it all
All the things that I relate to them
Like authors and painters,
Transparent paper wings
That float above me while I sleep
To make the room more natural
So we could die in it and die in it and die.
And all the dreams that I awake to read like ghostly paintings
And all the things I hate, I wish I didn't have to hate
To find a room that's natural
To live and die in it, live and die, live and die.
I don't think you know just what you're doing
You pretend to know exactly all the things you keep on moving
Said I don't think I know exactly what I'm doing
But I tend to know exactly all the things you keep on moving
When you wake up from your snoozin'
I'll tell you how to do it my way
I'll tell you what I'm doin'
There's a knife up in the drawer
Anybody try to stop it
And I'll find out where you're stompin'
And it's all about the days you spend
Without me at our home.
I can't stand to think about
A heart so big it hurts like hell
Oh my God, I gave my best
But for three whole years to end like this
Well do you want to fall apart
I can't stop if you can't start
Do you want to fall apart
I could if you can try to fix what I've undone
'Cause I hate what I've become
You know me,
Or you think you do you, you just don't seem to see
I've been waiting all this time to be
Something I can't define. So let's
Cause a scene
Clap our hands and stomp our feet or something,
Yeah something.
I've just got to get myself over me
I could stand to do without
All the people I have left behind
What's the point in going 'round
When it's a straight line baby, a straight line down
So let's make a list of who we need
And it's not much, if anything
Let's make a list of who we need
And we'll throw it away 'cause we don't need anyone
No, we don't need anyone
You know me,
Or you think you do, you just don't seem to see
I've been waiting all this time to be
Something I can't define. So let's
Cause a scene
Clap our hands and stomp our feet or something,
Yeah something.
I've just got to get myself over me
And I hate what I've become
You know the night life is just not for me
'Cause all you really need are a few good friends
I don't want to go out and be on my own
You know they started something I can't stand
You leave for the city, well count me out
'Cause all this time is wasted on
Well, everything I've done
You know me,
Or you think you do you, you just don't seem to see
I've been waiting all this time to be
Something I can't define. So let's
Cause a scene
Clap our hands and stomp our feet or something,
Yeah something.
I've just got to get myself over me
You know me,
Or you think you do you, you just don't seem to see
I've been waiting all this time to be
Something I can't define. So let's
Cause a scene
Clap our hands and stomp our feet or something,
Yeah something.
I've just got to get myself over me, yeah
Over me, yeah. Over me.
Down in Bowery
They lose their ballads and their lipped mouths in the night
And stumbling through the street
They say, Sir, do you got a light?
And if you do, then you're my friend
And if you don't, then you're my foe
And if you are a deity
Of any sort, then please don't go
Ne me quitte pas, mon cher
Ne me quitte pas
Ah, ah, ah
Ne me quitte pas, mon cher
Ne me quitte pas
Down on Lexington
They walk in new shoes
Stuck to aging feet, and
Close their eyes and open
And not recognize the aging street, and
Think about the things were right
When they were young and veins were tight, and
If you are the Ghost of Christmas Past
Then won't you stay the night?
Ne me quitte pas, mon cher
Ne me quitte pas
Ah, ah, ah
Ne me quitte pas, mon cher
Ne me quitte pas
Oh, ooh, ooh
Ne me quitte pas, mon cher
Ne me quitte pas
Ah, ah, ah
Ne me quitte pas, mon cher
Ne me quitte pas
Down in Bronxy Bronx
The kids go sledding
Down snow-covered slopes, and
Frozen noses, frozen toes
The frozen city starts to glow, and
Yes, they know that it will pass
And, yes, they know New York will thaw, but
If you're a friend of any sort
Then play along and catch a cold
Ne me quitte pas, mon cher
Ne me quitte pas
Ah, ah, ah
Ne me quitte pas, mon cher
Ne me quitte pas
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ne me quitte pas, mon cher
Ne me quitte pas
Ah, ah, ah
Ne me quitte pas, mon cher
Ne me quitte pas
I love Paris in the rain
I love Paris in the rain
I love
I love
I love
In the rain
I love Paris in the rain
I love Paris in the rain
And I love
I love
I love
In the rain
I love
I love
I love
In the rain
Down in Paris
They walk fast
That is, unless they're walking slow, and
In cafés they look away
That is, unless they look right in, and
In the corners I get lost
That is, unless I'm getting found, and
If you are the ghost of New York City
Won't you stick around
Ne me quitte pas, mon cher
Ne me quitte pas
Ah, ah, ah
Ne me quitte pas, mon cher
Ne me quitte pas
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ne me quitte pas, mon cher
Ne me quitte pas
Ah, ah, ah
Ne me quitte pas, mon cher
Ne me quitte pas
I love Paris in the rain
I love Paris in the rain
I love

I love Paris in the rain
Man, I love
I love
I love in the rain
And I love

In the rain
In the rain
Oh, I love
In the rain
In the rain
In the rain
Ne me quitte... pas!
Ne me quitte... pas!
Ne me quitte... pas!
We wrote a prelude
To our own fairy tale
And bought a parachute
At a church rummage sale
And with a mean sewing machine
And miles of thread
We sewed the day above L.A.
In navy and red
We wound a race track
Through your mom's kitchen chairs
And fought the shadows back
Down your dark basement stairs
I lit a match, then let it catch
To light up the room
And then you yelled as we beheld
An old maroon hot air balloon
I'll be out of my mind
And you'll be out of ideas
Pretty soon
So let's spend
The afternoon in a cold hot air balloon
Leave your jacket behind
Lean out and touch the treetops over town
I can't wait
To kiss the ground
Wherever we touch back down
La la la la la laaa
La la la la la laaa
We drank the Great Lakes
Like cold lemonade
And both got stomach aches
Sprawled out in the shade
So bored to death you held your breath
And I tried not to yawn
You made my frown turn upside down
And now my worries are gone
I'll be out of my mind
And you'll be out of ideas
Pretty soon
So let's spend
The afternoon in a cold hot air balloon
Leave your jacket behind
Lean out and touch the treetops over town
I can't wait
To kiss the ground
Wherever we touch back down
I'll be out of my mind
And you'll be out of ideas
Pretty soon
So let's spend
The afternoon in a cold hot air balloon
Leave your jacket behind
Lean out and touch the treetops over town
I can't wait
To kiss the ground
Wherever we touch back down
If not for you
Babe, I couldn't even find the door
I couldn't even see the floor
I'd be sad and blue
If not for you
If not for you
Babe, the night would see me wide awake
The day would surely have to break
It would not be new
If not for you
If not for you, my sky would fall
Rain would gather, too
Without your love, I'd be nowhere at all
I'd be lost if not for you
If not for you
The winter would hold no spring
Couldn't hear a robin sing
I just wouldn't have a clue
If not for you
If not for you, my sky would fall
Rain would gather, too
Without your love, I'd be nowhere at all
I'd be lost if not for you
If not for you
The winter would hold no spring
Couldn't hear a robin sing
I just wouldn't have a clue
If not for you
If not for you
You're the kind of friend
Who always bends when I'm broken
Like remember when
You took my heart and put it back together again
I've been wasting time
With clueless guys but now it's over
Let me tell you why I'm through
I've got someone new who's just like you
You're it, you're the ultimate
It's automatic, I'm sure of it
No lie, so don't even try
To tell me that you're not the guy
'Cause I've been waiting all my life
For someone just like you
But you're it
You're the ultimate you
You're the kind of guy whose hand's in mine
Sends shivers, up and down my spine
You took my heart
And put it back together again
You're the kind of guy that blows my mind
But now it's my turn
You've been right in front of me
Everything I knew, why didn't I feel?
You're it, you're the ultimate
It's automatic, I'm sure of it
No lie, so don't even try
To tell me that you're not the guy
'Cause I've been waiting all my life
For someone just like you
But you're it
You're the ultimate you
You're it, you're the ultimate
It's automatic, I'm sure of it
No lie, so don't even try
To tell me that you're not the guy
You're it, you're the ultimate
It's automatic, I'm sure of it
No lie, so don't even try
To tell me that you're not the guy
'Cause I've been waiting all my life
For someone just like you
But you're it
You're the ultimate you
You're it
You're the ultimate you
Measure me in metered lines and one decisive stare
The time it takes to get from here to there
My ribs that show through t-shirts and these shoes I got for free
I'm unconsoled, I'm lonely
I am so much better than I used to be
Terrified of telephones and shopping malls and knives
And drowning in the pools of other lives
Rely a bit too heavily on alcohol and irony
Get clobbered on by courtesy
In love with love and lousy poetry
And I'm leaning on this broken fence
Between past and present tense
And I'm losing all those stupid games
That I swore I'd never play
But it almost feels okay
Circumnavigate this body of wonder and uncertainty
Armed with every precious failure and amateur cartography
I'm breathing deep before
I spread those maps out on my bedroom floor
And I'm leaning on this broken fence
Between past and present tense
And I'm losing all those stupid games
That I swore I'd never play
But it feels okay
And I'm leaving with goodbye
And I'm losing but I'll try
With the last ways left to remember, sing
My imperfect offering
If I know one thing that's true
It ain't what you say, it's what you do
And you don't say much, yeah, that's true
But I listen when you do
A thousand years go by
But love don't die
If I know one thing that's true
It's that I'm never leaving you
And you don't say much, yeah, that's true
But I lose it when you do
Don't let them tell no lies
Love don't die
No matter where we go
Or even if we don't
And even if they try
They'll never take my body from your side
Love don't die
If there is one thing that's true
It's not what I say, it's what I do
And I say too much, yeah, that's true
So just listen to what I do
A thousand years go by
But love don't die
No matter where we go
Or even if we don't
And even if they try
They'll never take my body from your side
Love don't die
She can break it up
She can burn it down
You can box it in
Bury it in the ground
You can close it off and turn it away
Try to keep it down, six feet in the ground
But love don't die
No matter where we go
Or even if we don't
And even if they try
They'll never take my body from your side
Love don't die
No matter where we go
Or even if we don't
I'd like to watch them try
They'll never take my body from your side
Love don't die
Stop bein' a bad joke
It's not the same
Feeling that sunshine
And forgetting the rain
It feels so peaceful
Without the rain
Your life's got happy
You got on the TV
Yeah yeah yeah, la la la, la la la la
Yeah yeah yeah, la la la, la la la la
Being with each other
We're havin' fun
I've got time to spare so
I might find the one
We dig each other
And break the rules
We love one another
And that's no fool
Yeah yeah yeah, la la la, la la la la
Yeah yeah yeah, la la la, la la la la (My girl)
Yeah yeah yeah, la la la, la la la la
Yeah yeah yeah, la la la, la la la la
I take a piece of paper
And write your name
You put it in your pocket
And I did the same
We love each other
And that's for sure
I live here without you
I can't take it no more
Yeah yeah yeah, la la la, la la la la
Yeah yeah yeah, la la la, la la la la (My girl)
Yeah yeah yeah, la la la, la la la la
Yeah yeah yeah, la la la, la la la la
We live in a free world
I whistle down the wind
Carry on smiling
And the world will smile with you
Life is a flower
So precious in your hand
Carry on smiling
And the world will smile with you
When every race is run
And the day is closing in
I don't care about the world
I'm living for the light
Don't cry for me today, ahahaha
We live in a free world
I whistle down the wind
Carry on smiling
And the world will smile with you
Life is a flower
So precious in your hand
Carry on smiling
And the world will smile with you
I can not be your judge
Mr. Jailer is your host
He's keeping you inside
And hides you from the world
No catcher in the rye can help you from yourself
We live in a free world
I whistle down the wind
Carry on smiling
And the world will smile with you
Life is a flower
So precious in your hand
Carry on smiling
And the world will smile with you
Please Mr. Agony
Release them for a while
Learn them the consequences of
Living without life
We live in a free world
I whistle down the wind
Carry on smiling
And the world will smile with you
Life is a flower
So precious in your hand
Carry on smiling
And the world will smile with you
We live in a free world (Free world)
Life is a flower (Is a flower)
I whistle down the wind
Carry on smiling
And the world will smile with you
So precious in your hand
Carry on smiling
And the world will smile with you
We live in a free world (Free world)
Carry on smiling
And the world will smile with you
Life is a flower (Is a flower)
Carry on smiling
And the world will smile with you
We live in a free world (Free world)
Carry on smiling
And the world will smile with you
Life is a flower (Is a flower)
Carry on smiling
And the world will smile with you

Oho ho ohooo
Well these days I'm spread so thin
I'm getting carried up by the wind
Every time you get high
You might see me floating by
Well so long old bean
It's been a dream being with you
I couldn't tell us apart
Oh and I know neither could you
Don't tread on me
When you float downstream
On a moonbeam
So long old bean
So long old bean
Here comes the mapinguari singing awww
When's there gonna be an end to wondering
When all of our troubles are gonna end 'cause
We've had our fill of finding our empty pockets
Emptier still and there probably won't be
An end to that my friends
Now that my tralala's are dating
Little sips of the Hollywood bowl
They mute up my mind
How kind of them to mellow mellow mellow my soul
Well they're the gambling kind
As smooth as a tuba' ass on the dole
Money never beats soul
How noble
Don't forget me
When you float downstream
On a moonbeam
So long old bean
So long old bean
I'm a little firefly
Landing on you
It's up in the morning and on the downs
Little white clouds like gambolling lambs
And I am breathless over you
And the red-breasted robin beats his wings
His throat it trembles when he sings
For he is helpless before you
The happy hooded bluebells bow
And bend their heads all a-down
Heavied by the early morning dew
At the whispering stream, at the bubbling brook
The fishes leap up to take a look
For they are breathless over you
Still your hands
And still your heart
For still your face comes shining through
And all the morning glows anew
Still your mind
Still your soul
For still, the fare of love is true
And I am breathless without you
The wind circles among the trees
And it bangs about the new-made leaves
For it is breathless without you
The fox chases the rabbit round
The rabbit hides beneath the ground
For he is defenceless without you
The sky of daytime dies away
And all the earthly things they stop to play
For we are all breathless without you
I listen to my juddering bones
The blood in my veins and the wind in my lungs
And I am breathless without you
Still your hands
And still your heart
For still your face comes shining through
And all the morning glows anew
Still your soul
Still your mind
Still, the fire of love is true
And I am breathless without you
August
I'll see you soon
Under yellow moons
Where I'll gather what's left of you
And august
I'm on your side
Or did I speak too soon
Now we cross the great divide
Someday we'll meet beyond the stars and it'll be
Away from here
Someday we'll meet beyond the time and the bars and it'll be
Away from here
August
August of last year
Before the leaves disappeared
Told me you were not the one
August
Something in your eyes
Or was it that you lied
Told me not to take it to heart
Someday we'll meet beyond the stars and it'll be
Away from here
Someday we'll meet beyond the limits of who we are and it'll be
Away from here
Someday we'll meet beyond the stars and it'll be
Away from here
Someday we'll meet beyond the land that you call miles away
Away from here
I know I should get next to you
You got a look that made me think you're cool
But it's just sexual attraction
Not something real so I'd rather keep whackin'
Why bother? It's gonna hurt me
It's gonna kill when you desert me
This happened to me twice before
It won't happen to me anymore
I've known a lotta girls before
What's the harm in knowing one more?
Maybe we could even get together
Maybe you could break my heart next summer
Why bother? It's gonna hurt me
It's gonna kill when you desert me
This happened to me twice before
It won't happen to me anymore
Yeah
It's a crying shame, I'm all alone
Not with you, nor her, nor anyone
Won't you knock me on my head?
Crack it open, let me outta here
Why bother? It's gonna hurt me
It's gonna kill when you desert me
This happened to me twice before
It won't happen to me anymore
(Why bother) Why bother?
(It's gonna hurt me) It's gonna hurt me
(It's gonna kill when) Why bother?
(You desert me) Gonna hurt me
(Why bother) Why bother?
(It's gonna hurt me) It's gonna hurt me
Why bother? It's gonna hurt me
It's gonna hurt me
Punk Love
Punk Love
Punk Rock Love
In the dark we are without her empress light
In the dark we are without a light
Half asleep we are calmly waiting through her night
Half asleep we wait till she arrives
Clouds of birds are covering her dark blue sky
Clouds of birds are covering her sky
A rush of wind is gently playing with their wings
And yellow stones are standing on her eyes
All rejoice is all we are when in her hands
All rejoice we are in her hands
Owl eyes her sun will rise and light the land
All rejoice we are in her hands
In a tiny, tiny southern Swedish country town
Two acres of field and a gas station
Riding on my moped, looking for fun
Staring into the blood-red sun
Oh, the country road is a boulevard
With neon lights and night-open bars
In my jacket, pack of playing cards
Just jacks, jokers, and a queen of hearts
My heart is beating, beating like Ringo
As I pull into the drive-in bingo
Why do the people in the country want to look like the people in the city
When the people in the city aren't the slightest pretty?
I want the people in the country to wear flannel shirts
And saggy jeans all covered in dirt
I want the people in the country to be open and kind
But most times I've met those with a narrow mind
With a big black dog to bite your behind
If they ever find out you're not one of their kind
All these thoughts as I open up a zingo
Friday night at the drive-in bingo
So this is what they do out here for fun?
They play bingo and let their engines run
Tonight's jackpot is a pig, hey, that's criminal
G-42, ooh, I'm going diagonal
I'm gonna gather up a few of my friends
As many fits into an army tent
Just bring your savings and a bottle of wine
To Friday night's reversal of time
This little southwest village shouldn't cost that much
Maybe a handful of silver or a hundred bucks
We could have wild, wild parties in that big old lodge
And the windmill's perfect for movies and such
We could fake our deaths to get insurance money
And take on hippie names, I'd be Snowphish, you'd be Sunny
We could start a little farm with little white bunnies
Just 'cause watching them copulate is very funny
There's a cow and an ostrich just waiting for you
A glass of apple cider just waiting for you
The smell of 1952 just waiting for you
And all I'm doing here is just waiting for you
A daydream, I'm caught up in limbo
Friday night at the drive-in bingo
I came here with a broken heart that no one else could see
I drew a smile on my face to paper over me
But wounds heal and tears dry and cracks they don't show
So don't be so hard on yourself, no
Let's go back to simplicity
I feel like I've been missing me
Was not who I'm supposed to be
I felt this darkness over me
We all get there eventually
I never knew where I belonged
But I was right and you were wrong
Been telling myself all along
Don't be so hard on yourself, no
Learn to forgive, learn to let go
Everyone trips, everyone falls
So don't be so hard on yourself, no
'Cause I'm just tired of marching on my own
Kind of frail, I feel it in my bones
Won't let my heart, my heart turn into stone
So don't be so hard on yourself, no
I'm standin' on top of the world, right where I wanna be
So how can this dark cloud be raining over me
But hearts break and hells a place that everyone knows
So don't be so hard on yourself, no
Let's go back to simplicity
I feel like I've been missing me
Was not who I'm supposed to be
I felt this darkness over me
We all get there eventually
I never knew where I belonged
But I was right and you were wrong
Been telling myself all along
Don't be so hard on yourself, no
Learn to forgive, learn to let go
Everyone trips, everyone falls
So don't be so hard on yourself, no
'Cause I'm just tired of marching on my own
Kind of frail, I feel it in my bones
Won't let my heart, my heart turn into stone
So don't be so hard on yourself, no
Oh, Oh, Oh, I
I learned to wave goodbye
How not to see my life
Through someone else's eyes
It's not an easy road
But no I'm not alone
So I, I won't be so hard on myself no more
Don't be so hard on yourself, no
Learn to forgive, learn to let go
Everyone trips, everyone falls
So don't be so hard on yourself, no
'Cause I'm just tired of marching on my own
Kind of frail, I feel it in my bones
Won't let my heart, my heart turn into stone
So don't be so hard on yourself, no
'Cause I'm just tired of marching on my own
Kind of frail, I feel it in my bones
Won't let my heart, my heart turn into stone
So don't be so hard on yourself, no
You paint a picture on the wall
Cause you got a lot to tell me
But you don't think you can say it better, oh baby
You're bringin' up times I can't recall
And I'm sure they make your point but
I just can't seem to remember, yeah
I know you got the feeling and I can't say I'm agreeing
With your topic of conversation
So just listen to the reasons and the hints I've been giving
To the thoughts of my imagination
So come on let me sing
I said baby, you're amazing
I want to let you see
You are everything and more to me
I will let you be, I will I will
'Cause I saw you walking down the hall
And I had a lot to tell you but I didn't think you could say it better, oh baby
You're good at making me feel so small
And I know you made your point but I just don't want to remember, yeah
I know you got the feeling and I can't say I'm agreeing
With your topic of conversation
So just listen to the reasons and the hints I've been giving
To the thoughts of my imagination
So come on let me sing
I said baby, you're amazing
I want to let you see
You are everything and more to me
I will let you be, I will I will
'Cause I'm dancing around in your world of play
I'm taking my time to make sure you stay
I would give my life to make it okay, yeah
So come on let me sing
(Music)
I said baby, you're amazing
I want to let you see
You are everything and more to me
I will let you be
I will, I will
I said baby, you're amazing
I want to let you see
You are everything and more to me
I will let you be
I will, I will... 'cause I will, I will
I'm on my way from misery to happiness today
ah-hah (ah-hah) ah-hah (ah-hah)
I'm on my way from misery to happiness today
ah-hah (ah-hah) ah-hah (ah-hah)
I'm on my way to what I want from this world
And years from now you'll make it to the next world
And everything that you receive up yonder
Is what you gave to me the day I wandered
I took a right, I took a right turning yesterday
ah-hah (ah-hah) ah-hah (ah-hah)
I took a right, I took a right turning yesterday
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
I took the road that brought me to your home town
I took the bus to streets that I could walk down
I walked the streets to find the one I'd looked for
I climbed the stair that led me to your front door
And now that I don't want for anything
I'd have Al Jolson sing I'm sitting on top of the world
I'll do my best, I'll do my best to do the best I can
ah-hah (ah-hah) ah-hah (ah-hah)
I'll do my best, I'll do my best to do the best I can
Ha-ah ha-ah ha-ah ha-ah
To keep my feet from jumping from the ground, dear
To keep my heart from jumping through my mouth, dear
To keep the past, the past and not the present
To try and learn when you teach me a lesson
And now that I don't want for anything
I'd have Al Jolson sing I'm sitting on top of the world
I'm on my way from misery to happiness today
ah-hah (ah-hah) ah-hah (ah-hah)
I'm on my way from misery to happiness today
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
I'm on my way to what I want from this world
And years from now you'll make it to the next world
And everything that you receive up yonder
Is what you gave to me the day I wandered
I'm on my way to what I want from this world
And years from now you'll make it to the next world
And everything that you receive up yonder
Is what you gave to me the day I wandered

(fade...)
When the lush hangs off the chron, I know that you're gone, ya feel me (feel me)
15 years off in this game, still nuttin changed, feel me (feel me)
Riding swiftly through the night, almost missed the light, if ya feel me (feel me)
Whether I'm right or wrong, I know that you're gone, (I know) ya feel me (feel me)
Damn, that wasn't nuttin but the intro... Here we go
What's a matter
With going places?
Take that gross look off your faces
Empty loving makes me seasick
What you're here for, I don't need it
I'll say nothing on your microphone
Till you swear to take me home
There's a one foot boy eleven stone
He's sitting on my shoulder
I'm too scared to look away,
He comes here almost everyday
And everyday I push him off and tell him boy we're over
My oh my
I think my mind is gone
I'm left here wondering
Was I crazy all along?
What do I do?
Nothing left but pray
Gonna shoot somebody
Help me drive this craziness away
I'm happy on my own
One foot boy!
One foot boy!
One foot boy!
One foot boy!
Say you like me,
Not with changes?
Shut up and forget it
These are my faces
All these colours
That surround me
All these places
Only drown me
I'll say nothing on your microphone
Till you swear to take me home
There's a one foot boy eleven stone
Sitting on my shoulder
I'm too scared to look away,
He comes here almost everyday
And everyday I push him off and tell him boy we're over
My oh my
I think my mind is gone
I'm left here wondering
Was I crazy all along?
What do I do?
Nothing left but pray
Gonna shoot somebody
Help me drive this craziness away
I'm happy on my own
I think my mind is gone
I'm left here wondering
Was I crazy all along?
What do I do?
Nothing left but pray
Gonna shoot somebody
Help me drive this craziness away
I'm happy on my own
What's a matter
With going places?
Take that gross look off your faces
Empty loving makes me seasick
What you here for, I don't need it
One foot boy!
One foot boy!
One foot boy!
One foot boy!
One foot boy!
One foot boy!
One foot boy!
One foot boy!
Happy on my own
I say the same thing twice, I'm awkward when I speak
Ain't got the perfect smile, don't turn heads on my street
Trying to be a superstar like everybody else
But being myself is something I do well
Whatever you do, do it good
Whatever you do, do, do, do, lord, lord, lord
Do it good, alright
Express yourself, express yourself, whoa do it
See it's not what you look like, when you doing what you doing
Express yourself, whoa do it
I don't make the papers, I'm far from JLS
Ain't got the x factor, I'm not what they expect
But it won't be long before my turn is next, to express
Now with all due respect
See whatever I do, I do it good
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do
So whatever you do, do, do, do, lord, lord, lord
Do it good,
Express yourself, express yourself, whoa do it
See it's not what you look like, when you doing what you doing
Express yourself, whoa do it
Hey, loose my shirt and tie
There ain't nothing too high
Show them what you got, whoa
It's nothing wrong with perfect and perfect
Now it's your time to shine
Express yourself, click your fingers now
Express yourself, come on,
See it's not what you look like, when you doing what you doing
Express yourself, whoa do it
See it's not what you look like, when you doing what you doing
Express yourself, come on now, yeah, come on, now,
Come on now, yeah, come on, now,
Come on now, yeah, come on, now,
Come on now, yeah, come on, now.
Turn off the lights
And touch me in the dark
Fade into the feeling
Whisper in my ear
What you want
What you need
Tell me my name, tell me my name
Again, again, again, again
Just yell out my name baby
(I got your nights) I got your nights
(I got your days) I got your days
(I got you on) I got you on
My time
(I got your nights) I got your nights
(I got your days) I got your days
(I got you on) I got you on
You taste like sweet wine
We are magnified
The sweat rolls down your thigh
We're making moves so blind
It's what you want
It's what you need
I'm just the same baby
(I got your nights) I got your nights
(I got your days) I got your days
(I got you on) I got you on
My time (x2)
And you're holding on to me like an old love
That you know every inch of
When I feel you start to go
Take it slow 'til your body's saying more baby
(I got your nights) I got your nights
(I got your days) I got your days
(I got you on) I got you on
My time (x2)
Your gonna be on my time, my time
I got your nights (I got your days)
I got your days (I got you on)
I got you on
My time
Hey
We caught another white snake tonight
Say something and I'll feel alright
I said wahey
We caught another white snake tonight
Say something and I'll feel alright
I said wahey
Hey yeah
Hey, hey
I said wahey
We caught another white snake tonight
Say something and I'll feel alright
Psyche
What an abomination
Innocence is such a crime
Hard working sound and vision
To bring you the beats in time
Hoping for stormy weather
Waiting for the proper time
When seven flies swarm together
To stitch eight
And save nine
And I realise full well
That my life ain't living hell
But I wrote the book too well
Beknown, beknown future
Hey
We caught another white snake tonight
Say something and I'll feel alright
I said wahey
We caught another white snake tonight
Say something and I'll feel alright
I said wahey
Hey yeah
Hey, hey
I said wahey
We caught another white snake tonight
Say something and I'll feel alright
Psyche
Whitesnake whitesnake
Whitesnake whitesnake
Whitesnake whitesnake
Whitesnake whitesnake 
Whitesnake whitesnake
Whitesnake whitesnake
Whitesnake whitesnake 
Whitesnake whitesnake
Whitesnake
Out of breath and out of cash
Find yourself watching M.A.S.H.
Every night on the couch
Woman says let's take a drive on south
Roll down the windows and open our mouths
Taste where we are, play the music loud
Stop the car, lay on the grass
The planet spins and we watch space pass
Walk a direction, see where we get
I never knew nothing so there's nothing to forget
Get real drunk and ride our bikes
There's so much beauty it could make you cry
There's so much beauty it could make you cry
There's so much beauty it could make you cry
There's so much beauty it could make you cry
The rich get money but never what they want
Find ourselves a new place to haunt
Climb up the fire escape
Do it 'til the ground looks far away
Go night swimming, leave your clothes on the ground
If you get busted you should stand there proud
It's the truth we all been wrong
Make it up and then let's move on
Playing cards, we all get to act sly
There's so much beauty it could make you cry
There's so much beauty it could make you cry
There's so much beauty it could make you cry
She's fighting with the sky
She thinks she can
Livin' within a lie
She thinks she can
Nobody knows what lies behind
The days before the day we die
Die die die, die die die die
Die die die, die die die die
Die die die
She puts her hands against
The life she had
Living with ignorance
Blissful and sad
Nobody knows what lies behind
The days before the day we die
Die die die, die die die die
Die die die, die die die die
Die die die
You can try to swim the sea
But say goodbye to you and me-e-e-e
You can try to swim the sea
You can try to hold the breeze
You can try to hide the sun
But say goodbye to everyone
You can try to swim the sea
You can try to hold the breeze
You can try to hide the sun
But say goodbye to everyone
You can try to swim the sea
You can try to hold the breeze
You can try through skin and bone
But you will end up all alo-o-one.
No one wants to hear about your 97th tear, 
so dry your eyes or let it go uncried, my dear. 
I am all out of love to mouth into your ear, 
and not above letting a love song disappear 
before it's written. 
And no one wants a tune about the 100th luftballoon 
that was seen shooting from the window of your room, 
to be a spot against the sky's colossal gloom 
and land, deflated, in some neighbor state that's strewn 
with 99 others.
8 Chinese brothers; 
well, there's a reason why the last is smiling wide 
and sitting higher than the others, 
swinging his arms.
You would probably die before you shot up 9 miles high, 
your eyes dilated as light plays upon the sight 
of TVC16 as it sings you goodnight. 
Relaxed as hell and locked up in cell 45, 
I hope you're feeling better.
The 51st way to leave your lover, 
admittedly, doesn't seem to be 
as gentle or as clean as all the others, 
leaving its scars.
All in the after hours of some Greenpoint bar, 
I told you I can't listen, baby, about the 4th time you were a lady, 
and how your forthrightness betrayed a secret shyness, 
stripped away by days of being hailed as "Your Highness." 
And what's new, pussycat, is that you were once a lioness; 
they cut your claws out. 
Kitten, not everyone's keen on lighting candle 17. 
The party's done. The cake's all gone. The plates are clean. 
The chauffeur's leering from the cheerless mezzanine. 
And, in just 1 year, the straight world can pay to see 
what they've been missing. 
You were caught kissing 8 Chinese brothers, 
but there's a reason why the last is smiling wide and sitting higher than the others, 
stinking with charm. 
And he says, "Lets get lost, let them send out alarms."
He says, "Let's get crossed out and come to harm"
"Lets make the world's stupidest stand and truly mean it
Let's hit the limit of loss over lover's arms
No, lets exceed it"
I been had and I been held
With the ghosts at bay
I been oaked and I been doped
And carried away
I been charred and I been scarred
On my own face
But I never thought I'd see you as I did
Today
Till the angels hung around
Till the angels hung around
Till the angels hung around
As they carried me away
I been clubbed and I been snubbed
By the dogs of LA
And I been burned and I been learned
In the same city
I been whored and I been gored
I been less and I been more
But I never thought I'd see you
As I did today
Till the angels hung around
Till the angels hung around
Till the angels hung around
As they carried me away
Ooh!
Ooh!
Ooh!
Ooh!
You were stuck in the badlands
Acting like a bad bad man
I been photographed and painted up
And I been in love only once
And I feared the best and loved the worst
And insisted that I go first
And watch your eyes as they poured
And I never really loved you more
And I never thought I'd see you
As I did today
Till the angels hung around
Till the angels hung around
Till the angels hung around
As they carried you away
And they put you in the ground
When the angels hung around
And the angels hung around
As they carried me away
On a highway along the Atlantic I'm rifling through these last seventeen years.
The radio waxes romantic. Its lullabies fill our eyes with tears.
We don't say a word.
There's nothing to say that hasn't been heard.
And how you've grown my little bird.
I'm regretting letting you fly.
Six pounds and seven ounces. A ball of bones and flesh and tears were you.
Now your hands, your tiny pink hands, grew larger than my hands ever grew.
We don't say a word.
There's nothing to say that hasn't been heard.
And how you've grown my little bird.
I'm regretting letting you fly.
I'm regretting letting you fly.
I'm regretting letting you fly.
On a highway. 
On a highway.
Hot Chelle Rae:
Let's get it on, yeah, y'all can come along
Everybody drinks on me, buy out the bar

And I'm gonna want a girl that I know I can take home
In the zone, where I think that I lost my phone
You can tell by looking in, the party's plain crack
And don't worry 'bout it girls 'cause I like it like
Come back stay here at my grandma's house
And leave your clothes over there, that's grandma couch

Te conocí un día de enero, 
con la luna en mi nariz 
Y como ví que eras sincero 
En tus ojos me perdí 
Que torpe distracción 
Y que dulce sensación 
Y ahora que andamos por el mundo 
Como Eneas y Benitin 
Ya te encontre varios rasguños 
Que te hicieron por ahí 
Pero mi loco amor 
Es tu mejor doctor 
Voy a curarte el alma en duelo 
Voy a dejarte como nuevo 
Y todo va a pasar 
Pronto verás el sol brillar 
Tú más que nadie merecer ser feliz 
Ya vas a ver como van sanando 
Poco a poco tus heridas 
Ya vas a ver como va 
La misma vida a decantar la sal que sobra del mar 
Y aunque hayas sido un extranjero 
hasta en tu propio país 
Si yo te digo ¿qué dices tu? 
Tu aún dices ¿que decís? 
Y lloras de emoción oyendo un bandoneón 
Y aunque parezcas despistado con ese caminar pausado 
Conozco la razón que hace doler tu corazón 
Por eso quise hacerte esta canción 
Ya vas a ver como van sanando 
Poco a poco tus heridas 
Ya vas a ver como va 
La misma vida a decantar la sal que sobra del mar 
JANUARY DAY 
I met you one January day, 
With the moon on my nose 
And seeing you were sincere 
in your eyes, i lost myself 
What a clusmy distraction 
And what a sweet sensation 
And now that we're walking around the world 
Like Eneas and Benetin 
I've already noticed the many cuts 
That they inflicted on you along the way 
But my crazy love 
Is your doctor 
I'm going to cure your mourning soul 
I'm going to leave you like new 
And everything's going to pass 
Soon, you will see the sun shine 
You, more than anyone, deserve to be happy 
Soon you will see 
Your wounds healing little by little 
Soon you will see how life itself 
Will decant the excess salt from the sea 
And although you've been a foreigner 
even in your own country 
If i ask 'how do you say' (Colombian Accent) 
You still say 'what did you say' (Argentinean Accent) 
And you cry with emotion listening to a bandoneón 
And though you seem absent minded with that lazy walk 
i know what causes your heart to ache 
that's why i wanted to make you this song 
You're going to see how little by little 
Your wounds are going to heal 
You're going to see how life itself 
Will decant the excess salt from the sea
It's time to tell my story
Of a girl I used to know
Always cried into her pillow
Under pin-ups on the wall
She didn't make Italia Conte
Didn't get that TV show
Then a nice man said he'd help her
With a new portfolio
Missus B Missus E Missus A-U-T
Missus I Missus F-U-L
I'm gonna reach the top
I ain't ever gonna stop
And I'm sure gonna ring your bell
Missus D Missus I Missus F-F-I
Missus C Missus U-L-T
If ever there's a girl
That could rock your world
Then that girl sure is me
(Right!)
So the fun won't start 'til she's living it up
Feeling good, on top of the pops
When you make it me plus one
Dress falls down at the aftershow
She breaks down on the video
Think you'll find it's me plus one
Now this wannabe señorita
Met a group of likely girls
Traded posters and the voxpops
For jetting round the world
But it didn't make her happy
And now she flies alone
The wrong pictures in the paper
And no one back at home
Missus B Missus E Missus A-U-T
Missus I Missus F-U-L
I'm gonna reach the top
I ain't ever gonna stop
And I'm sure gonna ring your bell
Missus D Missus I Missus F-F-I
Missus C Missus U-L-T
If ever there's a girl
That could rock your world
Then that girl sure is me
(Right!)
So the fun won't start 'til she's living it up
Feeling good, on top of the pops
When you make it me plus one
Dress falls down at the aftershow
She breaks down on the video
Think you'll find it's me plus one
People around you
Won't tell you how it is
Don't you think it's gone on long enough?
Take a look at yourself
Get out of the car
You know it's time
You've got to let it go
It's gone
Missus B Missus E Missus A-U-T
Missus I Missus F-U-L
I'm gonna reach the top
I ain't ever gonna stop
And I'm sure gonna ring your bell
Missus D Missus I Missus F-F-I
Missus C Missus U-L-T
If ever there's a girl
That could rock your world
Then that girl sure is me
(Right!)
So the fun won't start 'til she's living it up
Feeling good, on top of the pops
When you make it me plus one
Dress falls down at the aftershow
She breaks down on the video
Think you'll find it's me plus one
So the fun won't start 'til she's living it up
Feeling good, on top of the pops
When you make it me plus one
Dress falls down at the aftershow
She breaks down on the video
Think you'll find it's me plus one
She was an alcoholic artist
With too much makeup round her eyes
And I never knew her real name
She was sunbeam wrapped in lies
But I love her and I'm sorry
And that's all there is to say
It's like a fairy from the ancient time
And I hope it, hope it stays that way
And when I woke up on your kitchen floor
With a headache made in hell
And the flowers that I gave you
Smiled at me from the window pane
Then I thought I must be crazy
'Cause I'm feeling kinda good
And then when Satan helped me up again
It was then I, it was then I understood
Well I was never meant to be the good boy
I was never meant to go to school
Well it's guys like me who get somewhere
Cause everybody pitty a fool
Now it's payback for the rainy days
Now it's no more me and you
Well I got mine, you got yours babe
Now it's payback
Now it's me against the world
It was the last time I forgave you...
You fell down the stairs into my arms
And swiftly ran the other way
And I heard the steady swell of applause
The two drunk kids, trying to figure out which way was home
They got lost as they were taking off each other's clothes
They realized there was a hole in the boat
And with no lifesaver you try your best to float
And eventually the sky did return
And I was there outside in green
And I watched the world being reborn, till one a.m.
So I thought I'd let you know
It was beautiful, slow dancing to tunes of Billie Holiday
The city looked wonderful that way
And love, just like blood, will always stain
And if I could reverse it, I don't think that it'd be worth it because I know in my heart I would never let you tumble to the ground.
No, I'd never let you fall
(Wake up it's a beautiful morning... It's a beautiful morning...)
Summer's gone
Days spent with the grass and sun
I don't mind
To pretend I do seems really dumb
(It seems really dumb)
I rise as the morning comes
Crawling through the blinds
I shouldn't be up at this time
But I can't sleep with you there by my side
Wake up it's a beautiful morning
Feel the sun shining for your eyes
Wake up it's so beautiful
(Wake up Boo)
For what could be the very last time
Twenty-five
Don't recall a time I felt this alive
So WAKE UP BOO!
There's so many things for us to do
(Things that we could do)
It's early so take your time
Don't let me rush you please
I know I was up all night
I can do anything, anything, anything
Wake up it's a beautiful morning
Feel the sun shining for your eyes
Wake up it's so beautiful
(Wake up Boo)
For what could be the very last time
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
But you can't blame me now
For the death of summer
But you can't blame me now
For the death of summer
But you're gonna say what you wanna say
You have to put the death in everything
Wake up it's a beautiful morning
Feel the sun shining for your eyes
Wake up it's so beautiful
(Wake up Boo)
For what could be the very last time
Wake up it's a beautiful morning
Feel the sun shining for your eyes
Wake up it's so beautiful
(Wake up Boo)
For what could be the very last time
Insulation
In my circulation
I'm a mating rhythm
Sick with electricion
Nazi operation
Devestation
Wire up a radio
And I am a mating rhythm
Wire up the radio
Turn the terror and find my limit
Hot wire my heart
Hot wire my heart
Hot wire my heart
Like this
(I feel now?)
They're movin' in
Pull the zipper
It's sliding up
I don't have a reason
Honey for your best man
Wire up a radio
And I am a beating rhythm
Wire up for the radio
Turn the terror an'
Hot wire my heart
Hot wire my heart
Hot wire my heart
Like this
A kicking in the nightshifts
Greasing up/a teasing of my fingertips
I think you'll find us
Anybody's title?
Got my eyes on the controls
Turned on let's go
Wire up the radio
And I am a mating rhythm
Wire up for the radio
Turn the treble and fight my limit
Hot wire my heart
Hot wire my heart
Hot wire my heart
Like this
Long legs,
Don't give me no head rush in the morning
Oh baby, it's bad too bad
I don't think I'll ever see your face again
And I don't wanna lose your love
And I don't wanna choose just one
'Cause I've been having too much fun
Oh
Oh it's bad too bad
I don't think I'll ever feel the same again
Oh baby, I'll beg I'll beg
'Cause I found it but I don't know what it is
And I don't wanna lose your love
And I don't wanna choose just one
'Cause I've been having too much fun
Oh but it's gone...
And I don't wanna lose your love
And I don't wanna choose
'Cause I've been having too much fun
Oh but it's gone
Long legs don't give me no head rush in the morning
Oh baby baby, I'll beg I'll beg
'Cause you're leaving and I won't know how it ends
And I don't wanna lose your love
And I don't wanna choose just one
'Cause I've been having too much fun
Oh but it's gone
And I don't wanna lose your love
And I don't wanna choose just one
'Cause I've been having too much fun
Oh but it's gone
I've been sleeping with ghosts
I've been watching stars coming out of the sky
And I've been hoping and closed
To the space man movies I'd call my life
My life
And I've been climbing ladders through time 
I've got tunnel vision but I'm doing fine
And I've been watching stars coming out of the wall
And maybe if I'm lucky I can catch them before you fall
And you are not alone
Calling out to the astronaut
I need some of what you've got
I need to be high
Crawling out of the world she brought
Calling out to the astronaut
I need to be high
And I've been holding this microphone
And I've been channeling but I think we're alone
And I've got platinum vision and a tin foil touch
I've got you to propel me 
But I still need so much
Not to be alone
Calling out to the astronaut
I need some of what you've got
I need to be high
Crawling out of the world she brought
Calling out to the astronaut
I need to be high 
And you are not alone
And you are not alone
And you are not alone
Calling out to the astronaut
I need some of what you've got
I need to be high
Crawling out of the world she brought
Calling out to the astronaut
I need to be high 
Calling out to the astronaut
I need some of what you've got
I need to be high
Disappear in the world she brought
Calling out to the astronaut 
I need to be high
And I've got you to propel me, but I still need so much
Here I am, This is me
I come to this world so wild and free
Here I am, So young and strong
Right here in the place where I belong
It's a new world
It's a new start
It's alive with the beating of a young heart
It's a new day, In a new land
And it's waiting for me
Here I am
Oh
It's a new world, It's a new start
It's alive with the beating of a young heart
Ya, It's a new day, In a new land
And it's waiting for me
Here I am
(Instrumental Until End)
I keep on livin',
To keep from cryin'.
I keep on dreamin',
To keep from dyin'.
I keep on trying,
I ain't gonna stop.
Get right down to the bottom of the barrel and float back on top.
We all know someone,
Whos always hurtin',
The sun is shinin',
They draw the curtain.
One thing for certain,
The pain ain't gonna stop.
You get right down to the bottom of the barrel and float back on top.
'Cause I know the grass,
Is always greener in someone else's yard.
And the world is so much meaner,
When your heart is hard.
I go out walkin',
In any season.
It could be rainin',
It could be freezin'.
I don't need no reason,
It's just so pleasin'.
And I can't stop.
You get right down to the bottom of the barrel and float back on top.
Tou get right down to the bottom of the barrel and float back on top.
Stare into the sun, stare into the sun
I'm gonna stare into the sun, stare into the sun
There ain't a cloud in the sky, no nothing
I see the birds, they fly on something
This is the summer
It's the summer, full of color, baby
The sun is shining down for lovers
But not for me, it shines for others
You gave me love, babe
Gave me love, babe, now it's over
I'm feeling blue 'cause love is gone
Guess I lose but life goes on
Got a few tears to dry
Before these blue shade days are gone
And I can stare into the sun
I'm gonna swim in seas of green, I tell you
I'm gonna run like I'm seventeen, forever
I see a rainbow, purple and gold
But it's covered
Oh yeah, 'cause there's a cloud
She follows me 'round wherever
Her last words keep raining down, on shelter
You took your love babe, took your love babe
Now the colors all melt together
I'm feeling blue 'cause love is gone
I guess I lose, but life goes on
Got a few tears to dry
Before these blue shade days are gone
And I can stare into the sun
Stare into the sun, stare into the sun
I'm gonna stare into the sun, stare into the sun
You gave me love babe, gave me love babe
You gave me love then took it away
You gave me love babe, gave me love babe
You gave me love then took it away
You gave me love babe, gave me love babe
You gave me love and took it away
You gave me love babe, gave me love babe
Oh babe, I said oh lord, babe
I'm feeling blue, 'cause love is gone
I guess I lose but life goes on
Got a few tears to dry
Before these blue shade days are gone
And I can stare into the sun
Before these blue shade days are gone
And I can stare into the sun
I've got a fever, baby, your love
I've got a fever baby, it's your love, yeah
I said I'm blue, baby
I said I'm blue, baby
I said I'm blue babe
Blue babe, I said I'm blue, baby
I'm crying late now, the sun is gone
I'm crying late now, the sun is gone
I need you love
I need you love
Do you see me, baby
On the street?
And I'm her king to her heat
And I love, babe
Choo choo Charlie had a pretty good band
But he couldn't understand why no one would go
A world record player's on a tour of Japan
Charlie's fixing his van with the left arm tan
He said
Monday, I'm all high
Get me out of FLA
In school yeah, I fooled ya
Now I know I made a mistake
Blister on a turnpike, let me by
I only wanna wonder why when I don't die
Ooh, I shot ya, yeah, I know
I only wanna go where my wheels roll
Monday, I'm all high
Get me out of FLA
I fooled ya in school, yeah
Now I know I made a mistake
Everybody's wondering where'd he go
He must be down in Pensacola hiding from the snow
The world record player's on a tour of Japan
Charlie's fixing his van, he's waiting for a postcard
And he said
Monday, I'm all high
Get me out of TLA
I cut class in school, yeah
Now I know I made a mistake
I made a big mistake, alright
One thought has me turning back
A dozen point the other way
We act upon desire to each a hand for hire
And patience isn't worth the wait
You've got knives in your eyes
You would be happy not to change your mind
I can't defend you truly
When I worry about smoke 'stead of putting out the fire
And if we worked it out
Chances abound, we'd be standing our ground
For no one's better sake
(Better say) goodbye
What are we waiting for? What are we waiting for?
What are we waiting for? What are we waiting for?
What are we waiting for? What are we waiting for?
Mmm... What are we waiting for?
How faint might that light become
In focus but at miles away?
Although my position just gives you an ignition
Be certain that I know my praise
So is this how it ends?
Oh, with a whimper in the place of a bang
I can't defend you truly
When I worry about smoke 'stead of putting out the fire
And if we worked it out
Chances abound, we'd be standing our ground
For no one's better sake
(Better say) goodbye
We would be friends if we tried again
I'll take second place just to end the race
For no one's better sake
(Better say) goodbye
I've never seen you frown this much
It's time that we
Left this haunted town
The spookiness of night surrounds us in trees
Us on bikes on fountains
Never been alone as such
Your foots on the clutch
Your hand's on my crutch
Slow down
And run in little circles till circles are
Black and on the ground.
And clever isn't where it's at
'Cause dumb is back
Heads are holes and clouds
And I've never seen you frown this much
It's time that we got this flaunting down
A feather in a baseball cap
You dance all wack
Weakened knees call
And I've never seen you frown this much
It's time that we rocked three daunting nouns
It's better not to holla back
'Cause life long cracks
Speak through these walls
I'm a wind-up toy in an up down world
If you leave me all alone, I'll make a mess for sure
I've a heart of gold in the smallest size
Leave me in the dark, you'll never hear me cry
More than an illustration
Points of articulation
Come to life on a brass spring
Such a wonderful plaything
It's a cruel cross that I have to bear
If you come a little close I'm going to pull your hair
More than just a toy in a patch-blue suit
Hold me in your arms I'm just a boy like you
But your mama thought there was somethin' wrong
Didn't want you sleeping with a boy too long
It's a serious thing in a grown-up world
Maybe you'd be better with a Barbie girl
You knew that I adored ya
But you left me in Georgia
Toys are not sentimental
How could I be for rental?
She's the meanest hag that has ever been
Pulled out my insides with an old safety pin
I'm the sorest sight, now I feel like trash
Clothes are made of rags and they don't even match
So she dressed me up as the man she loved
Then threw me in a box when she had had enough
Now the light of day I no longer see
She stuck her voodoo pins where my eyes used to be
Accidentally tragic
Victim of her black magic
Had a boy once who loved me
Now he's so afraid of me
On a long lost day when you're gray and dull
You'll be there remembering your old toy boy
When your oldest son wonderin' what to be
Tell him the story of a boy like me
Well, I don't
Know what I'm doing here
I could say
That I do
But I don't
You could wrap a million candles
Into a torch and hope that it stears you home
You could cut all the telephone wires
And hope that nobody does get through
I might not have the power
Of telepathy
But, I'm gonna be contacting you
Because I borrowed a book that I saw
Was planted deep inside your bag
It gave me an excuse
To see you again
But I'm not a thief
I'll give it back
Don't you ever wonder
Who's living in that house
It's too small for people
We all said
But there's people in the floorboards said the mouse
And I showed you the things that I'd made
You didn't think that they were too great
But I'm glad that you thought of it
Think what you're taught
Because everybody else's mind is grey
We kept up the act for, two-o-o-o-o
Dates before it needed blue
I didn't drink what you drank
You didn't sink when I sank
So, there's little else for us to do
Don't you ever wonder
Who's living in that house
It's too small for people
We all said
But there's people in the floorboards said the mouse
Said the mouse
I didn't say
Goodbye today
Oh, I did it
The cowards way
I tied it to the net, girl
To see where it gets
To go sailing on
Down your way
But you poured petrol all over
The ship you used to sail the sea
You didn't think that you'd be coming home again
So, you said Bye to me
Don't you ever ponder
On things we never said
Yes I did
But when we were kids
Now it's too late
Because we're dead
Because we're dead
Because we're dead
Because we're dead
All this beauty;
You might have to close your eyes
And slowly open wide
All this beauty;
We traveled all night
We drank the ocean dry
And watched the sun rise...
You can ask about it
But nobody knows the way
No bread-crumb trail
To follow through your days
It takes an axe sometimes
A feather in the sunshine
And bad weather
It's a matter of getting deeper in
Anyway you can
All this beauty;
You might have to close your eyes
And slowly open wide
All this beauty;
We traveled all night
We drank the ocean dry
And watched the sun rise...
I can see you're new, awake
Let me assure you, friend
Every day is ice cream and chocolate cake
And what you make of it
Let me just say
You get what you take
From it, so be amazed
Whenever you stop...
You gotta be brave.
All this beauty;
You might have to close your eyes
And slowly open wide (all this beauty)
And watch the sun rise.
It's happening all the time
When I open my eyes
I'm still taken by surprise
I hold sunlight and swallow fireflies
And it makes me want to cry
I love you
I shall never grow up
Make believe is much too fun
Can we go far away to the humming meadow
(Sherri's singing)
We were walking there
And I had tangles in my hair
But you make me feel so pretty
You have shining eyes
Yes like those forest lights
And it makes me want to cry
(Stacy's singing at the same time)
I am just wishing you were there
So we could walk down to the stream
And we would throw all our leaves in
Seeing our dragon when we look
I love you
I shall never grow up
Make believe is much too fun
Can we go far away to the humming meadow
I shall never grow up
Make believe is much too fun
Can we go far away to the humming meadow
This place is so lovely
It kind of makes me very happy
Let's go far away to the humming meadow
To the humming meadow
To the humming meadow
You wear your smile like it was going out of fashion
Dress to inflame but douse any ideas of passion
Carry your love in a trinket hanging round your throat
Always inviting, always exciting but I must not take off my coat
Well I'm tired of hanging around
I want somebody new
I'm not sure who I've got in mind
But I know that it's not you
That it's not you
You ask me questions that I never wanted to hear
I am the only one just until you finish this year
I would murder you if I had the alibi here in my hand
But you just laugh because you don't understand
That I'm tired of hanging around
I want somebody new
I'm not sure who I've got in mind
But I know that it's not you
It's not you
That it's not you
No, it's not you
It's not you
Over a sea of grief, Scarlet died.
Above her dying mind were fossilfied memory imprints of her favorite day.
For a minute, I stayed watching this brilliant display,
Until a god with a broom came and swept them away.
In their bereavement, all of her colorful friends turned to a milky-grey depressing blend, 
Which incidentally made Grey feel inane, so he set off to find a less trite identity,
One as stunning and bold as Scarlet used to be.
They say you gotta lose a couple fights to win
It's hard to tell from where I'm sitting
They say that this is where the fun begins
Guess it's time that I was quitting
A slight figure of speech
I cut my chest wide open
They come and watch us bleed
Is it all like I was hoping now
They said "I hope that you will never change"
I went and cut my hair
They said "Don't take your business to the big town"
I bought us tickets there
A slight figure of speech
I cut my chest wide open
They come and watch us bleed
Is it all like I was hoping now
What did you expect
And what did you forget
That to live you let go of me with each step
It becomes a progression I won't let regret manifest
To aggression
Are you to assess what I've been? What I am? Or become?
Did you stop to accept how pathetically dumb
It can be to
Attack those around 'cause you're
True to color, a town, a time, or a place?
It's not you, it's not mine
And besides it is gone
And you never will find it again
But I don't want to fight
I just ask let me be
I won't give the chance to be my enemy
So go home
Think it through
A jet plane and a big idea
I jump over the seat
What Ifs hot on my trail
But they can't catch me, no
A slight figure of speech
I cut my chest wide open
They come and watch us bleed
Is it all like I was hoping now
You can shake it all around
You can go up and down
You can lose what you found
But you can't ignore my techno
You can go west or east
Confess your sins to a priest
You can slay the wicked beast
But you can't ignore my techno
You can go to the doctor
You can cough in his face
Infect the whole human race
But you can't ignore my techno
You can laugh, you can cry
You can live, you can die
Spend your days asking why
But you can't ignore my techno
You can trip on my synthesizer
Electronic world for every boy and every girl
You can trip on my synthesizer
In the end, technology unto the world will set us free
Be all that you can be
Just as long as you are free
You were blind and now you see
That which is my techno
You can trip on my synthesizer
Electronic world for every boy and every girl
You can trip on my synthesizer
In the end technology unto the world will set us free
You can trip on my
You can trip on my
You can trip on my
You can trip
You can trip
You can trip on my synthesizer
You can trip on my synthesizer
Let's go
I'm a band in a show about a man holding hands with his wife
On a therapist's couch, with his face to the ground after fucking around countless nights
And there's this one episode, close-up cameras are showing him crying
His red head and his red eyes
I'm a band in a show about a boy being buried alive
From his head to his toes, by a criminal, but with a sensitive soul, with a set of raccoon eyes
And there's this scene in the show when a hustler knows he's gonna die
The ground opens and he climbs inside
And as he speaks his last line, a thought falls from his mind, and I pick it up right through the TV
Oh, oh
Is there a hand to take hold of the scene?
I'm a man in a dream and there, dancing in front of my eyes
Is a queen formed out of flaws, with her eyes all gone odd and a rod bolted into her spine
She rises up like a yawn, grips my heart like a claw, splits apart like a jaw, like an eye
And she asks me with a sigh
"When we're so far from right, when we're losing the fight, when we are letting the light weaken its beam
Oh, oh
Is there a hand to take hold of the scene?"
I want a smile like a glistening shard
I want a kiss that's as sharp as a knife
The day expires
And the dry, cracked, trembling lips
God saw fit to put this kiss inside
I lift them up to you
I'd like to bear witness to
A light that is fine and is filling the cryingest eyes
Grace in each face that is making the wastedest, brokenest ones fairly fly
Love that is innocent of that old cynical, covetous, cancerous vibe
And a beauty that annihilates all life
Like it's lived in these nights, holding your hatred tight like a sign that you're right or you're strong
When your doors are shut tight, I will dream you tonight and my dream will just sweep you along
When all fires are fanned, when we're shucking our plans, when we're too weak to stand on our two feet
Oh, oh
Is there a hand to take hold of the scene?
I saw you first.
It was in a dream, it was in a dream.
It was in a dream, it was in a dream.
I knew it'd work.
Or so it seemed, or so it seems.
Or so it seems, or so it seems.
While you hold on,
Let that Golden go.
Golden goes on,
So don't hold it.
Oh no, oh no.
Oh no, oh no.
In the light, there's still stormin',
In the shade, there's still warmin'.
You'll see,
What you'll be.
In the grey, there's still colors,
Without fade, inside lovers.
We'll be,
Yeah, we'll be.
I know there's a light inside 'cause...
I saw you first,
It was in a dream, it was in a dream.
It was in a dream, it was in a dream.
While you hold on,
Let that Golden go.
'Cause Golden goes on,
So don't hold it.
Oh no, oh no.
Oh no, oh no.
I know there's a light.
It was in a dream, it was in a dream.
It was in a dream, it was in a dream.
I know there's a light.
It was in a dream, it was in a dream.
It was in a dream, it was in a dream.
I know there's a light inside.
Think of a place I would go
I'm daydreamin
Where the sycamore grow
I'm daydreamin
And oh if you knew what it meant to me
Where the air was so clear
Oh if you knew what it meant to me
Anywhere but here
Oh now look to the east
Great mountain remember me
Oh I wound around you for miles
I sat down right there and I stretched my bones
And oh if you knew what it meant to me
Oh if you knew what it meant to me
Oh if you knew what it meant to me
You would see too
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Oh the unspeakable things
It's land I can see for miles
With only the wind whispering
Land I can see for miles
With only the wind whispering
Oh land I can see for miles
With only the wind whispering
Oh I'd run as fast as I can
Land I can see for miles
Oh I'm searching
With only the wind whispering
And oh if you knew what it meant to me
Oh if you knew what it meant to me
Oh if you knew what it meant to me
You would see too
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Oh the unspeakable things
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Oh the unspeakable things
Oh the unspeakable things
Oh the unspeakable things
Hey, I'm looking up for my star girl
I guess I'm stuck in this mad world
The things that I wanna say
But you're a million miles away
And I was afraid when you kissed me
On your intergalactical frisbee
I wonder why, I wonder why
You never asked me to stay
So wouldn't you like to come with me?
Go surfin' the sun as it starts to rise
Whoa, your gravity's makin' me dizzy
Girl, I gotta tell you, I'm feelin' much better
Make a little love in the moonlight
Hey, there's nothing on earth that can save us
When I find love with Uranus
I don't want to give you away
Because it makes no sense at all
And Houston, we've got a problem
The ground control couldn't stop them
I wonder why, I wonder why
You never asked me to stay
So wouldn't you like to come with me?
Go surfin' the sun as it starts to rise
Whoa, your gravity's makin' me dizzy
Girl, I gotta tell you, I'm feelin' much better
Make a little love in the moonlight
Fly away
Watch the night turn into day
Dance on the Milky Way
Melt me with your eyes
My star girl, rules the skies
One! two! one, two, three, four!
I'm looking up for my star girl
I guess I'm stuck in this mad mad world
The things that I wanna say
But you're a million miles away
So wouldn't you like to come with me?
Go surfin' the sun as it starts to rise
Yeah, wouldn't you like to come with me?
Yeah, girl, I gotta tell you, I'm feelin' much better
I can't get enough of you
Galaxy defenders, stay forever
Never get enough of you
I was never cool in school.
I'm sure you don't remember me.
And now it's been ten years
And I'm still wondering who to be.
I love to mix in circles, cliques, and social coteries, that's me
Hand me my nose ring!
Can we be happy?
Show me the mosh pit!
Can we be happy?
We can be happy underground.
Who's got the looks?
Who's got the brains?
Who's got everything?
Now I got this pain in my heart, that's all.
Hey you with the long and lonely face
There's got to be something else
Let me tell you something else
There was a girl that passed me by
She gave a smile but I was shy and looked down so down
Don't look down no no! Go go underground
And now there's a place to go.
It's the morning now, it's the evening
It's everything.
I click my heels and I'm there.
Underground, Underground
Everything's heavy underground
Underground
You've been kicked around,
Underground
Did life bring you down here?
Everything's heavy underground
We'll be decked in all black
Slamming the pits fantastic.
Officer Friendly's little boy's got a mohawk
He knows just where we're coming from.
It's industrial, work it underground
Get down, get down, get down
Oh we can't, oh we can't, oh we can't be
Oh, we can't, oh we can't, oh we can't be (3x)
Everything's happy underground, everything's happy underground.
I will leave the wallpaper life and run away to the Foreign Legion
I will leave the wallpaper life and run away to the Foreign Legion
And as the tanks roll into town, as the tanks roll into town
A little bit of knowledge will destroy you
A little bit of knowledge will destroy you
As the tanks roll into town, as the tanks roll into town
A little bit of knowledge will destroy you
A little bit of knowledge will destroy you
I don't know why I feel so tongue-tied
I don't know why I feel so skinned alive, oh
Run until your lungs are sore until you cannot feel it anymore
Run until your lungs are sore until you find an open door
I'll build you up to pull you down
Tie you to your feet and watch you drown
A little bit of knowledge will destroy you
A little bit of knowledge will destroy you
I'll build you up to pull you down
Tie you to a stake and watch you burn in Hell
I don't know why I feel so tongue-tied
I don't know why I feel so skinned alive, oh, oh
I'll find another skin to wear, I'll find another skin to wear
Somene else's date
Someone else's door
There's a girl with Cherry Chapstick on
And nothing more
Such a lurid pose
And she seems this close
Not to me
Here I stand, crawlin' home at night
Wonderin' (Wonder?) why the girls don't look at me when I walk
By
And the way they make me feel
Is (It's?) too way (,?) too real to believe (be here or be?)
...(??)
Summer's on the way
Wonderin' (Wonder?) what it would be like
If I could be that smoothe
I could think about all that I missed out
It's hard to do (you?)
Someone else's date
Someone else's door
There's a girl with Cherry Chapstick on
And nothing more
Such a lurid pose
That she seems this close
Not to me
Runnin' round in circles all day long
Run around in circles all day long
Some songs see us sailing away
Navigating foreign borders
And climbing the waves
Someday your secret will be revealed
Am I the one you're thinking of
When the sun goes down into the water?
We're struck by the still of the moon
Hanging up there in the sky as though a balloon
Anchored by an astronaut's patriot tune
We will buy a ship and fly
To the land that would be rediscovered
We'll design a clever disguise
Or retreat to the bottom of the sea
We were destined to live out our lives
Underwater you and me
We'll escape beneath a violet sky
Clouds come
And night falls
You seem different
Oh my my!
Upon an endless trail of moonlight
They'll never realize that we have gone
We have dropped right out of
Out of sight
We'll design a clever disguise
Or retreat to the bottom of the sea
We were destined to live out our lives
Underwater you and me
Well you didn't stop
When I told you to stop
And there was a month
When I wasn't sure
If the next time I saw you
Out on the road
I'd have something to say
Other than "Pay
All of the money that you owe"
And I would have liked to
To have something above you
To have something to hold
And know I could choose to let it grow
And I would have called you
And I'd've said "Hey
You know I'm in control
I'll let you know
If you have to come and choose a name"
Well I am a woman
Well you know I'm a woman
But before I met you
I was only a kid
Though there were moments
When you thought you would break me
But you wanted to take me
So you did
And I will think of you now that we are apart
I put my hand across my gut 
I plan to feed it with a heart
I'm not the girl that you remember from the start
I was only a baby
Now I am what you made me
And I will think of you now that we are apart
I put my hand across my gut 
I plan to beat it with a heart
I'm not the girl that you remember from the start
I was only a baby
Now I am what you made me
And once you left me in the spring
And twice you left in fall
And once I tried to make a life
To keep myself in yours
Do you think of me when you are playing
The one and five in four?
Is country music what your life is for?
We almost had a baby
Instrumental
Oh, I see what she do
But I can do it better
And the talk of the town be true
That I'll make you forget her
How can you hate something that you ain't have tried?
You've got to lose control most every night
Yeah you've seen what they do?
Well, we can do it better, yeah, I'm talking to you
You've got to...
Feel it
See it
Know how much you need it
What's the point of livin' if you don't take a chance?
You've got to...
Use it
Lose it
Know that you'll still do it
What's the point of livin' if you don't wanna dance?
Oh, I know life is hard
So we'll live it for the weekend
You can hurt, or take heart
I guess it really depends
What's the point of worryin' about being cool?
When there's a million things to learn they never teach you in school?
I don't believe what they say
We just want tomorrow to be better than today
You've got to...
Feel it
See it
Know how much you need it
What's the point of livin' if you don't take a chance?
You've got to...
Use it
Lose it
Know that you'll still do it
What's the point of livin' if you don't wanna dance?
You've got to...
Feel it
See it
Know how much you need it
What's the point of livin' if you don't take a chance?
You've got to...
Use it
Lose it
Know that you'll still do it
What's the point of livin' if you don't wanna dance?
Fabrications complicate the world in a web
Too much useless information plays with your head
Very clever people know we all need a chance
To stop our clever busyness and let go and dance
You've got to...
Use it
Lose it
Know that you'll still do it
What's the point of livin' if you don't wanna dance?
You've got to...
Feel it
See it
Know how much you need it
What's the point of livin' if you don't take a chance?
You've got to...
Use it
Lose it
Know that you'll still do it
What's the point of livin' if you don't wanna dance?
Oh-oh, oh-oh everybody 
Everybody wanna dance now
Oh-oh, oh-oh everybody
Everybody wanna dance now
When I was a young boy
My mama said to me
There's only one girl in the world for you
And she probably lives in Tahiti
I'd go the whole wide world
I'd go the whole wide world just to find her
Or maybe she's in the Bahamas
Where the Caribbean Sea is blue
Weeping in a tropical moonlit night
Because nobody's told her 'bout you
I'd go the whole wide world
I'd go the whole wide world just to find her
I'd go the whole wide world
I'd go the whole wide world to find out where they hide her
I'd go the whole wide world
I'd go the whole wide world just to find her
Why am I hanging around in the rain out here
Trying to pick up a girl
Why are my eyes filling up with these lonely tears
When there's girls all over the world
Well is she lying on a tropical beach somewhere
Underneath the tropical sun
Pining away in a heatwave there
Hoping that I won't be long
I should be lying on that sun-soaked beach with her
Caressing her warm brown skin
And then in a year or maybe not quite
We'll be sharing the same next of kin
I'd go the whole wide world
I'd go the whole wide world just to find her
I'd go the whole wide world
I'd go the whole wide world to find out where they hide her
I'd go the whole wide world
I'd go the whole wide world just to find her
I'd go the whole wide world
I'd go the whole wide world to find out where they hide her
Yeah!
It feels less important when you want to wait it out
I had enough feeling give me what I want or put me on the streets
I'm getting tired of living my life like nothing's happening
Talk is cheap but lies are even cheaper
So it's really me I want you to count the ways you can make it up to me
I'm getting tired of everybody talking and not doing a thing
Here I am in the graveyard waiting for a war
I'm here, I'm calling out your name
I've been here before
There's nothing left to talk about but there's plenty left to do
And if it's all the same to me you know it'll be different to you
I'm getting tired of living like I'm dying while the world is moving on
Here I am in the graveyard waiting for a war
I'm here, I'm calling out your name
I've been here before
Pardon me I must apologize
I've been this way for quite some time
I tried to be just a long time ago
Baby your magic is working
I lose control of myself when ever you are near me
I feel myself changing
From a guy too cynical for love
Into a blushing romantic
Oh honey I'd swim across the Atlantic
Just to be near to you I'm hopping like a kangaroo
Baby your magic is working
All of my friends think I'm mad
'Cause I talk of nothing but you girl
How you've really changed me
From a guy thought too cynical for love
You've proven everyone wrong
Anywhere with you girl is where I belong
Everything is beautiful and you are the reason
Lately I've been so happy
Just holding you and gazing into your eyes
Like in a movie
You are a star... I mean a starlet,
Listen the night we met I fell in love with you
Who'd have guessed who'd have guessed
I'm in love I'm in love
How you've really changed me
From a guy thought too cynical for love
Suddenly I feel as light as a butterfly
And wanting to give love another try
Everything is beautiful and you are the reason
Baby your magic is working
My mirror's reflection is you
Looking coquet and smirking
Now your magic is working
I do this everyday
I do this daily
Everyday I do this
When I found you I knew there was a chance that,
The stars in your eyes would turn and break my heart.
So I gathered everything I had left in my world and put it in your
Hands to tear apart
But you loved and built a house with my love,
Meet me at the house with all my heart.
I went there, I went there and I waited,
I really really wanted you to come.
Come! Come! Come!
When I found you I knew there was a chance that,
The stars in your eyes would turn and break my heart.
So I gathered everything I had left in my world and put it in your
Hands to tear apart
But your love, would not care for my love
My love you built a wall inside your heart.
I have a hammer, a hammer to break down,
You have a hammer baby we can break down the wall
You have a hammer baby break down the wall,
I do this everyday
I do this daily
Everyday I do this

I'm Jimmy Pop here in a jiffy heat me up and add oil
I'm like a zit a wart a corn a cyst a festerin' boil
I get under your skin and I sebaceously form
I'm as deep as the plot to an amateur gay porn
Keep ya hungry for more like Bangladesh
Then I'll bjorg da bjorg da bjorg ya like the Swedish Chef
'Cause I'm one of a kind and kinda hard to find
Kinda like an Injun without his fire water wine
I'm like Schneider One Day At A Time
I'm feelin' like Bob Vila nailin' up your behind
To my wall like Daniel-san does
I'm waxin' on I'm waxin' off I'm waxin' just because
I get wired like Western Union and I got to be me
And I got more balls than the daily lottery
Like hemorrhoidal itch yo you can't ignore me
'Cause I'm more tongue in cheek than a lesbo orgy
And I don't give a damn if you don't like me
'Cause I don't like you 'cause you're not like me
And I don't give a damn if you don't like me
'Cause I don't like you 'cause you're not like me
And I don't give a damn if you don't like me
'Cause I don't like you 'cause you're not like me
And I don't give a damn if you don't like me
'Cause I don't like you 'cause you're not like me
Second verse is different than the first
I'm Jimmy Pop I am
Jimmity Jimmity Pop I am I am
See my name's not Hoover and I don't give a damn
And I got a different angle like a parallelogram
And you'll be all ears like a field of corn
I'll make you Dizzy like Gillespie as I toot my own horn
Like a number two pencil I always got a point
You'll want to share it with your friends like a poorly rolled joint
I'm Jimmy Pop y'all I'm Jimmy Pop y'all
I'm an Alka Seltzer that's right you're a seagull
As I continue to expand your head is gonna burst
Leave a bad taste in your mouth like moldy liverwurst
Like the Texas Chainsaw Massacre I'll get in your face
But then I'll brush you off like Aqua-Fresh toothpaste
'Cause I'm lettin' off steam like a Chinese laundromat
But I'm not a roll of Charmin so don't give me no crap
And I don't give a damn if you don't like me
'Cause I don't like you 'cause you're not like me
And I don't give a damn if you don't like me
'Cause I don't like you 'cause you're not like me
And I don't give a damn if you don't like me
'Cause I don't like you 'cause you're not like me
And I don't give a damn if you don't like me
'Cause I don't like you 'cause you're not like me
I hate a lot of whites and I hate a lot of blacks
I hate poopin' in public places but we all hate that
I hate lesbian feminists 'cause they're all so damn ugly
I hate Spin magazine 'cause they never ever plug me
And I hate Regis and I hate Kathie Lee
I hate every single movie by that midget Spike Lee
I hate people that think that I care what they think
I hate people that think that their ass don't stink
I hate Jon Bon Jovi but I hate his music more
I hate killin' people 'cause I hate to keep score
I hate you but you hate yourself too
I hate to be honest but I'd hate to be you
And I don't give a damn if you don't like me
'Cause I don't like you 'cause you're not like me
And I don't give a damn if you don't like me
'Cause I don't like you 'cause you're not like me
And I don't give a damn if you don't like me
'Cause I don't like you 'cause you're not like me
And I don't give a damn if you don't like me
'Cause I don't like you 'cause you're not like me
And I don't give a damn if you don't like me
'Cause I don't like you 'cause you're not like me
And I don't give a damn if you don't like me
'Cause I don't like you 'cause you're not like me
And I don't give a damn if you don't like me
'Cause I don't like you 'cause you're not like me
And I don't give a damn if you don't like me
'Cause I don't like you 'cause you're not like me
If I had to choose a moment in time
To take with me into eternity
I would choose this
This moment with you in my arms
I know we've lost the final battle
I know we are prisoners
I can hear chains rattle
But I'm a prisoner of this moment with you in my arms
You in my arms
You in my arms
You in my arms
I have a love
I have a love for this world
A kind of love that will break my heart
A kind of love that reconstructs and remodels the past
That adds a dryness to the dry august grass
That adds the sunshine to the magnifying glass
And makes me fight for something that just can't last
You in my arms
You in my arms
You in my arms
You in my arms
If I had to choose a moment in time
To take with me into eternity
I'd choose this moment with you in my arms
You in my arms
You in my arms
You in my arms
You in my
(Dodododo 1)
Dodododo, dodododo, dodododo, dodeedododo...
(Verse 1A)
Waking up at twelve in my clothes again,
Feel my head explode from a night of gin,
Another night out late.
I don't wanna drink,
Don't wanna be a clown,
Gotta get my feet back on the ground
Before it pulls me in
(Verse 1B)
How come it ended up like this?
And who's gonna catch me
When I'm coming down to hit the ground again?
All by myself, (waking up at twelve I'm my clothes again)
'Cause I don't wanna drag you down,
Hold you down,
'Cause you're a friend,
I blame myself, (feel my head explode from a night a gin)
I guess you think it's funny now,
Funny now.
(Dodododo 2)
Dodododo, dodododo, dodododo, dodeedododo...
Dodododo, dodododo, dodododo, dodeedododo...
(Verse 2A)
On the underground,
With the freaks and frowns,
Looking at the world,
Through silver clouds,
But then it all came down.
I've gotta rise above
The emotional flood,
Gotta cut these ropes around my hands,
Pull myself around.
(Verse B)
How come it ended up like this?
And who's gonna be there
When I've lost control and I'm heading to crash-land?
All by myself, (waking up at twelve I'm my clothes again)
'Cause I don't wanna drag you down,
Hold you down,
'Cause you're a friend,
I blame myself, (feel my head explode from a night a gin)
I guess you think it's funny now,
Funny now.
(Riff)
All by myself,
'Cause I don't wanna drag you down,
Hold you down,
'Cause you're a friend,
I blame myself,
I guess you think it's funny now,
Funny now.
It's such a shame.
All by myself, (Waking up at twelve in my clothes again)
'Cause I don't wanna drag you down,
Hold you down,
'Cause you're a friend,
I blame myself, (Feel my head explode from a night of gin)
I guess you think it's funny now,
Funny now.
(Outro Chorus)
It's such a sin.
All by myself, (Waking up at twelve in my clothes again)
'Cause I don't wanna drag you down,
Hold you down,
'Cause you're a friend,
I blame myself. (Feel my head explode from a night of gin)
I guess you think it's funny now,
Funny now.

I know a movie star, I've got her plastered to my wall
Just like we're dear old friends, like she already knows me
She's perfect as she seems, lifts me right out the mezzanine
I finally fell in love, I've been waiting forever
4 3 2 1 went out the barrel of the gun
Keep my head way down
Stay out or stay in
Half dead and half numb
She's enough to make me warm
It's all so safe and sound
Lie back and fast asleep, if you could see what I could see,
Drip drop a lovely dream,
God damn you movie star, can't you just play a minute more
We'd be the best of friends, you could stay here forever
4 3 2 1 went out the barrel of a gun
Keep my head way down
Stay out or stay in
Half dead and half numb
She's enough to make me warm
It's all so safe and sound
She will be sweet on me, just like a mystery
It's not so hard to see, if I'm not mistaken
She comes from far away (far away), and gets closer every day (every day)
And all that I can say is that she's all I want and all that I live for
4 3 2 1 went out the barrel of a gun
Keep my head way down
Stay out or stay in
Half dead and half numb
She's enough to make me warm
It's all so safe and sound
I was not looking for arty farty love
I wanted someone to love completely
Someone more than weekly
I was looking for a decent boy
For a tender glance, ohoho
For a safety dance, ohoho
The wuthering heights
And the stormy nights
You give me ten thousand nights of thunder
But I will give them all back to you
'Cause you're so ooh (Tootootoo), so ah (Tootootoo), so cool
You came like a thief in the night and stole my heart
Ooh, like a solitude erasure
Like an elevator
And I know we'd do anything for love (Oh yeah)
And it is you and me, ohoho
For all eternity, ohoho
The wuthering heights
And the stormy nights
You give me ten thousand nights of thunder
But I will give them all back to you
'Cause you're so ooh (Tootootoo), so ah (Tootootoo), so cool (Baby, you're so super-supremely-ba-ba-di-oh)
It feels like ten thousand nights of thunder
When I've spend one with you
'Cause you're so ooh (Tootootoo), so ah (Tootootoo), so cool (Baby, you're so super-supremely-ba-ba-di-oh)
And baby, baby, you're irresistible and I'm insatiable (Ooohooohooohooohooo)
Yeah, love is an ocean of sweet emotion (Sweet emotion)
You give me ten thousand nights of thunder
But I will give them all back to you
'Cause you're so ooh (Tootootoo), so ah (Tootootoo), so cool (Baby, you're so super-supremely-ba-ba-di-oh)
It feels like ten thousand nights of thunder
When I've spend one with you
'Cause you're so ooh (Tootootoo), so ah (Tootootoo), so cool (Baby, you're so super-supremely-ba-ba-di-oh)
You give me ten thousand nights of thunder
But I will give them all back to you
'Cause you're so ooh (Tootootoo), so ah (Tootootoo), so cool (Baby, you're so super-supremely-ba-ba-di-oh)
Tootootoo, tootootoo
Tootootoodooroo
You're so ooh (You're so), so ah (You're so), so cool (Baby, you're so super-supremely-ba-ba-di-oh)
Tootootoo, tootootoo
Tootootoodooroo
You're so ooh (You're so), so ah (You're so), so cool (Baby, baby, you're so!)
Tootootoo, tootootoo (Ohoho!)
Tootootoodooroo
You're so ooh (You're so), so ah (You're so), you're so (Hey, hey, yeah!)
Tootootoo, tootootoo
Tootootoodooroo
You're so ooh, so ah, so cool
Tootootoo, tootootoo
Tootootoodooroo
Monday, back from the dead
I'm letting it go
Back for another one
Tuesday, shoot me in the head
I'm takin' it back , takin' it back
I'll take it back
Wednesday, she's lookin' for a friend
She'll get what she wants
Can't seem to get enough
Thursday, it's more than I can stand
I'm holdin' her down, holdin' her down
She's down again
I gotta find a way to find her
Where could she be?
Four days of the week
She thinks I'm the enemy
One day, left me for dead
Woke up on the floor
Time for another one
Two days, she's leavin' me again
Can't take it no more
Out through the open door
Three days, she's found herself a friend
She got what she wants
Still never get enough
Four days, she's back with me again
She's pullin' me down, pullin' me down
I'm down again
I gotta find a way to find her
Where could she be?
Four days of the week
She thinks I'm the enemy
Monday's gone
Tuesday's fadin'
Wednesday's gone
Thursday's all but wasted now
Monday, back from the dead
I'm letting it go
Back for another one
Tuesday, shoot me in the head
I'm takin' it back , takin' it back
I'll take it back
I gotta find a way to find her
Where could she be?
Four days of the week
She thinks I'm the enemy
Thinks I'm the enemy
Bed clothes, why am I in bed clothes?
Watching out the window
Watching what I don't know
On the fire escape now
Hands they start to shake now
Ready for the rail to break now
And I'm awake at last awake
Cursing, rattling and cursing
Go ahead and do your worst then
Your worst that I can take
Oh let the rain fall down
And wash this world away
Oh let the sky be grey
'Cause if its ever gonna get any better
Its gotta get worse for a day
Morning, where am I this morning?
Now its really pouring,
Crawling up this shore
And I walk the neighborhood
And umbrella does no good
And I guess its in my blood
Couldn't stop the flood
Drowning, everything is drowning
Go ahead and take the town
The town is yours to take
Oh let the rain fall down
And wash this world away
Oh let the sky be grey
'Cause if its ever gonna get any better
Its gotta get worse for a day
Calling, calling, falling, falling
Grab on my guitar
And paddle with both my arms
Headed where the voices are
I'll end up far so far away
Oh let the rain fall down
And wash this world away
Or let the sky be grey
'Cause if its ever gonna get any better
Its gotta get worse for a day
Its gotta get worse for a day
Its gotta get worse for a day
Its gotta get worse for a day
I know
Its gotta get worse for a day
Like a cloud his fingers explode
On the typewriter ribbon, the shadow grows
His heart's in a bowl behind the bank
And every evening when he gets home
To make his supper and eat it alone
His black shirt cries while his shoes get cold
It's just a dream he keeps having
And it doesn't seem to mean anything
And it doesn't seem to mean anything
One summer, a suicide
Another autumn, a traveler's guide
He hits snooze twice before he dies
And every evening when he gets home
To make his supper and eat it alone
His black shirt cries while his shoes get cold
It's just a dream he keeps having
And it doesn't seem to mean anything
It's just a dream he keeps having
He feels lucky to have you here
In his kitchen, in your chair
Sometimes he forgets that you're even there
It's just a dream he keeps having (ooh)
And it doesn't seem to mean anything (ooh)
It's just a dream he keeps having (ooh)
It's just a dream
And it doesn't seem to mean anything (ooh)
One day one woman asked him
"What do you to survive?"
He said 'oh my dear listen here
And this is what he cried
On my feet I wear two shoes for dancing
"Dancing to be free"
My feet they're paying tribute to
The Bobby Marley legacy
My knees they got some cuts and bruises
From skating all my days
'Cause when I skating with my friends
My troubles drift away
I say my legs they're wearing baggy pants
I like to move around
'Cause getting down and jumping up
These are some good things that I found
Aeehhhiiiaaaaa
Boom shak the empire be rising
Aeehhhiiiaaaaa
Boom shak we making some loving
Aeehhhiiiaaaaa
Boom shak the greedy men running
Aeehhhiiiaaaaa
Boom shak got two shoes for dancing
My waist it's got a slinky belt
With a clip that's quick to open
Because loving is the sweetest thing
And from my waist it happens
And my stomachs got some tasty food
That's making me feel good
'Cause sharing some meals is something
I wish the world could do
And my chest it wears a singlet
Ah my chest it beating proud
My chest suggest I am a man
That no institution can knock down
And around my neck is superstition
Hanging from a chain
Because I got my gods but in the end
I make my own way
My mouth it's got a great big smile
That shows some great big teeth
To friends it brings a happiness
And to enemies it brings defeat
And my eyes they've got some vision
That can see through many lies
Well my eyes they look for better things
The better things to see in life
And my ears are wearing head phones
That do play my favourite songs
Not music I'm told to like
But the songs that make me dance along
'Cause on my feet are shoes for dancing
'Dancing to be free'
My feet they're paying tribute to
The Bobby Marley legacy
Walked to your house on my lunch break, here it comes
Come inside and pour a drink, here it comes
You'll probably tell me everything you think, here it comes
The place and the time where we knew everything could go wrong
Grass grows green, could you step away from the screen?
Doesn't mean I don't want you to be seen
Just like everyone
Grass grows green and it's just everyone
You always told me life's a dam that breaks, well, here it comes
If you sit still or if you run, well, here it comes
So now we're drowning in birthday cakes, well, here it comes
The place and the time where we knew everything could go wrong
Keep it clean, I didn't mean to be mean
Why does it always seem like I've never won?
Keep it clean and no one's ever won
The empty promise makers said, here it comes
Make a point to make no sense, well, here it comes
Speak about the future in past tense, here it comes
Don't look down, so what'd we do?
Walking around with shit on my shoes, well, here we come
The place and the time where we knew that things would go wrong
Dear your name here
It's been a long time, a very long time
Since I've heard your voice
And I bet she never thought I was
So sorry so.
I've had a hard time, very hard time
Seeing less of you.
I never thought you knew.
So can you see
You're seeing less of me darling.
And you're blind to the fact that my
Heart stopped beating.
And I'm as good as dead,
And I'm as good as dead,
Dear I forgot your name again
Just picking up where I left off.
This is the part where you leave me.
So sorry so.
I've had a hard time, very hard time
Seeing less of you.
I never thought you knew,
So can you see
You're seeing less of me darling.
And you're blind to the fact that my
Heart stopped beating.
So can you see
You're seeing less of me darling.
And you're blind to the fact that my
Heart stopped beating.
And I'm as good as dead,
And I'm as good as dead,
This is all I have to say.
To say
So can you see
You're seeing less of me darling.
And you're blind to the fact that my.
Heart stopped beating,
So can you see
You're seeing less of me darling.
And you're blind to the fact that my
Heart stopped beating.
You are a thunderous thing, wonderous king
The face of rival-less gods, deep in your thoughts
Come here, oh, closer to touch, never enough
Let me climb under your skin, oh let me in
From your lips, a precipice 
I hang from every word
Height and seeking
Oh we are reaching 
New heights and seeking
How to keep them high
The calm of turbulent seas, fallen to sleep
And when the troubles arise, we hold on tight
How can a body contain something so great
My shell may suddenly burst out will come birds
From your lips, a precipice
I hang on every word
Height and seeking
Oh we are reaching 
New heights and seeking
How to keep them high
Height and seeking
Oh we are reaching 
New heights and seeking
How to keep them high
Keep them high
We will find a way
We will find a way
We will find a way
We will find a way
And we are height and seeking,
Oh we are reaching 
New heights and seeking
How to keep them high
Height and seeking
Oh we are reaching 
New heights and seeking
How to keep them high
How to keep them high
How to keep them high
Keep them high
I never thought that you'd find out I did it
I was so scared that you'd leave, so I hid it
I know we said that we'd always be honest
So now I went out and messed up our nest
It finally seems like we've turned into strangers
It's gotten so bad, there's just no more anger
So now it seem like we can't get no further
I can't believe I'll be bright for another
I'll be the switch she turns on
She'll be mine too, I get off
I'll be the fuse that she blows
And even with the lights out, we'll glow
So where's the sun? It shone no love on your face
Under the moon and with the girl that's in your place
And even Edison has no idea
Of all the blackouts I've caused you and me
I'll be the switch she turns on
She'll be mine too, I get off
I'll be the fuse that she blows
And even with the lights out, we'll glow
I'll be the switch she turns on
She'll be mine too, I get off
I'll be the fuse that she blows
And even with the lights down real low
We'll glow, we'll glow, we'll glow
I'll be the switch she turns on
She'll be mine too, I get off
I'll be the, I'll be the fuse she blows
And even with the lights out, we'll glow
I'll be the switch she turns on
She'll be mine too, I get off
I'll be the fuse that she blows
And even with the lights out, we'll glow
I'll be the switch she turns on
She'll be mine too, I get off
I'll be the fuse that she blows
And even with the lights out, we'll glow
I'll be the, I'll be the fuse
I'll be the, I'll be the fuse
Lady on the water, make me rich, make me poor
Lay your flowers at my door
Lady on the water, bring me branches, bring me twine
Graft my heart upon the vine
With your wine down my feathers as the cock crows given time
Oh, awake, my lady on the water, share my bread and share my drink
Pay no mind what others think
Lady on the water, whip this wind into a flame
With your grapes and bottled rain
Make your wine of my worship of divinely strange refrain
Oh, to make it rain
My lady on the water, place your thumb upon my tongue
Leave a song no one has sung
Lady on the water with your jacket blue and strange
Change these rivers in my veins
Into wine, learning, burning, driven deep into this maze
All of my days
My lady on the water, lead me from the wilderness
Through countless deserts, dreams and jests
Lady on the water, rest my head upon your chest
Leave me only when I'm blessed
Cause I'll be in my own country, good and dead and gone to rest
It's the way that's the best
Instrumental
If I only knew your name
I'd go from door to door
Searching all the crowded streets
For the face that I once saw
If I only knew your name
I'd go from door to door
Tell me have you seen the girl
I've met just once before
One Night of Love
Nothing more nothing less
One Night of Love
To put my head in a mess
Is that you on the bus?
Is that you on the train?
You wrote your number on my hand
And it came off in the rain
One Night of Love
Nothing more nothing less
One Night of Love
It left my bed in a mess
Is that you on the bus?
Is that you on the train?
You wrote your number on my hand
And it came off in the rain
If I only knew your name
I'd go from door to door
Searching all the crowded streets
For the face that I once saw
If I only knew your name
I'd go from door to door
Tell me have you seen the girl
I've met just once before
Whoa-Oh
(Laura Marling)
Young Love
Never seems to last
Far too young
Until they have a past
Playing games
People move so fast
You don't need eyes to see
If someone's got a heart of glass
Young Love
Never seems to last
Far too young
Until they have a past
One night of love
Nothing more nothing less
One night of love
It left my heart in a mess
If I only knew your name
I'd go from door to door
Searching all the crowded streets
For the face that I once saw
If I only knew your name
I'd go from door to door
Tell me have you seen the boy
I've met just once before
Whoa-Oh
And since we met
I simply cannot forget
You are on my mind
Yes, since the day we met
I think I haven't slept
More than an hour at a time
You make me wanna measure stars
In the backyard
With a calculator and a ruler, baby
I found a letter that describes
How the moonlight will lead me
To a distant place that you will be
I don't know how
But there's a power
For now it conveys a subtle mystery
And from my house
As I look out
The stars align
You make me wanna measure stars
In the backyard
With a calculator and a ruler, baby
I found a letter that describes
How the moonlight will lead me
To a distant place that you will be
The open sky
Is mine tonight
It gives a sign
Of what I'll find

I'm in a mess, I'm in a dress
There's nothing from here till tomorrow morning
How will I get there?
I don't do drugs
All my friends are on their holidays
I go outside, it's not so bad
I saw my friend and he couldn't believe that
The girls were holding hands
The girls are holding hands
Don't be a fool
It's 1995, the girls are just friends
They got the drugs I could use but then I don't want any
All that I want is a photograph of Photo Jenny
How will I get one? I don't know
How will I get one? I don't know
How will I get her to strike a pose?
It's getting cold, I'll catch the bus
I saw my friend when she's finished working
Get some fish and chips
What's on the box?
'Man about the house' with Paula Wilcox
You see the boy/girl's at the bar
Everyone thinks she's really ugly
But I shut my eyes
I make a film
And the star of it is Photo Jenny

Gonna knock you 'round the head
