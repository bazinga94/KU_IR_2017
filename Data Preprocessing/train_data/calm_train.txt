Oh, but if I don't do it, you know somebody else will
If I don't do it, you know somebody else will
If I don't do it, you know somebody else will
If I don't do it, you know somebody else will
And it's such a night, it's such a night
Sweet confusion under the moonlight
It's such a night, such a night
To steal away, the time is right
(Lyrics Continued Below)
Yeah, I couldn't believe my ear
And my heart just skipped a beat
When you told me to take you walkin' down the street
Oh yeah, you came here with my best friend Jim
Here I am, I'm stealin' you away from him
Oh, but if I don't do it, you know somebody else will
If I don't do it, you know somebody else will
If I don't do it, you know somebody else will
If I don't do it, you know somebody else will
'Cause it's such a night
Instrumental
You've lost your sunlight, your body's filled with night
You stood and let it crush you, and now we can't go back
But you always will be the only one

With these hands, I will cling to you,
I'm yours forever and a day.
With these hands, I will bring to you,
A tender love as warm as May.
With this heart I will sing to you,
Long after stars have lost their glow,
And with these hands, I'll provide for you,
Should there be a stormy sea,
I'll turn the tide for you,
And I'll never,
No, I'll never let you go.
What the hell babe,
Damn I ain't never felt this way
Somebody, somebody tell me
I don't have a clue what to do
When it comes to you
Baby, you're so beautiful
Everytime, I see you girl, it throw me off
It's so unusual
For me, to be waiting
But I don't want to blow it girl,
But you should know this girl
Oh, I'm not gonna be the one to mess this up,
'Cause I've been left up in love before,
I'ma be the one to take her back see girl
We can take our time and you can want to Stay in, go out,
Anything you want girl, we can do
Girl are we going down, I don't know,
But from here now baby I'm gone leave that up to you,
Ima leave it up to you
Procession moves on, the shouting is over
Praise to the glory of loved ones now gone
Talking aloud as they sit 'round their tables
Scattering flowers washed down by the rain
Stood by the gate at the foot of the garden
Watching them pass like clouds in the sky
Try to cry out in the heat of the moment
Possessed by a fury that burns from inside
Cry like a child though these years make me older
With children my time is so wastefully spent
A burden to keep though their inner communion
Accept like a curse, an unlucky deal
Played by the gate at the foot of the garden
My view stretches out from the fence to the wall
No words could explain, no actions determine
Just watching the trees and the leaves as they fall
Just watching the trees and the leaves as they fall
Just watching the trees and the leaves as they fall
Just watching the trees and the leaves as they fall
Breaking down the surface in the night.
It's like running around the evasive ground.
It can't be done.
For the first time I tried to really try.
It's not easy for a blind man, to see the Sun.
I've seen the future and the end is here.
Please forgive me, 'cause I've been there.
Seas ran by and by and far and wide.
It's easy to see right through your fingers and hide.
Fighting for the freedom nowhere found.
Feeling old, too old to fight.
Running around the circles in the night.
How you're supposed to keep it all inside?
I've seen the future and the end is near.
Please forgive me, 'cause I've been there.
It's not too much time left for us to breathe.
That's my story.
The end is closing in.
Seas ran by and by and far and wide.
It's easy to see right through your fingers and hide.
Seas ran by and by and far and wide.
It's easy to see right through your fingers and hide.
Breathing as my body dies to get by.
The light behind the cracks of glass is so bright.

Det bor en ängel i mitt rum
hon har sitt bo ovanför mitt huvud
hon gör mej lugn
och hon viskar till mej
allt det jag säger dej 
Det bor en annan i min kropp
hon har den vackraste av själar
hon är kärlek och hopp
och hon berättar för dej
hur mycket jag älskar dej
Det bor en ande vid min fot
som blåser värme över huden
det kittlar och du såg att jag log
men när hon andas på mej
är det för att jag ska komma
och värma dej
Här är jag med allt det andra
som gör en människa hel
och jag hoppas
jag hoppas att du orkar
och att ängeln i rummet
det är henne
du ser
When you said tulips
I knew that you're mine
When I caught you there
Crying in the night
Wearing my jacket
Wearing that smile
I knew that I'd found you
This could be an opportunity
Were you unawares?
Did it catch you out?
Or did it break you in
Right from the start?
It's as pure as fire
It's as pure as snow
I knew that I'd found you
This could be an opportunity
If you promise to let it
If you promise to let it grow
'Cause you're the one I love
Bury everything you own
On a hill in Peckham Rye
Say a prayer for those you've known
As tracer fire scars the sky
A heaven of abandoned stars
River running black and red
Fight your way through crowds and cars
As rockets flower overhead
Meet me in the dust cloud
As the towers topple over ground
We can be ghosts now
We don't ever have to make a sound
Meet me in the white light
As the city slowly lifts away
We can be a ghost now
With the memory of another day
Meet me in the white light
In the white light now
You were so clever
You kept it together today 
By the way
I'll no longer ignore you 
I wanted to show you again 
I'm your friend 
Sometimes we just pretend 
And all I can say is you saved me
Changed all the things that have made me 
Entertaining, thoughts are raining 
Down we fall
It's all okay
When I say 
You and I 
Take your time 
I can't wait 
To see you fly 
You don't have to wander 
I've finally discovered tonight 
Where we're right
This is just the beginning 
It's all that I'm tryin' to say 
If I may 
You're never in my way 
And all I can say is you saved me 
Changed all the things that have made me 
Entertaining, thoughts are raining 
Down we fall
It's all okay
When I say 
You and I
Take your time 
I can't wait 
To see you fly 
And all I can say is you saved me 
Changed all the things that have made me 
Entertaining, thoughts are raining 
Down we fall
Entertaining, thoughts are raining 
Down we fall
(And all I can say is you saved me) Entertaining, thoughts are raining 
Down we fall  
(Changed all the things that have made me) Entertaining, thoughts are raining
Down we fall
(And all I can say is you saved me) Entertaining, thoughts are raining 
Down we fall  
(Changed all the things that have made me) Entertaining, thoughts are raining
Down we fall
(And all I can say is you saved me) Entertaining, thoughts are raining 
Down we fall  
(Changed all the things that have made me) Entertaining, thoughts are raining
Down we fall
(And all I can say is you saved me) Entertaining, thoughts are raining 
Down we fall  
(Changed all the things that have made me) Entertaining, thoughts are raining
Down we fall
(And all I can say is you saved me) Entertaining, thoughts are raining 
Down we fall  
(Changed all the things that have made me) Entertaining, thoughts are raining
Down we fall
(And all I can say is you saved me) Entertaining, thoughts are raining 
Down we fall

Maya this song's for you
I have your name print tattooed upon my skin
There's so much to say to you
And where do I begin?
'Cause all these prayers must be going somewhere
Somewhere I can never trace
But it seems so far look in the stars
And the empty space
There are worlds within worlds, that keep rotating
And so many thoughts that flow through my mind
If this universe is really shrinking
We'll be together in time
I had a vision of this place
It looked like heaven but the colours seemed to change
And no matter what I do yeah
It's slowly fading away
So all of these prayers have to be going somewhere
Somewhere I can never trace
And one could get lost in all of these stars
And drift in space
There are worlds within worlds, that keep rotating
And so many thoughts that flow through my mind
If this universe is really shrinking
We'll be together in time
There are worlds within worlds, that keep rotating
And so many thoughts that flow through my mind
If this universe is really shrinking
We'll be together in time
There are worlds within worlds, that keep rotating
And so many thoughts that flow through my mind
If this universe is really shrinking
We'll be together in time
One night
When you're looking
At me looking at you
It may be tonight
We'll go walking through...
Just me and you
Bittersweet
You're gonna be the death of me
I don't want you but I need you
I love you and hate you at the very same time
Bittersweet
See what I want so much, should never hurt this bad
Never did this before, that's what the virgin says
We've been generally warned, that's what the surgeon says
God talk to me now, this is an emergency
And she claim she only wit' me for the currency
You cut me deep, bitch, cut me like surgery
And I was too proud to admit that it was hurtin' me
I'd never do that to you, at least purposely
We breakin' up again
We makin' up again
But we don't love no more
I guess we fuckin' then
Have you ever felt you ever want to kill her?
And you mix them emotions with tequilla
And you mix that wit' a little bad advice
On one of them bad nights, y'all have a bad fight
And you talkin' 'bout her family, her aunts and shit
And she say, muhfucka, yo mama's a bitch
You know, domestic drama and shit, all the attitude
I'll never hit a girl, but I'll shake the shit outta you
But I'ma be the bigger man, big pimpin' like jigga man
Oh, I guess I figure it's
Bittersweet
You're gonna be the death of me
I don't want you but I need you
I love you and hate you at the very same time
Bittersweet
See what I want so much, should never hurt this bad
Never did this before, that's what the virgin says
We've been generally warned, that's what the surgeon says
God talk to me now, this is an emergency
And my nigga said I shouldn't let it worry me
I need to focus on the girls we gettin' currently
But I've been thinkin' and it got me back to sinkin' in
This relationship, it even got me back to drinkin'
Now this Hennessey, is gonna' be the death of me
And I always thought that you havin' my child was our destiny
But I can't even vibe wit you sexually
'Cause every time that I try you will question me.
Saying, you fuckin' them girls, disrespecting me
You don't see how your lies is affectin' me
You don't see how our life was supposed to be
And I never let a nigga get that close to me
And you ain't cracked up
To what you was supposed to be
You always gone, you always be where them hoes will be
And it's the first time she ever spilled her soul to me
Bittersweet
(I fucked up and I know it, G)
You're gonna be the death of me
(I guess it's bittersweet poetry)
I don't want you but I need you
I love you and hate you at the very same time
Bittersweet
You're gonna be the death of me
I don't want you but I need you
I love you and hate you at the very same time
See what I want so much, should never hurt this bad
Never did this before, that's what the virgin says
We've been generally warned, that's what the surgeon says
God talk to me now, this is an emergency
See what I want so much, should never hurt this bad
Never did this before, that's what the virgin says
We've been generally warned, that's what the surgeon says
God talk to me now, this is an emergency
Bittersweet
You're gonna be the death of me
I don't want you but I need you
I love you and hate you at the very same time
He stands by the doors of the Rex all night
Chain-smoking Celtas
His eyes trouble more than one woman
His voice is heavy and deep
There's dirt on the sidewalk
And the newsboy yell
Nothing ever changes at the Parallel
Nothing ever changes at the Parallel
There 's a girl at the Molino
She wears a leather coat
The dust of Barcelona
Sticks to her heals as she walks
Trough the door
And he thinks: "What the hell
Does she come here for?
Maybe she wants me, and that's
Her way to say it?
Maybe she wants me, and that's
Her way to say it?
Maybe she wants me, but who am I to tell?
He bites his fingernails
Scratches his eyebrows
Lights another cigarette
Watching the queens of the street
Acting their parody of love
And he feels like he stands by the gates of hell
Nothing ever changes at the Parallel
Nothing ever changes at the Parallel
That girl from the Molino
Who wears the leather coat
Sits there rockin' slowly on a chair
Gazing dreamly at the door
And he thinks: "What the hell
Is she looking for?
Maybe she wants me, and that's
Her way to say it?
Maybe she wants me, and that's
Her way to say it?
Maybe she wants me, but who am I to tell?"
In the night, I hear 'em talk,
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road, he lost his soul to a woman so heartless...
How could you be so heartless?
Oh... How could you be so heartless?
How could you be so, cold as the winter wind when it breeze, yo
Just remember that you talkin' to me though
You need to watch the way you talkin' to me, yo
I mean after all the things that we've been through
I mean after all the things we got into
Hey yo, I know of some things that you ain't told me
Hey yo, I did some things but that's the old me
And now you wanna get me back and you gon' show me
So you walk around like you don't know me
You got a new friend, well I got homies
But in the end it's still so lonely
In the night, I hear 'em talk,
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road, he lost his soul to a woman so heartless...
How could you be so heartless?
Oh... How could you be so heartless?
How could you be so Dr. Evil, you bringin' out a side of me that I don't know...
I decided we weren't gon' speak so
Why we up 3 A.M. on the phone
Why does she be so mad at me fo'
Homie I don't know, she's hot and cold
I won't stop, won't mess my groove up
'Cause I already know how this thing go
You run and tell your friends that you're leaving me
They say that they don't see what you see in me
You wait a couple months then you gon' see
You'll never find nobody better than me
In the night, I hear 'em talk,
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road, he lost his soul to a woman so heartless...
How could you be so heartless?
Oh... How could you be so heartless?
Talkin', talkin', talkin', talk
Baby let's just knock it off
They don't know what we been through
They don't know 'bout me and you
So I got something new to see
And you just gon' keep hatin' me
And we just gon' be enemies
I know you can't believe
I could just leave it wrong
And you can't make it right
I'm gon' take off tonight
Into the night...
In the night, I hear 'em talk,
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road, he lost his soul to a woman so heartless...
How could you be so heartless?
Oh... How could you be so heartless?
Childhood was I happy then?
I don't remember it all that well
I would have ended it by now
If it wasn't for the cinema
And I know it's getting late
The food is aging in my plate
Feels like I've passed my expiring date
Like a lonely vegetable
Waiting in my cubicle
I'll never amount to anything
So what have I left to give?
What is there left to say
When at the closing of the day
Feels like the world has passed away?
Dull, blank and lusterless
Clumsy, unadorned and colourless
I never liked me anyhow
I wasn't made for anytime
Still I wanted you to know
Yeah I wanted you to know
Moonlight came upon my worthless shadow
Mon coeur est rempli,
Mais mon corps s'ennuie
Tes jeux délibérés avec un dé,
Des dés pipés, des dés pipés,
des dés pipés
Je veux savoir où naît le vent
J'ai l'âme inerte en même temps
Il y a de l'uniformité partout
De la pensée en boîte et c'est
bien tout !
Mon coeur est rempli,
Mais mon corps s'ennuie
Je t'ai montré mon arrière-train
Mon céans, mon céans, mon céans
l'océan
Et quand ma langue se délie...
C'est l'éloquence de mes silences
Là, sur ton orifice ami...
Je m'immisce dans ta pénombre,
Et, là, je fais le tour du monde
Mon coeur est rempli,
Mais mon corps s'ennuie
Les poupées qui disent "oui
et non"
Qu'on é.cu de la même...
Façon, je dis non, je dis non,
je dis non, je dis non,
je dis non !
Je dis non !
Je dis qu'il n'y a pas d'porno chic
Mais bien que des porcs au sens
strict
Primo, deuxio, tertio, c'est le chaos
J'ai bien le coeur sur le bord du
billot
Mon corps se rempli
Mais mon coeur aussi
Et plus le corps est entravé
Plus l'esprit est "libre", est "libre",
est "libre",
Mon coeur est rempli
Mais mon coeur s'ennuie
Et plus le corps est entravé
Plus l'esprit est "libre", est "libre",
est "libre"...
I know exactly how you feel
You were this close to closing deals
When everything fell from out your hands
You were forced to decide on other plans now
You figured it best to just ignore it
Otherwise you're only living for it
And if anyone ever wondered why you did it
You'd swear they never knew you sold your soul to the
Burning, burning, burning, burning bridges
You know exactly what I want so
I don't have to be so damn upfront
No matter the moment we decide to make our minds up
I know a man who may need a new assignment
To hand in his heart and take his last vacation
Attempting to spoil imagination
If anyone ever wonders where he went
I wouldn't say that he spent his time driving over
Burning, burning, burning bridges
Burning, burning which is
Nothing more than a longing for being uninvolved
Uninvolved
Uninvolved
Uninvolved
Oh, desire can cause heart attacks
Oh, desire can cause heart attacks
Oh, desire can cause heart attacks
Oh, desire, it won't bring you back
Do you want to be hypnotized?
All you have to do is move your body
In what ever way feels comfortable for you
Just let yourself sink into the groove
And move...
Fix your eyes on a spot
It doesn't matter where
Just fix your eyes on one spot
And begin to relax
Feel your mind and body
Beginning to wind down
Wind down, wind down and relax
If you have any thoughts
Just let them drift through your mind
Like beautiful clouds
Across a clear blue sky
Just through your mind and away from you
Through your mind and away
As you relax
Deeper, deeper and deeper relax
Just let go of stress and tension
Let go of worry and doubt and relax
Imagine a staircase standing in front of you
With ten, wide, safe, stairs
Down, down to a perfect relaxation
Down to peace and contentment
Down towards the happiness that you deserve
And as I count down from ten
Take one step with each number
One step down
10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1
Deeper, deeper, deeper... relax
That's it... just let go, and relax
You've stolen my heart it's true
You see the shape of things to come
Why give up our lives to the brutes and fools
Tear it all apart
You see the shape of things to come
Why? this now girl
Will we kill each other
Like Adam in chains
I want revenge
Like Adam in chains
I want revenge
Adam in chains
They've broken your heart
Ah yeah, they're gonna tear your world apart
Why make up a lie
And believe it's true
Ah, tear it all apart
I know the shape of things to come
Why this now girl
Will we murder each other
Like Adam in chains
I want revenge
Like Adam in chains
I want revenge
Like Adam in chains
I want revenge
Want revenge
In the mind of a madman
There are colour explosions
An eclipse of emotion
Why tear our world apart
Why tear it all apart
Why tear our world apart girl
When your faith in life is gone,
Come and speak to me.
When you're down and all messed up,
Seek my sympathy.
When everybody says no, no, no,
Well, it's your misfortune and none of my own,
Wrong, wrong, wrong,
Well, it's your misfortune that sweetens my song.
I can be the friend you want,
I can be your confidante,
I can be the right reminder at the right time,
Throwin' out the lifeline.
Stand in the light. Stand in the light. Stand in the light.
Stand in the light. Stand in the light. Stand in the light.
When your face is caked with mud,
Come and speak to me.
When the chill creeps in your blood,
Seek my sympathy.
When everybody says no, no, no,
Well, it's your misfortune and none of my own,
Wrong, wrong, wrong,
Well, it's your misfortune that sweetens my song.
I can be the air you drink,
Every single thought you think,
I can be the right notion in the meantime,
Warm you like the sunshine.
Stand in the light. Stand in the light. Stand in the light.
Stand in the light. Stand in the light. Stand in the light.
Stand in the light. Stand in the light. Stand in the light.
Stand in the light. Stand in the light. Stand in the light.
Every time he goes, she dies
Every time she comes, she cries
He was her long, bright future
In the middle of a wrong, dark road
He loved her, but he wasn't too sure
If he could return the love she showed
When she said, "my love extends
Beyond the realm of being friends"
He kissed her head
And quietly he said
"It's not that you're not beautiful, you're just not beautiful to me"
She said, "how beautiful do I have to be?
When I look in the mirror, you're the only thing I see,
And I have loved you beautifully"
Well, ten thousand tears passed by
But she never let him see her cry
And he called up down one night
He said, "let's get in the car and just drive"
He talked a lot about loneliness
But why, she didn't know
And some song about Memphis
Was playin' on the radio
She said, "let's stop the car and slow dance,
Won't you just give me a chance?"
He took her hand
And hoped she'd understand
"It's not that you're not beautiful, you're just not beautiful to me"
She said, "how beautiful do I have to be?
When I look in the mirror, you're the only thing I see,
And I have loved you beautifully"
Well, she'll burn that bridge
And build a house
And swallow the smoke in her mouth
And she'll feel the burn
And then make the choice
To put the fire in her voice
"It's not that you're not beautiful, you're just not beautiful to me"
She said, "how beautiful do I have to be?
When I look in the mirror, you're the only thing I see,
And I have loved you beautifully"
Is it strange for me to say that
If I were to die today
There's not a thing that I would change
I've lived well
Maybe I have made mistakes 
And been through my fair share of pain
But all in all
It's been okay
I've lived well
And the more that I see
The more that I know
I don't know anything
At all
Like the more that I breathe
And start to go slow
Of all the many things
I can only recall
All of the good things, good things
All of the good things, good things
Only the good, the good, the good
Only the good, the good, the good
All of the good things, good things
All of the good things, good things
Only the good, the good, the good
Only the good, the good, the good
Living on Sycamore street
And spending weekends on the beach
We were free to be everything we dreamed
Flying kites and water fights
Summer nights
We'd ride our bikes
On Over Hill
Ladera Heights
Man, I swear
And the more that I see
The more that I know
I don't know anything
At all
Like the more that I breathe
And start to go slow
Of all the many things
I can only recall
All of the good things, good things
All of the good things, good things
Only the good, the good, the good
Only the good, the good, the good
All of the good things, good things
All of the good things, good things
Only the good, the good, the good
Only the good, the good, the good
All of the good things, good things
All of the good things, good things
Only the good, the good, the good
Only the good, the good, the good
Won't you man up now
And be a hero?
I never thought you would let me go
All the voices keep torturing you head
You gotta quiet them, quiet them
I come in peace
I come to rescue you
And thought you're sick
I will comfort you
My heart is weak
When I'm not with you
We gotta make it through
You gotta live and learn
And you've learn to bail
You live your life like you're stuck in hell
And my only goal
Is to make you feel safe
But like everything I do I fail
I come in peace
I come to rescue you
And thought you're sick
I will comfort you
My heart is weak
When I'm not with you
We gotta make it through
You were part of a dream
And you made life more real
And you gave sense to my life too
You gave sense to my life too
You were part of a dream
And you made life more real
And you gave sense to my life too
You gave sense to my life too
Won't you man up now and
Be a hero?
Won't you man up now and
Be a hero?
Won't you man up now and
Be a hero?
Won't you man up now and
Be a hero?
I've never
I've never gone
I kind of know what I want
I don't know what I want
I've driven
A hundred yards
I never know what I've done
And that's a problem for some
When most of us are sleeping
Why bother to awake
If most of us are cheating
Why bother to uptake
I don't have to go with that
You don't have to go with that
(Repeat)
I've never
I've never gone
How can I know what I want?
I don't know what I want
I've driven
A hundred yards
I never know what I've done
And that's a problem for some
When most of us are sleeping
Why bother to awake
If most of us are cheating
Why bother to uptake
I don't have to go with that
You don't have to go with that
(Repeat)
When the winter was over
She returned there to find him
And her memories filled her with light
She remembered the beauty
She remembered desires
And her memories filled her with light
I am the sun in the flame
Cold from the flame turns away
And in these winds came a change
She awakes
Sister, walk through these fields of delight
I want you to know
Desperation's the tenderest trap
So gently you go
What will it take?
Sister awake
Sister awake
Sister
Sister
When this beautiful cult of desire
Has left you for dead
Isolation will cradle the lies
Of things left unsaid
What will it take?
Sister awake
Sister awake
Sister
Sister
And you'll look to the heavens above
And taste its deceit
These temptations have blinded desires
To sleep at their feet
What will it take?
Sister awake
Sister awake
Sister
Sister
Sister
Sister
And you'll hear them call out your name
Invoking the fates
Chances are you've travelled too far
In stirring their hate
So what will it take?
My sister awake
Sister awake
Sister awake
Awake
Awake
When people say it's sad
You know it can't be bad
And on any other day I'd be soul destroyed
But now I can't afford to listen to a word they say
And of all the times we had
Oh the ultimate late night
Didn't taste right
True words that I should know
Blood on my hands
When you looked around I couldn't be found
A crime's a crime, I'll have to pay
Now I find that I'm thigh deep
Too young for the worst of my mind
You whispered behind me
"If I may make so bold"
Call it young and wild
But I ran a mile in a minute and there's no going back
True words that I should know
Blood on my hands
When you looked around I couldn't be found
A crime's a crime, I'll have to pay
Ttrue words I said to myself
As the wind chilled my bones
"Home alone, you call that a late night?"
When people say you're dead
You know you caught their eye
And on any other day I'd be soul destroyed
But that's just not the way now
I don't mind telling you
Nothing is quite what it seems
True words that I should know
Must have been blood on my hands
When you look around I couldn't be found
A crime's a crime but I don't mind
True words that I should know well
But surely by now I could say to myself
"The days are getting longer so I better get stronger fast"
Surely by now?
Kruszę w dłoniach
Kromki chleba dwie
Okruchy,ryżu garść
Na parapecie kładę
Na lampie siedzi mały wróbel
Na oko-same pióra i kości
Zwęszyło ucztę kilka tłustych mew
Odganiam je robię szum
Bo nienawidzę mew
W tym czasie wróbel z głodu zdycha
Spada pożera go sąsiada kot
Nie żebym lubiła ptaki
Ja o ptakach nawet nie myślę
Po prostu wzruszył mnie ten mały
Naprawdę chciałam dobrze
One wild wakes through gates so sleep
Sinking self so sweet
The last song say feel afraid
But the evil that can be, has been, will be again...
Everything's moving away too fast
I don't mind let it pass,
All things in town went, nothing will last
No, I don't mind let it all pass.
To the higher heights I can lift it
... I couldn't with it
No senses...
With everything moving away too fast
I don't mind let it pass,
All things in town went, nothing will last
No, I don't mind let it all pass.
Sometimes, 
It's better not to know.
Holdin' on to something when 
You should just let go.
Two words
Spoken in a dream
Swimming to the surface like a
Last breath, last scream
Push, pull
Hurry up and stall
Would you give a little if you can't give it all
Ten years, pecking at a seed
Trying to wake the kid who's 
Messin' up my wet dream
Hey kid, rock and roll
Bullseye hung on your soul
I wish I had knew
Short simple way to reach you
I'd be the king if I could say to you
Cut the baby in two
Baby in two
True words
Spoken in a dream
Swimming to the surface like a
Last breath last scream
Sometimes it's better not to know
Holdin' on to nothing when you should just let go
Hey kid rock and roll
Bullseye hung on your soul
I wish I had knew a
Short simple way to reach you
I'd be the king if I could say to you
Cut the baby in two
Baby in two
Sometimes the city life feels like
Nothing was as bad as it is tomorrow
Alright, you can cry
Living with the price of a world of sorrow
I wish I had knew
A short simple way to reach you
I'd be the king if I could say to you
Cut the baby in two
Baby in two
Cut the baby in two
Baby in two
You've left your ghost until tomorrow
And then he must be sent
To a strange address
In the Mediterranean
I've met your ghost, he has proposed
I've met your ghost, yes, he's proposed
He needs some time alone
Then he'll stay with me
Then he'll visit your seven seas
Please leave me your ghost
I will keep him from harm
Although I've learned that
You were wounded
My forest of glass
Caused enough damage
As has your teal satin crashing
My ambers and my blues
Could have another use
Your ghost has shown me
Our primroses
Could survive the frost
If a gentle rivulet of flame
Is sustained tenderly
He'll play a Beatles tune
Me, more a Bach fugue
Is this such a great divide
Between your world and mine?
They both can purify
And heal what was cut and bruised
Please leave me your ghost
I will keep him from harm
I understand that you've been wounded
My ambers and my blues
Could have another use
Please leave me your ghost
Just leave me your ghost
I will keep him warm
I will keep him warm
We don't know which way we're goin'
Don't know where we are
Find a way out, find a way
Home is somewhere I'm missin'
When I look around
Find a way out, find a way
Hell has no reason to smile
When you're living in an innocent world
You once had a heart like a child
Now it's buried under sadness and guilt
We don't know which way we're goin'
Don't know where we are
Find a way out, find a way
Home is somewhere I'm missin'
When I look around
Find a way out, find a way
Hell has no reason to smile
When you're living in an innocent world
You once had a heart like a child
Now it's buried under sadness and guilt
Don't run away
Don't run away
Don't run away now
Don't run away
Don't run away
Don't run away now (now, ooh ooh ooh...)
I am falling out of you
From heights
I never thought I knew
I am failing without you
In ways I always thought were new
Despite the knowing this is strange
Inside
I hope I'll never change
Shine
I'm trying to be brave
Bring me bring me
Bring the answers on in waves
Turn me on and watch me go
Straight and narrow
Nice and slow
Push me over see me spin
Watch me fight the fight the pull within
I am wasting without you
Broken pieces without glue
Why
Just as I think it's done
You're there
Darkening the sun?
Turn me on and watch me go
Straight and narrow
Nice and slow
Push me over see me spin
Watch me fight the fight the pull within
Turn me on and watch me go
Straight and narrow
Nice and slow
Push me over see me spin
Watch me fight the fight the laws within
Listen, listen.
I'm listening carefully
To where exactly you might be,
'Cause I've had enough waiting,
I've had enough waiting
For you.
I'm thinking, I'm thinking
Of growing old with someone
As beautiful as you.
Just ask me to.
Just ask me to.
You.
I'm recalling, recalling
Putting on jackets way too thin
To fight against snow way too thick,
And it coming down sideways,
And you clearing my eyes.
I've had a little too much to think.
I've had a little too much to think.
And empty rooms tend to make
Me believe in you.
Surrounded by everything, I am
Boxed and labeled, ready to go.
Not before time, not before time.
I'm listening, I'm listening.
Might have got that information anywhere
Let's not just talk about it please
If there's a chance, we'll make it anyhow
And that way saving me from grief
I'll let go
Baby I'm really worrying about you
For the first time now tonight
I see it's really hurting deep inside you
It sure feels funny but if it's so
I'll let go
Cause you been cheating and it hurt me more than you will ever know
And if it ain't positive vibrations, baby, than it'll have to go
Consider that the terrible silence
Feels better than it does when we talk
We cannot win
Let's not begin
My friends they talk about it and they said
- Oh no, man, can't believe that's true
They couldn't believe that shit about you
- It don't seem like the stuff she would do
Wait a minute baby, listen up now
I've been mistreated, I can mistreat too
Yeah I Know
Howling in remembrance, an animal has died
I'm hollowed out but resonant, a void is amplified
And abandoned, shy
My animus was lost, I found when I looked back in time
I can see the where and how, but I don't know the why
Or if it's right to try
The best advice I ever had was leave what was behind
But did I see some value there, or am I going blind?
Is it all in my mind?
Like when you want it easy and you've got an uphill climb
Why would give power to the ones who robbed you blind
Yet another time?
You've got a choice, it's the toro or the toreador
Your brides are not all as weak as what you take them for
This mean arena is all the things it seems and more
Well, that final day will come, it comes to everyone
The accidents of birth can make it hard to speak one's mind
But I believe there's power here, just not that I can find
And I'm not aimed on dying
You're in a dance and you must maintain until it's done
You've got a chance to retake a bit of innocence
You didn't choose to commit, but you're committed
So put some passion in the play, because we all go anyway
Trying to find a fact to frame a fully righteous fire
Everyone wants body counts and I just want to cry
Is it alright?

Program director on the radio won't play no music until the caller tell him so
This chest is full of memories
Of gold and silver tears
I'll give you more to own than all of this
And I'll give you more than years
For you were once a child of innocence
And I see you just the same
Your burdens couldn't win or lose a thing
Oh, I'd tell you once again
But you're always on the run
Slow your breath down, just take it slow
Find your heart now
You can trust and love again
Slow your breath down, just take it slow
Find your smile now
You can trust and love again
If you leave I'll still be close to you
When all your fears rain down
I'll take you back a thousand times again
And I'll take you as my own
I would sing you songs of innocence
Till the light of morning comes
Till the rays of gold and honey cover you
In the sweetness of the dawn
But you're always on the run
Slow your breath down, just take it slow
Find your heart now
You can trust and love again
Slow your breath down, just take it slow
Find your smile now
You can trust and love again
You're not alone
(Slow your breath down, just take it slow)
You're now a part of me
(Find your heart now)
You feel the cure
(You can trust and love again)
I'll feel the toil it brought you
You're not alone
(Slow your breath down, just take it slow)
You're now a part of me

You feel the cure

I'll feel the toil it brought you
You're not alone

You feel the cure
(You can trust and love again)
I'll feel the toil it brought you
I get high on you baby
And I don't think we should wait (2x)
Every little day
Every other little day
You take my breath away in
Every little way
Every other little way
It feels so good and
I get high on you baby
And I don't think we should wait (2x)
Every little night
Every other little night
I dream of you and
Every little time
Every other little time
It feels so good and
I get high on you baby
So I don't think we should wait (2x)
No I don't think we should wait (2x)
I get high on you baby
So I don't think we should wait (2x)
No I don't think we should wait
You brighten up the moon and the stars at night
You keep me seeing rainbows in the sky
You bring new meaning to my life now
I believe in miracles baby I'm forever yours, yours
Tender love's what you're giving me and
You've surpass all my fantasies and
I keep thanking the Lord above for
Blessing me with oh so much
'Cause I know how it feels to be
Part of you boy
Everyday my life's so abundant
With joy
And I honestly never thought love
Could be real
Until the angels guided you to me
You brighten up the moon and the stars at night
You keep me seeing rainbows in the sky
You bring new meaning to my life now
I believe in miracles baby I'm forever yours, yours
Lying with you so natural, I
Never knew this was possible
And it finally feels like my life has begun
Now that I can share it with someone
You brighten up the moon and the stars at night
You keep me seeing rainbows in the sky
You bring new meaning to my life now
I believe in miracles baby I'm forever yours, yours
You brighten up the moon and the stars at night
You keep me seeing rainbows in the sky
You bring new meaning to my life and now
I believe in miracles baby I'm forever yours, yours
Baby our love will always persevere
Anything you ever need,
You know I'll be right here and
You don't have to worry boy
I won't betray your trust because I'm
So much in love (so much in love)
Every time your lips meet mine
It still feels like the first time
And if you lost everything
I'd keep standing by your side
And boy it seems like everyday
I fall deeper in love because I
Can't get enough
You brighten up the moon and the stars at night
You keep me seeing rainbows in the sky
You bring new meaning to my life now

Everything that you do's so amazing

Everything that you do's so amazing
Everything that you do's so amazing to me
Boy
You brighten up the moon and the stars at night
You keep me seeing rainbows in the sky
You bring new meaning to my life now
I believe in miracles baby I'm forever yours, yours
You brighten up the moon and the stars at night
You keep me seeing rainbows in the sky
You bring new meaning to my life now
I believe in miracles baby I'm forever yours, yours
La da da da da
La da da da d
Baby I believe in miracles because I'm baby I'm forever yours, yours.
I believe in miricles baby I'm forever yours.
I've been rued enough for the both of us
I hope that I haven't said too much lately, ooh lately
You laugh and listen to my mind
Underneath the lights of the city sky, baby, ooh baby
When laughing is gone my way
You're still beside me
When it all fall into places
Just remind me
Either way it's fine with me
You make it look so easy
We got all the time we need
Either way it's fine with me
You make it look so easy
You make it look so good
All these pictures hanging in the room
And things I thought I'd never do, baby, ooh baby
And I second guess what you don't doubt
And somehow it just don't works out lately, ooh lately
When laughing is gone my way
You're still beside me
When it all fall into places
Just remind me
Either way it's fine with me
You make it look so easy
We got all the time we need
Either way it's fine with me
You make it look so easy
You make it look so good
My life gets brighter by the day
From loving you, shine
I don't think you even have to try
Either way it's fine with me
You make it look so easy
We got all the time we need
Either way it's fine with me
You make it look so easy, baby
You make it look so good
Either way it's fine with me
You make it look so easy
We got all the time we need
Either way it's fine with me
You make it look so easy, baby, babe
You make it look so good
Here we are at last
The moment soon will pass
We'll go our separate ways
We'll vanish in the haze
We'll never be the same
We'll forget each other's names
We'll grow old and lose our hair
It's all downhill from there
But tonight we'll reach for the stars
We'll rent expensive cars
And dream our dreams
Of a perfect night
And we'll sing our prom theme
Here we are at last
We're running out of gas
The air is getting thick
The girls are feeling sick
We'll pass out on the beach
Our keys just out of reach
Soon we'll say good bye
Then we'll work until we die
But tonight we feel like stars
We'll play our air guitars
'Cause we're 18
It's a perfect night
To sing our prom theme
A spotlight's shining brightly
On my face
And I can't see a thing
And yet I feel you, looking my way
An empty stage
With nothing but this girl
Who's singing this simple melody
And wearing her heart on her sleeve
And right now...
I have you
For a moment I can tell I've got you
Cause your lips don't move
And something is happening
Cause your eyes tell me the truth
I've put a spell over you.
Beauty emanates from every word that you say
And capture the deepest thoughts
In the purest and simplest of ways
But you see
I'm not that graceful like you
Nor am I as eloquent
But just a simple melody
Can change the way that you see me
And right now...
I have you
For a moment I can tell I've got you
Cause your lips don't move
And something is happening
Cause your eyes tell me the truth
I've put a spell over you...
All my life I stumble
But up here I am just perfect
Perfect as I'll ever be...
Air on the streets, lights on the trees
Eight days a week, singer's disease
I wanna be where the sun meets the sky
I wanna be there, it's out of your mind
And I believe in the secrets you're keeping
I wanna piece of the air when I breathe in
I wanna be the gold underneath the stream
Having my moment, you know what I mean
Ooh, it's a blue sky
And the headlights, and the headlines
It's a new day, for a new wave
It's a perfect moment, oh
I'm moving out, for a moment in The Springs
Out of my way, Berlin to L.A.
I wanna stay here and never go home again
I wanna be the grass underneath your feet
I wanna be the shops on your high street
And I believe in the secrets you're keeping
I wanna be your alarm when you sleep in
I wanna be the one you can be around
I wanna be the one who can make you proud
Ooh, it's a blue sky
And the headlights, and the headlines
It's a new day, for a new wave
It's a perfect moment, oh
I'm moving out, for a moment in The Springs
Get a voice, don't get a doctor
That's your choice, no one can stop you
I wanna be the one you can be around
I wanna be the one who can make you proud
Got a job, I don't got no pension
In it for love - money's too tight to mention
I wanna be in the rockin'est city
I wanna do what I want if it kills me
Have to say, your home's where you make it
It's OK, I know when you fake it
I wanna be the gum on your train seat
I wanna stand up and walk on my own feet
I wanna be the one you can be around
I wanna be the rock underneath your ground
I wanna be the one who can make you proud
I wanna be the one you can be around
I wanna be the one you can be around
This ain't no place for a man of faith
I gamble it all away, tumble into fall abased and ablaze
Can't fault or blame fam, they parade arrays of aid and praise
Saints patronized by the razor blade
Dismayed and fazed and maybe I assay the prize
Stay alive or prepared - scared ain't no way to die
Though if my ache could be assuaged by sin
I'll make it bleed fate, racing to the gate pleading "take me in," I'm
Down, unable to prevail unassisted
Will the tempest hail another victim in cyclical rhythm? Please
Break it, 'cause honestly the lie "I try tirelessly" is cowardice
Powerless am I to fight this avarice, I'm
Down, to give over control, the soul's solely yours
Deal and dispose, but keep it real close and don't
Break it, 'cause they gon' take it hard if I don't make it through
And some are reaching for reason to hate you.
Time and time again I've been told
That I focus on the flaws of man's off-center ten-fold
Stricken with the winter cold, sippin' the burnin' hot
A spill will blister, learn not to leave skin exposed
Stitch it up and pray the kid recover nicely
And I might have if not for daddy's bad advice
He's the type to fight God but not a vice
Grip the heater twice as hard - it's this reality I battle nightly
Even in sleep it seems flight's unattainable
Upon waking the facial expression deigns a satiable exchange
Weather shades drawn, either side a storm rages on
Patiently the fawn awaits the day the rain's gone
In my defense I claim it's obvious I'm not him
Probably it's the toxin - sorry it's a lot been unresolved
Sick since six, seen 'em revolve around a small town
'Click,' call it quits - bring all them walls
Down, finally I'mma defeat the rival
With a rifle, writing my epistle titled "try cycle," I
Break it, so never they perpetuate the malady
Abashedly accommodate mortality, undoubtedly I'm
Down, to reconsider, I'll stay if you can make a promise though
Please keep it real close and don't
Break it,
I'm warning, not strong enough to take it now
And I'm investigating other ways out
Will rebuilds what the bottle destroyed
I'm downhill standing still at the bottom of Roy
Where the pass over I-5 looks alive much as anything
Cling to the side and any sign of your memory
My creative liberty is tempting me to hasten to the point of penance
We could be rejoined if you employ forgiveness
Sell it all, tell 'em hell is nothing but a cell wall
I'mma soar even as the shell... fall...
Down, shed not a tear for my exodus
I'm here in the protectorate, the fear I held was delicate, to
Break it, simply took a leap of faith and virtue
Serve through, I never meant to hurt you, for certain I'll be
Down, to revisit the dearest of my kinfolk
Hold the spirit near, keep it real close and don't
Break it, the creed is all we got until we meet again
I'm prayin' you're gon' make it through the season.
The siren sings a lonely song
Of all the wants and hungers
The lust of love, a brute desire
The ledge of life goes under
Divide the dream into the flesh
Kaleidoscope and candle eyes
Empty winds scrape on the soul
But never stop to realize
Animal whisperings
Intoxicate the night
Hypnotize the desperate
Slow motion light
Wash away into the rain
Blood, milk and sky
Hollow moons illuminate
And beauty never dies
Running wild, running blind
I breathe the body deep
1,000 years beside myself
I do not sleep
Seduce the world it never screams
Dead water lies
Ride the only one who knows
Beauty never dies
I know, I know, I know
That you're not happy here
You don't need to say it
It shows, it shows, it shows,
It's all over your face
You can't erase it, no
I wish that we could face
The things that hold us back
Before we fade to black
Instead we choose to chase
The things we know won't last
They'll never last
But something keeps me hanging on
Yeah some feelings they never go
So, look up
And if the stars should fall from the sky
I will put them all back in time
So you know that when they shine
They shine for you
Oh oh oh yes they do, they do, they do
Those words that we don't say
They make the biggest sounds
They call us out (call us out)
'Cause there are quiet truths in pain
And we both feel them now
But still we love somehow, oh
I wish that we could face
The things that hold us back
Before we fade to black
Instead we choose to chase
The things we know won't last
They'll never last
But something keeps me hanging on (something keeps me hanging on)
Yeah some feelings just never go
So, look up
And if the stars should fall from the sky
I will put them all back in time
So you know that when they shine
They shine for you
Oh oh oh yes they do, they do, believe me
I love you in my way
Ooh what more can I say
It's constant as the stars
Although we're lost in space
So if separate ways we go
I hope somehow you'll know
Whatever circumstance
You will be in my soul (you'll be in my soul, in my soul)
In my soul
And if the stars should fall from the sky
I will put them all back in time
So you know that when they shine
They shine for you
Oh oh oh yes they do
After it's all been said
The music spinning in our head
Can't forget the feeling of
The magic of that summer in love
Ooh, I wanna take you there
Do you wanna turn back the pages?
Memories and photographs
The world has changed
And yet the game
Is still the same
Isn't it time we danced the night away?
How about doing it just like yesterday?
Every time I think of you
And all of those things we used to do
Remember those nights we spent, just you and I
Little did we know how the time would fly
Isn't it time?
Oh, isn't it time? Woah
The good times never have to end
And now's the time to let them happen again
We can have ourselves a blast
The good times, they aren't only in the past
Isn't it time we danced the night away?
How about doing it just like yesterday?
Every time I think of you
And all of those things we used to do
Remember those nights we spent, just you and I
Little did we know how the time would fly
Isn't it time?
Oh, isn't it time?
And as the sun goes down
We raise a glass to kindness
To all the good times we shared
Isn't it time we get ready again?
Isn't it time we go steady again?
Isn't it time we danced the night away?
How about doing it just like yesterday?
Every time I think of you
And all of those things we used to do
Remember those nights we spent, just you and I
Little did we know how the time would fly
Isn't it time?
Oh, isn't it time?
Isn't it time we danced the night away?
How about doing it just like yesterday?
Every time I think of you
And all of those things we used to do
Remember those nights we spent, just you and I
Little did we know how the time would fly
Isn't it time?
Even then I must have known 
Felt the stretch of skin on bone 
As then 
I stared 
For too long at my own 
On reflection
Only when my hands went numb 
Failing cells of each begun 
To touch 
And spin 
Like lines around the sun 
On reflection
So tonight I sit and wait 
Hear the sounds of life grow late 
And look 
Through the ice 
Of an ever older me 
On reflection
"Sorry"
Is all that you can't say
Years gone by and still
Words don't come easily
Like "sorry" (like "sorry", like "sorry")
"Forgive me"
Is all that you can't say
Years gone by and still
Words don't come easily
Like "forgive me" ("forgive me") Forgive me
But you can say, baby
Baby, can I hold you tonight?
Baby, if I told you the right words
Ooh, at the right time
You'll be mine
"I love you"
Is all that you can't say
Years gone by and still
Words don't come easily
(Words don't come easily)
Like "I love you", "I love you"
But you can say, baby
Baby, can I hold you tonight?
Baby, if I told you the right words
Ooh, at the right time
You'll be mine
(Baby, can I hold you)
But you can say, baby
Baby, can I hold you tonight?
Baby, if I told you the right words
Ooh, at the right time
You'll be mine
(Baby, if I told you)
(Baby, can I hold you) You'll be mine
(Baby, if I told you)
(Baby, can I hold you) You'll be mine
(Baby, if I told you)
Baby, can I hold you
It's terrific how the day after day hurts
'Cause someday I'll believe you
One day I could breath
It's terrific how the day after day hurts
'Cause someday I'll believe you
Once more
It's terrific hate you day after day more
'Cause someday I'll believe you
One day I could breath
It's terrific hate you day after day more
'Cause someday I'll believe you
One day if I could breath
Just without the same
It's time to wake up
Leave you here but
I am not to blame
It's terrific how was the day after day worse
And someday I had lost you
And someday I can't breathe
It's terrific how was the day after day worse
And someday I had lost you
Once more
Once more I can't breathe
Just without the same
It's time to wake up
Leave you here but
I am not to blame
I can't breathe
Just without the same
It's time to wake up
Leave you here but
I am not to blame
It's time to wake up
Leave you here
It's time to wake up
Leave you here but
I am not to... blame

In my dreams
I can kill you
Close to me
You open the cage and he sets you free
Come to me
We run away forever from this misery
Lost my mind
Are you calling me
Killing time that I left behind
Everything changes to a point that it stops and it turns around
I'm always falling down
Killing time that I left behind
Everything changes to a point that it stops and it turns around
It's coming for you now
So how can it be
The color of the world had turned dark for me
Falling free
Losing my reflection and my clarity
Talk to me
I feel the sickness taking over me
Let me be
Imagining that you are here with me
Killing time that I left behind
Everything changes to a point that it stops and it turns around
I'm always falling down
Killing time that I left behind
Everything changes to a point that it stops and it turns around
It's coming for you now
Pancho don't you like me no more
Pancho to me our friendship means more
Pancho please forget what I said
'Cause Pancho were headin' towards our end
I remember the first time when you came to town
Speaking in Spanish making the rounds
When you first saw me ypour face was agrin
And you called me the Cisco kid
I said someday you'll be happy with me Pancho
I remember the good times when you loved me so
I gave you my hat and wore your sombrero
And all of the times you saved me from death
Oh Pancho you were the best
I had a black horse you had a grey
My horse was fastest but yours di okay
When it came to chasin' rustlers we'd always win
'Cause we were Pancho and the Cisco kid
Oh Pancho we're headin' towards our end
In the crazy world
Anything can happen
If you will it to
I'm just a hazy girl
Blurring all the edges
Only seeing blue
It's a wild hope
A wild hope
A wild hope
Everything will be alright
Lost inside
A painting of a city on a hotel wall
Days goes by
Wasting golden hours in the fall
It's a wild hope
A wild hope
A wild hope
Everything will be alright
I catch a glimpse of our reflection
Beside you I see myself
We are the season's new collection
We look like everybody else
Walk alone
Through the crowded streets into the fading grey
Here and gone
Like a decoration for the holiday
It's a wild hope
A wild hope
A wild hope
Everything will be alright
There is no such place, o yes I have seen it too
Just a little different from how you do,
A river winding blue among the dunes and a marble bed
A sun that doesn't set but settles. 
There is no such place.
If I lower mine to yours would you kiss me on the face?
If you're looking for an unmarked place,
There is no such place -
Blasted in appearance and a composite of fearful minutes
Frozen in the waking instant 
Longing, things I long for,
Peaceful nights, strangers at the door,
O come in, come in,
You've been here before. 
There is no such place, so perhaps we have a reason
For our long and falling face,
Above all it would be warm but we would keep our heads all 
Clear as Winter, storms would be a sight to make us shiver
But without the chill
Of thinking all is hither-thither - 
Longing, Things I long for,
Peaceful nights, strangers at the door,
O come in, come through the door,
You've been here before,
You've been here before 
There is no such place, o yes I have seen it too
Just a little different from how you do,
A house upon a hill with no windows
Just a can upon the sill
To catch your tears
To feed your garden.
Oh tonight I will retire
To the arms of my lover
The sweetest kiss she will give
As I lay down beside her
What will she think
When she awakes
Just to find I have left here
Oh tonight I will retire
To these hands with revolver
And I don't fear death
I will commit 
Like an old friend I've known forever
So come on in, take me on
No I won't stay here no longer
And if I should taste fire
Save me not, I deserve to die
And oh tonight I will retire
To loving arms of my savior
And we will walk through his gates
To the skies of Heaven
And no more tears will I cry
Are my sins, are they forgiven
And if I should taste fire
Save me not, I deserve to die
And if I should taste fire
Save me not, I deserve to die

Oh, but all I know, is all I know
It's the disco infiltrator for sure
But all I see, is all I see
But still you want it, oh
Stop, you can't believe, what you believe
Or the disco infiltrator will leave
Oh, stupid me, oh, stupid me
But still we want it, oh
Stop, we can't shake the waist
Oh, stop, you've got to shake the waist
Stop, what you've been told is what you're told
It's the disco infiltrator gone cold
Oh, stupid you, I bet' told the truth
But you don't want it, no
Stop, you make me frown your little town
You run the disco infiltrator on down
Oh, stupid you, oh, stupid me
And we deserve it, oh
Stop, you can shake the waist
Oh, stop, you've got to shake the waist
Bear in mind, we all fall behind
From time to time
Bear in mind, we all fall behind
From time to time
Oh, but all I know, is all I know
It's the disco infiltrator for sure
But all I see, is all I see
But still you want it, oh
Stop, you can't believe what you believe
Or the disco infiltrator will leave
Oh, stupid me, oh, stupid me
Oh, but still we want it, oh

Stop, you can't shake your waist
Oh, don't stop, you've got to shake your waist

I make a date for golf
And you can bet your life it rains
My flat warming got started
But the btch next door complained
It seems ill spend my whole life
Catching colds and missing trains
I waited in the rain
For a blind date who never showed
Then a 4x4 drenched my jeans as I tried to cross the road
Got back to the car in time to watch it being towed
Everything haoppens to me
At first I thought you might break this jinx for me
Youi love would bring an end to my despair
That would have been so cool
Not how its meant to be
Instead you vanished into thin air
I've emailed and I've phoned
Sent a text meassge or two
You told me to piss off and for that respect is due
I fell in love just once
Did it have to be with you?
Living souls around me
They don't see
Just staring, closed faces
Fake a smile
Shaking hands shake their heads
But they don't speak
Only demanding the right numbers
Of me
Breaking into pieces
I'm breaking into pieces
My world is turning too fast
And I can't get off this spin
I'm moving somewhere I don't want
But all I do is fake a smile
It's so cold around me
I hurry to the next stop
I'm waiting for something
For someone
To steer me back to my life
Steer me back to my life
My world is turning too fast
And I can't get off this spin
I'm moving somewhere I don't want
But all I do is fake a smile
When will I break
When does the ice break
When will I dare to press rewind and start all over
This world is turning too fast
And I can't get off this spin
I'm moving somewhere I don't want
But all I do is fake a smile
This world is turning too fast
I'm moving somewhere
And fake a smile
You're the last of your kind, Mona Lisa
With a wink of your eye,
Ya make it all right
Oh there's more left to life, Mona Lisa
Let me take you along for the ride
Ain't nothin' that stays the same
Won't ask it a' you
Just that burgundy smile you wore yesterday
Say ya won't ever lose
I been down, I been worse
Mona Lisa
Came in last, came in first
But it all gathers dirt, Mona Lisa
'Fore ya bathe in the light
Ain't nothin' that stays the same
Won't ask it a' you
Just that burgundy smile you wore yesterday
Say ya won't ever lose
Oh ya taught me this much, Mona Lisa
I done set it aside
For when you need the same magic touch
For for when you need remindin'
Ain't nothin' that stays the same
Won't ask it a' you
Just that burgundy smile you wore yesterday
Say ya won't ever lose
Just that burgundy smile you wore yesterday
Say ya won't ever lose
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone,
It's not warm when she's away.
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone,
And she's always gone too long
Anytime she goes away.
Wonder, this time where she's gone,
Wonder if she's gonna stay
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone,
And this house just ain't no home,
Anytime she goes away.
And I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, hey I ought to leave the young thing alone,
But ain't no sunshine when she's gone,
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
Only darkness everyday.
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone,
And this house just ain't no home,
Anytime she goes away, Anytime she goes away,
Anytime she goes away, Anytime she goes away
Her skin was darker than ashes
And she had something to say
'Bout being naked to the elements
At the end of yet another day
And the rain on her back that continued to fall
From the bruise of her lips
Swollen, fragile and small
And the bills that you paid with were worth nothing at all
A lost foreign currency
Multi-coloured, barely reputable
Like the grasses that blew in the warm summer breeze
Well, she offered you this to do as you pleased
And where is the poetry?
Didn't she promise us poetry?
The redwoods, the deserts, the tropical ease
The swamps and the prairie dogs, the Joshua trees
The long straight highways from dirt road to tar
Hitching your wheels to truck, bus or car
And the lives that you hold in the palm of your hand
You toss them aside, small and damn near unbreakable
You drank all the water and you pissed yourself dry
Then you fell to your knees and proceeded to cry
And who could feel sorry for a drunkard like this
In a democracy of dunces with a parasite's kiss?
And where are the stars?
Didn't she promise us stars?
Nothing will ever be as it was
The price has been paid with a thousand loose shoes
Pictures are pasted on shop windows and walls
Like a poor man's Boltanski
Lost one and all
Sell, sell
Bid your farewell
Come, come
Save yourself
Give yourself over
Pushing your consciousness
Deep into every atom and cell
Sell
Bid your farewell
Come, come
Save yourself
Give yourself over
Pushing your consciousness
Deep into every atom and cell
Sell
Bid your farewell
Come, come
Save yourself
Give yourself over
Pushing your consciousness
Deep into every atom and cell
What a time it was
Was befriended and was a friend 
For the longest while
You were here
And I never knew you from the sun
Snow is on the ground
This is not my landscape now
Where I find myself
Without you
Oh I never knew you from the sun
Oh I had a friend 
I had a friend I loved
Now I walk for miles
Into dark forests of piano sounds
I'm lost
Deep into my sleeve 
Deep in my sleeves
Pockets start where I always reach
You are there
Oh I never knew you from the sun
Never, never knew you from the sun
Ore di care deum deo | Ore care deum

Open up
I once was sleeping
All remains are in safe keeping
Looks like everybody knows
I want to learn the secret my way
It's right behind me
So softly
Centered in a field
Hold to kill
I'm in the same rotation
Waiting on a clear reason
Why this is the wrong way out
It's right behind me
So softly
Lock down inside
More of you buys my time
I never knew this is the way it goes
Oh where you lay
Your head tonight
I'll roll away alone
And close on down
Take up your wings
And fly back out
And we'll pretend
Forget we're dead
Yeah, we'll lay it down
When we're all through
When we're killed or cured
And barely heard
Put Ariel on
And smoke away the night
And do the white net crawl
Until the hammers fall
I kept your poem here
With all my other gear
But in the end
I missed what it meant
Oh where you lay
Your head tonight
I'll roll away alone
And close on down
There she walks
Acts like she doesn't see me
She goes by the name
Peculiar
No one
Cannot understand her methods
For me she's the same
Peculiar
Peculiar
You seem to know my secrets
Peculiar
You don't even know my name
I take your hand
And I keep on wandering
You give me support
Peculiar
Bring books
Let's spend the night together
It's snowing again
Peculiar
Peculiar
You seem to know my secrets
Peculiar
You don't even know my name
Peculiar
You seem to know my secrets
Peculiar
You don't even know my name
I'm leaving what I made behind
I'll have to let it speak for itself
Just make sure that I'm remembered
Not for good or bad just not forgotten
If I could lift my arm I'd grab yours
If I could open my eyes I wouldn't do it
I'll never know what it's like to feel safe again
How can you not see me lying here?
How can you not respond?
If you could hear me you'd do something
At least give me a reason to let go
I remember what you wore on the first day
You came into my life
And I thought hey
You know this could be something
'Cause everything you do and words you say
You know that it all takes my breath away
And now I'm left with nothing
So maybe it's true, that I can't live without you
Well maybe two is better than one
But there's so much time, to figure out the rest of my life
And you've already got me coming undone
And I'm thinking two, is better than one
I remember every look upon your face,
The way you roll your eyes, the way you taste
You make it hard for breathing
'Cause when I close my eyes and drift away
I think of you and everything's okay
And finally now, believing
And maybe it's true, that I can't live without you
And maybe two is better than one
But there's so much time, to figure out the rest of my life
And you've already got me coming undone
And I'm thinking two, is better than one
I remember what you wore on the first day
You came into my life
And I got high
Maybe it's true, that I can't live without you
Maybe two is better than one
There's so much time, to figure out the rest of my life
And you've already got me coming undone
And I'm thinking ooh I can't live without you
'Cause baby two is better than one
There's so much time, to figure out the rest of my life
And I've figured out with all that's said and done
Two, is better than one
Two is better than one
schlaf ein, es ist vorbei.
es ist nur der Wind,
der dich wachen lässt
und nicht die Konsequenzen,
die du alleine ziehst
und Träume die du hast
in diesen schmutzigen Sekunden
zwischen dem Schlaf und Wach.
wo wirst du heute schlafen
und worüber denkst du nach
es war wundervoll als wir uns trafen
wie lange lagst du wach?
könntest du hier verweilen
kannst du bleiben wie du bist
das war dein Leben an das ich dachte
das wie du, süchtig nach mir ist.
wie wir schweigend durch die Strassen gehen
muss sich wundervoll anhören
wie dann die Worte verstummen
sich ohne Zärtlichkeit berühren
So

He wears his hat o'er his eyes
And he's trying to keep it on
Says he's sick of living his life
And he's tired of being alone
No one's job but mine
That ain't no one's job but mine
That ain't no one's job but mine
That ain't no one's job but mine
Got a new sleeping bag
Got no place to sleep it at
Left my dog on the ranch
But I'm trying to get her back
My job's simple
I just got to see
The stars for what they are
And they don't grant wishes
And they don't guide me
But they try
They try
Now I'm gonna try
To straighten up your life
Straighten up your life
Saw the sign of the times
Out on the freeway
It said "hey man, there goes the hood"
I said "that's fine, I was done trying to be good"
The next time I come by
I want to see this sky split
Want to know what's happening
Trade this hard heart for tears
Take a look in the mirror
Next time I'll try
Next time I'll try
Vou sair p'rá ver o céu
Vou me perder entre as estrelas
Ver d'aonde nasce o sol
Como se guiam os cometas
Pelo espaço
E os meus passos
Nunca mais serão iguais
Se for mais veloz que a luz
Então escapo da tristeza
Deixo toda dor p'rá trás
Perdida num planeta abandonado
No espaço
E volto sem olhar p'rá trás
No escuro do céu
Mais longe que o sol
Perdido num planeta abandonado
No espaço
Ele ganhou dinheiro
Ele assinou contratos
E comprou um terno
Trocou o carro
E desaprendeu
A caminhar no céu
E foi o princípio do fim

And thanks for branding me a failure
And for destroying what joy I had
The mantles cracked
And turning black
I found out I'm not the man
That I fucking think I am
And you're just like a fucking ghostie
You trouble me when I try to sleep
The sombre way
You held your face
And we can never erase
All the stupid things we say
And I hope that you're dreaming of me
The way I'm forced to dream of you
And so you've won
I'll get the gun
'Cause we can never undo
All the stupid things we've done
Gone forever, the writing on the wall
They've boarded-up the cinema
Strawberry dreams and the dust-filled beams
Shut down in a modern town
See you walking, see you talking
Recollection on streets you used to know
Forgotten pleasure smoulder
Images fade but the town won't let them go
Sleepwalking, see you talking
Feel the city inside you
(Ooh) leave this city behind you
Drive wherever the roads will take you to
Down beside a river frozen brown
January days and their scarecrow trees
So cold - feel your ears burn
See you walking, see you talking
Feel the city inside you
(Ooh) leave this city behind you
Past and present
They converge on every side
The wires all get tangled
When now and then collide
Bittersweet taste of a time and another place before
Sleep walking, see you talking
Feel the city inside you
(Ooh) feel this city define you
(Yeah) leave this city behind you
I tiptoe across the squeaky floor
Check to see who's around first
No one should see this
I wrap my hands around his head
Steady myself for the kiss
No one should see this
I close my eyes and feel the stress
And press my lips onto his
No one seems to like this
I open my eyes in horror
To see what I've done
It was the wrong guy
He was the wrong guy
I tiptoe across the squeaky floor
Check to see who's around first
No one should see this
I wrap my hands around his neck
Steady myself for the kiss
No one should see this
I close my eyes and feel the stress
And press my lips onto his
No one seems to like this
I open my eyes in horror
To see what I've done
It was the wrong guy
He was the wrong guy
Like a pendulum
The Earth swings
Measured time
Held on strings
I'm not a cure
I'm just the hope
There in light
We can cope (did you know)
Like a fever
Burning inside
Time passed slow
It's your time
I'm not a cure
One of the few
Winter drives
The sky blue
Tiger in the sea
And the foundation's breaking down
Will you rise or fall?
You don't control
Caught away in clouds
And the foundation's breaking down
Will you rise or fall?
You won't control
I wish I Knew...
A call for penance
Cracks in the hands of a stranger
Rescue me to come back
A call for deliverance
Ghosts in the air that we breath
Watching our every last word
Whisper
Whisper
So what should I do
About a boy
Who won't listen
Erase
Erase us
Erase this world
A call for penance
Crack in the hands of a stranger
Are calling me home
Sheer disobedience
Simply a lack of love
I'm warming up
To come home
To come home
So what should I do
About a boy
Who won't listen
So anxious to find
Any other way
But won't listen, no
Erase
Erase us
Erase this world
Erase
Erase us
Erase this world

What if we were meant to be together
What if you were meant to be the one
I could hide a million years and try to believe
That any time the girl in mind will come and rescue me
'Cause you're the fire, you're the one
But you will never see the sun
If you don't know, you're right next to the right one
I could call it many names
But it's myself I need to blame
If you don't know, you're right next to the right one
In the end you've got a friend for lifetime (mhmh)
Truly there to truly care for you
I know you cry a million tears so I want you to know
That a pretty face can take you places, you don't wanna go
'Cause you're the fire, you're the one
But you will never see the sun
If you don't know, you're right next to the right one
And I could call it many names
But it's myself I need to blame
If you don't know, you're right next to the right one now
So in the end it all depends on whether you'll find
Warm embraces when I replace the one you had in mind...
'Cause you're the fire, you're the one
But you will never see the sun
If you don't know, you're right next to the right one
I could call it many names
But it's myself I need to blame
If you don't know, you're right next to the right one 
Yeah (ohoh..)
You're right next ti the right one
I could call it many names
But it's myself I need to blame, if you don't know
You right next to the right one
Right next to the right one
J'ai laissé ouverte mes persiennes
Les voies ressemblaient à la sienne
J'ai cru mille fois qu'il revenait
Et j'ai laissé passer l'été
J'ai laissé passer l'été
J'ai voulu retrouver son corps
Et je l'ai eu sans un effort
J'ai foutu ma vie en guerre
Et j'ai laissé filler l'hiver
J'ai laissé filler l'hiver
Personne à l'horizon
Personne sous mon balcon
L'espoir fait mourir parfois
Vois-tu ce qu'il a fait de moi
Vois-tu ce qu'il a fait de moi
J'suis restée prostrée dans le noir
J'ai chialé pour qu'il vienne me voir
J'ai été jusqu'à faire l'aumône
Et j'ai laissé mourir l'automne
J'ai laissé mourir l'automne
Ma douleur crevait les cieux
Je n'ai plus voulu croire en Dieu
Point de héros ni prince charmant
J'ai laissé pleurer le printemps
Laissé pleurer le printemps
Personne à l'horizon
Personne sous mon balcon
L'espoir fait mourir parfois
Vois-tu ce qu'il a fait de moi
J'ai laissé ouverte mes persiennes
Mes voies ressemblaient à la sienne
J'ai cru mille fois qu'il revenait
Et j'ai laissé passer l'été
J'ai laissé passer l'été
J'ai voulu retrouver son corps
Et je l'ai eu sans un effort
J'ai foutu ma vie en l'air
Et j'ai laissé filler l'hiver
J'ai laissé filler l'hiver
Personne à l'horizon
Personne sous mon balcon

Slow down 
There's gonna be trouble 
You're gonna forget 
What you're doing 
One false move, baby 
Suddenly everything's ruined 
Hold on 
You're gonna be sorry 
You're gonna regret 
What you're doing 
One false move, baby 
Suddenly everything's ruined 
And you ought to know 
You ought to know 
There's only one way this can go 
You ought to know 
You ought to know 
All of the ups and downs, the highs and lows 
Slow down 
There's gonna be trouble 
You're gonna forget 
What you're doing 
One false move, baby 
Suddenly everything's ruined 
One false move, baby 
Suddenly everything's ruined
I think of you
Whenever I'm alone
Whenever I get lonely
I think of you
Wherever you may go
I know that you are only one dream away
So don't give up
Baby, don't give in
If we try, we can begin again
I know what we've been through
But I still think of you
I think of you
Whenever I get down
Whenever I get dreary
I think of you
When you're not around
I wonder if you hear me
Call out your name
So don't give up
Baby, don't give in
If we try, we can begin again
I know what we've been through
But I still think of you
I think of you
Whenever I'm alone
Whenever I get lonely
I think of you
Whenever I get down
Whenever I get weary
I think of you
Whenever I'm alone
Whenever I get lonely
I think of you
Instrumental
Where Lagan stream sing lullaby
There blows a lily fair
When twilight gleam is in her eyes
The night is on her hair
And like a love-sick lenanshee
She hath my heart in thrall
No life have I, no liberty
With love is lord of all
And sometimes when the beetles horn
Hath lulled the eve to sleep
I steal unto her shieling low
And through her dooreen peep
There on the cricket's singing stone
She stirs the bog wood fire
And hums in soft sweet undertones
The song of heart's desire
Her welcome like her love for me
Is from her heart within
Her warm kiss is felicity
That knows no taint of sin
Siamese, Portuguese, dirty knees, look at these
Rookies around us, aren't you glad you found us?
Now if you are who you say you are, get up here to the bar
We'll plot out a plan to take down the man
We'll start with that new future superstore and steal all their
Decorative rocks, we'll fight all their rent-a-cops
And for the freeway maintainers who assist our escape
We got sandwiches, chips and cold Gatorade
We'll expose all the bicyclists who really are
DUI students who can't drive their cars
And we'll take stucco dust and wet drywall sludge
Combine 'em just right to make fuck the valley fudge
Apple bee's, Chuck E. Cheese, dirty deeds
Don't you see? 'Fuck the valley' fudge, it's my hate, my love
Nepalese, antifreeze, calories, can't you see?
'Fuck the valley' fudge, it's my hate and my love
'Fuck the valley' fudge, it's my hate and my love
'Fuck the valley' fudge, my hate, my love
'Fuck the valley' fudge
'Fuck the valley'
Fuck
No one told me
The right way
The right way to go about this
So I'll figure it out for myself
'Cause how much
Is too much
To give you
Well I may never know
So I'll just give until there's nothing else
Yeah I'll give give give (until there's nothing else)
Give my life (until it all runs out)
Give give (and I'll have no regrets)
I'll give until there's nothing left
I'll give
No one told me
How bad I need you (need you)
But I somehow arrived
To that conclusion all by myself (all by myself)
And I want
All you have to offer (to offer)
So I offer myself and I'll just give until there's nothing else
And I'll give give give (until there's nothing else)
Give my life (until it all runs out)
Give give (and I'll have no regrets)
I'll give until there's nothing left to
Give give give (until there's nothing else)
Give my life (until it all runs out)
Give give (and I'll have no regrets)
I'll give until there's nothing left
Sometimes I think
Like all I ever do
Is ask for things
Until I ask too much of you
But that's not the way (that's not the way)
I wanna live (I wanna live)
I need to change (I need to change)
But something's got to give
Yeah something's got to
Give give give (until there's nothing left)
Give my life (until it all runs out)
Give give (and I'll have no regrets)
I'll give until there's nothing left to give
Give give give (until there's nothing left)
Give my life (until it all runs out)
Give give
Give until there's nothing left
I'll give
Wouldn't be the first time love made a fool of me
Wouldn't even care but now you're here to see
It comes as no surprise
Just leave the light on
What I wouldn't give if you could have it all
The sun that's going down the bed that breaks the fall
The cradle and the bow
So you can take comfort now
You can take comfort now...
Sometimes a heart can break and make its own relief
The way a cold dark night invites the fire thief
He wants to show us how
So we can take comfort now
We can take comfort now
We can take comfort now
Leave the light on...
I wanted my life's work
To be like an ever-growing forest
So vast that you could lose your way in it
But this branch is all I have to show
It's withering and untended
There is nowhere it can take you that
You haven't been before
And you left it at your door
Oh my God, look around this place
Your fingers reach around the bone
You set the break and set the tone
Flights of grace, and future falls
In present pain
All fools say, "Oh my God"
Oh my God, why are we so afraid?
We make it worse when we don't bleed
There is no cure for our disease
Turn a phrase and rise again
Or fake your death and only tell your closest friends
Oh My God
Oh my God, can I complain?
You take away my firm belief
And graft my soul upon Your grief
Weddings, boats and alibis
All drift away and a mother cries
Liars and fools, sons and failures
Thieves will always say
Lost and found, ailing wanderers
Healers always say
Whores and angels, men with problems
Leavers always say
Broken hearted, separated
Orphans always say
War creators, racial haters
Preachers always say
Distant fathers, fallen warriors
Givers always say
Pilgrim saints, lonely widows
Users always say
Fearful mothers, watchful doubters
Saviors always say
Sometimes I cannot forgive
And these days mercy cuts so deep
If the world was how it should be
Maybe I could get some sleep
While I lay, I dream we're better
Scales were gone and faces lighter
When we wake, we hate our brother
We still move to hurt each other
Sometimes I can close my eyes
And all the fear that keeps me silent
Falls below my heavy breathing
What makes me so badly bent?
We all have a chance to murder
We all feel the need for wonder
We still want to be reminded
That the pain is worth the thunder
Sometimes when I lose my grip
I wonder what to make of Heaven
All the times I thought to reach up
All the times I had to give
Babies underneath their beds
Hospitals that cannot treat
All the wounds that money causes
All the comforts of cathedrals
All the cries of thirsty children
This is our inheritance,
All the rage of watching mothers
This is our greatest offense
Oh my God
Oh my God
Oh my God
Fixement, le ciel se tord
Quand la bouche engendre un mort
Là je donnerai ma vie pour t'entendre
Te dire les mots les plus tendres
When all becomes all alone
I'll break my life for a song
And two lives that stoop to notice mine
I know I will say goodbye
But a fraction of this life
I would give anything, anytime
L'univers a ses mystères
Les mots sont nos vies
You could kill a life with words
So, how would it feel
Si nos vies sont si fragiles
Words are mysteries
Les mots des sentiments
Les mots d'amour, un temple
If one swept the world away
One could touch the universe
I will tell you how the sun rose high,
We could, with a word, become one
Et pour tous ces mots qui blessent
Il y a ceux qui nous caressent
Qui illuminent, qui touchent l'infini
Même si le néant existe
For a fraction of this life,
I will give anything, anytime
L'univers a ses mystères
Les mots sont nos vies
We could kill a life with words
So, how would it feel
Si nos vies sont si fragiles
Words are mysteries
Les mots des sentiments
Les mots d'amour, un temple
Something in the way she moves
Attracts me like no other lover
Something in the way she moves me
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe in how
Something in the way she smiles
And all I have to do is think of her
Something in the way she smiles for me
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe in how
You're asking me will my love grow
I don't know, oh I don't know
Just stick around and it may show
I don't know, oh I don't know
(Something in the way she moves) Whoa, in the way she moves
(Attracts me like no other lover) Don't need no other lover
(Something in the way she moves) Oh, you know I need her all the time
(I don't want to leave her now)
(You know I believe in how) You know I believe
You're asking me will my love grow
I don't know, hey I don't know
Just stick around and it may show
I don't know, oh I don't know
Something in the way she moves
Attracts me like no other lover
Something in the way she woohs me
I don't want to leave her now
Well, you know I believe in how (ooh)
Deep in another dream
Thinking about you
Sailing through the city streets
Thinking about you
It's only been a little while
But I'm thinking about you
Can't hide another smile
I've been thinking about you
But I never look back (Never look back)
Never look over my shoulder
And I never react (Never react)
Can't go where I've gone before
No, I never look back (Never look back)
Now I've grown so much colder
And you're fading to black (Fading to black)
Like it's nothing at all
It's nothing at all
Deep in another dream
Thinking about you
Feels like the final scene
Thinking about you
Save it for a little while
Thinking about you
Time for another smile
I've been thinking about you
But I never look back (Never look back)
Never look over my shoulder
And I never react (Never react)
Can't go where I've gone before
No, I never look back (Never look back)
Now I've grown so much colder
And you're fading to black (Fading to black)
Like it's nothing at all
It's nothing at all
But I never look back (Never look back)
Never look over my shoulder
And I never react (Never react)
Can't go where I've gone before
No, I never look back (Never look back)
Now I've grown so much colder
And you're fading to black (Fading to black)
Like it's nothing at all
It's nothing at all (Thinking about you)
It's nothing at all
It's nothing at all (Thinking about you)
Thinking about you
I've lied to you
The same way that I always do
This is the last smile
That I'll fake for the sake of being with you
(Everything falls apart, even the people who never frown eventually break down)
The sacrifice of hiding in a lie
(Everything has to end, you'll soon find we're out of time left to watch it all unwind)
The sacrifice is never knowing
Why I never walked away
Why I played myself this way
Now I see your testing me
Pushes me away
Why I never walked away
Why I played myself this way
Now I see your testing me
Pushes me away
I've tried like you
To do everything you wanted to
This is the last time
I'll take the blame for the sake of being with you
(Everything falls apart, even the people who never frown eventually break down)
The sacrifice of hiding in a lie
(Everything has to end, you'll soon find we're out of time left to watch it all unwind)
The sacrifice is never knowing
Why I never walked away
Why I played myself this way
Now I see your testing me
Pushes me away
Why I never walked away
Why I played myself this way
Now I see your testing me
Pushes me away
(We're all out of time, this is how we find how it all unwinds)
The sacrifice of hiding in a lie
(We're all out of time, this is how we find how it all unwinds)
The sacrifice is never knowing
Why I never walked away
Why I played myself this way
Now I see your testing me 
Pushes me away
Why I never walked away
Why I played myself this way
Now I see your testing me 
Pushes me away
Pushes me away
Du sagst danke für einen schönen Tag.
Ich weiß du hast dich zu Hause gefühlt.
Da waren Menschen in den Häusern, in denen wir leiden.
Das ist das Schicksal von dir und mir.
Du weißt um die Welt, die du mir erschliesst.
Du weißt ich würde sterben für dich,
um dir ein gutes Leben zu garantieren...
Von Gott verbrüht und von den Menschen berührt,
die am Friedhof standen am Ende eines Lebens.
Von Gott berührt, von den Menschen verbrüht.
Und ich habe keine Angst zu fallen
während ich versuche zu stehen.
Das ist, wie ich mich fühle.
Ich verliere meine Antlitz.
Und wir fahren alle Straßen,
diesen langen Weg nach Hause.
Und wir kennen die Stellen,
an denen Sachen geschahen.
Wir kennen die Gerüche
und wir kennen die Gegenstände
und wir können spüren wie sie die Form verlieren.
Imagine a world without me
Say you're falling apart
Let's pretend you've missed me for a while
Wouldn't you say you were lonely
And love was breaking your heart?
Put on your Sunday best and fake a smile
I dream of dreaming dreams of her
In twilight she's a constant blur
The picture is clear
And I'm still fact, she's fiction
Remember the night you were with me
Fell asleep by my side
Strangers together, your hand in mind
How come we never came closer
When all the stars were aligned?
I thought we had a moment
I dream of dreaming dreams of her
In twilight she's a constant blur
The picture is clear
And I'm still fact she's fiction
I seem to miss the missing part
She's still my favorite work of art
The picture is clear
And I'm still fact, she's fiction
No, nothing has changed 'cause I'm still fact, she's fiction
Or I may be imperfectly formed in this contradiction
I dream of dreaming dreams of her
In twilight she's a constant blur
The picture is clear
'Cause I'm still fact she's fiction
I fell in love with her longing
Let's just say that she never found out
Who it was she never found in me
Someone will call, something will fall
And smash on the floor
Without reading the text, know what comes next
Seen it before
And it's painful
Things must change
We must rearrange them
Or we'll have to estrange them
All that I'm saying, a game's not worth playing
Over and over again
You're the one I like best, you retain my interest
You're the only one
If it wasn't for you, don't know what I'd do
Unpredictable like the sun
And the rainfall
Things must change
We must rearrange them
Or we'll have to estrange them
All that I'm saying, a game's not worth playing
Over and over again
Things must change
Are you late... It's always hate, troubles in your mind.
Take back the pain, we got the rain, don't know why.
Sweetness comes and goes and I'm always here to stay.
Reaching out and find that I'll never be late.
Sweet dogs, sweet rain, never come and go.
I'm oh so fine and ready to blow.
I'm oh so fine and ready to blow.
(She keeps on singing that)
Sweetness comes and goes and I'm always here to stay.
Sweetness comes and goes and I'm always here to stay.
(She keeps on singing that)
Sweet dogs, sweet rain, never come and go.
(She keeps on singing that)
I'm oh so fine and ready to blow.
Take back the line, go back - I'm sure.
Everytime I wan't more.
Take back the fruit, I'm here to rule.
All the time - I'm sure.
Sweet talk, back clap - oh baby.
It all make sense.
This is how you keep waiting and I don't know why.
(She keeps on singing that)
Sweetness comes and goes and I'm always here to stay.
Sweetness comes and goes and I'm always here to stay.
(She keeps on singing that)
Sweet dogs, sweet rain, never come and go.
(She keeps on singing that)
I'm oh so fine and ready to blow.
Always watch them with bright eyes.
Can't you see all is not right.
Always watch them with bright eyes.
Can't you see all is not right.
(She keeps on singing that)
Sweetness comes and goes and I'm always here to stay.
Reaching out and find that I'll never be late.
Sweet dogs, sweet rain, never come and go.
I'm oh so fine and ready to blow.
(She keeps on singing that)

Vaikka vasta kevät
S tuummuu
Pimeä
Lähellä maa mustuu
Harmaa sulkee silmät
Ilo laahaa jalkaa
Maa syttyy

Tuolla on kevät
Se ei heirää enää
Mustan rastas laulu
Raskas olalla
[English translation:]
Orphan Joy
Spring appears bent and unaware
Pastures blacken
Grey conquers eyes
Orphan joy
Mirth growing less
Spring at hand
Still won't wake
Fieldfares' song skirmishes
Take my heart with a grain of salt 
It's been broken but it's nobody's fault
I can't move lives
And I've paid the price
Many times over for everyone I know
I shouldn't be here 
Many miles away from everything that I hold dear
But life is fine
No matter how hard you fight
Now I'll have to go back to that place I know best
But I'm happy this time  
I know that 
This love's mine
I stuck around I played the hand I was dealt
I can only think one way and I only feel the way I felt
But you keep changing lanes 
Till it drove you insane
But we ended up pulling in around the same time keeps passin' me by
While I sit and wait for everything that I can find
But life is fine
No matter how hard you fight
Yea yea yea
Yea yea yea
Yea yea yea
Yea yea yea
Now I'll have to (yea yea yea)
Go back to that place (yea yea yea)
I know best (yea yea yea)
But I'm happy (yea yea yea)
This time (yea yea yea)
I know that (yea yea yea) 
This love's mine (yea yea yea)
I used to be afraid that I wouldn't find my love
But now I've found a way to end in my salvation
Flæddu ei svo greitt
þú gamla litla suð
Ég bleyti teikningar í þér
Flæddu ei svo greitt
þú gamla litla suð
Ég bleyti teikningar í þér
Flæddu ei svo greitt
þú litla fjalla suð
Ég bleyti teikningum af þér
Flæddu ey svo greitt
þú gamla fjalla suð
Ég bít í tunguna á þér
Now some of us are weak, and some endure
Some people live their lives with a violence that's pure and clean
But I saw man cry once, down on his knees
In a corner of a darkened cell, and his pain meant nothing to me
But I was younger then
Young men never die
And I walked out in the sun
I was strong, clear-minded and blind
Now don't say a prayer for anyone
It doesn't do any good
Please don't ask me a question
It'd just be misunderstood
And if you could step inside me you'd feel what hatred brings
And if you saw with my eyes you'd see what self-deception means
I was younger once and I created a lie
And though my body was strong
I was self-deluded, confident and blind
Now show some pity for the weak of will
Because when we're drinking we can never be filled
Show some understanding for the lonely fool
Because when I am drinking I am out of control
I was never young
Nothing has transpired
And when I look in the mirror I feel dead, I feel cold
I am blind
I am blind
I am blind
I am blind
And when the sun runs out
No doubts left standing
We'll see if Jah wills that we're alone again
Let love slip through our fingers I say
Live up, live up, live up
I wanna get up
Instead I give up
Sometimes life dictates what we hate
And when the sun runs out
No doubts left standing
Who knows if it'll go our way
And when the sun runs out
No doubts left standing
Isha Allah it'll be okay
And when the sun runs out
No doubts left standing
Would it be different if we knew we would win
Let love slip through our fingers I say
Live up, live up, live up
Sometimes
Even the season's change
All patterns rearrange
Lord, won't you grant me
New eyes, so I can see
What good are songs with no dances
I wanna live to live and take my chances
I wanna live today
Leave inhibitions in the wind
What good are songs with no dances, I pray
Lord, won't you grant me
Won't you grant me
Lord, won't you grant me

I had a very disturbing dream last night.
In this dream I found myself making love to a strange man.
Only I'm having trouble you see, because he's old... and dying...
And he smells bad, and I find him repulsive.
But then he tells me that everything is erotic, that everything is sexual. You know what I mean?
He tells me that even old flesh is erotic flesh.
That disease is the love of two alien kinds of creatures for each other.
That even dying is an act of eroticism.
That talking is sexual.
That breathing is sexual.
That even to physically exist is sexual.
And I believe him.
And we make love beautifully...
I want to be alone
I need to touch each stone
Face the grave that I have grown
I want to be alone
Before all the days are gone
And darker walls are bent and torn
To pass the time of those who mourn
I want to be alone
Rivers that run anywhere
Are in my hand and just up the stair
Past the eyes of those who care
Who can never be alone
Changes that were not meant to be
Tow the hours of my memory
Sing a song of love to me
To say you must never
Never be alone
The tears of a silent rain
Seek shelter on my broken pain
And run away
But I remain
To speak the words
That sing of alone
I want to be alone
I need to touch each stone
Face the grave that I have grown
I want to be alone
Pueden pasar tres mil años.
Puedes besar otros labios,
Pero nunca te olvidaré,
Pero nunca te olvidar.
Puedo morirme mañana.
Puede secarse mi alma,
Pero nunca te olvidaré,
Pero nunco te olvidaré.
Pueden borrar mi memoria.
Pueden robarme tu historia,
Pero nunca te olvidaré,
Pero nunca te olvidaré.
Cómo olvidar tu sonrisa.
Cómo olvidar tus miradas.
Cómo olvidar que rezaba
Para que no te marcharas.
Cómo olvidar tus locuras.
Cómo olvidar que volabas.
Cómo olvidar que aún te quiero
Más que a vivir, más que a nada.
Pueden pasar tres mil años.
Puedes besar otros labios,
Pero nunca te olvidaré,
Pero nunca te olvidaré.
Puede morirme mañana.
Puede secarse mi alma;
Pero nunca te olvidaré,
Pero nunca te olvidaré.
Puedes echarme de tu vida.
Puedes negar que me querías,
Pero nunca te olvidaré.
Sabes que nunca te olvidaré.
Cómo olvidar tu sonrisa.
Cómo olvidar tus miradas.
Cómo olvidar que rezaba
Para que no te marcharas.
Cómo olvidar tus locuras.
Cómo olvidar que volabas.
Cómo olvidar que aún te quiero
Más que vivir, más que a nada.
Pueden pasar tres mil años.
Puedes besar otros labios,
Pero nunca te olvidaré,
Pero nunca te olvidaré,
Pero nunca te olvidaré,
Pero nunca te olvidaré.
I'm all out of hope
One more bad break could bring a fall
When I'm far from home
Don't call me on the phone
To tell me you're alone
It's easy to deceive
It's easy to tease
But hard to get release
Les yeux sans visage eyes without a face
Les yeux sans visage eyes without a face
Les yeux sans visage eyes without a face
Got no human grace your eyes without a face
Yeah
I spend so much time
Believing all the lies
To keep the dream alive
Now it makes me sad
It makes me mad at truth
For lovin' what was you
Les yeux sans visage eyes without a face
Les yeux sans visage eyes without a face
Les yeux sans visage your eyes without a face
Got no human grace your eyes without a face
Les yeux sans visage eyes without a face
Les yeux sans visage eyes without a face
Les yeux sans visage your eyes without a face
Got no human grace your eyes without a face
Such a human waste your eyes without a face
And now it's getting worse
You looked like a princess the night we met
With your hair piled up high I will never forget
I'm drunk right now baby but I've got to be
I never could tell you what you mean to me
I loved you the first time I saw you
And I always will love you Marie
I loved you the first time I saw you
And I always will love you Marie
The song that the trees sing when the wind blows
You're a flower, you're a river you're a rainbow
Sometimes I'm crazy but I guess you know
I'm weak and I'm lazy and I hurt you so
And I don't listen to a word you say
And when you're in trouble I turn away
But I loved you,
I loved you the first time I saw you
And I always will love you Marie
I loved you the first time I saw you
And I always will love you Marie
One, two, three
One, two, three
One, two, three
One, two, three
One, two, three
One, two
Swan pond, oh swan pond
Who am I, you I am sure of
Your sound is sweet, the mosquito sweep (?)
My life, I'm sure of no one
Under your trees I forget about me
And in your grass I remember him
Apples or dates on marble floors
Swan pond, please set me free
But to hold him and sing
May be just what I need
But to hold him and say
May be just what I need
So swan pond, oh swan pond
Hear my song and please bring him to me
Oh swan pond, oh swan pond
Hear my song and please bring him to me
Oh swan pond, oh swan pond
Hear my song and please bring him to me
Composição: Renato Russo
Eu não me perdi,
E mesmo assim você me abandonou...
Você quis partir, e agora estou sozinho
Mas vou me acostumar..
com o silêncio em casa, com um prato só na mesa.
Eu não me perdi,
O Sândalo perfuma o machado que-o feriu
Adeus, adeus ,adeus meu grande amor.
E tanto faz.. de tudo o que ficou,
Guardo um retrato teu,
e a saudade mais bonita.
Eu não me perdi,
e mesmo assim ninguém me perdoou..
Pobre coração - quando o teu estava comigo era tão bom.
Não sei por quê acontece assim e é sem querer
O que não era pra ser: Vou fugir dessa dor.
Meu amor
se quiseres voltar - volta não
Porque me quebraste em mil pedaços.
I saw three shrimps in the water
And two were old and grey
So I swam a little closer
And I heard the third one say
"Goodbye mommy shrimp
And Papa shake my hand
Here comes the shrimp boat for
To take me to Louisiane"
He showed his mama and his papa papa papa papa papa papa papa
The shrimp newspaper he read
And there the advertisement
To all the young shrimps said
"Free ride New Orleans
To stay in Grand Hotel
Meet Creole gals
That help you out of your shell"
Goodbye mommy shrimp
And Papa shake my hand
Here comes the shrimp boat for
To take me to Louisiane
His poor mama and his poor papa papa papa papa papa papa papa
They haven't heard from him yet
Last time they've seen his smiling face
Is when he jumped into the net
Goodbye mommy shrimp
And Papa shake my hand
Here comes the shrimp boat for
To take me to Louisiane
Here comes the shrimp boat for
To take me to Louisiane
Here comes the shrimp boat for
To take me ah take me
In the calm, taking in stories
From your eyes for me to see
But every time the wind pulls back my hair
I can hear your voice ring in the air:
"You can't win me back, win me back
Win me back, win me back"
But I believe in love I guess
And you believe in loneliness
And now my consolation prize
Took off with a bigger size
Around the street where I grew up
There lies the truth of who I was
But I sailed too far out to sea
Here is nothing left for me
When there's no home to call your own
Your thoughts are colder than a stone
I sailed too far out to sea
There is no one left for me
Sag mal, hast du das gesehen,
Wie sie lachen, wie sie gehen?
Manche Wesen sind so schön.
Innen wie außen.
Sie verwöhnen deine Sinne und gewöhnen
Dich wieder an Liebe, die du kennst,
Zu der du immer wieder rennst.
Diese Liebe ist real,
So real wie Höllenqualen.
Höllenqualen sind egal,
Wenn sich die Liebe in dir entfacht.
Doch es ist gut wie es ist.
Der Mensch lernt nur, wenn er Scheiße frisst,
Sonst reift er nicht.
Er weiß doch nichts.
Ich weiß noch nicht, wann verstreicht die Frist?
Das hat die Welt noch nicht gesehen.
Trotzdem ist Liebe wunderschön,
Ist unsichtbar und trotzdem da.
Freude und Leid das ganze Jahr
Man nimmt das Leben sonst nicht wahr.
Denn mit dem Herz sind wir meist blind.
Wer von uns ist schon wie ein Kind?
Offen für alles wie der Wind,
Der doch dem Meer den Regen bringt.
Er ist so frei und doch gewillt.
Gib mir einen Koffer für mein Herz,
Der ist unendlich viel mehr wert,
Wenn du ihn mitnimmst, wenn du gehst,
Ihn bei dir trägst von früh bis spät,
Ihn dann zurück bringst unversehrt.
Ich lauf des öfteren Gefahr,
Zu vergessen wie schön das Leben bisher war.
Mit dir von Anfang an verflochten bis ans Ende meiner Zeit.
Wir lieben das Leben und sind dafür bereit.
Denn wir alle werfen Schatten auf des Nächsten Licht.
Lass dich nicht zerbrechen und fürchte dich nicht
Vor dem, was da kommt,
Vor dem, was du fühlst,
Vor dem, was du liebst.
Das hat die Welt noch nicht gesehen.
Trotzdem ist Liebe wunderschön,
Ist unsichtbar und trotzdem da.
Freude und Leid das ganze Jahr
Man nimmt das Leben sonst nicht wahr.
Denn mit dem Herz sind wir meist blind.
Wer von uns ist schon wie ein Kind?
Offen für alles wie der Wind,
Der doch dem Meer den Regen bringt.
Er ist so frei und doch gewillt.

Trotzdem ist Liebe wunderschön,
Ist unsichtbar und trotzdem da.
Freude und Leid das ganze Jahr
Man nimmt das Leben sonst nicht wahr.
Denn mit dem Herz sind wir meist blind.
Wer von uns ist schon wie ein Kind?
Offen für alles wie der Wind,
Der doch dem Meer den Regen bringt.
Er ist so frei und doch gewillt.
Das hat die Welt noch nicht gesehen??
Love is unseen
Love is your dream
But love is no dream
Love is so real
Even though it's unseen
Love is unseen
Love is your dream
But love is no dream
Love is so real
Even though it's unseen
Love is unseen
Love is your dream
But love is no dream
Love is so real
Even though it's unseen
Love is the best feeling I ever had
You and me have the cherished love
Love keep me warm
Love keeps you warm
Love is something you have to cherish
Das hat die Welt noch nicht gesehen.
Trotzdem ist Liebe wunderschön,
Ist unsichtbar und trotzdem da.
Freude und Leid das ganze Jahr
Man nimmt das Leben sonst nicht wahr.
Denn mit dem Herz sind wir meist blind.
Wer von uns ist schon wie ein Kind?
Offen für alles wie der Wind,

¿quién le va a dar presencia?
¿quién le va a aguantar la indecisión?
!una mínima decencia!
¿quién se va a ocupar ahora? yo no
!ha! No puede ser que vengas
cuando no te quiero más acá.
a no ser que me devuelvas
lo que yo te di con tantas ganas.
¿quien le tendrá paciencia?
¿quién le va a dar una mano?
nunca va a cambiar su esencia
¿quién lo va a ayudar temprano? yo no
¿qué le viene pasando?
hace tiempo está raro
ay, no se...
No I never meant to hold you back
I never meant to turn away
Please forgive me
I never meant to break your heart
I'd give my last breath before I do
Please forgive me
No I never meant to hold you down
I never meant to break your heart
Somehow, somehow
We are survivors
No I never meant to hold you back
I never meant to turn away
Here we are standing here
Survivors in the night
No I never meant to break your heart
I'll always be here for you
Here's my word, take my hand
Survivors in the night
No I never meant to let you down
I'd give my last breath before I do
All I ever wanted was to be right here
Survivors in the night
When all is said and done
We'll find a way
To put all this behind us
We'll find some way
'Cause you know that I won't be leaving
Yes I'm here and I won't be leaving
No I never meant to cause you pain
No I never meant to hurt you
All I want to do now, is to try my best
Survivors in the night
When all is said and done
We'll find someday
We can forget all this
Somehow, some way
And as long as I'm here
There'll be no worries any more
And all these promises I'm making now
I'll hold each day
So don't ever. don't ever, don't forget
That I never, never meant to break your heart
All I ever wanted was to stand beside you
Survivors in the night
We are survivors in the night
Foi numa festa, gelo e cuba-libre 
E na vitrola whisky a go-go 
? meia luz a som do Johnny Rivers 
Aquele tempo que você sonhou 
Senti na pele a tua energia 
Quando peguei de leve a tua mão 
A noite inteira passa num segundo 
O tempo voa mais do que a canção 
Quase no fim da festa 
Num beijo então você se rendeu 
Na minha fantasia 
O mundo era você e eu 
Eu perguntava Do You Wanna Dance ? 
E te abraçava Do You Wanna Dance ? 
Lembrar você 
Um sonho a mais não faz mal
Butterflies
All you gotta do is walk away and pass me by
Don't acknowledge my smile when I try to say hello to you yeah
And all you gotta do is not answer my calls when
I'm trying to get through
Keep me wondering why, when all I can do is sigh
I just wanna touch you
I just wanna touch and kiss and I wish that I could be with you
Tonight cause you give me butterflies inside inside and i
All I gotta say is that I must be dreaming, can't be real
You're not here with me, still I can feel you near me
I caress you, let you taste us, just so blissful listen
I would give you anything baby, just make my dreams come true
Oh baby you give me butterflies
I just wanna touch and kiss and I wish that I could be with you
Tonight cause you give me butterflies inside inside and i
I just wanna touch and kiss and I wish that I could be with you
Tonight cause you give me butterflies inside inside and i
If you would take my hand, baby I would show you
Guide you to the light babe
If you would be my love, baby I will love you, love you
Till the end of time
I just wanna touch and kiss and I wish that I could be with you
Tonight cause you give me butterflies inside inside and i
I just wanna touch and kiss and I wish that I could be with you
Tonight cause you give me butterflies inside inside and i
I just wanna touch and kiss and I wish that I could be with you
Tonight cause you give me butterflies inside inside and i
I just wanna touch and kiss and I wish that I could be with you
Tonight cause you give me butterflies inside inside and i
Summer in our sky ships, forever, sailing the wind
Somewhere Sunday morning brings us miles from earthbound, sailing the wind
September, keeping kite time together we summon the wind
Swaying to a gentle lady's breeze of ocean, sailing the wind
Up among the clouds I see my face miles below
Tugging on the string, a travelin' thing in my soul
I've got half a mind to close my eyes and let the string go, sailing the wind
Children, bring your kite lines to come and summon the wind
Tomorrow we'll be watching a sad sea and star bound, sailing the wind
Tomorrow we'll be watching a sad sea and star bound, sailing the wind
Up among the clouds I see my face miles below
Tugging on the string, a travelin' thing in my soul
I've got half a mind to close my eyes and let the string go, sailing the wind
The way the moon
Bends down to light the sea
And catches hold
Of mountains strong
They stand beside me and all that I am
They have written in my soul
I've made a promise to never lose sight
Of the dream that leads me home
And this much I know
Time like a river
Sends me away
But here on these shores
My heart remais
From these shores I came
A tender wind that reaches through the years
And sings me on
Through joy and pain
It breathes within me and all that I am
It has written in my soul
I've made a promise
To never lose sight
Of the dream that leads me home
And this much I know
And this much I know
They say
You curse at girls.
Don't you know it isn't right?
You could get yourself in trouble...
You've been
Livin' in a different world.
Lookin' for another fight.
Sifting through emotional rubble.
Hey, boy, don't you get it
That one day you're gonna regret it
When she's gone
Hey, boy, you can bet it
That you will be blue
Each time you curse at girls
You curse a little at yourself
Don't you know a girl gets angry?
Hey, boy, don't you get it
That one day you're gonna regret it
When she's gone
Hey, boy, you can bet it
That you will be blue
They say you curse at girls
Don't you know it isn't right?
Es regnet und wieder nichts getan
Nur wieder wie im Wahn ein Luftschloß aufgebaut
Es regnet und wieder eine Nacht
am Fenster zugebracht und Träume durchgekaut
Und im Garten blüht die Illusion, das kenn' ich schon
Mal sehen, ob sich das Warten lohnt
Immer wieder geht ein Regen nieder
Und am Himmel hängt ein halber Mond
Es regnet, begossen wird die Welt
Wer jetzt nicht schläft verfällt der feuchten Träumerei
Es regnet ??in Müdigkeit verstrickt
Ins Dunkel 'rausgeschickt verfusselt sich die Zeit
Und im Garten blüht die Illusion, das kenn' ich schon
Mal sehen, ob sich das Warten lohnt
Immer wieder geht ein Regen nieder
Und am Himmel hängt ein halber Mond
Es ist schon sehr, sehr lange her,
da sah ich dich im Regen stehen
und es ist schwer in den Regen zu sehen
und schwerer noch von alleine ins Bett zu gehen
Und im Garten blüht die Illusion, das kenn' ich schon
Mal sehen, ob sich das Warten lohnt
Immer wieder geht ein Regen nieder
Und am Himmel hängt ein halber Mond
Iça, iça Vela do barco 
Mar do Atlântico Sul
Marinheiro João do Arco 
Anjo do céu azul
Iça, iça âncora vela
Três milhas do atol
Sol na nuca e o corpo dela
Ofusca a luz do sol
Quem avista a ilha do amor
No mar só se dá bem
Um peixe que eu pesquei me fisgou
Fui seu peixe também 
Me dá um beijo, que o beijo é uma reza 
Pro marujo que se preza        
Me dá um beijo, que o beijo é uma reza 
Pro marujo que se preza
Oa Oa balanço do mar 
Oa oa amor vida boa
Oa oa vento dá na vela 
Oa oa me leva pra ela
Iça, iça Vela do barco 
Mar do Atlântico Sul
Marinheiro João do Arco 
Anjo do céu azul
Iça, iça âncora vela
Três milhas do atol
Sol na nuca e o corpo dela
Ofusca a luz do sol
Roupa lavada no mar alto
Cega minha aflição
Moça do batalhão Naval
Pega na minha mão
Me dá um beijo, que o beijo é uma reza 
Pro marujo que se preza        
Me dá um beijo, que o beijo é uma reza 
Pro marujo que se preza
Oa Oa balanço do mar 
Oa oa amor vida boa
Oa oa vento dá na vela 
Oa oa me leva pra ela
Iça, iça Vela do barco 
Mar do Atlântico Sul
Marinheiro João do Arco 
Anjo do céu azul
Iça, iça âncora vela
Três milhas do atol
Sol na nuca e o corpo dela
Ofusca a luz do sol
Tempestade vai e vem  
Vai firme no leme marinheiro
Ela me quer e eu já não choro mais
Vou correr o mundo inteiro
Me dá um beijo, que o beijo é uma reza 
Pro marujo que se preza        
Me dá um beijo, que o beijo é uma reza 
Pro marujo que se preza
Oa, oa balanço do mar

Me and my friend, we are not friendly anymore
We have not talked for so long
And if we had to talk, what could we say, sitting side by side
So long ago, we were dancing and singing
We could be together saying nothing
So long ago, it all meant much more than this
The pond, it seems so quiet tonight
And the swans are all huddled together
Well I sound alone here on my way home, again when no one is there waiting
So long ago we were dancing and singing
And it all meant something
So long ago, mean and my friend we were friendly
And now we don't see each other no more
This romance is fading
I'm tired of complaining
Every single move you make
Ends up being a big mistake
You constantly embarrass me
Infront of friends and family
But I'm not quite ready to let go
If we rewind and start again,
Will things be any different?
Our love sometime will start and end,
Will it go on if we try again?
If we could rewind all that's happened
I'd still make all the same mistakes
I've tried my hardest since we started
I'd do the same if we replayed the tape
I'm stll remember
The first thing
I loved about you
But can your smile save our love
From the problems I speak of
If we rewind and start again,
Will things be any different?
Our love sometime will start and end,
Will it go on if we start again?
If we could rewind all that's happened
I'd still make all the same mistakes
I've tried my hardest since we started
I'd do the same if we replayed the tape
Instead of rewind
I'd like to remind
You of all the good times that we've seen
And if you're still sore
Try fastforward
And see how empty your life will be without me
Without me
Without me
Die Tür steht auf,
Ich trete ein
Du lächelst nie,
Doch dein Glück kann ich fühlen.
Und meine Hand,
Fährt durch dein Haar,
Ich lehn mich an dich
Und schließ meine Augen.
Dann leg ich dir,
Die Riemen rum.
Verstehn' uns ohne ein Wort
zu sagen.
Du atmest tief,
Dann geht es los.
Ich halt mich fest und du gehst darin auf,
Mich zu tragen.
[Refrain]
Trag mich so weit es geht,
Trag mich egal wo hin. [trag mich]
Solang ich nur bei dir,
Und in Bewegung bin. [trag mich]
Dein Körper glänzt,
Im Abendlicht.
Ich spür' die Kraft,
Hinter jeder Bewegung.
Du Bäumst dich auf,
Ich geb mich hin.
Und unter jedem deiner Schritte erbebt,
Die Umgebung.
[Refrain]
Trag mich so weit es geht,
Trag mich egal wo hin. [trag mich, trag mich]
Solang ich nur bei dir,
Und in Bewegung bin. [trag mich]
Trag mich so weit es geht,
Trag mich egal wo hin. [trag mich, trag mich]
Solang ich nur bei dir,
Und in Bewegung bin. [trag mich]
Trag mich so weit es geht,
Trag mich so Schnell du kannst. [trag mich, trag mich]
Trag mich wo hin du willst,
Und halt nie wieder an. [trag mich]
I've been around a long time
In search of home and heart
On cartoons and in aeroplanes
In paper chains and stars
And I am come to you
And I am one for you
And let the guards be terrified
I am my soul's belief
And now, there's nothing left to hide
I am wild and I am free
And I am come to you
And I am one for you
I'm injoy as the morning spirals open
And the clouds melt away into water
And I am come to you
And I am one for you
A strange kind of love
A strange kind of feeling
Swims through your eyes
And like the doors
To a wide vast dominion
They open to your prize
This is no terror ground
Or place for the rage
No broken hearts
White wash lies
Just a taste for the truth
Perfect taste choice and meaning
A look into your eyes
Blind to the gemstone alone
A smile from a frown circles round
Should he stay or should he go
Let him shout a rage so strong
A rage that knows no right or wrong
And take a little piece of you
There is no middle ground
Or that's how it seems
For us to walk or to take
Instead we tumble down
Either side left or right
To love or to hate
Suszę kwiaty by spamiętać
Te wszystkie
Urodziny
Oświadczyny...
Pocałunki w rękę, usta i policzki
Suszę grzyby bo wrzucane
Do zupy pełnymi garściami
Są cudownym wspomnieniem jesieni
W te cholerne zi-wio-letnie dni
I nasze szczęście zasuszone
Na fotograficznym papierze
W te dni to godne
Największego cynika
Ściele się
Trup się ściele
First of all
It leaves a bad ache
So I choose good
Good things to think on
There we were heaven sent
Looks for lights anywhere
Bleed out the deviled soul
Look at what doesn't care
Please in me, make me well,
Make me well, make me well
This seed in me hasn't set
Heaven sent only shells
I keep my cold eyes locked
In a different place
I did it well
I did it for you
With all the cold that kept it down
Its ring in hard earned
I keep my cold eyes locked
In a different place
I did it well
I did it for you
When it's deepest in the ground
It's ringing harder than the bells do
Do it enough
Out of good. bad.
Always in awe
And nearly savoring
Meet me out when I'm want
Looks a lot, doesn't need it
Bleed this out deviled soul
Suddenly it's hard to see
I did it for you
With all the cold that kept it down
Its ring in hard earned
I keep my cold eyes locked
In a different place
I did it well
I did it for you
When it's deepest in the ground
It's ringing harder than the bells do
(Feat. Wendy Stubbs)
The time has come
For me to leave this place
The light, the sound of the cars
Have left me broken
If you can't change your mind
If you can't change your mind
Going back to the sea
Your skin and the sky light
Are fading to the distance
The soul of the life I once had
Echoes through the building
If you won't call my name
If you won't call my name
Going back to the sea
If you won't change your mind
If you won't change your mind
I'm going back to the sea
Dizem que não sirvo pra gostar de ninguém
Que não faço nada que não seja pro meu bem
Falo coisas de mau gosto
Não posso evitar
E há quem mesmo vire o rosto
Ao me ver chegar
É difícil respirar sem você
Não,
(Ela só quer)
Que eu goste,
(Algum lugar)
De ser má,
(E o que ela não)
Mas sorrir pra que?
Vá se lembrar
Espero, espero
Já vai longe o tempo
Mas te espero
Um dia pode ser
Talvez eu volte a ver
Todas as cores que fugiram junto com você
Eu só digo a quem me pede
Que eu tenha um bom coração
Que me dê uma razão
É difícil respirar sem você
Não,
(Ela só quer)
Que eu goste,
(Algum lugar)
De ser má,
(E o que ela não)
Mas sorrir pra que?
Vá se lembrar
Espero, espero
Já vai longe o tempo
Come on home
It's as it's always been
Don't you know you're
Bound to be let in
You leave no track
But he knows where
You've been
All your Summers set
Inside his eyes
Through his gaze
You come to realize
Through one thousand lives
The moon will rise
He comes from east and west
And north and south
With all the things that
You can live without
In the end it's all you
Care about
Our friends are all hurting
From moments and regrets and charity laced with a lie
And still we keep hoping
To fix all the defects and strengthen these Seminal ties
We go on together
For better or worse, our history is too real to hate
Now and forever
We stay until morning, and promise to fight for our fates
'Til we die
'Til we die
The start of the journey
Is every bit worth it, I can't let you down anymore
The sky is still clearing
We're never afraid and the consequence opens the door
I've never stopped trying
I've never stopped feeling like family is much more than blood
Don't go on without me
The piece that I represent compliments each and every one
'Til we die
'Til we die
We won't be forgotten, we'll never give in
This war we've achieved has allowed us to win
'Til we die
'Til we die
My last true confession
Will open your eyes, I've never known trust like the nine
Let it be spoken
Let it be screamed, they'll never ever take us alive
'Til we die
'Til we die
We won't be forgotten, we'll never give in
This war we've achieved has allowed us to win
Carry on
Carry on
(We'll never be broken, we won't be denied
Our war is the pressure, we need to unite
We'll never be broken, we won't be denied
Our war is the pressure, we need to unite)
'Til we die
'Til we die
We won't be forgotten, we'll never give in
This war we've achieved has allowed us to win
Carry on
Carry on
We'll never be broken, we won't be denied
Our war is the pressure, we need to unite
'Til we die
'Til we die
'Til we die (we won't be forgotten, we'll never give in)
'Til we die (this war we've achieved has allowed us to win)
'Til we die (we'll never be broken, we won't be denied)
'Til we die (our war is the pressure, we need to unite)
I saw the back of the stars
Tremble and fall
While seahorses played
On the slope of your breast
I saw a hundred angels
Rush to the ground
They were giving you garlands
And giving you crowns
The flowers are everywhere
Christ glorious entwined
The tip of the moon
And the sun as it shines
And the roots as they burrow
And tunnel through earth
And the birds as they soar on their wings
I heard them whisper your name
And I remember you there
And the turtle-doves hiding
As your eyes roared with light
And I remember your smile
So wide and so red
Whilst the snowflakes covered
Your hair with their seals
And I remember our bliss
As we gazed at the wall
And I remember you there
I remember you there
With your mocking bird hair
Some years ago
We had sat down and wept
With the sea in our ears
And seven cats on our laps
Whilst the books gathered dust
Unread and untrue
And you flicked through the letters
I could not bear to read
Surprise, I can see it in your eyes
You can't hide from me
Feeling scared ready to escape
I can read your neurology
Won't you, won't you save me
I'm looking for a remedy
Won't you save me
Take your time don't go running away from this
Know your mind don't go running around like this
If you set yourself up to fall down
When you do you learn to shift the blame
And lose the one you love
Take your time don't go running away from this
Runaway
There's a boom echoes in my heart
Still don't know if you're near or far
Feel a breeze of a new beginning
You're for keeps don't you runaway
Just place both your feet on the ground
(It keeps you stable)
The ground
(It keeps you stable)
The ground
(It keeps you stable)
You know you've got to...
Take your time don't go running away from this
Know your mind don't go running around like this
If you set yourself up to fall down
When you do you learn to shift the blame
And lose the one you love
Take your time don't go running away from this
Runaway
Always run away
Always run away
Always run away
Always run away
Help me 
I feel like I'm weightless
Floating right out of your hands
And there's only so much I aspire to
Taking one day at a time
And deliverance has many faces
But grace is an acquaintance of mine
Tell me how could it have happened?
You know that we're not the marrying kind
Travel light, don't think twice
We're leaving the shadows behind
It's given us this wonderful wanderlust
I don't doubt it, I feel it
Wanderlust
Wanderlust
Help me
This waterboy's wasted
Falling right out of your sky
And there's nothing I could do without you here
Loving the state that I'm in
Between no longer and not yet
On the threshold of some brighter thing
The match was struck and I was fire
The embers of a drowning man
Tell me why won't I listen
Or acknowledge that I don't understand?
Losing light, a selfish kind
We're out on the road again
It's given us this wonderful wanderlust
I don't doubt it, I feel it
Turn the headlights on full
I want to take in it all
And let it wash over me
The bridge looked so high
From the ledge that we've climbed
But we climbed them so that we could be free
Give me no dreams of what the future brings
I need to know when I have gone too far
Repeated lightning strikes
Up and down the spine
They search us out wherever we are
In a world full of lies
That tug at the truth
I'm taking no sides
Now I recognise you
Wanderlust
Wanderlust
It's given us, given us this wonderful wanderlust
I don't doubt it, no
Take another sip my love and see what you will see
A fleet of golden galleons on a crystal sea
Are you sitting comfortably?
Let Merlin cast his spell
Ride along the winds of time and see where we have been
The glorious age of Camelot, when Guinevere was Queen
It all unfolds before your eyes
As Merlin casts his spell
Seven wonders of the world he'll lay before your feet
In far-off lands on distant shores, so many friends to meet
Are you sitting comfortably?
Let Merlin cast his spell
Ciało się miesza z ciałem
W proporcjach doskonałych
Połykam cię
Smakujesz mi jak nikt
Paru parumba ba
Niech trwa to przenikanie
Chiny - na prześcieradle
I we mnie
Smakujesz mi jak nikt
So tell me dear where is it you go from here?
As you curse and peel and pose in tears
Against the wall and across the hall
Across the wards as we both dissolve
I have this habit of punishing things
That move so fast they grow out wings
That sneaks through houses as we barter for sleep
(So just let me hide)
I wish I had you in my lungs
Id blow you upand block the sun
To save everyone from this brilliant light we've won
And our bodies got so much clearer
With dirty blood and thirty last calls
So fill it up and spin forever down the wall
I throw it up just to watch it fall
Through the window you looked much sweeter
Tell me something 'bout a lonely night
Burnt by the steam from a better life
But your lottery touch feels lucky enough
Refugee hands from a gin war.
I know a place where we can rest tonight
But when the bombs start falling... you've got to open your eyes
And I just hope that I have mine
I just hope that I have.
I wish I had one hundred thousand pounds
Id crack the ground as your struggle for sound leaps
From town to town to town
Share your spoken wealth
Share your bodys health
I need it more than I need myself
I know you'll leave with the kings reprieve
I guess that's just fine by me
Through the window you tasted much sweeter

Far past these roads there is a place
Where all of our precious dreams remain
Someday I know I'll find a way
To keep myself from holding on
Stay awake with the sound of my voice
I'm restless from the silence in the air
I want to be somewhere I can see the roads
A place where every time you breathe a wish comes true
I want to be where love is real
And memories of distant days come to life again
Inside this room, time will stand still
As long as I'm not aware of change
The world outside leaves me behind by myself
There's no mercy for those who hold on
Stay awake with the sound of my voice
I'm restless from the silence in the air
Far past these roads there is a place
Where all of our precious dreams remain
Someday I know I'll keep myself
From holding on to it
I could live in a different place
With a different house and a different name
I could sing you your favourite song 
Yeah, you'd sing along, you'd sing along
I could wrap you in your favourite clothes
And kiss your face just so you know
That I'm the one who has got your back 
Now turn around and don't be sad
I hope you find the love that's true
So the morning light can shine on you
I hope you find what you're looking for 
So your heart is warm for ever more
I could fly you away with me
To the furthest place you'll ever be
We could smoke 'til the sun goes down
And without a sound, without a sound
We'd fall asleep by the big blue sea
With open eyes so we could see
The way it shines for you and I
You know it'll shine until we fly
I hope you find the love that's true
So the morning light can shine on you
I hope you find what you're looking for
So your heart is warm for ever more
I could wait with you by the water
I could wait with you for the winter to come
I could stand with you with your snow boots on
I hope you find the love that's true
So the morning light can shine on you
I hope you find what you're looking for
So your heart is warm for ever more
I hope you find what you're looking for
So your heart is warm for ever more
Instrumental
Don't!
Don't... don't you wish we tried?
Do you feel what I feel inside?
You know our love is stronger than pride... oh
No don't... don't let your anger grow
Just tell me what you need me to know
Please talk to me, don't close the door
Hmmm, 'cause I wanna hear you
I wanna be near you
Don't fight, don't argue
Give me the chance to say that I'm sorry
Just let me love you
Don't turn me away
Don't tell me to go
Don't!... Don't give up on trust
Don't give up on me, on us
If we could just hold on long enough
Hmmm, we can do it
We'll get through it
Don't fight, don't argue
Just give me the chance to say that I'm sorry
Just let me love you
Don't turn me away, don't tell me to go
Don't pretend that it's okay
Things won't get better that way
Don't do something you might regret someday...
Don't!
Don't give up on me
Hmm, Don't!
(We can do it) We'll get through it
Don't fight, don't argue
Just give me the chance to say that I'm sorry
Just let me love you
Don't turn me away, don't tell me to go
Don't! (Don't fight don't argue)
Don't give up on me
(Give me the chance to say that I'm sorry)
Say that that I'm sorry
(Just let me love you)
Don't give up on me
(Don't turn me away)
Don't tell me to go
Don't!
(Don't fight don't argue)
Don't give up on me
(Give me the chance to say that I'm sorry)
Say that that I'm sorry
(Just let me love you)
Don't give up on me
(Don't turn me away)
Don't tell me to go...
Your Love Is Mine,
I want the world to know

Deliver me, out of my sadness
Deliver me, from all of the madness
Deliver me, courage to guide me
Deliver me, strength from inside me
All of my life I've been in hiding
Wishing there was someone just like You
Now that You're here
Now that I've found You
I know that You're the one to pull me through
Deliver me, loving and caring
Deliver me, giving and sharing
All of my life I was in hiding
Wishing there was someone just like You
Now that You're here
Now that I've found you
I know that You're the one to pull me through
Deliver me
Deliver me
Oh, deliver me
All of my life I was in hiding
Wishing there was someone just like You
Now that You're here
Now that I've found You
I know that You're the one to pull me through
All of my life I was in hiding
Wishing there was someone just like You
Now that You're here
Now that I've found you
I know that You're the one to pull me through
Deliver me
Won't you deliver me?
Me and all my friends
We're all misunderstood
They say we stand for nothing
And there's no way we ever could
Now we see everything that's going wrong
With the world and those who lead it
We just feel like we don't have the means
To rise above and beat it
So we keep waiting
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting
Waiting on the world to change
It's hard to beat the system
When we're standing at a distance
So we keep waiting
Waiting on the world to change
Now, if we had the power
To bring our neighbors home from war
They would have never missed a Christmas
No more ribbons on their door
And when you trust your television
What you get is what you got
'Cause when they own the information
They can bend it all they want
That's why we're waiting
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting
Waiting on the world to change
It's not that we don't care
We just know that the fight ain't fair
So we keep on waiting
Waiting on the world to change
We're still waiting
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting
Waiting on the world to change
One day our generation
Is gonna rule the population
So we keep on waiting
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting
Waiting on the world to change
This is emotion 
Emotion less war 
A torn shirt and a long dead cause 
I can't sleep 
This kind of thing gets me down 
Don't say walk 
I may lose my fear 
I could lose myself 
In this honesty
I read all sorts of things 
There's so much to learn 
I've seen the hand that rushes in 
As it rush over you 
I could lose myself 
In this honesty
Christian
I let her go
Gone gone gone black widow
I let her go
Gone gone gone in a dying meadow
I just opened up my window
No need to argue
If she's going
I let her go
Gone gone gone in the deep slumber
Gone gone gone as ice melted in summer
I just opened up my window
No need to argue
Lay my head against my pillow
No need to follow
If she's going

I'll let you sleep
Sleep all day, it's fine
A little time, a little time
Something to save
And save this room
Remember this time, this room
You want it to change
Don't want it to change
It always will
And I wanna pull things up
And throw them in the air
I wanna see you born
I wanted to be there
Now everyone is here
Fill up their cups, they're here
Make someone play
Don't know what to say
I'll leave it to you
And oh, my dear
Say it again, my dear
You speak like you sing
So say it again
I'll leave it to you
And I wanna pull things up
And throw them in the air
I wanna see you born
I wanted to be there
I wanna pull things up
And throw them in the air
I wanna see you born
I wanted to be there
I remember tears streaming down your face
When I said, "I'll never let you go"
When all those shadows almost killed your light
I remember you said, "Don't leave me here alone"
But all that's dead and gone and passed tonight
Just close your eyes
The sun is going down
You'll be all right
No one can hurt you now
Come morning light
You and I'll be safe and sound
Don't you dare look out your window
Darling, everything's on fire
The war outside our door keeps raging on
Hold on to this lullaby
Even when the music's gone, gone
Just close your eyes
The sun is going down
You'll be all right
No one can hurt you now
Come morning light
You and I'll be safe and sound
Ooh, ooh, ahh, ahh
Ooh, ooh, ahh, ahh
Just close your eyes
You'll be all right
Come morning light
You and I'll be safe and sound
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh...
In a purple room
Throne of needles
Sailing to the sun
Reaching higher
Sleeping on a bed
Of broken bottles
Passing night and day
Wasting hours
Rings on the water caressing your hair
Touch of a mother so gently aware
Let the journey entice you to stay
Draped in water seduced to immerse
Lying on the grass
By the river
Captured by the moon
Barely breathing
Dreaming while awake
Moving slowly
Waiting for a change
Never coming
Can you see the danger
Within my eyes
Everyone's a stranger
Wearing disguise
Rings on the water caressing your hair
Touch of a mother so gently aware
Let the journey allure you to stay
Let the water seduce you to immerse
Don't go looking for him lady,
Don't go looking for him now...
He'll be sailing 'cross the ocean,
By the time you turn around
All he carries is his pride, he has nothing to his name...
What he's leaving you behind,
Is the burden of the blame...
Don't go looking for him lady,
He's far gone now
Don't go looking for him lady,
Don't go looking for him now...
He's somewhere across the border,
In some lonely little town
A tattoo on his arm, is all that will remain
Of a lady, with no heart, playing stupid little games
Don't go looking for him lady,
He's far gone now
And now you're gazing at the moon...
Humming melancholic lines
Burning candles in your room,
As if to see the light
(Instrumental)
Don't go looking for him lady,
Don't go looking for him now
He'll be over the horizon,
By the time you come around...
You can stare up at the sky
Building castles in the air
He won't be coming back this time,
There'll be no answer to your prayers...
Don't go looking for him lady,
He's far gone now
And now you're gazing at the moon...
Humming melancholic lines
Burning candles in your room,
As if to see the light
Don't go looking for him lady,
Don't go looking for him now
There's no need to be sorry for yourself
It don't matter anyhow
Don't go looking for him lady yeah
He's far gone now
Don't looking for him lady yeah
He's far gone now
Io voglio regalarti la mia vita
Chiedo tu cambi tutta la mia vita, ora
Ti do questa notizia in conclusione
Notizia è l?�anagramma del mio nome, vedi
E so che serve tempo, non lo nego
Anche se in fondo tempo non ce n?��? e ma se
Cerco lo vedo
L?�amore va veloce e tu stai indietro
Se cerchi mi vedi
Il bene più segreto sfugge all?�uomo che non guarda avanti, mai
Ricevo il tuo contrordine speciale
Nemico della logica morale
Opposto della fisica normale
Geometria degli angoli nascosti, nostri
E adesso!
Ripenso a quella foto insieme
Decido che non ti avrei mai perduta
Mai perduta, perché ti volevo troppo
Mancano i colpi al cuore
Quel poco tanto di dolore
Quell?�attitudine di chi ricorda tutto, ma se
Guardo, lo vedo
Il mondo va veloce e tu vai indietro
Se cerchi, mi vedi
Il bene più segreto sfugge all?�uomo che non guarda avanti, mai
Dietro le lacrime che mi hai nascosto
Negli spazi di un segreto opposto
Resto fermo e ti aspetto
Da qui non mi è possibile
No non rivederti più
Se lontana non sei stata mai
Se cerco lo vedo
L?�amore va veloce e tu stai indietro
Se cerchi mi vedi
Il bene più segreto sfugge all?�uomo che non guarda avanti, mai
I'm taking my time
I'll fix it, don't worry now
I'm needing you there
Make sure that you're coming too
All of my life
Is all I'll give you here
The meaning of me
Is something to pursue
You think I'm a saint
It's in your pretty head
Stretched out like a saint now
I love you to death
Catch another dream now
We can find them somehow
I know that there's a boy inside the man
Catch another dream now
Take all we are allowed
For I know that there's a man inside the boy
Grown ups don't know
How to dream anymore
Their heads in the sand
And they choose to ignore it all
All of my life
Is all I'll give you here
The meaning of me
Is something to pursue
You think I'm a saint
It's in your pretty head
Stretched out like a saint now
I love you to death
Catch another dream now
We can find them somehow
I know that there's a boy inside the man
Catch another dream now
Take all we are allowed
For I know that there's a man inside the boy
You think I'm a saint
It's in your pretty head
Stretched out like a saint now
I love you to death
Catch another dream now
We can find them somehow
I know that there's a boy inside the man
Catch another dream now
Take all we are allowed
For I know that there's a man inside the boy
Catch another dream now
We can find them somehow
I know that there's a boy inside the man
Catch another dream now
Take all we are allowed
For I know that there's a man inside the boy
A man inside the boy
You think I'm a saint
It's in your pretty head
(Death; portrayed by Busta Rhymes + sounds of a shovel digging + a heartbeat)
Yeah I know
A lot of you niggaz don't plan on the day when you'd have to see me
You see - I'm that nigga that you should really be afraid of
I dig graves for niggaz like you
We gon' get more acquainted at a time when you least expect it
(Chorus 2X: female singer)
Do you ever think (do you ever think)
What life would be (what life would be)
Where you will go (where will you go)
After you die (after you die)
[Death] You fucked up nigga!
(Busta Rhymes)
You know that when that time comes and nobody is checkin'
And everything you had is gone in the split of a second
That's when it starts hittin the fan and it gets real in this bitch
Just face the fact your shit's a wrap and you gotta deal with the shit
Despite I talk about it, I ain't makin' fun of them niggaz
I give thanks 'cause I've been blessed and I ain't one of them niggaz
Can't imagine how difficult it is, I know you suspect
That shit around you is lookin' dumb, it's gettin' hard to accept it
Alone in the mirror, you look at yourself and you smile
Disregarding the fact your running's been done for a while
Refuse to acknowledge the truth like the mind of a child
Continue frontin, like it's nothin' while you live in denial
While all your people around you start to leave you in the same place
You overexert the little you have left to save face
You tryin' to hide your expression from lookin' worried
On what to do when your career is buried
(Busta Rhymes)
Niggaz ain't GIVIN' a fuck about your flows no more
You ain't the star you were, fuckin' the same hoes no more
Promoters ain't payin' and bookin you for shows no more
You ain't whippin the Range, you ain't whippin a Rolls no more
Reality starts to settle in, you're sweatin every wake up
You're broke and now you gotta return your jewelry to Jacob
You run around and you front like you're still on fire
But nobody believes you; and now you live as a liar
You're onnly lyin' to yourself 'cause it's evident in the proof
As your world continues to crumble, come to terms with the truth
You're still holdin' on to them days when everything was about you
But niggaz don't even remember you enough to just shout you
I remember when you did your thing without a doubt tastefully
The problem was you didn't know when to bow out gracefully
Once told, never burn out, it's best to fade away
Preserve your value so that you can live to see a greater day
People see you and it's bugged that you mean nothin'
You doin' shit and front to prove to people you mean somethin'
It happens in the vicious when the truth starts to settle in
You step to the door of the club and see that you ain't gettin' in
Forgettin you a man first, chasin the fame
Got to remember, morals and principles, reppin your name proper
But most niggaz don't, and they whole life hurried
What do you do when your career is buried
(Death; portrayed by Busta Rhymes + (Busta Rhymes))
Okay
I told you we was gonna get more acquainted
At a time when you least expect it nigga
I'm here to lay you to rest once and for all [coughing]
You've been dead a long time but you refuse to accept that shit
But it's okay [coughing]
Nigga shut the FUCK UP AND GET IN THE BOX NIGGA! (WAIT! Please!)
It was custom built for all niggaz like you [lid closes]
You just don't wanna accept when it's time to hang it up
(Stop! BITCH!) See you in the afterlife nigga (Wait! HELP!)
Whever the fuck that is! (somebody help!)
(I can't breathe, nigga!)
(Open this shit nigga!)
(OPEN THIS SHIT! [knocking])
(OPEN THIS SHIT! [knocking])
(Busta Rhymes screams incoherently)
(Somebody help! hey!)
(Open this shit motherfucker what you doin')
(Open it!)
(Screaming and sounds of the shovel burying him to fade)
Because you're young, sharp as a knife
You need that buzz to come alive
Out on the edge, out on the town
You ain't got time to settle down
You're always sure, you're always right
You see it all in black and white
You never listen to anyone
Because you're young
Because you're young, you're torn between
A world of hate and a world of dreams
So much to lose, so much to gain
So much to fight for, so much to change
You don't look back, you don't look down
You gotta turn everything around
You live your life like a loaded gun
Because you're young
Stop talking back, get off the phone
You're late again, you missed the last bus home
This ain't the way you wanna live
I know something's got to give
You're always sure, you're always right
You see it all in black and white
You never listen to anyone
Because you're young
Don Cali:
Mit 13 fuhr ich nach Paris
Um den Sohn meines Vaters endlich kennenzulernen
Ich hatte viel gehört über die Stadt der Liebe
War beeindruckt vom Multikult und Eifelturm
Auf einmal stand er da, sein Name war Tara
Von ihm wurde mir viel erzählt als ich klein war
Wir haben so lang geredet, draußen wurde es hell
Ich habe so lange gewartet und dann ging es viel zu schnell
Chorus:
Was dir heute gegeben wird
Wird dir morgen wieder genommen
Drum wenn du heute glücklich bist
Verlasse dich nicht auf morgen
Im Flugzeug nach Berlin hab ich so viel nachgedacht
Übers Leben, es hat mir ein Geschenk gemacht
Er hatte viele Träume, genauso wie ich
Er wollte ein Haus bauen mit einem Zimmer für mich
Und alle anderen, die sich familie nennen
Damals wusste ich noch nicht dass Träume auch verbrennen
Ich hab so fest an meinen Bruder geglaubt
Doch mir wurden meine Träume geraubt
Chorus
Die Zeit verging, meine Gedanken wurden klarer
Ich war so froh über die Freundschaft mit Tara
Mein Bruder für den mein Vater nie da war
Der mir nach all diesen Jahren endlich nah war
Er rief mich an, er lud mich ein
Was für eine Ehre nach Paris zu seiner Filmpremiere
Ich sagte ab, denn ich war auf Wohnungssuche
Hatte Stress ohne Ende, meine Frau die war schwanger
Eine Woche später, eine Nacht, die ich nie vergesse
Ich sah meinen Opa tot in einem Sarg
Schweißgebadet wachte ich auf und rief ihn an
Alles war okay, doch das Gefühl hielt weiter an
Zwei Stunden später, ich hört das Telefon
Der tag war grau und es schneite, ich nahm ab
Mein Vater weinte
Omar! Tara ist tot!
Chorus 2x
Sag deiner Mutter,dass du sie liebst
Sag deinem Vater,dass du ihn liebst
Sag deiner Schwester,dass du sie liebst
Sag deinem Bruder,dass du ihn liebst
Sag deiner Tochter,dass du sie liebst
Sag deinem Sohn ,dass du ihn liebst (2 x)
Would you like to learn to sing?
Would you like to sing my song?
Would you like to learn to love me best of all?
Anyone can learn the words
And the melody's so plain
This is my song to bring you back again.
I can teach you how to sing and dance
With a song and dance routine
And when my party's over
You can fall in love with me.
Would like to learn to Tango?
Do you dance the light Fandango?
Teach you how before we're done.
Anyone can make it two
Any two can turn to one
And the melody's lost
Before the song's begun
Well, we sound so good together
And so poorly sung alone
Your harmony's an open breeze
Into my sheltered home.
I can teach you how to sing and dance
With a song and dance routine
And when my party's over
You can fall in love... with me.
Life
It's ever so strange
It's so full of change
Think that you've worked it out
Then bang
Right out of the blue
Somethin' happens to you
To throw you off course 
And then you
Breakdown
Yeah, you breakdown
Don't you breakdown
Listen to me
Because
It's just a ride, it's just a ride
No need to run, no need to hide
It'll take you 'round and 'round
Sometimes you're up, sometimes you're down
It's just a ride, it's just a ride
Don't be scared, don't hide your eyes
It may feel so real inside
But don't forget, it's just a ride
Truth
We don't wanna hear (don't wanna hear)
It's too much to take (too much to take)
Don't like to feel out of control
So we make our plans (we make our plans)
Ten times a day (ten times a day)
And when they don't go our way we
Breakdown
Yeah, we breakdown
Don't you breakdown
Listen to me
Because
It's just a ride, it's just a ride
No need to run, no need to hide
It'll take you 'round and 'round
Sometimes you're up, sometimes you're down
It's just a ride, it's just a ride
Don't be scared, don't hide your eyes
It may feel so real inside
But don't forget, it's just a ride
Slowly
Oh so very slowly
Accept that 
There's no getting off
So live it
Just gotta go with it
'Cause this ride's 
Never gonna stop (stop, stop, stop)
Breakdown
Don't you breakdown
No need to breakdown
No need, at all
Because 
It's just a ride, it's just a ride
No need to run, no need to hide
It'll take you all around
Sometimes you're up, sometimes you're down
It's just a ride, it's just a ride
Don't be scared, now dry your eyes
It may feel so real inside
But don't forget, enjoy the ride
It's just a ride, it's just a ride
No need to run, no need to hide
It'll take you all around
Sometimes you're up, sometimes you're down
It's just a ride, it's just a ride
Don't be scared, now dry your eyes
It may feel so real inside
But don't forget, enjoy the ride
Oh lori
Written by Billy Alessi and Bobby Alessi
I'd like to stay in love with you
All summer and after fall
I'll keep you warm through the winter
Because I've noticed one thing
This ain't no summer fling
I'd like to ride my bicycle with you
On the handlebars
You'd laugh and run away
And I'd chase you through the meadow
Without you I'd die
Let's never say good-bye
Oh, Lori
You bring the spring, the summer, fall
Ooh and winter
By the season
Oh, Lori (oh, Lori)
You make me feel as though I've been born again
Born again
You danced for me in your bare feet
That mellow afternoon
When we made love to each other
And I'm loving you
That's all I want to do
Oh, Lori
You bring the spring, the summer, fall
Ooh and winter
By the season
Oh, Lori (oh, Lori)
You make me feel as though I've been born again
Born again
In dresses white, all set for sail
A little girl dreams of taking the veil
In dresses white, all set for sail
A little girl dreams of taking the veil
On beaches clean of sand and shell
A little girl dreams of taking the veil
All lightning bright and thunder loud
A little girl dreams safe and sound
Oh when the cold wind blows
I feel it to the bone
Oh when you say you know
I feel I'm not alone
And even though I may return
To empty places on my own
Where I remember everything you want me to forget
Then you provide the parachute
When I am falling like a stone
And I remember there's a life 
That I have not lived yet
You and I, truth and lies
I've been fooling myself too long
You and I, breaking ties
How could we be so right 
And so wrong?
I hear the words you say
Your mouth against my skin
My world just falls away
You light me from within
And even though I may return
To empty places on my own
Where I remember everything you want me to forget
Then you provide the parachute
When I am falling like a stone
And I remember there's a life 
That I have not lived yet
You and I, truth and lies
I've been fooling myself too long
You and I, breaking ties
How could we be so right
And so wrong?
Truth and lies
Breaking ties
So I look in your direction
But you pay me no attention, do you?
I know you don't listen to me
Cause you say you see straight through me, don't you?
But on and on from the moment I wake, to the moment I sleep 
I'll be there by your side, just you try and stop me
I'll be waiting in line, just to see if you care
Oh??Did you want me to change?
But I'd change for good
And I want you to know that you'll always get your way
I wanted to say??
Don't you shiver, shiver 
Sing it loud and clear, I'll always be waiting for you
So you know how much I need you
But you never even see me, do you?
And is this my final chance of getting you?
And on and on from the moment I wake, to the moment I sleep
I'll be there by your side, just you try and stop me
I'll be waiting in line, just to see if you care, if you care
Oh??Did you want me to change?
Well I'd change for good
And I want you to know that you'll always get your way
I wanted to say??
Don't you shiver, don't you shiver
Sing it loud and clear, I'll always be waitin' for you
Yeah I'll always be waiting for you
Yeah I'll always be waiting for you
Yeah I'll always be waiting for you, for you
I will always be waiting??
And it's you I see but you don't see me
And it's you I hear so loud and so clear
I sing it loud and clear and I'll always be waiting for you
So I look in your direction
But you pay me no attention
And you know how much I need you
But you never even see me
All the bedroom lights go out
As the neighbourhood gets quiet
Everything in heaven and earth is almost right
But there's a wife whos wondering where her husband could be tonight
And when the phone rang only once she took a dreadful fright
Little things just seem to undermine her confidence in him
He was late this time last week
Who can she turn to when the chance of coincidence is slim
'Cause the baby isn't old enought to speak
There's been a long honeymoon
She thought too late and spoke too soon
There's no money back guarantee on future happiness
There's been a long honeymoon
If he's out on a date then her life's in ruins
She never thought her love could ever be as strong as this
All the movies and the papers
Feature the murders of lonely women
If he isn't in by ten she'll call up her best friend
Why doesn't he come home
Why does her friends phone keep on ringing
Maybe she should just pretend
Razors edge
Outlines the dead
Incisions in my head
Anticipation the stimulation
To kill the exhilaration
Inert flesh
A bloody tomb
A decorated splatter brightens the room
An execution a sadist ritual
Mad intervals of mind residuals
Close your eyes
Look deep in your soul
Step outside yourself
And let your mind go
Frozen eyes stare deep in your mind as you die
Close your eyes
And forget your name
Step outside yourself
And let your thoughts drain
As you go insane... go insane
Innate seed
To watch you bleed
A demanding physical need
Desecrated eviscerated
Times perpetuated
Close your eyes
Look deep in your soul
Step outside yourself
And let your mind go
Close your eyes and forget your name
Step outside yourself and let your thoughts drain
Close your eyes
Look deep in your soul
Step outside yourself
And let your mind go
Frozen eyes stare deep in your mind as you die
Close your eyes and forget your name
Step outside yourself and let your thoughts drain
As you go insane... go insane
Close your eyes and forget your name
Step outside yourself and let your thoughts drain
As you go insane... go insane
My hands are down I can no longer masquerade
You're just like poison in my veins killing me inside
I know you tell everyone I'm what's her name
But you're story tends to change when you look in my eyes
Uh oh 
Do you really wanna know?
Don't waste another minute of my precious time
The social strain is watching you out with all your friends
With the disgust that you pretend when I walk on by
You wear it well treating me like someone you don't know
But then you call me on the phone to tell me goodnight.
Uh oh 
I think I better go
Before I turn this love into a crime
Uh oh 
Do you really wanna know?
Don't waste another minute of my precious time
You can turn me inside out
You can follow me around
I don't care what you do 
Just as long as you know I'm through
Uh oh 
I think I better go
Before I turn this love into a crime
Uh oh 
*Uh oh* 
Do you really wanna know?
*Uh oh* 
Don't waste another minute of my precious time
Uh oh
*Uh oh* 
Uh oh 
*Uh oh*
Don't wanna think about when you were mine
You are a drug to me
I never ever thought it otherwise
And I love the lies you've told to me
While looking me directly in my eyes
This is not ecstasy, but it's better than cocaine
And you know that I will miss you when you're gone
I'm not equipped to play this game
You know your words,
They don't mean anything to me
They only serve to fatten up the prey
And when it's time to take them to the slaughterhouse
You slice their throats, continue on your way
This is not jeopardy,
And it's not your high school prom.
And you know that I will miss you when you're gone
I'm not equipped to be your mom
You are a drug to me
I never ever thought it otherwise
And I love the lies you've told to me
While looking me directly in my eyes
One, two, three, four
Up above the clouds, it is always a blue sky
Some will try a trick, but you just look them in the eyes
What will they do, when the money runs dry?
Where will they go, when the jet planes can't fly?
When all is said and done I will love you
When all is said and done I'll still love you
Starring out at the stars, you feel helpless and so small
Nothing but closed down bars, no one helps you when you fall
One day this world will be returning to this prime
We'll all be gone, there'll be no more roads to find
When all is said and done I will love you
When all is said and done I'll still love you
The rain came again,
Cleaning the dream and it always makes me cry, oh my
Something about the rain, it sends memories through my vains
Memories always stain, you can't wash them down the drain
Where will I go when my broken body dies?
And what will I know when I look up to the skies?
When all is said and done will you love me? (x2)
The rain came again, cleaning the dream
And it always makes me cry, oh my
Up above the clouds, it is always a blue sky
Es así: No es verdad y nada es tan cierto
Por ahí parece haber asomando un cuerpo.
Puede ser su cuerpo.
Quieren ver adonde van tomados de la mano
y, verán, los espiarán, y todo es tan humano
¡Humano! ¡Qué espanto! Humano
Quiero pararlos, quiero enseñarles,
pero no acierto
Ya pasó la eternidad
¿Adónde están los muertos?
Muertos
Do you remember the day we left the Earth?
I thought it was for good
It's been two years since then I think
At the time we thought we should
But I miss the blues, I'll miss the greens
I liked humans more than machines
Our families are so far away
As we floated around in space
But even though we miss our friends
The love we share will never end
Internation space station 
Join your arms across our nations
The time has come to return to Earth
But we must back our things first
Don't cry 
We'll be back soon
From up so high
Beyond the moon
Sexy girl, sexy girl
Sexy girl, sexy girl
Wenn ich sehe, wie du um die Ecke gehst
Wie du swingst und dich noch mal locker umdrehst
Und dein Rock - Schock - der ist doch indiskret
Ich mach die Augen zu, sonst ist alles zu spät
Hier ist sie, die Wirklichkeit
Dein Rock ist ein megakurzes Mini-Kleid
Sexy girl, sexy girl
Sexy girl, sexy girl
Wenn ich sehe, was mit deinem Mund passiert
Wie der plötzlich immer weicher, nasser, größer wird
Magnet-Mund, rot verschmiert
In der dunklen Ecke hast du alle verführt
Tief rein werfen wir uns in die dicke heiße Luft
wo uns niemand sucht, wo uns niemand sucht
Sexy girl, sexy girl
Sexy girl, sexy girl
Wenn ich sehe, wie du deinen Arsch bewegst
und mal wieder nichts untendrunter trägst
Weil dich dann jeder Blick berührt
und du noch mehr spürst, noch mehr spürst
Sexy girl, sexy girl
Sexy girl, sexy girl
Lay by the wind and show me
The meaning of good love
If I would believe I don't need
True love
Oh... I will do right by you
Oh... I will do right by you
Lay on the wind and lie my side with you
And through and through
Here on the path of love and meaning
From where we come
Oh... I will do right by you
Oh... I will do right by you
Oh... I will do right by you
Oh... I will do right by you
Oh no don't run away
Another moment
Oh no don't run away
Oh... I will do right by you
Oh... I will do right by you
Oh don't run away
Another moment
Stepped on a crack
Thought you had broke your own back
Things that you want 
That you bought and stole
You knocked on the door
Tell me what it's all for
Who am I supposed to be? 
Anyone but me
Got dirt on your face
Still you got something to say
Gonna make it alright
If you find the time
And Heaven adores you
Heaven adores you
Heaven adores you now.
(x2)
I get so busy and I shut you out
And you don't have a clue what that's about
You're probably thinking that I'm getting mad at you
I should take the time to just explain
That you're the onlythat keeps me sane
Cause that would really be the kindest thing to do
Even though there's no one who is closer to my heart
I can see that I have kept you in the dark
Sometimes I forget sometimes I don't think
To show the things I feel and to tell you what I meen
But there is not a day that ever passed by
That I don't thank god
That I've got you in my life
If you have any doubts of what my love is about
I just wanted you to know
I would'nt blame you if you turned away
But I'd be begging you to stop and stay
Your more important to me than I ever
Show
So if your thinking I don't care as much
That I don't appreciate your love
Well I'd be devistade
Sometime I don't think
To show the things I feel and to tell you what I meen
But there is not a day that ever passed by
That I don't thank god
That I've got you in my life
If you have any doubts of what my love is about
I just wanted you to know
I just wanted you to feel what I feel for you
I just wanted you to know
Sometimes I forget
Sometime I don't think
To show the things I feel and to tell you what I meen
But there is not a day that ever passed by
That I don't thank god
That I've got you in my life
If you have any boubts of what my love is about
I just wanted you to know
Sometimes I don't think
To show the things I feel and to tell you what I meen
But there is not a day that ever passed by
That I don't thank god
That I've got you in my life
If you have any doubts of what my love is about
I just wanted you to know
In your letter you didn't say that
The weather would be so dreadful
But I'm so glad to be here
It's just you and me now honey
Far from the west coast
Where you've never been and
You long to see someday
Who'd have thought I'd really visit
A holiday in Rhode Island
I'm so happy just to see you
You're all I dream of honey
Now we can be together
For a few days I am the only one
And you can't wait to get away
'Cause you don't need me now 
And there's no grace in what you say 
I don't believe you now 
I don't even know her 
You could lie in the face or the look 
War is over, I recover 
But you won't be there to see me
And I let go who what I know 
'Cause it can free me now 
I used to wait, I used to pray 
I'm almost sorry that you suffered 
Windows opened I'd be scary
Now my feet don't touch the ground 
Do you believe me now 
There you can see me now 
Oh, what do you need 
And there's no place and I can't wait 
'Cause I don't need you now 
'Cause I let go from all I know 
'Cause it can free me now 
I don't even know her 
You could lie in the face or the look 
War is over, I recover 
Now my feet don't touch the ground 
Do you believe me now 
There you can see me now 
Oh, what do you need 
War is over, I recover 
I don't even need to fight 
Do you believe me now 
There you can see me now

Put out your hand
Open up your heart
How can I love you when we're so far apart?
And all I want is your love
All I want is your love
Put out your hand
Open up your mind
How can you love me then just leave me behind?
When all I want is your love
When all I want is your love
Here I am waiting for you
Here I am all alone
Here I am waiting for you
Tell me what went wrong
All I-I-I want is your love
All I want is your love
I want your love
Tell me that you love me
That you're never going leave me
That you're never gonna hurt me
That you never will deceive me
That you're thinking that you'll see me
That you're always thinking of me
Tell me
You want my love
You want my love
Put out your hand
Open up your heart
How can I love you when we're so far apart?
When all I want is your love
All I want is your love
Here I am waiting for you
Here I am all alone
Here I am waiting for you
Tell me what went wrong
All I want is your love
All I want is your love
I want your love
I want your love
Oh
Yeah
I want your love
I want your love
Oh, I want your love
We work late and I pretend that I don't notice when you're next to me
But I do
I might be mistaken but I sometimes get the feeling that you notice too
And I know this place that's near here
Quiet dark and small
When we're finished here
I think that I may want a beer
How 'bout you
It'd be nice to go out drinking with you
You would think that we've danced around each other long enough to know
Where to stand
But my heart stops in a panic
When I think how it would feel to finally hold your hand
So we wait for this to happen
Or make it happen now.
Either way I think
That we should start off with a drink
Maybe two
It'd be nice to go out drinking with you
No big deal
We can play it nice and cool and keep the pressure off
Invite our friends
We'll have a few too many
We'll discreetly share a cab home when the evening ends
When we reach that awkward moment
Standing at your door
We won't even know 'cause we'll just smile and let it go
Sail on through
It'd be nice to go out drinking with you.
Take off your shoes, hang up your wings
Stack up the chairs, roll up the rug
Savor the things that sobriety brings
Drain in the last from a jug
But when I hit the bottle, there's no tellin' what I'll do
'Cause something deep inside me wants to turn you black and blue
I can't resist you, I can't wait
To twist your loving arms 'til you capitulate
Beat me in the kitchen, and I'll beat you in the hall
There's nothing I love better than a free for all
To take your pretty neck and see which way it bends
But when it is all over we will still be friends
Wave a white flag, put away the pistol
Too many people just can't get kissed
But if there's nothin' I can do to make amends, baby
Hope you don't murder me
Oh, was it all right, or was it okay
I'll make it all up to you someday
Oh, but you didn't have to laugh that way
Oh, no, you didn't have to laugh that way
Wave a white flag, put away the pistol
Too many people just can't get kissed
But if there's nothin' I can do to make amends, baby
Hope you don't murder me
Gee, baby, hope you don't murder me
I think it's winter now 'cause it's already dark
Can't tell by the temperature 'cause it's always warm
Tidal waves, eruptions, plagues and thunder storms
In times like this, we cannot say we have not been warned
But to turn back now we've come too far, so
We're speeding into the dark
What do you know?
Keep on going
Just press that foot on the gas
What do you care?
Just keep on going
We're speeding into the dark
What do you know?
Keep on going
Just press that foot on the gas
What do you care?
Just keep on going
Oh beautiful world of mine
What have I done to my paradise?
They say everything is gonna be alright
Yeah damn sure it will
See many men it will take to survice
To prevail we must kill
And when this game is over
And the last values have been sold out
When the last fish the last tree are no more
Oh brotherman is it that you'll slow down
We're speeding into the dark
What do you know?
Keep on going
Just press that foot on the gas
What do you care?
Just keep on going
We're speeding into the dark
What do you know?
Keep on going
Just press that foot on the gas
What do you care?
Just keep on going
Just keep on going
Just keep on going
Just keep on going
Just keep on going
You're wet around the edge
Tired of swimming upstream
You thought you'd just rest a while
But you were still swept back to me
Swept back to me
Swept back to all the grief and the worry
Swept back
Swept back
But I know you don't deserve to be broken
So just focus on the light
Focus on the light
Well we push and we pull
But still at least we never feel empty
And can't we just pretend
That I'm an island in your sea
Let's give in before we're swept
Smacked up again behind the door
Begging please give me some more
A vein that's open for the day
Feel the pulse beneath the skin
And smiling as it all begins
Oh where have you been?
Judy's staring at the sun
Judy's staring at the sun
Judy's fantasy has come
So amplify this little one
She's a volume freak
She hears as much as she can see
And what she sees she can't believe
It's just what Judy needs a moment of release
To give her peace peace peace
Judy's starting at the sun
Judy's day passed out of sight
Judy will be suffering tonight
She's suffering
She passed by and said goodbye to him
And in a rare and lucid state
She said my days are unoriginal
I wanna fade, fade, fade
She's suffering
Judy's staring at the sun
Judy's day passed out of sight
Judy will be suffering tonight
Abre os teus armários
Eu estou a te esperar
para ver deitar o sol
sob os teus braços castos
Cobre a culpa vã
até amanhã eu vou ficar
e fazer do teu sorriso um abrigo
Canta que é no canto que eu vou chegar
Canta o teu encanto que é pra me encantar
Canta para mim
qualquer coisa assim sobre você
Que explique a minha paz
Tristeza nunca mais
Vale o meu pranto
que esse canto em solidão
Nessa espera o mundo gira em linhas tortas
Abre essa janela
primavera quer entrar
pra fazer da nossa voz uma só nota.
Canto que é de canto que eu vou chegar
Canto e toco um canto que é pra te encantar
Canto para mim qualquer coisa assim sobre você
que explique a minha paz
Tristeza nunca mais

Wir sind die Clowns
Im Zirkus des Lebens
Alle Träume ein Zelt
Und die Domteure Propheten
Besoffen an uns selbst
Auf diesem blauen Planten
Hat jede Flucht ein Gehäge
Ist jeder Club die Manege
Es ist wie unten zu sein
und nach oben zu steigen
es ist verloren meist
unausgewogen wie Zeiten des Leidens
und aufgehoben wie Geigen
für diesen einen Moment
um unkosequent aufzuboren
und konsequent auf den Boden
maßlos zu überspannen
wie diese Landungsbrücken
über die wir rannten
als wir raus waren
und so sehr danaben
nicht im Stande
uns zu leben
doch so weit davon entfernt
uns dabei auch zu geben
es gab nie ein dagegen
nur unser klangheimliches Elend
und es fand uns wieder zum Glück
fand es wieder zu uns zurück
Wir sind die Clowns
Im Zirkus des Lebens
Alle Träume ein Zelt
Und die Domteure Propheten
Besoffen an uns selbst
Auf diesem blauen Planten
Hat jede Flucht ein Gehäge
Ist jeder Club die Manege
gehts oder gehts
Jeder bei Lars sagt ein Witz
Der Applaus ist vergebens
Und der Fall ohne Netz
während man stolpert und fällt
bei diesem Seiltanz am Boden
ist der Erfolg nur Jonglage
und jeder Salto verlogen
People, places
Pursuing the chases
Our moments were chosen
Her senses explosion
Take your pulse and read it well
She never said you'd only get one chance
Pay your debt and bleed as well
You're living in the same circumstances
The end of an era
Our future no clearer
My people no stronger
The blame I lay on her
Wonderland, wonderland
It's beautiful
Wonderland, wonderland
It's beautiful
Take your pulse and read it well
She never said you'd only get one chance
Pay your debt and bleed as well
You're living in the same circumstances
The end of an era
Our future no clearer
My people no stronger
The blame I lay on her
The Robin's song in Winter
Brings Virginity to a close
Beware the wrecking angel
Jackals gather, jackals know
From within This Glass Coffin
A Deeper Shade Of Brown
From within This Glass Coffin
A Storm Swept into town
With 13 glasses
And, 1 last Toast
To the coming of The Swarm
For our Holy Ghost
We say Goodbye
To The Now
We say Goodbye
Vapour trail
It's A Good Sign
If You Understand
What flies, what flies symbolize
It's A Good Sign
(A little underhand?)
What flies, what flies symbolize,...
This Butterfly Effect
It's got a Heart in Your Pain
Ghosts settle on You
Sun weeps for You
For Twilight has come
Flying close to The Sun
With Fabian's Stick
Grieving not weeping
The Robin's song in Winter
Brings virginity to a close
Beware the wrecking angel
Jackals gather, jackals know
From within This Glass Coffin
A deeper shade of Brown
From within This Glass Coffin
A Storm swept into town
With 13 glasses

Should I write myself out of the history books
And mark a place in time for every chance you took?
Don't get me wrong, I know you've got your life in place
I've yet to take a hint
Someday, I'm sure I'll get the picture, stop waiting up
When it all comes down to a sunrise on the East side
Will you be there to carry home
The remains of my wasted youth
This wasted time on you has left me shaking in waiting
Shaking in waiting for something more
Tonight is alive with the promise of a street-fight
And there's money on the table
Says your cheap-shots won't be able to break bones
I've yet to break a sweat, I'll make your past regret
It's future, here's to you
When it all comes down to a sunrise on the East side
Will you be there to carry home
The remains of my wasted youth
This wasted time on you has left me
Shaking in waiting for something more
Make all of my decisions for me
I've never taken the fall for deceit
I'll keep a secret if you keep me guessing
The taste of your lips says we shouldn't have met like-
Make all of my decisions for me
I've never taken the fall for deceit
We'll keep a secret if you keep me guessing
The taste of your lips says we shouldn't have met like this
I can keep a secret if you can keep me guessing
The flavor of your lips is enough to keep me pressing
For more than just a moment of truth between the lies told
To pull ourselves away from the lives we leave back-
(I can keep a secret if you can keep me guessing)
The flavor of your lips is enough to keep me here, keep me here
When it all comes down to a sunrise on the East side
Will you be there to carry me home
The remains of my wasted youth
This wasted time on you has left me
Shaking in waiting for something more
In times without changes
Changes in life
Life without reason
Wondering why
Why keep searching
Seeking someone
Someone to guide me
My guiding light
Guiding light
I know the answers
And you know who I am
Tell me your vision
And take your stand
Times I remember
All of my lies
One through eleven
My memory dies
Times without changes
Changes in life
Life without reason
That ball of fire
That sits beside me
He beats the earth
And Jesus loves him
His days are long
His bones are broken
I served him right
I go to heaven
The glooming's quiet
And soon before him
His body's warm
And can't support us
My body's young
And here to please him
I served him right
I go to heaven
That ball of fire
That sits beside me
He beats the earth
And Jesus loves him
His days are long
His bones are broken
I served him right
I go to heaven
Mare nubium, umbriel
Mare imbrium, ariel
Et itur ad astra, et itur ad astra
Mare undarum, Io vela
Mirabile dictu, mirabilia
Mirabile visu, mirabilia
Et itur ad astra, et itur ad astra
Sempervirent, rosetum
Afer ventus, zephyrus
Volturnus, Africus
Et itur ad astra, et itur ad astra
Etesiarum eurus
Suus cuique mos, suum cuique
Meus mihi, suus cuique carus
Mememto terrigena, mememto vita brevis
Meus mihi, suus cuique carus
Mais tout ce qui s'est passé
Glisse à côté
Comme l'eau sur les joues
Rester comme ça attaché
Quand l'autre a quitté
Et tous ce mots qu'on a dit
Mot qu'on a fuit
Où sont ils allés
Rester comme ça attaché
Ne peut rien changer
Alors va
Je laisse le vent emporter tout
Laisse le vent prendre soin de tout
Je laisse le vent emporter tout
Laisse le vent prendre soin de tout
Je t'ai rêvé homme sans pied
Dieu ou névé
Ou comme un bruit doux
Là j'irai bien te chercher
J'ai tellement changé
Mais tout ce qui c'est passé
Glisse à côté
Comme l'eau sur les joues
Quand je t'ai pris par la main
C'etait un matin
Bien
Je laisse le vent emporter tout
Laisse le vent prendre soin de tout
Je laisse le vent emporter tout
Laisse le vent prendre soin de nous
Ist der Weg das Ziel,
führ'n alle Wege dorthin -
oder nur im Kreis.
Bin ich der ich war,
das was morgen geschah,
war ich immer schon da?
Wo gehst du hin, wo kommst du her?
Gibt es da vielleicht noch mehr,
von deiner Art?
Nichts ist wie es war,
und langsam wird dir klar,
dass da was Grosses war.
Es war immer schon da.
Es war immer hier,
tief in dir,
tief in dir.
Die Antwort liegt in dir,
lebt in dir,
lebt in dir.
Ist das Leben ein Traum,
gebor'n aus Schall und Rauch?
Träumst du immer noch?
Ob die Welt sich ewig dreht?
Gibt es was, das dich bewegt,
dir den Kopf verdreht?
Bringt mir der Tod ewiges Leben?
Sind uns're Sünden längst vergeben,
oder niemals mehr?
Alles wie es war,
und langsam wird dir klar,
dass da was Grosses naht.
Gehst auf grosse Fahrt.

Christmas time is here
Happiness and cheer
Fun for all that children call
Their favorite time of the year
Snowflakes in the air
Carols everywhere
Olden times and ancient rhymes
Of love and dreams to share
Sleigh bells in the air
Beauty everywhere
Yuletide by the fireside
And joyful memories there
Christmas time is here
We'll be drawing near
Oh that we could always see
Such spirit through the year
Sleigh bells in the air
Beauty everywhere
Yuletide by the fireside
And joyful memories there
Christmas time is here
We'll be drawing near
Oh that we could always see
Such spirit through the year
Christmas time is here
Ben Kweller:
Well I held you with our undry eyes
Happy years pass by
It's ok to cry
The Bens:
After all
In the end
Just pretend
Ben Lee:
Well it's sticks and stones and broken homes
That taught us how to smile
The Bens:
After all
In the end
Just pretend

There's a name that plays in my head
Like a song
All day long she's with me every day
The Bens:
After all
In the end
Just pretend

Everyone needs
Ben Kweller:
If the sun can shine
You'll be just fine
Look into your mind
Where you're free
The Bens:
After all
In the end
Just pretend
Ben Lee:
'Cause we hurt each other once before
Lets not do that again
The Bens:
After all
In the end
Just pretend
Ben Folds:
And a voice so fimilar
Wakes me up in the middle
She thinks I'm having a bad dream
The Bens:
After all
In the end
Just pretend
The Bens:
Everyone needs
Everyone needs
Everyone needs
Ben Kweller:
After all... it's the end...
I know I may be wishing
On a world
That may never be
But I'll keep on wishing 
No matter how hopeless
Or foolish
It may seem
I'll keep on wishing 
I'll toss my coins in the fountain
Look for clovers in grassy lawns
Search for shooting stars in the night
Cross my fingers and dream on
I know I may be dreaming
Of a world
Far from present day reality
But I'll keep on dreaming
No matter how unrealistic
Or naive
It may seem
Always keep dreaming
And toss your coins in the fountain
Look for clovers in grassy lawns
Search for shooting stars in the night
Cross your fingers and dream on
We must always be thinking
Of a world
As a place of infinite possibilities
And always keep thinking
No matter how hopeless
Or foolish
It may seem
Always keep thinking
And toss our coins in the fountain
Look for clovers in grassy lawns
Search for shooting stars in the night
Cross our fingers and dream on
I'll keep on wishing
We must always keep dreaming
Of a world
With equality and justice
Thinking
There could be a world
Without poverty and sickness
Wishing
Of a world
Without hunger and homelessness
Dreaming
Of a world
Where all people live in peace
Dreaming
Of a world
Dreaming
On a world

From The Shore
Open my veins for your sorrow
Poison seeps into
Waving like a lake
Into strangest heavens
Thru life shun
Free waters
Waters heave
Free they seem
From this shore a stone
Laid on your shoulders
The stone's poem is mine
4 AM, I watch you sleep,
I pray to God your soul to keep.
You sound asleep, but I feel pain,
You're in my thoughts, you're in my head again.
I wonder what you dream, when you dream,
Do you feel what I feel?
My head is numb, 
My eyes are red, 
My soul is weak, 
My heart's like lead, 
But you make it go away.
Because you're real
Because you're real
Because you're acclaim
My head is numb, 
My eyes are red, 
My soul is weak, 
My heart's like lead, 
But you make it go away.
Because you're real
Because you're real
Because you're acclaim

Lay only leopard flowers upon my path
Lined by the drummers and scent of Aragon
Faith is difficult and nuture is all?
Signed on the path from Aragon
Like an ideal falling, tumbling to earth
Its wings broken so like wisdom
Grey steel holes
Open behind me
Dark pink scars
Run along beside me
Endless pointless
Gaping chasm
Ill-chosen, disappointing
With litte meaning
Snow-white ferocity
Your image did deceive me
Like an ideal falling, tumbling to earth
Its wings broken so like wisdom
Grey steel holes
Open behind me
Dark pink scars
Run along beside me
Lay only leopard flowers upon my path
Lined by the drummers and spears of Aragon
Faith is difficult and nurture is all?
Signed on my path from arrogance
Lay only leopard flowers upon my path
Lined by the drummers and scent of Aragon
Faith is difficult and murder them all
Signed on the path from Aragon
Por el amor de una mujer
Jugué con fuego sin saber
Que era yo quien me quemaba
Bebí en las fuentes del placer
Hasta llegar a comprender
Que no era a mi a quien amaba
Por el amor de una mujer
He dado todo cuanto fuí
Lo más hermoso de mi vida
Mas ese tiempo que perdí
Ha de servirme alguna vez
Cuando se cure bien mi herida
Todo me parece
Como un sueño todavía
Pero sé que al fin
Podré olvidar un día
Hoy me siento triste
Pero pronto cantaré
Y prometo no acordarme nunca
Del ayer
Por el amor de una mujer
Llegué a llorar y enloquecer
Mientras ella se reía
Rompí en pedazos un cristal
Dejé mis venas desangrar
Pues no sabía lo que hacía
Por el amor de una mujer
He dado todo cuanto fuí
Lo más hermoso de mi vida
Mas ese tiempo que perdí
Ha de servirme alguna vez
Cuando se cure bien mi herida
The sailboat won't be long
The ocean is in the tub
My foot in one the plug
It's pulling me down the drain
I wish I'd never lied
To you in bed that day
If I was wrong or right
Does it matter much anyway?
Never let it bring you down
When it's falling rain on the ground
Never let it bring you down
I wish you were around
The fish float through the room
Nibbling on the moon
The sun sets in your eyes
Scenes of summer skies
The towel is on the floor
But is it worth fighting for?
Never let is bring you down
When it's falling rain on the ground
Never let it bring you down
I wish you were around
Aunque sientas dolor 
Sigues continuando, subiendo, continuando
Aunque tengas temor
Sigues continuando, cruzando, continunado 
Pues la vida siempre te dara,
Un camino, unico a ti
Con tiempo veras 
Con tiempo veras
Aunque tengas preguntas
Sigues continuando, buscando, continunado 
Aunque baje la sombra 
Sigues continuando, navegando, continunado
Algunas veces, tal un capitan
Naveguaras en tu soledad
Hacia tu tierra (x2)
Aunque dañan tus sueños
Sigues continuando, sembrando, continuando,
Hasta los dias tranquilos 
Sigues continunado, explorando tus deseos
La vida es un mar tan bravo 
Abraza los momentos lindos
La suerte es caprichosa
Quieta y digna, atraviesa
La fortuna y la miser
In a dream
In a place
Where the far reaches of this mind
I have seen a true nightmare
With the kiss of lovers lips
What a friendly offer
Just a memory
It still hurts
When I think that once
She was mine
Because I'm lost for words
With one last breath
For me to take from you
Now gasp for air
There's nothing left
For me to take from you
I guess it's only right
To give someone what they need
Even if it's nothing they ever
Wanted in the first place
I've seen with my own two eyes
The hurt and pain
That love causes
That's why I won't let you
Go down that road
To emotional overdose
If I had her again
Everything would be alright
But nothing's alright
And nothing's ok
When you live in a memory
I'm lost for words
With one last breath
For me to take from you
Now gasp for air
There's nothing left
For me to take from you
Just a breakdown of the heart
I'm lost for words that won't mean a thing
A tragic ending
A farewell to
A friendship that meant
Nothing at all
You let her in
You let her win
Is there anything else
To break or mend a bond as strong as ours
That wallow all through life
All through life
I'm lost for words
With one last breath
For me to take from you
Now gasp for air
There's nothing left
For me to take from you
One two, one two
Don't you go and let the world weigh you down
Should you ever fall, I'm gon' be around
Pick you up, keep you away from harm
Free from all the stress and take within my arms
Take away the way to ease the pain
When our day is done, we shall be one
So don't you go and let the world bring you down
If you ever fall, I'm gon' be around
I'm gon' be around
Don't you go and, let the world weigh you down
If you ever fall, I'm gon' be around
So don't you go and let the world bring you down
Should you ever fall, I'm gon' be around
Pick you up, keep you away from harm
And when our day is done, then we shall be one
We shall be one
Driving around, living the dream
I'm cruising the town, diggin' the scene
I'm not gonna stress, I'm not gonna worry
Doing our best, no need to hurry
Looking ahead with anticipation
Making each day a new celebration
Seems like it could go on forever
Long as we can all stay together
We used to get around
Get up and hit up all the hot spots in town
Spring vacation, good vibration
Summer weather, we're back together
Easy money, ain't life funny
Hey, what's it to ya, hallelujah
As for the past, it's all behind us
Happier now, look where life finds us
Singing our songs is enough reason
Harmony, boys, is what we believe in
Some said it wouldn't last
All we can say is we're still having a blast
Spring vacation, good vibration
Summer weather, we're back together
Easy money, ain't life funny
Hey, what's it to ya, hallelujah
Every night's a special occasion
Spring vacation, good vibration
Summer weather, we're back together
Easy money, ain't life funny
Hey, what's it to ya, hallelujah
Spring vacation, good vibration
Bitter hate 
Fuels my existence
Emptiness fills time
A constant state 
Of mental illness
Self worth decreasing
Demoralize
Drown myself in a
Black sea of agony
-Solo-
My conscience with grief
Led myself astray once more
Nothing seems real
Disillusional shadow
Impassable
Screaming
Impassable
Visionless
Impassable 
Screaming 
In oblivion
-Acoustic solos-
Soon the suffering will end
These blackened memories 
Controlling me
A living hell for me
Every waking minute 
That I'm breathing
Impassable
Screaming
Impassable
Visionless
Impassable 
Screaming 
In oblivion
Impassable
Screaming
Impassable
Visionless
Impassable 
Screaming 
In oblivion
Dag en nacht
En wij daartussen
Jouw kussen zacht
Op mijn natte-dromen-wang
Bang van komen en jouw gaan
Slaap lekker ding
Want jij is lastig
Nog meer jij is fantastig toch
Slaap lekker ding
Want jij is lastig
Nog meer jij is fantastig toch
Glimlach lag
In veel te grote tas
Klein te zijn
Fijn tussen vingers
Groot geheim
Slaap lekker ding
Want jij is lastig
Nog meer jij is fantastig toch
Slaap lekker ding
Want jij is lastig
Nog meer jij is fantastig toch
Laten we samen
Dingen doen zingen
Van Liedjes die niet bestaan
Laten we samen 
Dingen doen zingen
Laten we samen niet bestaan
Slaap lekker ding
Want jij is lastig
Nog meer jij is fantastig toch
Slaap lekker ding
Want jij is lastig
Nog meer jij is fantastig toch
Nog meer jij is fantastig toch
Nog meer jij is fantastig toch
My veins are poppin' from this love inside
I just can't let it out
This pipe and these needles are my only guide
They've got me on the wrong route
What is my life about?
Living in the shadows of a man I've never seen
Dreamin' like a lonely child
I know your brothers and your sister and your mother too
Man I wish that you could see them too
Oh Lord
Oh Lord
Man I wish that you could see them too
Man I wish that you could see them too
So can I come to see you sometime
'Cause I been missin' you
I've never heard you cry I've never seen you whine
I'm feeling oh so young
But still I must die to get to you
And if I do I wonder how just you will see me
And implicate the things I've done
I'm dyin' in the shadows of this man I've never seen
I'll see you soon
Now where's my gun?
Oh Lord
Oh Lord
Oh Lord
Where's my gun?
Oh where's my gun?
Oh Lord
Where's my gun?
Oh Lord
My gun
Let me open your eyes
Let me see who you are
I am you, you are me
We are a part of
The second coming of Christ
It's God himself in a jar
Yeah... yeah
Yeah... yeah
Let me open your eyes
Let me see who you are
I am you, you are me
We are a part of
The second coming of Christ
Its God himself in a jar
Yeah
Hey
You got me, sad and lonely
When I'm me... me
You know you make me so lonely
I am so alone
And I will pray and then I'll cry
And I will pray and then I'll cry
And I will pray and then I'll cry
And I will pray and then I'll cry
Don't know if I want you to understand me
Don't know if I want you to understand me
Don't know if I want you to understand me
Or go
Don't know if I want you to see through me
I confess this heavy heart, has me on my knees
Don't know if I want you to see through me,
Or go
Or go
Or go
Or go
Cause it feels like static when you're here
Static when you're gone
Static everywhere
Static every time
Love come and bless me, show me how it feels
Been here time before, and it wasn't real
Don't know if I want you to understand me
Or go
Can't blame you dove, when the blame is mine
To love and let go, was never the design
Don't know if I want you to see through me
Or go
Cause it feels like static when you're here
Static when you're gone
Static everywhere
Static every time
Everytime
Even as my demons leave
Unsure if I want you to see through me
I Don't know if I want you to understand me
Or go
Let go
Go go...(repeat till fade)
Kai tu mane glostai,
Manyje mažiau purvo
Ir sudega sostai
Ir iškrenta durklai
Aš lieku be ginklo
Be jokios išeities
Šilkas ant tavo peties
Yo no sé qué será de mi ahora
Yo no sé qué será de tí.
Habrá que esperar.
Decidir, elegir, qué llevar, qué queda
Embalar, viajar??
¿Qué será de mi jardín sin agua que lo riegue?
Vaca que cambia de querencia??
¿Deberé o no volver? Me arriesgaré aunque no quiera
Deberé salir a ver para entender que yo no sé qué será de mi
¿Que haré?
Look at where you've got yourself now
You think the world is trying to bring you down
You think that moving on
Means getting passed around
But every move you make
Just takes you further down
These are simple times
And now I miss your simple pleasures
A substance state of mind
What I had left to treasure
I know it's been a while
But I swear you wouldn't be so lonely
If only you'd let me in
So look at you now
The spark in your eyes is gone, somehow
I wish you would hang up and turn around
And let me see those eyes
They'd be the same brown eyes
I can't help thinking so much about
How such a girl could dig a hole so deep
You can't find a way to get out
I'm not a helping hand
I'm a rope to pull you through
Just give me, give one more chance
To turn you back to you
Take this feeble mind
And mold it into something better
And help me realize that I won't live forever
I know it's been a while
But I swear you wouldn't be so lonely
If only you'd let me in
So look at you now
The spark in your eyes is gone, somehow
I wish you would hang up and turn around
And let me see those eyes
They'd be the same brown eyes
You're not here
Every night is a nightmare
So look at me now
The spark in my eyes is gone, somehow
I wish I could stand up and turn around
And let you see my eyes
They'd be the same brown eyes
It is dangerous
To put this into words
But I'm alright
Close to fulfilment
I miss you
I miss you
And anyway
I just wanted to show you
I'm yours now
Empty and cynical
Lost
In gratitude
In gratitude
It is dangerous
To put this into words
But I know in time
We'll get out of this mess
We'll get out of this mess
And anyway
I just wanted to show you
Some happiness
I wanted to show you the stars
I want to show you the stars
And we'll go
Just hit the ground running
Just hit the ground running, I know
Just hit the ground running
And won't look back
Just hit the ground running
Just hit the ground running
Just hit the ground running
And won't look back
Just hit the ground running
Just hit the ground running, I know
Just hit the ground running
And won't look back
You might as well surrender now
You'll never hold that stance
With all my words
I can't find one
To help you understand
It's not too late
Take up the cup
Put down your weapons and choose
But you say life's so unfair
Oh you say life's so unfair
You can ill aford to hold to this views
You need something to blame
But it's you
Yes it's you
It's your truth
Someone made you
I don't know, if you're sick
I confort
You run away
My simpathy
You twist it
Your reflex gets in the way
You mother me
I son you
You act up
I can't get through
This foosteps
So ancient
In your eyes
I'm your infant
Your ancient
Full circle
In my eyes
You're my infant
Dead ball in our court
We've got a dead ball in our court
We just say life's so unfair
Yes you say life's so unfair
You need something to blame
But it's you
Yes it's you
It's your truth
dans le ciel
 un soleil rouge
 qui attend
 et soudain
 un homme étrange
 qui descend
 qui se doutera
 que ce Martien
 a bravé l'espace
 pour me demander ma main
 
dans le ciel
 le soleil rouge
 reparti
 mais il brille
 sur la grisaille
 de ma vie
 qui m'accordera
 dans sa pensée
 l'auréole de gloire
 qu'alors je mériterai
 
quand le soleil rouge reviendra
 et loin de la terre m'emmènera
 loin de la terre m'emmènera
 loin de la terre m'emmènera
Whatever it is I do, I try to think about you
I have a love for you that nothing hides
Whatever it is I do, I'm only thinking of you
I hope you look at me through patient eyes
I've become amused
I've become blind
I've become what I know not breathes
You seem illiterate to all my emotions
I stand corrected, how well you read
You speak the truth, you speak the me
You feel the love I have yet to find
I know it's there, I know it's there
But I let the sandcastles kill my mind
Pathetic me, I long to be you
I think I'm close but I stand so far
The turbulent one sheds a turbulent tear
I miss the love only 'cause they starve'
Oil and water, lust and sympathy
I life and death my way through the sun
Where originates all the pain that leaves
My memory a traumatic sponge and sings to you
Well define my love with attitude
Open up your mind and it will sing to you
You can always tell
But I know remorse so well
I left reality early due to the lack of love, reason
Whatever it is I do, I try to think about you
I have a love for you that nothing hides
Whatever it is I do, I'm only thinking of you
I hope you look at me through patient eyes
The channel, a professional liar
How I long to contradict those vibes
Joni help me, I think I'm falling
It's not the love and I quest the why
I don't know, If I'm right, I'm right
But if I'm wrong then show me I'm wrong
The fear of pity is always awake
But infinite sympathy's completely gone
It's the windows, the doors, the passageways to the truth
Oh my God, it echoes the mind
In total recall as wild as the deuce
And so deceiving is the clouded heart
So superficial is the open wound
I caress the infinite light
That even at night overshadows the moon that sings to you
Well, define my love, that lives within you
Even when I die, it will sing to you
You can only tell if remorse has done you well
The misconstrued my answers due to the lack of love, reason
Whatever it is I do, I try to think about you
I seek the sympathy and I can't lie
Whatever it is I do, I'm only thinkin' of you
I hope you look at me through patient eyes
Whatever it is I do, I try to think about you
I seek the sympathy and I can't lie
Whatever it is I do, I'm only thinkin' of you
I hope you look at me through patient eyes
Whatever it is I do, I try to think about you
I seek the sympathy and I can't lie
Whatever it is I do, I'm only thinkin' of you
I hope you look at me through patient eyes
People are strange
When you're a stranger
Faces look ugly
When you're alone
Women seem wicked
When you're unwanted
Streets are uneven
When you're down
When you're strange
Faces come out of the rain
When you're strange
No one remembers your name
When your strange
When your strange
When your strange
When your strange
People are strange
When you're a stranger
Faces look ugly
When you're alone
Women seem wicked
When you're unwanted
Streets are uneven
When you're down
When you're strange
Faces come out of the rain
When you're strange
No one remembers your name
When you're strange
When you're strange
When you're strange
When you're strange
When you're strange
Faces come out of the rain
When you're strange
No one remembers your name
When you're strange
When you're strange
When you're strange
When you're strange
Sweet suburban sky, gonna miss you if you burn
Curse you, when it's our turn, so come now wash your face
In water's full of grace, 'cause only time will tell,
When you'll be willing to sell, your body for one precious taste, then all is left to waste
Sweet suburban sky...
Doctor feels the pain, that caused the sickening rain,
But you continue to compromise, there won't be no alibis,
When there's no water to wash the burning sun from your eyes,
Sweet suburban sky...
So when you finally taste, all of the waste,
Sign of the time, you won't even call it a crime
The water's coming round again, maybe you'll be gone by then
But they won't thank our generation
For the ignorant inclination, 'cause when there's nowhere
Left to hide, maybe then they'll call it genocide...
I like what your t-shirt says:
I'm with stupid and stupid's with me.
Let's climb to the top of the state bridge
Ad see how stupid we can be
'Cause this is the first song but definitely not the song.
I know that you are liquid, for I'm the governess of alone.
The things I've imagined do would really quite astound you
I don't do 'em, I just feel 'em,
And two times two is chicken,
I am your state of mind.
So why can't you be:
Exactly like me?, exactly like me. (x3)
Like Madonna, so emotional,
No car wreck, suicide,
Stairway so unclimbable,
No house to hide inside,
Your house, your house, your house I will explore
Your cold marble floors and secret doors,
The fine lines of your architecture,
And if you need me, I'll come and see thee, and be your visitor,
We'll play kissy kissy and have a baby and figure out,
What we live for.
I am your state of mind.
I am your state of mind.
So why can't you be:
Exactly like me? exactly like me. (x3)
Exactly like me. (x18)
Was brauchen wir zur Erinnerung? Einen marmornen Engel? Eine Steinplatte, auf der die Taten verzeichnet sind? Eine pharaonengleiche Pyramide? Ein schlichtes Blumengebinde? Ein Splitter im Herzen? Ein Gedicht?
Wir beerdigen unsere Vergangenheit mit Pomp in großen Mausoleen mit pathetischen Zeremonien. Lobpreisende Grabreden, tränendurchweichte Seidentücher, Blumenmeere und ein Leichenschmaus. Nach gar nicht allzu langer Zeit ist uns die Grabpflege zu mühsam. Der Gang zum Friedhof zu anstrengend. Haben wir nicht die nötige Ruhe um das Unkraut zu zupfen. Und gegen eine recht ordentliche Summe lassen wir die Gräber unserer Verstorbenen vom Friedhofswärter pflegen. Er wird das Laub entfernen und die kleinen Lichter täglich neu entzünden. Unser Gewissen ist beruhigt und wir können uns zurücklehnen.
Ist es besser, wenn wir die körperliche Hülle auf einer Wiese verscharren? Ohne Pomp und Getöse, da die Erinnerung in unseren Herzen ist. Wir brauchen nicht den täglichen Gang zum gepflegten Grab. Wir haben die Liebe in uns, die uns mit dem Verstorbenen, auch über dessen Ableben hinaus, verbindet. Das ist gut.
Aber was ist mit denen, die keiner kennt? Wer erinnert sich an die? Jener dort, ging er freiwillig auf die andere Seite? War er müde? Konnte er die Realität nicht mehr ertragen? Vielleicht folgte er seiner Liebsten. Und da, ein Kind. Niemand kennt es, weiß seinen Namen. Es war offensichtlich nicht gewollt. Es wird nicht vermisst. Es ging nicht freiwillig ins Wasser. Dazu war es noch viel zu klein. Auch der da, man schnitt ihm die Kehle durch, bevor man ihn in den Fluss warf. Aber wo? Manch einer von denen kam von weit her. Man weiß nicht, wie lange er im Wasser lag. Die Strömung ist stark und möglicherweise trieb er kilometerweit, ohne dass man ihn bemerkte. Warum vermisst sie niemand?
Siehe Wanderer: Die Sonne fällt sanft durch die dichten Laubblätter der alten Bäume. Die Donau rauscht im Hintergrund. Der Blick auf ihre dunklen Wasser ist durch eine Staumauer und Büsche verborgen. Sie hat sie einst alle angespült, die Verlorenen, die Vergessenen, die Ignorierten, die Verzweifelten, die Unbekannten. Nimm dir einen Moment Zeit. Setz dich zu mir auf die knarrende Holzbank, die ein paar gute Menschen einst hierhin stellten als sie all denen einen Platz für die letzte Ruhe gaben. Lass uns erinnern. Lass uns gemeinsam gedenken derer, die hier vergraben sind. Sieh all die schlichten Kreuze, die einfachen Grabsteine. Fällt dir etwas auf? 
Auf den meisten steht nur ein Wort: Namenlos.
Cool me
Cool my fever high
Hold me when I cry
I need it so much
Makes you want to get down crawl like a beggar
For its touch
And all the while it's free as air
Like plants the medicine is everywhere
Love
Love
Love
We crave it so badly
Makes you want to laugh out loud when you receive it
And gobble it like a candy
We think it's easy
Sometimes it's easy
But it's not easy
You're going to break down and cry
We're not important
We should be grateful
And if you're wondering why
Love
Love
Love
The price that we pay
When evil walks the planet
And love is crushed like clay
The master races, the chosen people
The burning temple, the weeping cathedrals
You push me away
Bitterly
My apologies fall on your deaf ears
You curse my name
Bitterly
And now your eyes they look at me
Bitterly
I stand ashamed
Amidst my foolish pride
'Cause for us, there'll be no more
For us, there'll be no more
And now my eyes
They look at you
Bitterly
Bitterly
In my life the piano sings
Brings me words that are not the strength of strings.
Fiery rain and Ruby's cooling sun.
Now I see that my world has only begun.
Notes that roll on winds with swirling wings...
Brings me words that are not the strength of strings. 
In my life the piano sings
Brings me words that are not the strength of strings.
Fiery rain and Ruby's cooling sun.
Now I see that my world has only begun.
Notes that roll on winds with swirling wings...
Brings me words that are not the strength of strings.
How could I stand here
And watch the sun rise
Follow the mountains
Where they touch the sky
Ponder the vastness
And the depths of the sea
And think for a moment
The point of it all was to make much of me
'Cause I'm just a whisper
And You are the thunder and...
I want to make much of You, Jesus
I want to make much of Your love
I want to live today to give You the praise
That You alone are so worthy of
I want to make much of Your mercy
I want to make much of Your cross
I give You my life
Take it and let it be used
To make much of You
And how can I kneel here
And think of the cross
The thorns and the whip and the nails and the spear
The infinite cost
To purchase my pardon
And bear all my shame
To think I have anything worth boasting in
Except for Your name
'Cause I am a sinner
And You are the Savior and..
I want to make much of You, Jesus
I want to make much of Your love
I want to live today to give You the praise
That You alone are so worthy of
I want to make much of Your mercy
I want to make much of Your cross
I give You my life
Take it and let it be used
To make much of You
This is Your love, oh, God
Not to make much of me
But to send Your own Son
So that we could make much of You
For all eternity
And I want to make much of You, Jesus
I want to make much of Your love
I want to live today to give You the praise
That You alone are so worthy of
I want to make much of Your mercy
I want to make much of Your cross
I give You my life
Take it and let it be used
To make much of You
I want to make much of You
Much of You, Jesus
If there were no words
No way to speak
I would still hear you
If there were no tears
No way to feel inside
I'd still feel for you
And even if the sun refused to shine
Even if romance ran out of rhyme
You would still have my heart until the end of time
You're all I need, my love, my Valentine
All of my life
I have been waiting for
All you give to me
You've opened my eyes
And showed me how to love unselfishly
I've dreamed of this a thousand times before
But in my dreams I couldn't love you more
I will give you my heart
Until the end of time...
You're all I need, my love, my Valentine
And even if the sun refused to shine
Even if romance ran out of rhyme
You would still have my heart until the end of time
'Cause all I need is you, my Valentine
You're all I need, my love, my Valentine
It's a place that's not so far
I dream there and sometimes I wake there
Do you want me caring less
Sometimes we don't ask for what we need
And I can guess how I want to be loved
And I've guessed what of me you need
Doesn't matter if we lie
Your sentences never defined you
Do you think that I can't feel
When I touch you there's words on your body
Should you be scared
When I say sometimes I'd want you dead
So no one else can have you when it ends
How'd I reach this point on my own
(And how fragile I thought was I)
This is not the first time
I've watched the end of the thing that had no end
Do you want me caring less
Sometimes we let go of what we need
Why can't you guess how I want to be loved
Can't even tell me what of me you need
Look around, wonder why
We can live a life that's never satisfied
Lonely hearts, troubled minds
Looking for a way that we can never find
Many roads are ahead of us
With choices to be made
But life's just one of the games we play
There is no special way
Make the best of what's given you
Everything will come (It will come) in time
Why deny yourself?
Don't just let life pass (Don't let it pass) you by
Like winter in July
Future dreams can never last
When you find yourself still living in the past
Keep moving on to higher grounds
Looking for the way you thought could not be found
Mmm, we may not know the reason why
We're born into this world (Never, never know the reason why)
Where a man only lives to die
His story left untold
Make the best of what's given you
Everything will come (It will come) in time
Why deny yourself?
Don't just let life pass (Don't let it pass) you by
Like winter in July
Ha-ah-ah
Ah ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
And we may not know the reason why
We're born into this world (Never never know the reason why)
Where a man only lives to die
And his story left untold
So make the best, make the best of what's given you
Everything will come in time
Why deny yourself?
Don't just let life pass you by
Like winter in July
Ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Well I don't think it's odd
To stand before God
And solemnly swear when there's love in the air
And I don't think it's weird
When the one thing you fear
Is losing the one thing that's holding you dear
Well I don't think it's strange
I don't think it's insane
It turns the world around
All the birds keeping singing
And the bells keep ringing
And the heart keeps bringing you home to
California
Where the warm sun shines
California
Hear the wind blowing chimes
Californ-i-a
Though you're far away
Your love is here today
True love in your heart
Like a flame in the dark
May you have may you hold
Till death do you part
'Cause two of a kind
It ain't easy to find
Coming out of the gloomy
And led by the blind
It don't take much to see
That what's meant to be
Is right in front of me
When the birds keeping singing
And the bells keep ringing
And the heart keeps bringing you home to
California
Where the warm sun shines
California
Hear the wind blowing chimes
Californ-i-a
Though you're far away
Your love is here today
We're sitting on a real celebration
Thank heavens what a fine situation
Shoot the cannon blow the horn
Love is born in California
With the falling rain came the scent of our times
I whipped you off and felt so awkwardly alive
I pretend to think about my health and what's true
But the only one I ever think about is you
Whatever the season I'll be around your block
I want to know if you were faking
I cut all cords with a sigh and a smile
But when you step up I feel so nervous I could die
With the sound of laughter came a sense of doubt
But I won't believe that you were faking
Whatever the season I'll be around your block
I want to know if you were faking
With the sound of laughter came a sense of doubt
But I won't believe that you were faking
Whatever the season I'll be around your block
I want to know if you were faking
Now, picturing a scene
Seen it all before
We drink, we drink a little much
Drink a little more
To shake off the nerves and
Take off the edge and
Now is there any way back home?
Seen it all before and
I know the signs
We drink, drink a little much
To stimulate the mind
Now it's two hours to go
Insult everyone that we know
Now it's such a long way home
Maybe it's time to go?
Maybe it's time we went?
You're making a spectacle
Maybe it's time we left?
I don't wanna spoil your night
I don't wanna hurt your pride
But maybe it's time to go?
Maybe it's time?
Now eating from your hand
Laugh at every line
Soon losing track of you
Losing track of time
Now it's dead on the dancefloor
And nobody's laughing anymore
Have I become a tiresome bore?
Maybe it's time to go?
Maybe it's time we went?
You're making a spectacle
Maybe it's time we left?
I don't wanna spoil your night
I don't wanna hurt your pride
But maybe it's time to go?
Maybe it's time?
To go where there's nowhere to hide
From what's broken inside
A faultline rips right open
Under the wide, wide ocean's tide
Under the wide, wide ocean
Maybe it's time to go?
Maybe it's time we went?
You're making a spectacle
Maybe it's time we left?
I don't wanna spoil your night
I don't wanna hurt your pride
Maybe it's time to fly?
Maybe it's time?
Maybe it's time to go?
Maybe it's time?

¿Qué hacer con el perro que ladra por la ventana?
Hace tiempo que me cansé, y él no para. No para.
Al final no aguanté y llamé y la dueña no estaba
Cuando más tarde la encontré, dijo: "El perro no ladra"
¡Qué malhumor me dio! Yo sé que me mintió,
sabe que ladra cuando se va a trabajar. Algo voy a tramar
De buen modo le pregunté: "¿No se puede hacer nada?"
Pero como no encontré la respuesta esperada, le dije:
¡Calle ya a ese perro no lo agunato se lo ruego!
¡Si no calla ya mismo e ese perro yo me muero!
¡Calle ya a ese perro no lo agunato se lo ordeno!
¡Si no calla ya mismo e ese perro yo me vengo!
Quizás será el cassette, ese que le grabé con el ladrido de él
Que le puse a la noche durante un mes
Yo no sé muy bien qué será, pero el perro no ladra más
Ella lo lleva a pasear y él va dando las gracias.
Quizás será el cassette, ese que le grabé con el ladrido de él
Que le puse a la noche durante un mes.
El perro está contento Ya no oigo el lamento
La señora lo lleva a todas partes con ella
Bring just your fire
Maybe bring just (my mirror?)
I feel you
So long have been sleeping violently
Love ain't no way to share your time
So long since I felt this silent
And as you turn away
I'm lost, I mess up, as forced
That she passes by the price trying not to steal life
But they reach you
And as you turn away, I'm lost, I mess up, as forced
That she passes by the price trying not to steal life but they reach beneath you
Bring just your fire
Maybe I fear (my mirror?)
I need you
Far too long we have been silent
I miss you
Way too long since
I've been this silent
Now an unexpected peace comes to the day
As the howling and the fighting dies away
When the hanging dust is clearing from the air
You can just make out a lonely figure there
He's the last man standing on the track
He does not look down
He does not look back
You can't hold him down
You can't hold him back
He is sorry for the wrong that he has done
And he cries out for the anger born so long
All the cuts and bruises suffered in whose name?
Oh, but now is not the time to face his shame
He's the last man standing on the track
He does not look down
He does not look back
You can't hold him down
You can't hold him back
Ahhhh! Ahhhh! Ahhh!
Ahhhh! Ahhhh! Ahhh!
Eu sempre quis fazer você feliz
?s vezes me deixava pra outra hora
Eu sempre quis falar o que eu sentia
Mas dessa vez foi o silêncio
Que falou por mim
Eu sempre me esforcei pra te incentivar
Tua falta de caminho me detinha a intenção
Eu sempre te deixei bem à vontade
Mas tua falta de vontade
Me desmotivou
Quer saber?
Já Foi
Vou cuidar
De mim
Quer saber?
Eu quero alguém pra dividir
Gostar de quem gosta de mim
Eu sempre acreditei muito em nós dois
Primeiro em você, depois em mim... Éramos nós
Eu sempre quis fazer a minha parte
Mas você não faz mais parte
Da metade de nós dois
Quer saber?
Já Foi
Vou cuidar
De mim
Quer saber?
Eu quero alguém pra dividir
Gostar de quem gosta de mim
spoken:
Yeah . . .
E quanto vale o tempo todo que vivemos
Correndo atrás dos sonhos
Pra viver só de amor
E quanto a gente paga pelos sonhos que deixou?
Quer saber?
Já Foi
Vou cuidar
De mim
Quer saber?
Eu quero alguém pra dividir
Gostar de quem gosta de mim
Quer saber?
Já Foi
Vou cuidar
De mim
Quer saber?
Eu quero alguém pra dividir
Gostar de quem gosta de mim
Quer saber?
Já Foi
Vou cuidar
De mim
Quer saber?
Eu quero alguém pra dividir
Gostar de quem gosta de mim
Quer saber?
Já Foi
Vou cuidar
De mim
Quer saber?
Eu quero alguém pra dividir
Gostar de quem gosta de mim
Lately you've been bothered by your friends
We will disturb you, to make you talk again
Try to find the other side of you
The things you hide, what you don't say
We say no, oh no
We won't let you slip inbetween
We say no, oh no
We won't let you squeeze right through
Give you second chances easily
We wait for answers, for hours and years
But the sadness in your eyes won't go away
It becomes you, in a strange kind of way
I wonder were you come from
Who you've been
What you gain, if you win
But my guess is right you break like glass
And I wonder where, your god was then
I say no, oh no
I won't let you slip inbetween
I say no, oh no
I won't let you squeeze right through
Oh how sweet a girl like you can be
When she tries
You're changing skin like I change clothes
You're faking it well but it shows
You say, lately I've been bothered by my friends
They need foregiveness
I need therapy, they say
Better lock up well before they come
With their prairs, and loaded guns
Better lock up well before they come
More than ten years to ignore, what they here for
We say no, oh no
We won't let you slip inbetween
We say no, oh no
We won't let you squeeze right through
We say no, no no no
Since you fall from every throne
Sleep on, dream on, sleep on, dream on
Sleep on, dream on, sleep on, dream on
Sleep on, dream on, sleep on, dream on
Sleep on, dream on, sleep on, dream on
Sleep on, dream on, sleep on, dream on
Sleep on, dream on, sleep on, dream on
Sleep on, dream on, sleep on, dream on
Sleep on, dream on, sleep on, dream on
Sleep on, dream on, sleep on, dream on
Sleep on, dream on, sleep on, dream on
Sleep on, dream on, sleep on, dream on
Sleep on, dream on, sleep on, dream on
How long will it take
For these ties to you to break?
They're much stronger than I thought
And I'm not sure that I'll get over you
I'm not sure that I want to
How long 'til you're gone
From every troubled thought?
'Cause you're still here to heal what's wrong
And I'm not sure that I'll get over you
I'm not sure that I want to
We both made the call that it was only my fault
Such a beautiful view with a long way to fall
I was afraid how it could hurt to leave the safety of above
Well if it doesn't it's not love
How long 'til I don't feel
Like you're still right here?
Reminding me of what is real
And I'm not sure that I'll get over you
I'm not sure that I want to
But I am not sure that I'll get over you
I'm not sure that I want to
Oh look there you go again
Puttin' on that smile again
Even though I know you've had a bad day
Doin' this doin' that
Always puttin' yourself last
A whole lotta give and not enough take
But you can only be strong so long before you break
So...
Fall
Go on and fall apart
Fall into these arms of mine
I'll catch you every time you
Fall
Go on and lose it all
Every doubt every fear
Every worry every tear
I'm right here
Baby fall
Forget about the world tonight
All that's wrong and all that's right
Lay your head on my shoulder let it fade away
And if you wanna let go it's okay
Fall
Go on and fall apart
Fall into these arms of mine
I'll catch you every time you
Fall
Go on and lose it all
Every doubt every fear
Every worry every tear
I'm right here
Baby fall
Hold on
Hold on
Hold on
To me
Fall
Go on and fall apart
Fall into these arms of mine
I'll catch you every time you
Fall
Go on and lose it all
Every doubt every fear
Every worry every tear
I'm right here
Baby fall
Where can I turn?
You've gone away
I grieve in silence
So much I've learned
In life today
Still I need your guidance
You always found the words to say
To ease my troubled mind
Now you're gone, I feel alone
If I could see you one more time
If I could see you now
You'd help me find my way
If I could see you now
You'd help me find my way
Where can I turn?
You've gone away
I need your words of wisdom
Sometimes I'm lost
And in a rage
Taking things for granted
Your were the one that did believe
When no one else could see
If I could share what's on my mind
If I could see you one last time
If I could see you now,
You'd help me find my way.
If I could see you now,
You'd help me find my way.
If I could see you now
You'd help me find my way
If I could see you now
You'd help me find my way
If I could see you now
You'd help me find my way
I'll find the strength somehow
I'll fight to seize the day
(To be gone EP)
Found love, last summer it faded away.
All marks on my body vanished in a day.
Unwanted, late September when you are eager to find.
Wait to last winter, love of any kind.
You have no one on your side, fight your own troubled mind.
And no help to come by, fight your own troubled mind.
All winter, slept around until my heart fell a sleep.
Never had so much, was afraid to keep.
First of April, love of your life falls out of the blue.
Falling for a bad joke, you love to be the fool.
You have no one on your side, fight your own troubled mind.
And no help to come by, fight your own troubled mind.
So find love, for to night for all nights to come.
As long as you're with someone and never left alone.
As long as you're with someone never left alone.
You have no one on your side, fight your own troubled mind.
And no help to come by, fight your own troubled mind
Are you afraid, afraid of the truth
In the mirror staring back at you
The image is cracked but so is the view here
The strength of a tree begins in the roots
That I tend bury into you
At least now the storm can't blow me away
So crawl inside my head with me,
I'll show you how it feels to be to blame like me
Should I be afraid of this face that I see
In the mirror staring back at me?
So cold were the days when I listened to you
And you say that I'm weak, so show me the proof
Because I still exist in spite of you
But I won't compete with you every day
So crawl inside my head with me,
I'll show you how it feels to be to blame like me
Schizophrenic conversations that
I'm always having with myself
I hear these voices in my head competing
Maybe I could use a little help
I still have schizophrenic conversations
Where there's no one else around to hear
I long for solitude and peace within me
Void of all the anger and the fear
So crawl inside my head with me,
I'll show you how it feels to be fucked up like me,
I'll show you how it feels to be, blame like me,
To be ashamed like me
Dyma geidwad i'r couuledig
Medd yg i'r gwywedig rai
Medryn ado'r byd a'i cwys
Gofidiau dwys a blinion
Bale y cawn i noddfadlos
Yn rhos y pererinion
One two three four five
And six beers later I was wild
I said baby
Show me to the bed now
'Cause I've been sitting here since half past nine
Been thinking dirty thoughts about you a thousand times
Come on baby
Do you feel the same huh?
'Cause I don't want to end up being
A tragic heartbroken human being
Five six seven eight
It's twelve o clock and it's getting late
Come on
Don't you feel like going home
I'll treat you good if you treat me bad
And I'll give you the best lovin' that you've ever had
Shut up
And take me by the hand
'Cause I don't want to end up being
A tragic heartbroken human being
And he said something like this:
Sure babe, I'll take you home
But in the morning you'll be on your own again
And I said:
Well honey that's ok
And I don't really care if you are straight or gay
As long as
You make my day
'Cause I've been sitting here since half past nine
Been thinking dirty thoughts about you a thousand times
Come on
Show me the way
'Cause I don't want to end up being
A tragic heartbroken human being
Speak to me with your sweet voice
And take me through another night
Speak to me with your soft voice
And I will surely be alright
If I can close my eyes without a fear
Speak to me with your sweet voice
Near
Hold me in your warm hand
And I could sleep with you tonight
Hold me in your warm hand
And I could sleep with you tonight
And all my earthly cares might fade away
If you hold me in your warm hand 
That way
It's as close as I get to love
As close as I get to love
Speak to me with your sweet voice
Again
Speak to me with your sweet voice
And take me through another night
Speak to me with your soft voice
And I will surely be alright
If I can close my eyes without a fear
Speak to me with your sweet voice
Near
Speak to me with your sweet voice
That way
Speak to me with your sweet voice...
Cuando las almas van enredadas no hay más
Que un mar de pasión
Van enlazadas, acariciadas y no hay más
Que el olor de su amor
" Me gustas tú, Rigoberto, y tú y tú, pero,
Por encima de todas tus otras cosas, me gustan
Tus orejas voladoras. "
(Los cuadernos de don Rigoberto, Vargas Llosa)
Entre dos almas enamoradas sólo hay
Juegos de seducción...
Ven juntito a mí que te quiero besar
Ven juntito a mí no te arrepentirás
Ven juntito a mí tu lengüita he de acariciar
Y si me dejas iré más lejos, ya verás
Puedo ver que en amor el inicio tiene tanto placer
Y ven juntito a mí que te quiero besar
Ven juntito a mí no te arrepentirás
Ven juntito a mí tu lengüita he de acariciar
Y si me dejas iré más lejos, ya verás
Y si me dejas iré más lejos, ya verás
Y si me dejas iré más lejos, ya verás
Take the sound from my head
Take me down
And empty out my heart
'Cause the nightmare is over
'Cause the nightmare is over
Shape my face how you want to
Drag me down
Control my every thought
Now my nightmare is over
My nightmare is over
Won't matter now
Won't matter now
Won't matter now
Won't matter now
Make me feel so much hate
Turn me grey
Fuck my everyday
My nightmare is over
My nightmare is over
No longer ill at ease with the crazy people
No longer afraid of the shit put in my face
Now my nightmare is over
Now my nightmare is over
It won't matter now
It won't matter now
It won't matter now
It won't matter now
It won't matter now
I'm coming up only to hold you under
And coming up only to show you're wrong
And to know you is hard; we wonder...
To know you all wrong; we warn
Really too late to call
So we wait for morning
To wake you is all we got
To know me as hardly golden
Is to know me all wrong, they warn
At every occasion I'll be ready for the funeral
At every occasion, once more, it's called the funeral
At every occasion, oh, I'm ready for the funeral
At every occasion, oh, one billion day funeral
I'm coming up only to show you're down for
And coming up only to show you're wrong
To the outside, the dead leaves lay on the lawn
For they don't have trees to hang upon
At every occasion I'll be ready for the funeral
At every occasion, once more, it's called the funeral
At every occasion, oh, I'm ready for the funeral
Every occasion, oh, one billion day funeral
Ne me quitte pas
Il faut oublier
Tout peut s'oublier
Qui s'enfuit deja
Oublier le temps
Des malentendus
Et le temps perdu
? savoir comment
Oublier ces heures
Qui tuaient parfois
? coups de pourquoi
Le coeur du bonheur
Ne me quitte pas (4 fois)
Moi je t'offrirai
Des perles du pluie
Venues de pays
Où il ne pleut pas
Je creuserai la terre
Jusqu'après ma mort
Pour couvrir ton corps
D'or et de lumière
Je ferai un domaine
Où l'amour sera roi
Où l'amour sera loi
Où tu seras reine
Ne me quitte pas (4 fois)
Ne me quitte pas
Je t'inventerai
Des mots insensés
Que tu comprendras
Je te parlerai
De ces amants là
Qui ont vu deux fois
Leurs coeurs s'embraser
Je te racont'rai
L'histoire de ce roi
Mort de n'avoir pas
Pu te rencontrer
Ne me quitte pas (4 fois)
On a vu souvent
Rejaillir le feu
De l'ancien volcan
Qu'on croyait trop vieux
Il est paraît-il
Des terres brûlées
Donnant plus de blé
Qu'un meilleur avril
Et quand vient le soir
Pour qu'un ciel flamboie
Le rouge et le noir
Ne s'épousent-ils pas
Ne me quitte pas (4 fois)
Ne me quitte pas
Je ne veux plus pleurer
Je ne veux plus parler
Je me cacherai là
? te regarder
Danser et sourire
Et à t'écouter
Chanter et puis rire
Laisse-moi devenir
L'ombre de ton ombre
L'ombre de ta main
L'ombre de ton chien
Ne me quitte pas (4 fois)
Süße sechzehn Jahr
und voller Zuversicht
Low im Ohr
Die Geschichte war
Und irgendwo in Holland
hat sich einen Dame vielleicht gewundert
Ich kann sehen, ob Leute
Bald Krank werden
Und irgendwo in Frankreich
Mit unter 30, mitunter glücklich
Wo hast du,
eigentlich damals geschlafen
Mit dem Mofa nach England,
demnächst als Film,
an Originellen Schauplätzen
Mit dem Mofa nach England
Sich Unterhalten,
mit Freunden die bald sterben
Die Kinder,
nach der Zukunft fragen
Das ist das Lied,
das sich zu über setzten lohnt
Mit dem Mofa nach England
Putting all the vegetables away 
That you bought at the grocery store today 
And it goes fast, you think of the past 
Suddenly everything has changed. 
Driving home, the sky accelerates. 
And the clouds all form a geometric shape. 
And it goes fast, you think of the past. 
Suddenly everything has changed. 
Putting all the clothes you washed away. 
As you're folding up the shirts, you hesitate. 
Then it goes fast, you think of the past. 
Suddenly everything has changed.
Lost and losing trust
I can't prevent the rust
It's starting to envelope
The lack of progress
Between us
Lessons learned through handshakes
Storied scars and faded stains
Things we still believe in
Caught before they fall through drains
Hard to say what's on my mind
Knowing well it means goodbye
Look for ways that I can tell you
Thanks, but I will be just fine
Lessons learned through handshakes
Storied scars and faded stains
Things we still believe in
Caught before they fall through drains
Time won't wait
For the days gone by
Find a way to remain
Well and I (?)
So I find the time to write
Words of hope and words of spite
Calloused hands and candle light
Bend the words to make it right
Lessons learned through handshakes
Storied scars and faded stains
Things we still believe in
Caught before they fall through drains
I lay still in the fire.
Oh, the grass. Burn in bed.
Blackened ash.
A cold sound rustled in the trees
Pulling limbs.
The smoke rose. The smoke rose.
It'd come to make a mess of things
And throw a storm of burnt flakes,
Lifting to the air the floating world,
To let them go silent into the ground
Where all things make work of coming back.
I lay in the ground, wait, lonely for you.
My hair grows, nails grow out
And I count them as they go
One, two, three, four, five, six
Break into air.
Set themselves between the blades of grass,
So let your bare feet bleed.
With one or two I get used to the room
We go slow when we first make our moves
But five or six bring you out to the car
Number nine with my head on the bar
And it's sad, but true. Out of cash and I.O.U's
I've got desperate desires and unadmirable plans
My tongue will taste of gin and malicious intent
Bring you back to the bar. Get you out of the cold
A sober straight face gets you out of your clothes
And they're scared that we know all the crimes they'll commit
Who they'll kiss before they get home
I will lie awake
Lie for fun and fake the way I hold you
Let you fall for every empty word I say
Barely conscious in the door where you stand
Your eyes are fighting sleep while your mouth makes your demands
You laugh at every word, trying hard to be cute
I almost feel sorry for what I'm gonna do
And your hair smells of smoke
Who will cast the first stone?
You can sin or spend the night all alone
Brass buttons on your coat hold the cold
In the shape of a heart that they cut out of stone
You're using all your looks that you've thrown from the start
If you let me have my way, I swear I'll tear you apart
'Cause it's all you can be
You're a drunk and you're scared
It's ladies night, all the girls drink for free
I will lie awake
Lie for fun and fake the way I hold you
Let you fall for every empty word I say
I will lie awake
Lie for fun and fake the way I hold you
Let you fall for every empty word I say
She lies still 
Her eyes on fire 
I'm dressed to kill 
And I'm tethered and tied 
And in the arms of a stranger 
You search for someone like her 
And the music carries on 
In a simple border song 
You once knew 
People like you 
They come and they go 
What's left to say 
We already know 
And we've danced these shoes to pieces 
And we stood where no one has stood 
And the music carries on 
In a simple border song 
You once knew 
And I guess I've said it all 
And I guess I've said it all 
You can't cry but you'll fall 
And I guess I've said it all 
You will walk 
You will walk 
You will walk out of here 
You will walk 
You will walk 
You will walk out of here 
And I guess I've said it all 
And I guess I've said it all 
You can't cry but you'll fall 
And I guess I've said it all
I knew I'd run into you, I had that feeling
There's a light in the room as you appear
I'm in your shadow again
It's clear already, I will never be good for you
So I must keep quiet, never giving up all the truth
Of what I'm feeling
You'll always be my silent valentine
You'll always be my silent valentine
People comment around us
On what a pair we'd make
It's been three years or maybe more
Feels like a day, still you make my heart ache
My words are frozen
All this hurt runs down to my fears
Walking away is the hardest thing to do, but I must leave
It's what I'm feeling
You'll always be my silent valentine
You'll always be my silent valentine
You'll always be my silent valentine
You'll always be my silent valentine
Instrumental
These days I don't see you walk so proud
These days I don't hear you talk so loud
When you thought you'd soaked up all of the blows
You realized you were not even close
And it feels like it's tearing you up
And it feels like it's wearing you down
You'll get through this if you hang on
Yeah the truth is you're not alone
You'll get through this if you hang on
'Cause the truth is you're not alone
You're not on your own
I see your face on every corner of every street
You spend you days just waiting for your next defeat
But I can only tell you what I know
And all I know is that I just don't know
And it feels like it's tearing me up
Yeah it feels like it's wearing me down
I'll get through this if I hold on
'Cause the truth is I'm not alone
I'll get through this if I hang on
And the truth is I'm not alone
I'm not on my own
And you are not alone
It's just hard sometimes to carry on
No I'm not on my own
And you are not alone
It's just hard sometimes, it's so hard sometimes
But we got to hold on
We got to hold on
Hold on
Kein Geräusch durchdringt den Raum der Nacht
Ein paar Wolken ziehen
Als wollten sie entfliehen
Aus einer Welt, die scheinbar nicht verstummt
In der Gedanken kreisen
Die mich zum Wahnsinn treiben
Schlaflos quäle ich mich durch die Nacht
Schlaflos, was hast du mit mir gemacht
Müde lausche ich der Dunkelheit
Doch nichts als Schweigen
Wie eine Ewigkeit
Ungeduldig ersehne ich den Tag
Nur um dich zu sehen
Wie wird es weitergehen?
Schlaflos kämpfe ich mich durch die Nacht
Schlaflos, was hab ich nur gemacht
I heard about your story from a friend
To let go and make an end
That's what you did
You left some words saying now it would be good
You knew they'd cry but you hoped they understood
Things you've had to face, what you have seen
To make it through each day you tried
Without the tears
They tried to help but they didn't see you crawl
They knew you fought but they never thought you'd fall
Never thought you'd fall
Tell them please, how could they know
Hurts inside, no scars to show
You played the lead and never once you failed
And the place from where you watch us now
Hope you've found your peace somehow
I heard about your story through the years
Know 'bout all your hurt and fears
I won't forget
I wrote a song that I wish for you to hear
It's about yourself and the life you couldn't bear
I wanna remember all there's about you
And I know there's so much
I see all the faces
The tears and embraces
Wish you could be here to see it too

Walking by strangers
Stranger than me
We talk of the future
Between you and me
Sweet little darling
Where will we be
Sweet little darling
Where will we be
It's hard to conceive it
All comes to an end
A joke when it's funny, well
I laugh and pretend
We're fools to believe it
We're fools to try
To slow down this seemingly
Nonstop July
We're fools to believe it
We're fools to try
To slow down this seemingly
Nonstop July
How'd you like the sound of those four letter words?
They make me look so clever
As I fall to the earth
I wanna walk through the morning
And I've not seen the night
I wanna hold on to you baby
And make you fell all right
If I could just draw a line under this stupid way of life
With two eyes open and two eyes feeling all right
How'd you like the sound of those four letter words?
Do they really make me look that clever as I fall to the earth?
Ain't it funny how you only ever seem to want what you can't have?
And that one little thing well it's driving you mad
I'd chase him round and build like that
With two eyes open and two eyes staring back
You say darlin'
You say darlin' don't
Lift my hand off your thigh and say darlin'
Darlin' please don't
Not that you're the one
Not to say I'm right
Not to say today
And not to say a thing tonight
But suffice it to say
We're leaving things unsaid
We sing ourselves to sleep
Watching the day lie down instead
And we are leaving some things unsaid
And we are breathing deeper instead
We're both pretty sure
Neither one can tell
We seem difficult
What we got is hard as hell
A hundred thousand words
Could not quite explain
So I walk you to your car
And we can talk it out in the rain
And we are leaving some things unsaid
And we are breathing deeper instead
And we are leaving some things unsaid
I can sing myself to sleep
No more
No more
Not that you're the one
Not to say I'm right
Not to say today
And not to say a thing tonight
I took my darling out to the aquarium
Sea creatures stared at us and we stared back at them
My baby freaked when she peeked at that 8-legged blob with a beak
She was too scared to speak
I said don't be upset it's only an octopus
Don't bother it and I'm sure it won't bother us
Please don't be upset my darling, please don't get upset
My baby came riding to meet me one time
On the crowed last car of the downtown-bound 9
She was brave but she caved
When the train was delayed
It was just the last straw in her hard busy day
I said don't get upset 'cause it's not a catastrophe
Nothing will happen and soon you'll be back with me
Please don't be upset my darling, please don't be upset
My gal's got a headhache, her ankle is hurting too
Boots she bought gave her a rash and her winsdom tooth
Is coming in and it's damp out and she's having cramps and she's so mad at me 'cause I didn't shave
I said don't be upset I know you're feeling sensitive
I'll try to be kinder and be more attentive
Please don't be upset my darling please don't get upset
Darling I said, I'm gonna be 27 soon
I've only got rejection letters and a sense of impending doom
I think it's too late for me
All the comic companies hate me
And I try but it's always the same
I guess my art is just lame and it's strange but still somehow I'm
Always not suiting their needs at this time
And she said ...don't be upset,
You know that you're wonderful
Just keep on trying ...(actually what she really said was)
All you ever wanna talk about is your self and your comic books and your album and your tour
And every time I see your friends they just ask me where you are again and it hurts
It makes me feel like dirt
I'm just gonna write where you are on my shirt
And I said don't be upset, don't be in a bad mood
Let's just go to a show and hang out and feel good
Come on please don't be upset my darling, please don't be upset, I'll do anything baby, just don't be upset.
Every now and then I cry
Every night
You keep stayin' on my mind
All my friends say I'll survive
It just takes time
But I don't think time is gonna heal this broken heart
No, I don't see how it can if it's broken all apart
A million miracles could never stop the pain
Or put all the pieces together again
No, I don't think time is gonna heal this broken heart
No, I don't see how it can while we are still apart
And when you hear this song, I hope that you will see
That time won't heal a broken hearted me
Every day is just the same
Playing games
Different lovers, different names
They keep saying I'll survive
It just takes time
But I don't think time is gonna heal this broken heart
No, I don't see how it can if it's broken all apart
A million miracles could never stop the pain
Or put all the pieces together again
No, I don't think time is gonna heal this broken heart
No, I don't see how it can while we are still apart
And when you hear this song, I hope that you will see
That time won't heal a broken hearted
Time won't heal a broken hearted me
The small, the large and the human mind
Never tells how it feels
It boils and boils and leaves you dry
Wanna know how it tastes for real?
And if the sun seems grey no light
I can make it digitally bright
Going out to colour them mountains
Slow it down or speed it up
Turn around and make a stop
And we'll care for making it right
And if the sun seems grey no light
I can make it digitally bright
Going out to colour them mountains
Slow it down or speed it up
Turn around and make a stop
And we'll care for making it right
It goes and goes and passes by
What are they looking for?
It boils and boils and leaves you dry
This real taste asks for more
And if the sun seems grey no light
I can make it digitally bright
Going out to colour them mountains
Slow it down or speed it up
Do whatever you want it's our map
There's no way of not making it right
There's no way of not making it right
Mexican border
6 a.m. twilight
It's never easy to cross any borders
Without any papers
No requests and no orders
It has never been easy to cross any borders.
Down in the valley, the industrial estate,
He slaloms round beer cans in his escape.
He never got nothing, in death even less.
What'd you say? I bless.
Do what we like,
Go where we like,
Happy to see it says nothing about us.
Drive by the scene,
Holding our breath.
Relieved to see it says nothing about us.
Down in the chambers of law there's a blueprint
To make sadness invisible, suffering a figment.
Rehabilitate some and just hide the rest,
Now who's guilty? Confess.
Do what we like
Go about our lives
Happy to see it says nothing about us.
Read in the news
Just shake our heads
Happy to see it says nothing about us. 
He was alone
Fell with a silence
His mother did separate the whites from the violence
Love on your own
Reap what you've sown
I can't believe that our trains didn't even slow down
Instrumental
Prisonnier de ton enchantement
En faire l'affaire de nos sentiments
On dirait l'âme,on dirait le corps
Quand ton ennemi est le plus fort
Et moi j'accours..Mais comment te dire
Les mots ne viennent pas
Libérez les sons de ma voix
Je voudrais arrêter le temps
Passer en toi
Mais laisse moi te dire
Pris au piège par le souffle imminent
De ton retour, tout ce qui nous attend
On dirait l'âme, on dirait le sang
Tu touches mon coeur, l'esprit s'en ressent
Et moi je suis fou...Mais comment te dire
Les mots ne viennent pas
Libérez les sons de ma voix
Je voudrais arrêter le temps pass
Passer en toi
Mais laisse moi te dire...
Mais comment te dire
Les mots ne viennent pas
Libérez les sons de ma voix
Je voudrais arrêter le temps
Passer en toi
Mais laisse moi te dire
En amour on n' sait rien
On est rien
On est rien
On est rien...
I lit my purest candle close to my
Window, hoping it would catch the eye
Of any vagabond who passed it by
And I waited in my fleeting house
Before he came I felt him drawing near
As he neared I felt the ancient fear
That he had come to wound my door and jeer
And I waited in my fleeting house
"Tell me stories," I called to the Hobo;
"Stories of cold," I smiled at the Hobo;
"Stories of old," I knelt to the Hobo;
And he stood before my fleeting house
"No," said the Hobo, "No more tales of time;
Don't ask me now to wash away the grime;
I can't come in 'cause it's too high a climb,"
And he walked away from my fleeting house#
"Then you be damned!" I screamed to the Hobo;
"Leave me alone," I wept to the Hobo;
"Turn into stone," I knelt to the Hobo;
And he walked away from my fleeting house
Why are there so many songs about rainbows and what's on the other side?
Rainbows are visions, but only illusions
And rainbows have nothing to hide
So we've been told and some choose to believe it
I know they're wrong wait and see
Someday we'll find it, the rainbow connection
The lovers, the dreamers and me
Who said that wishes would be heard and answered
When wished on the morning star?
Someone thought of that and someone believed it
Look what it's done so far
What's so amazing that keeps us stargazing
And what do we think we might see?
Someday we'll find it, the rainbow connection
The lovers, the dreamers and me
All of us under its spell
We know that it's probably magic
Have you been half asleep and have you heard voices?
I've heard them calling my name
Is this the sweet sound that calls the young sailors
The voice might be one and the same
I've heard it too many times to ignore it
It's something that I'm supposed to be
Someday we'll find it, the rainbow connection
The lovers, the dreamers and me
Someday we'll find it, the rainbow connection
The lovers, the dreamers and me
My girl's got a big mouth, with which she blabbers a lot
She laughs at most everything, whether it's funny or not
And if you see her, tell her it's over now
I want a girl who will laugh for no one else
When I'm away she puts her makeup on the shelf
When I'm away she never leaves the house
I want a girl who laughs for no one else
My girl's got eyeballs in the back of her head
She looks around and around, you know, it makes me sad to see her like that
Please don't believe her, she says that for anyone
And if you see her tell her it's a hey, hey, hey, hey
I want a girl who will laugh for no one else
When I'm away she puts her makeup on the shelf
When I'm away she never leaves the house
I want a girl who laughs for no one else
And if you see her, tell her it's over now!
And if you see her, tell her it's over now
And if you watch a girl (watch her, girl)
Watch her, watch her, watch her, watch her
I want a girl who will laugh for no one else
When I'm away she puts her makeup on the shelf
When I'm away she never leaves the house
I want a girl who laughs for no one else
No one else, yeah
Das große Leben eines großen Mannes
braucht als Basis einen großen Traum,
den er träumt in einem großen Bett,
und so ein Bett gehört in einen großen Raum.
Große Räume gibt es nur in großen Häusern,
mit großen Fenstern, um hinaus zu schau'n
auf das eigene, entsprechend große Land,
das umgeben ist von einem großen Zaun.
Ich bin das Eigentum von meinem Eigentum
bin allem hörig, was mir gehört.
Ich bin besessen von dem, was ich besitze
und werd' gefressen von dem, was mich ernährt.
Ich bin der Diener von dem, was ich verdiene,
ich bin der Sklave von dem, was ich versklavt.
Und allen Dingen über die ich verfüge,
füge ich mich brav.
Ich hab's geschafft, wonach ich immer strebte.
Alle Dinge ringsumher gehören mir.
Doch das Einzige was ich dabei empfinde.
Ist die Angst, es wieder zu verlier'n.
Und so verkriech ich mich mit allen meinen Schätzen.
Ins verkabelte gepanzerte Versteck.
Ich bin Müde, doch wag ich nicht zu schlafen
sonst kommt der Pöbel und nimmt mir alles weg.
Ich bin das Eigentum von meinem Eigentum
bin allem hörig, was mir gehört.
Ich bin besessen von dem, was ich besitze
und werd' gefressen von dem, was mich ernährt.
Was ich beherrsche, das raubt mir die Beherrschung
bin ganz benommen, von dem was ich mir nahm
um meinem Schicksal geschickt zu entkommen - doch es kam
Ich bin das Eigentum von meinem Eigentum
bin allem hörig, was mir gehört.
Ich bin besessen von dem, was ich besitze
und werd' gefressen von dem, was mich ernährt.
ich bin erdrückt, von all den Unterdrückten
und weil mein Reichtum mir immer noch nicht reicht,
bleibt mir als Sicherheit, doch nur ein wenig Sicherheit - vielleicht.
Angel broke her wing
Oh, you poor thing
The hum of the motor gave way to
The tick tick ticking of the clock
And the rattle of springs
The Buick's in the drive
It's good to be alive
And if you knew now what you knew then
You wouldn't want to go home
Wouldn't want to go
If you knew now what you knew then
You wouldn't want to go to Amity Gardens again
It isn't very much, but
For now it's home
A room in the shadow of a funny-looking man
On the phone to the bank about a default loan
I thank you very much
Ta ta we'll be in touch
And if you knew now what you knew then
You wouldn't want to go home
Wouldn't want to go
If you knew now what you knew then
You wouldn't want to go to Amity Gardens again
Where you came from
And act like you tried
Cause somethings are better kept
Deep down inside
But you're not driving
You're along for the ride
Just checking out the scene
And taking in the green
Instrumental
Starting over again
You've made your mind up
Let your hard luck end and make it new
Do it now, girl
If you're leaving then leave
If you need it then I want you to
Let your thoughts come in
Dedicated to you
Stories I've heard like a man on the moon
Lessons I've learned
If you're leaving then leave
If you need it then I want you to
There's no use thinking
Why these phases change you
You're not waiting here for anyone
I'll break down if you come around
When you need it I want you to
Take the past and cut it out
Let the knife turn to rust
Make something else up there's majesty in motion
You've made your mind up
If you're leaving then leave
If you need it then I want you to
If you want it I want you to
If you're leaving then leave
If you need it I want you to
Just wait for it to come
Don't wait your life away
You've so long to get it
So get it now
Instrumental
You had your chance, but you never called me
So I started to get cold
And to be tired of this little romance
Tired of fake diamonds, fake silver, fake gold.
You had your chance, but you didn't grab it
So I slowly slipped away
And I got tired of this little romance,
Tired of cheap flowers, cheap candy, cheap champagne.
But my darling,
I never wanted a fur coat or your cabriolet.
Cause, all I wanted
Was you to want me
And I wanted you to want me to stay.
You had your chance, but you never called me
So I started to get cold
And to be tired of this little romance
Tired of fake diamonds, fake silver, fake gold.
You had your chance, but you didn't grab it
So I slowly slipped away
And I got tired of this little romance,
Tired of cheap flowers, cheap candy, cheap champagne.
My darling,
I never wanted a fur coat or your cabriolet.
Cause, all I wanted
Was you to want me
And I wanted you to want me to stay.
But my darling,
I just wanted you to want me to stay
Some old hotel room in Memphis
I see the city through the rain
I'm just chasing me my time
And remembering some pain
See there once was a boy
And on the street he'd surely die
So the nightbird took him in
And she taught him how to fly
See the nightbird softly fly
Why does she fly alone?
Is the moonlight just a flame for her memory?
Now she's gone
Two bit bars and honky tonks
Any pleasure can be found
You can get just what you want
If you lay your money down
And lonely sailors do their drinking
My, my, my how the brave men do die
And the nightbird sells her pleasures
Bringing tears to my eyes
See the nightbird softly fly
Why does she fly alone
Is the moonlight just a flame for her memory
Now she's gone
So I guess I'll go out walking
Lord, let the rain keep falling down
I guess I'll go chase some memories
On the dark side of town
See the nightbird softly fly
Why does she fly alone
Is the moonlight just a flame for her memory
Now she's gone
Once I had a man, sweet as he could be
Once I had a man and he was right for me
Kind of curly hair, eyes so soft and true
That you couldn't help but care
When he looked at you
He called me baby
Baby all the time
He said, "Baby can't you see?"
"Baby understand?"
"Baby you're for me"
"Oh won't you take my hand?"
But I push him away
Wouldn't let him near
Pushed him far away
And now I'm wishing I could hear him
Call me baby, baby all the time
It's so lonely through the day
Lonely through the night
Lonely, lonely hours without that
Man I held so tight
Lord I pray that you will listen to my plea
Keep him close to you so he'll come back to me
And call me baby, baby all the time
Baby, baby all the time
Come fly with me, let's fly, let's fly away
If you can use some exotic booze
There's a bar in far Bombay
Come fly with me, let's fly, let's fly away
Come fly with me, let's float down to Peru
In llama-land there's a one-man band
And he'll toot his flute for you
Come fly with me, let's take off in the blue
Once I get you up there
Where the air is rarefied
We'll just glide
Starry-eyed
Once I get you up there
I'll be holding you so near
You may hear
Angels cheer, 'cause we're together
Weather-wise, it's such a lovely day
Just say the words and we'll beat the birds
Back to Acapulco Bay
It is perfect for a flying honeymoon, they say
Come fly with me, let's fly, let's fly away
Once I get you up there
Where the air is rarefied
We'll just glide
Starry-eyed
Once I get you up there
I'll be holding you so near
You may hear
Angels cheer, 'cause we're together
Weather-wise, it's such a lovely day
If you say the word, we will beat those birds
Back to Acapulco Bay
It is perfect for a flying honeymoon, they say
Come fly with me, let's fly, let, s fly
Pack up, let's fly away
A Night all alone
(I Sit all alone)
The same as the last
(I Sit all alone)
The lonely man cries
(I Sit all alone)
From present and past
Though many he's known
(Searching for love)
To lay on his bed
(Searching for love)
The message received
(Searching for love)
By his heart and his head
(Searching for Love) He follows the path
(Looking for you)
That leads to the Bay
(Looking for you)
And remembers a love
(Looking for you)
He let slip away
(Looking for you)
Clouds drift through his mind as he walks by
The boats are in their docks under a clear blue sky
He doesn't feel the heat, he doesn't feel the time go by
All he feels is emptiness from the inside
I kick the sheets
Until they rise like mountain ranges at my feet
I'm in the dark
God only knows the torment writ large upon my heart
What wouldn't I?
What wouldn't I give?
It comes to this
I'm only sure of things I know now don't exist
There's no precision
I'm inside-outside-in, I want subdivision
And all of this fills my aching head
I hate this face, the luxury hotel bed
Oh, dear, oh me-oh-my
Got to concentrate just to keep from trying
Oh, dear, oh me-oh-my
Got to concentrate just to keep from trying
Don't lose it
Things move rapidly
Don't lose it
Try to maintain composure
Don't lose it
The dead are haunting me
Out with it
Let's get it over with
What wouldn't I?
What wouldn't I give?
I'm thoroughly wasted
My mind's hallucinating lucidity
It's oversensitized
And something's moving on the periphery
What wouldn't I?
What wouldn't I give?
Perfect and dull decorate, perfect and dull
Keepin' the cool from coming out, yeah
Oh oh, I'm not too cool, oh oh, I'm not too cool
Angry and dumb dominate, angry and dumb
Keepin' the cool from comin' out, yeah
Oh oh, I'm not too cool, oh oh, I'm not too cool
Oh no, I'm not too cool, oh oh, I'm not too cool
I always liked rock and roll, it kinda moves me
I'd like it more if I dance, yeah, sure
Oh oh, I'm not too cool, oh no, I'm not too cool
Wrong move and you're not too cool, wrong move and you're not too cool
Run, run, 'cause you're not too cool
Keep it hidden 'cause you're not too cool
Perfect and dull, but not too cool
Run, run, you're not too cool
Angry and dumb, but not too cool
Angry and runin', and not cool
I can feel your breath on my neck my love,
I can feel my death at the end of my life,
And I know if I stay in this night,
I know if I stay here in this night,
I know if I stay in and hide,
Both of you will find me.
I hold you in like a deep breath
Feel you like the last beautiful touch before a final rest
I know I'll see you forever
I want it painted black and red
It's so beautiful to me, it's everything I see
It's so beautiful to me, but it's nothing that I need
And I can't taste anything less
Every time I'm forced down
To be with yourself, take all the blood you want
But not from here
It's so beautiful to me, it is everything I see
It's so beautiful to me, but it's nothing that I need
Not a hand, not a finger
This is my home
I'm dying here
I hide in the corner
That look on your face...
I'm accustomed to it
I'm still young, but I know my days are numbered
1234567 and so on
But a time will come when these numbers have all ended
And all I've ever seen will be forgotten
Won't you come
To my funeral when my days are done
Life's not long
And so I hope when I am finally dead and gone
That you'll gather round when I am lowered into the ground
When my coffin is sealed and I'm safely 6 feet under
Perhaps my friends will see fit then to judge me
Oh when they pause to consider all my blunders
I hope they won't be too quick to begrudge me
Won't you come
To my funeral when my days are done
Life's not long
And so I hope when I am finally dead and gone
That you'll gather round when I am lowered into the ground
If I should die before I wake up
I pray that the Lord my soul will take but
My body, my body - that's your job
Well I can't be sure where I'm headed after death
To heaven, hell, or beyond to that Great Vast
But if I can I would like to meet my Maker
There's one or two things I'd sure like to ask
Won't you come
To my funeral when my days are done
Life's not long
And so I hope when I am finally dead and gone
That you'll gather round when I am lowered into the ground
uno debió perder la vergüenza hace tanto...
cómo me hizo perder, la vergüenza, mis años
cuando llegaba a mi el amor de mi vida,
enardecida, me congelaba y me iba
acorralada estaba en mis pensamientos.
el amor, la pasión, se quedaban adentro
años pasaron y me animé a la victoria.
pude salir, al fin, y llegar a la gloria
la gloria es verte volver, saber que un beso llega.
It was five o'clock 'cause I checked my watch
When I woke back up on the subway
And I missed my stop it was 10 blocks back
But I liked my seat so I kept it
And I'm still surprised that you stayed with me
Till my first mistake of the century
It was so extreme I controlled my dreams
With the radio and the late show
In Dublin's fair city, where the girls are so pretty
I first set my eyes on sweet Molly Malone
As she wheeled her wheelbarrow through streets broad and narrow
Crying cockles and mussels alive a-live O!
A-live a-live O! A-live a-live O!
Crying cockles and mussels alive a-live O!
She was a fishmonger and sure it was no wonder
For so were her father and mother before
And they both wheeled their barrows through streets broad and narrow
Crying cockles and mussels alive a-live O!
A-live a-live O! A-live a-live O!
Crying cockles and mussels alive a-live O!
She died of a fever and no one could save her
And that was the end of sweet Molly Malone
Now her ghost wheels her barrow through streets broad and narrow
Crying cockles and mussels alive a-live O!
A-live a-live O! A-live a-live O!
Crying cockles and mussels alive a-live O!
A-live a-live O! A-live a-live O!
Crying cockles and mussels alive a-live O!
Back through time, I know
You're calling me
For a saviour--I know
It's my destiny
So I'm gonna rise
Face the morning sun
Feel it calling me,
Wanting me
Believes in me
Love labours on
Love labours on
Back through time, I know
I'm a wanted man
Oh momma, I know
Gave me grace, not to lose
So I'm gonna get up--cleansed
Face the morning rain
I feel it touching me,
Healing me
Believes in me
Love labours on
Love labours on
Feel it wanting me,
Knowing me,
Believe, yeah
Love labours on
Love labours on
Ooh
Ooh
Are you wanting,
I know 'cause you're calling me, yeah
Are you needing,
Yeah 'cause you need from me
Wanting me,
Reaching me,
Wanting me,
Knowing me,
Believes in me.
Love labours on
Love labours on
Love labours on
Love labours on
Labours on
Love labours on
Love labours on
When you just can't sleep
And you're sick of counting the sheep
The sunlight in your head
Just won't let you put the days to bed
Pick a place to meet
In pajamas and bare feet
On a moonlit street
Move me to the rhythm of your heartbeat
Oh, the places we could go
Chicago, New York, and Toronto
And if it starts to snow
We can hop a train to Mexico
Where we'll sleep on the beach
With blankets made of leaves from palm trees
And we'll say "Let's never leave"
And that's when I'll feel the sun creeping up on me
I'll always wake up so confused
Each time I have that dream of you
So if you dreamt of me, too
Does that mean we dreamt the same dream
Restless little one
Comfortable and warm
Let me fall apart
Crippled in your arms
Chase me through the dark
Ready on your mark
First to reach the stars
Wins a broken heart
One that broke apart
Shattered from the start
Are you there?
Do you read me?
Are you there?
I don't feel you anymore
Cages and alarms
Keeping us from harm
I will be the guard
Hope to rest upon
Could I be the one
To break a will so strong
Pray it won't be long
Till your will is gone
Everything is done
Nothing left at all
Are you there?
Do you read me?
Are you there?
I don't feel you anymore
Are you there?
Will you give in?
Are you there?
If I give out
Over and out
Cages and alarms
Keeping us from harm
I will be the guard
Hope to rest upon
Everything is done
Nothing left at all
Are you there?
Do you read me?
Are you there?
I don't feel you anymore
Are you there?
Will you give in?
Are you there?
If I give out
You don't have to hear my heart beat
All you need is to look into my eyes
And tell me I'm the one you heart needs
I'n the only one you run to in the night
Oh let me burn the words "forever mine"
Across your heart, across your mind
Take your hands and feel my heart beat
Come and let me feel it in your eyes
All you have to do is touch me
Oh and lay your flame across my fire
Oh let me spread your wings and come inside
And take your heart and make you mind
Come and lay down your heart on me
All that I wanna feel is
Breathe in me
Lay down your heart on me
Feel you inside of me
Breathe on me
Come and take me on, take me down
Oh take me all the way
There's only one way
Only one thing I need, all I need
Take me way down
Come and lay down on me
This old house is falling down around my ears
I am drowning in a river of my tears
When all my will is gone you hold me sway
And I need you at the dimming of the day
You pull me like the moon pulls on the tide
You know just where I keep my better side
What days have come to keep us far apart
A broken promise or a broken heart
Now all the bonnie birds have wheeled away
And I need you at the dimming of the day
Come the night you're only what I want
Come the night you could be my confidant
I see you on the street in company
Why don't you come and ease your mind with me
I am living for the night we steal away
And I need you at the dimming of the day
Yes I need you at the dimming of the day
I said venice
You heard vegas
Now I say either way
Baby let's go
I get so shaky
And I just can't shake it
I bliss like this
I'm one of those
But I don't wanna wear you
Wear you like a band-aid
Wave you like a ticket
Out of my good grief
I just wanna know you
Know you like I know my garden
What you smell like when you're bloomin
What lives underneath
Deep down underneath
Way down underneath
We do a whole lotta laughin'
At the shyness that surrounds us
I do a whole lotta lookin'
Somewhere else
I don't need to look
No, I can just feel you
Besides every time I see you
It just forces me to look at myself
'Cause I get so shaky
And I just can't shake it
I bliss like this
I'm one of those
And I said venice
And you heard vegas
But now I say either way
Let's go
C'mon baby let's go
I know, I know, I know, I know what you'd say here
I know, I know, I know, I know all the games you play
I am, I am, I am, I am not afraid because
I know, I know, I know, I know what to say
I feel it
It's coming
It's here if you want it and
I am, out on my own
Moving in shadow
Nobody knows who I am
Standing alone
And it's me, but you can't see who I am
I'd like to rip you out of your skin
I'd switch us around and
Put you back in and
I know, I know, I know, I know what to say here
But it couldn't be any other way
'Cause I feel it
It's coming
It's here if you want it and
I am, out on my own
Moving in shadow
Nobody knows who I am
Standing alone
And it's me, but you can't see who I am
So close but you don't know
And it's me but you can't see (x6)
I feel it
It's coming
It's here if you want it
I am, out on my own
Moving in shadow
Nobody knows who I am
Standing alone
And it's me, but you can't see who I am
So close but you don't know
And it's me but you're never gonna see who I am
So close but you don't know
And it's me but you just can't see who I am
The water is wide
I cannot get o'er
And neither have I wings to fly
Give me a boat that can carry two
And both shall row my love and I
O love is handsomeand love is fine
And love's a jewel while its first new
But love grows old, and white's so cold
And fades away like morning dew
There is a ship, its sailing the sea
It's loaded deep as deep can be
But not so deep as my love for him
I know not if I sink or swim
The water is wide
I cannot get o'er
And neither have I wings to fly
Give me a boat that will carry two
And both shall row my love and I
And both shall row my love and I
(Smith/Daugherty)
Life is designed With unfinished lines 
That another sings Each story unfolds 
Like it was gold Upon a ragged wing 
The bold and the fair Suffer their share 
He whispered to his kin All of my debts 
Left with regrets I'm sorry for everything 
Trespasses stretch like broken fences Winding as they may 
Trespasses stretch like broken fences Hope to mend them one day 
And she pinned back her hair Shouldered with care 
The burdens that were his Mending the coat 
That hung on the post In heart remembering 
Trespasses stretch like broken fences Winding as they may 
Trespasses stretch like broken fences Hope to mend them one day 
And her time was to come Called to her son 
This your song to sing All of our debts 
Wove with regrets Upon a golden string 
And he found the old coat Hung on a post 
Like a ragged wing And took as his own 
The sewn and unsown Joyfully whistling
I woke up between dawn and night,
Thought I heard the voice of mommy.
Sound as if my parents had a fight,
So I woke up my brother lying next to me.
I wonder why she's making all that noise,
Better go and check-it out.
So without trying to breathe only the sound of little feet
We were about to discover what that noise was all about.
And as we opened up the door,
We saw them lying on the kitchen floor.
We were grateful for they both did their best,
But we said: 'Hey, ther must be an easier way to make breakfast.'
Breakfast
They both got up real fast
As if they were caught or something (mmmmmm)
And then we understood at last
It was a surprise breakfast they were planning.
Mommy stumbled: 'Later, kids, you'll understand.'
While daddy was busy putting on his pants.
We said: 'We already do, don't worry we'll do the rest.'
So far for our quest, we made coffee, boiled eggs.
We made them breakfast.
Breakfast
Jo poika kiskoo pojan unta vuoteessaan 
ennen kuin loppuun iltasadun saan,
Mä istun hetken ja mietin maailmaa
Ihmisenpoikaa se odottaa.
Voi kuinka kaunis poika onkaan tosiaan.
Ei muuhun pysty hän kuin uutta oppimaan.
Hän siinä kylkeänsä kääntää miehekkäästi ääntää.
Hän matkaa taittaa linnunradallaan ja nukkuu vaan.
chorus..
Voi kunpa matkas onneksi
koituis vihaa, katkeruutta et
tuntis joutavaa, voi kun oisit
viisaampi kuin isäs milloinkaan
kunpa oppisit ajattelemaan
Niin poika kiskoo pojan unta sikeää
kehtolaulu kesken taas kerran jää,
liukenee yöhön murheet aikuisen ihmisen poikaa kun katselen
Voi kuinka kaikkivaltias noin olla voit,
me sinut tehtiin mutta sinä meidät loit
Siinä tuhiset ja puhkut pelkkää voimaa uhkuen
silmänurkkiin kuivuu kyyneleet, sä matkaa teet
chorus
chorus
I'm bored, you're boarding the 504 out of town 
It's late, so look straight,
Don't pull your eyes off the ground 
You sit and wait across the gate 
The minutes stretch themselves so long 
You'll never be my destiny 
Because my destination's wrong 
Right coast, left coast 
Drifting round and round 
I'm lost, always 
And I know I can't be found 
Who made these customs I can't seem to get past? 
It's no use, since you've been born
Into a higher class 
When I want you, and only you
Somehow your baggage comes along 
And it never stops, no, it never stops
Until I'm back where I belong 
Right coast, wrong coast 
Drifting round and round 
I'm lost, always 
And I know I can't be found
You can't see me 
Across this great divide 
I'm lost, always 
If I'm not right by your side 
Back where I belong
Back where I belong 
Back where I belong 
Back where I belong 
Back where I belong 
Back where I belong 
Back where I belong 
Back where I belong
The sun goes down
And you're still here
I'm biting my tongue
And you're bending my ear
And what we have isn't clear.
So I go home to my
Sleeping misses
And shower her with my
Lazy kisses.
I can't stop acting my age
Cause hope stays or it fades.
And I should go home for now
Be a heavy hitter figure out where I went wrong
Home for now
You know I miss her and think about her all night long.
Now I'm bordering bored
My night been spent
Peeping sleepy faces off your tenement
And picking up the pieces
Passed country lines and interstate signs
We were here to sing
To shadow an endless dream
Left my family
Backstage we met
You were writing your set taped to your guitar
We talked till the owners swept outside the bakery door
But don't look at me this way in the broad light of day
We're not safe from the veil of the night
And it must be displaced
That look on your face
I never thought I'd find
Crossed tangled vines
You whisper signs
You could hear, you see
Yellow roses spring
Vase left a perfect ring
Is it morning or night
The missed call the missed flight
Cab is waiting
Remember the song that played
"You're somebody's baby"
So I can't look at you this way
In the broad light of day
We're not safe from the veil of the night
And it must be displaced
That look on my face
I never thought I'd find
So don't look at me this way
In the broad light of day
We're not safe from the veil of the night
And it must be displaced
That look on your face
I never thought I'd find
You give me something to hold on to
I hear your voice and it quiets my mind
Every beautiful melody
Every perfect piercing line
You give me something to hold on to
You are a vessel of light
To me tonight
And while I wrestle with demons and appetites
I cling to you
You give me something to hold on to
You tell the stories I need you to tell
Something in the way you sing
Pulls me out of my lonely hell
You give me something to hold on to
Sing to me...
You are a vessel of light
To me tonight
And while I wrestle with demons and appetites
I cling to you
Sing to me, sing to me
Your meloncholy song
Sing to me, sing to me
And I will hold on
You are a vessel of light
To me tonight
And while I wrestle with demons (angels and appetites
I cling to you
I cling to you tonight
Go write a message in the sand
Of what you want to say to me
Ice-cream won't be long
Now that I'm here with you
The glistening sea runs through your hands
As you float upon the sparkling sands
The setting sun shines on your hair
I'm walking on the salty air
You are... the prettiest thing
On saltcoats beach
Hand in hand
We stare across the oceans waves
Promise me
We'll do this again some day
The glistening sea runs through your hands
As you float upon the sparkling sands
The setting sun shines on your hair
I'm walking on the salty air
You are... the prettiest thing
On saltcoats beach
These wars, we face only keep me in my place.
The shadow I cast only grows, largest just right before.
It meets me, unwilling at the floor.
Where's your man?
He's lost and gone again
What is your name?
The name behind the shame
Where's the cup?
It was filled, now broken up
Where's your man?
He's lost and gone again
As I get behind the wheel again
Pray to live a million years
You know I lied, but if it makes you glad
I'll tell you what you want to hear
Play the song without the rhyme scheme
Play the song without the hook in the third line
So I can forget it easily
Like I wish I could forget you
The photographs without the faces
The photographs of just the landscapes where we've been
So I can forget them easily
Like I wish I could forget you
Like I wish I could forget you
Maybe I'll write this up or maybe I'll leave this down
Maybe I'll write this up or maybe I still look down
For you around the bend
For you around
Roll the film without the love scene
Roll the film with all of the car crashes and
Maybe I'll forget it easily
Like I wish I could forget you
Like I wish I could forget you
Maybe I'll write this up or maybe I'll leave this down
Maybe I'll write this up or maybe I still look down
For you around the bend
For you around the bend
For you around the bend
For you around
Maybe I'll write this out or maybe I'll leave this down
Maybe I'll write this out or maybe I still look down
Maybe I'll write this out or maybe I'll leave this down
Maybe I'll write this out or maybe I still look down
For you around the bend
For you around the bend
For you around the bend
For you around the bend
For you around the bend
For you around the bend
For you around the bend
For you around
You're earth bound and I'm injured
We move too fast to remember
The drive onto me
Drive onto me
We carved the days from the hours
You showed me all I could have
In the drive onto me
You were free when I was taken
You did your best to change that
In the drive onto me
You stop and I'm in over drive
You hooked the stars with your eyes
In the drive onto me
Accident when we needed
I'm stronger as we near it
We can't help to watch this whole thing crash together
We are the bruised and the tender
We are the crack that was mended
From all the times we ever tried
We should've found each other in this
Drive onto me
I was hiding in the light
And I failed to see your love
All my moments made of stone
All my angels made of words
All my angels made of words
I was waiting for your smile
Like time was on my side I said
It's not me you're looking for
There's no case for going there
With your down and perfect heart
With your down and perfect heart
I was waiting for your smile
Like time was on my side I said
My whispered reason is
The darkness of your kiss
I'm just waiting
I'm just waiting in the cold, wet snow
I'm just waiting
I'm just waiting for my love
So we can go away
So we can go away to a happy day
I'm just waiting
I'm just waiting for my love to come
I've been waiting
I've been waiting for so long
So we can go away
So we can go away to a happy day
If the sun is to set
To leave us dark with regret
I will work up the strength
To pull our earth back round again
And if the ocean should freeze
Before we've sailed all the seas
I will drop to my knees
Until Poseidon agrees
We could build an island
You and I could swim beside
Where we could ride the tides
Until we fall asleep at night
We could build an island
You and I could swim beside
Where we could ride the tides
Until we fall asleep at night
If you get scared of the space
Between now and those days
Then I will take you away
Somewhere fear has no place
We'd make ashes of our clothes
And grow a garden out of those
And watch the water as it rose
To bring the ocean to our toes
We could build an island
You and I could swim beside
Where we could ride the tides
Until we fall asleep at night
We could build an island
You and I could swim beside
Where we could ride the tides
Until we fall asleep at night
It's true
Distance just makes my heart grow for you
And everything I want for us to do
To build an island between me and you
Build an island between me and you
We could build an island
You and I could swim beside
And we could ride the tides
Until we fall asleep
We could build an island
You and I could swim beside
Where we could ride the tides
Until we fall asleep at night
We could build an island
You and I could swim beside
Where we could ride the tides
Until we fall asleep at night
We could build an island
We could ride the tides
Oh, we could build an island
Until we fall asleep at night
yo no quiero ver más
a todo aquel que se ha ido.
mi corazón roto ha venido, me habla y dice
que no le ha quedado nada, que él está vacío
me dice que todo se ha marchitado
y yo no tengo más que un río
tan seco el lecho,
que está agrietado profundamente.
la falta de agua. No le han echado asiduamente
Ahora, otrora
dando vueltas me voy dando cuenta estoy sola.
donde hubo fuego, heridas quedan
miré para otro lado y vi lo que pasó
no lo quiero
el tiempo ha terminado, mirá lo que quedó
no lo quiero. ahora, otrora
los recuerdos que el tiempo borró
The one that I loved, used to laugh when I cried.
The one that I loved, wouldn't stay by my side.
If love could've lasted forever I'd be with her today.
If love could've lasted forever I'd still hear her say darlin'
Kings of the highway we will be.
The faster you drive, the less you can feel.
The lights on the road, are strange and unreal.
When there's nothing to lose, there's nothing to win.
In a night without day, on a road without end darling,
Kings of the highway, we will be.
And your hoping the sun won't rise.
Your hoping the sun won't rise.
Kings of the highway, we will be.
The one that I loved, used to laugh when I cried.
The one that I loved, wouldn't stay by my side.
If love could've lasted forever I'd be with her today.
If love could've lasted forever I'd still hear her say darling,
Kings of the highway, we will be.
Darling kings... Of the highway... We will be.
Darling Kings... Of the highway... We will be.
We will be...
Ride on, ride on
Friends of the black swan
Ride on, ride on
Do you know where she's gone?
Gumdrops and Saturdays
Did Eric call by the way?
He knew, he knew
And he knew where the pillow goes
Ride on, ride on
Friends of the black swan
Ride on, ride on
You know where she's gone
Buttercups and the fishing flies
The biggest thickest ever sky
I know they know something
I know
Ride on, ride on now
Friends of the black swan
Ride on, ride on
You know where she's gone
Little green men do okay
It's the fairies' revenge they say
Gumdrops and Saturdays
Did Eric call?
Ride on, ride on
Friends of the black swan
Ride on, ride on
You know where she's gone
Ride on
Ride on

Take me on a ride inside your heart tonight
Just you and me
Take me to live inside the truth
Sugar, I wanna taste the way you feel inside
All through the night
Forget about the time
Just close your eyes
Sugar, always
Though my heart, it breaks, baby
Oh, let me be the one to come alone
Let me just be such a deep surprise
As the world you know begins to cry tonight
Just let it be, if you wanna grow it all must die
Sugar, we can come alive inside your dreams tonight
Live to believe you are the only one for me
Sugar, always
Though my heart, it breaks, baby
Oh, let me be the one to come alone
Let me just be such a deep surprise

I don't know why
I treat you like I do
When I love you
More than life itself
I must be another
Poor bastard
With the disease
Called selfishness
I'm a backstabber lady
But I don't know why
I throw these knives
I'm a backstabber lady
Even though this woman tries
To change her life
I'm so pathetic
When I cry
Begging for forgivness
And a one last try
And minutes after we've
Worked things out
I'm back and I'm throwing
These sharp knives
I'm a backstabber lady
But I don't know why
I throw these knives
I'm a backstabber lady
Even though this woman tries
To change her life
It was a dark and clouded night
Where neither star nor moon would shine
Yet standing in a pool of light
Like Saturn with its rings
A lonesome figure gleamed
So tall and wild and evergreen
With roots that reached out for the sea
Like dancers in the wind
Oh, hi
Love
So far from
From me
Those salt cliffs can't be scaled
The evidence of those who failed
Their skeletons lay strange and frail
Like lace among the rocks
So content to sit and wait
So dedicated to your fate
To never move, to never chase
You just stand up there and watch
Oh, hi
Love
So high up
Will you always be
Out of reach?
Oh, hi
Love
Oh, why
Love?
I wish that you would
Jump
But I can see
Your ties run deep
And it's not for me
To cut you free
They would seek high, they would seek low
Calling their manchild as the trouble did flow
There's always somebody to watch over me
I'm never alone, I wish they'd leave me be
Never alone
I'm never alone...
I'm just a boy, not long for this world
I'm called Nelsito and I'm thirteen years old
For nearly two decades this vendetta has raged
There are no men -- I'm the last in the chain
Last in the chain
I'm manchild man
Marimba sing high, marimba sing low,
Marimba sing high as the cemetery grows
All have been wept for husbands, brothers, grandsons,
Grandfathers, nephews, cousins, uncles, fathers, and sons
I walk in boots too big for me
The women do cry as they watch over me
I work at the altar, I try to be good
But just like the others, I'll soon travel in wood
I try to be good
Manchild in wood
I wait for manhood
I'm the manchild.
First we drink our coffee now,
And talk about nothing in particular.
Why don't we just sit back and enjoy the silence for a while.
Truth no lies, tears and smiles are locked in our eyes
As we sit here and drink a beer and do nothing in particular.
Nothing in particular.
But I enjoy myself; I got my friends around me.
Close your eyes and drift away.
You don't have to stay awake to talk to me when you know nothing to say.
Why can't we just sit back and feel the love between us now.
Truth no lies, tears and smiles are locked in our eyes
As we sit here and drink a beer and do nothing in particular.
Nothing in particular.
But I enjoy myself; I got my friends around me.
The wind that cracks the leaves
Has scattered all the seed
Lo, the light limned low
Low to the ground
The time is all I own
And time is come and gone
The limbs of life left low
Low to the ground
To the ground
To the ground
To the ground
The sight that holds my eyes
Has made the lovers blind
Alike their love laid low
Low to the ground
I sound the oath to sit
In thrall of weathers wit
Ally the languished lips
Low to the ground
To the ground
To the ground
To the ground
The seed that left the tree
Will carve a thousand leaves
And let them all to cleave
Cleave to the ground
To the ground
Did you hurt your hand again last night when you fell in the snow?
Shuffle shuffle shuffle shuffle your feet without looking down.
You know how to place your feet carefully on the ground.
Lighten up
Lighten up
Lighten up, you say lighten up
Lighten up
But here it's dangerous, not like home.
You never know what might be under the snow.
Lighten up
Lighten up
Lighten up, you say lighten up
Lighten up
Tomorrow when we walk in the cold, keep hold your hand 'cause you know I like it so when.
If you push me down I will try not to care about what might me under there
Lighten up
Lighten up
Lighten up, you know, lighten up
Lighten up
Storm warning, feels like a heavy rain
Winds on the coast tonight
We may get tossed tonight
Storm warning, he made it pretty plain
He's fallin' for another, found a new lover
And he won't be back again
Can't stop a river, when it's burst it's banks
I've seen the look in his eyes
He's in love and hypnotized
Time of mourning
There's already been a flood of my tears
Such a sense of loss tonight
Not to do but ride it out
Storm warning, storm warning
Can't stop a river when it's burst it's banks
I wonder how long it's gonna take
To get over this heartbreak
Storm warning, feels like a heavy rain
Winds on the coast tonight
We may get tossed tonight
Storm warning, storm warning
Storm warning, storm warning
If the sun refused to shine, I would still be loving you
If mountains crumble to the sea, there would still be you and me
Kind woman, I give you my all
Kind woman, nothing more
Little drops of rain, whispers of the pain
Of tears of loves lost in the days gone by
Our love is strong, with you there is no wrong
Together we shall roll until we die
Inspiration is what you are to me
Inspiration, look and see
And so today, my world it smiles, your hand in mine, we walk the miles
And thanks to you it will be done, for you to me are the only one
Happiness, no more be sad
Happiness, I am glad
Little drops of rain, whispers of the pain
Of tears of loves lost in the days gone by
Our love is strong, with you there is no wrong
Together we shall roll until we die
If the sun refused to shine, I would still be loving you
If mountains crumble to the sea, there would still be you and me
Null Uhr zehn und keine Spur von Dir,
Ihr Business läuft hoch auf Tour.
Die Stärksten der Stadt ergeben sich
Gefügig ihrer Kur.
"Gold'ne Nase" heißt sie auf der Szene
Ah, ah, sie schärft bei Dir und
Sie schläft bei mir.
Zuviel Hitze im Tiefkühlfach,
Zuviel Hitze in Ihr.
Es ist zu heiß für mich in dieser Stadt,
Hier ist zuviel weiß,
Ich sehe mich nicht satt.
Es hat zuviel Hitze, und da friere ich,
Ja diese Stadt hat nichts
Für mich und Dich,
Hey, baby, tell your daddy,
What's goin' wrong with you!
Drei Uhr zwanzig und kein Stern in Sicht,
Ein Blaulicht stoppt den Verkehr.
Vier Uhr zehn liegt sie am Eis
Und vergisst,
Die Hitze schafft sie nicht mehr.
Nehmt Euch den Ring,
Den mit dein weißen Steinen.
Er ist ja doch nur von mir -
So viel Hitze im Tiefkühlfach,
So viel Liebe in Ihr
Und Staub zu Staub vergeht.
Ich komme viel zu spät.
Es war zu heiß für sie in dieser Stadt,
Hier war zuviel weiß,
Sie wurde niemals satt,
Es hat zuviel Hitze,
Und da friere ich,
Ja diese Stadt hat nichts
Für dich und mich,
Und mich, und niemanden
I sit alone contemplating
What is missing inside me
I desperately try to remember
A life that's not meant to be
I meditate
And try to recapture
Some sense of reality
In my life (?)
When I look around
I see numb empty faces
The world is waiting to die
And this apathy
Is so suffocating
The slow decay of my mind
I've searched the world
For someone with answers
To questions that are plaguing me
I scream in vain
To anyone who'll listen
But everbody's watchin' TV
Is anyone alive?
Am I lost in a world
Where nothing matters?
Am I lost in a world
Where no one cares?
Is anyone alive? (x2)
Are we lost in a world
Where nothing matters?
Are we lost in a world
Where no one cares?
Is anyone alive? (x2)
Over where the rainbow meets the darkened sky.
I pretended there was hope for you and I.
Now too late I guess the real world I find.
You changed your mind, you changed your mind.
Over where tomorrow chases clouds away.
I pretended that somehow you'd really stay.
Now I'm left here with those dreams you tossed away.
You changed your mind, you changed your mind.
Over where the rainbow meets the darkened sky.
I believed that we would never say goodbye.
Now I'm standing here alone too late to cry.
You changed your mind, you changed your mind.
You changed your mind, you changed your mind.
I want your love, I need your love. Too late you changed your mind.
I want your love, I still need your love. Too late you changed your mind.
Oh, you changed you mind, oh, you changed your mind, you changed your mind.
Oh, you changed your mind.
When you were mine
I gave you all of my money
Time after time
Yeah you done me wrong
It's just like a train
That all my friends come over and eat
You were so strange
You didn't have the decency to change those sheets
Oh Girl
When you were mine
I used to let you wear all of my clothes
You were so fine
Or maybe that's the reason that it hurt me so
I know
That you're goin' with another guy
I...
I don't care
'Cause I love you baby, that's no lie
I love you more than I did when you were mine
So when you were mine
You were kinda sorta my best friend
So I will find
I let you fool around
You never cared
I never was the kind to make a fuss
When he was there
Sleeping in between the two of us
I know
That you're goin' with another guy
I...
I don't care
'Cause I love you baby, that's no lie
I love you more than I did when you were mine
So when you were mine
You were all I ever wanted to do
Now I spend my time
Following him whenever he's with you
I know
That you're goin' with another guy
I...
I Don't care
'Cause I love you baby, that's no lie
I love you more than I did when you were mine
I know
That you're goin' with another guy
I
I Don't care
'Cause I love you baby, that's no lie
I love you more than I did when you were mine
Instrumental
I see you shivering from the cold
You slip in front of me, in the queue
The people behind us staring
You get the privilege of being with me
Like I get the poetry in motion
Of your body next to mine
I believe in the way that you move
I believe in the way that you move
My mind is in the gutter
But I'm looking up the skirts of the stars
You wouldn't get it
Why does it matter how I treat you
When TV says the world is crushing down around us
The sadness that comes in the mornings will be washed away
You'll see to that, but how long will it last
I believe in the way that you move
I believe in the way that you've touched me somehow
I believe in the way that you move
I believe in the way that you move
The sadness that comes in the night times will fade away
You'll see to that, but how long will it last
Is it worse to smile falsely or to frown
I could've guessed but now I'm finding out
From the pleasures we define
Well, I'm sure we'll be fine
I wonder how your body tastes
Inside of someone else's place
Pull away your eyes it's nothing left to heal
I'm alone but I know everything you feel
And you waited on the rain
For tears my heart has caged
And we fall through fate
But we raise and rise again
And I run, run, run, run, run,
And I run, run, run, run, run,
I run, run, run, run, run,
I just run run run.
Tell me how you close the door,
No one, nobody can love you more,
Telling all your friends that this love is just made for bleeding,
And upon new road I have started keep on, try to breath in.
And you waited on the rain,
For tears my heart is caged,
And we fall through fate,
But we rise and rise again.
And I run, run, run, run, run,
And I run, run, run, run, run,
I run, run, run, run, run,
I just run run run.
Our laws are fading,
Tied up and changed.
And you waited on the rain,
For tears my heart is caged,
And we fall through fate,
But we rise and rise again.
And I run, run, run, run, run,
And I run, run, run, run, run,
I run, run, run, run, run,
I just run run run.
las cosas sólo son
los rayos, los árboles son
las praderas, los desastres
son las sombras y el calor
el mar, la tierra son
las piedras, los pájaros son
sólo son sin albedrío
son los brillos, el color
agradezco su humildad
pues gracias a ella soy
una estrella en el cielo
un camino
abierto en flor
Kun elämä on pitkä uneton yö
Kirjoitan maailmaa kodiksi
Missä kuljet kapeaa rantakaistaa
Välillä meren ja maan
Kun jäljet sotkeutuu liejuun
Kaikista vastauksista tahtoo pois
Ole pelottava kuin kevään liekki
Ole kaunis kuin kukkiva puu
Merivirtojen juoksuun
Tai tuuleen, sen kirjoitukseen
Lennä mieleni lennä
Voit mennä, en pelkää ollenkaan
Ja oikea siipi on valkee
Ja se vasen musta on
Ja päivä on auringon kultaa
Ja yö on kylmä, valoton
Ja oikea siipi on valkee
Ja se vasen musta on
Älä putoa, katso alas
Siellä kyllin kauan vietit
Mietit miten lopettaa
Vanhan runontekijän sanoin
Täynnä uhmaa ja kauneutta
Luon rannanmitan valkeaa vaahtoa
Sinut kauniina kuin kärsivä jumala
Olen väsynyt moniin sanoihin
Olen väsynyt itseeni
Jos sanot jätä kaikki, seuraa minua
Jättäisin ja seuraisin
Only a few things will we recall
With love, with gratitude
Only a few things
On the hour in which I die
So if I cannot tell you if though words I do not find I want you to know
There are only a few things
That I will be carrying
In my memory when I go
Only a few things will we recall
With true happiness with gratitude
Only a few things I see you, I see you
You, you were the joy in my life
The one who loved my tired bones
You are the one who came to stay
So if I do not tell you if I don't find the words
It is not because I don't feel it in my heart
You're the one who loved my tired bones
You're the one who took me home
You're the one who loved my tired bones
You're the one who took me home
You, you brought joy to my world
So I will tell you now
In case you don't know
You will be with me when I go
Only a few things will we recall
With love, with gratitude
Only a few things
On the hour in which I die
When you're alone
There is no one to pull you under
When you're alone
There is no one to break your fall
When there is nothing
Left for them to plunder
They leave without a whisper
They leave without a glance
Because you have nothing
In your hands
To make them want to glance your way
When you're alone
There is no one to keep you caged in
When you're alone
There is no one to keep you warm
And if you try
To keep all of the rage in
It breeds a world of anger
It breeds a world of pain
Till you surrender
Half insane
Half wishing you could start again
I've seen the mortal danger
I've seen it hide away
It's very treasure, just in case
And no one ever looked your way
I've seen the mortal danger
It breathes, it is my friend
It is my saviour, my mistake
The one thing I refuse to fake
Susanne tog en återvändsgränd
Det visste hon nog för länge sen
Så mycket piller, så lite sömn
Så lite ork, så mycket dröm
Och Magnus gick in i en vit korridor
Kvarten för ensam, stan för svår
Och Jonas ska hitta en mening i nån indisk by
Så trött på sanningen, behövde en ny
Och tornet i Sofia sträcker upp sig mot himlen
Över torgen här går var och en för sig
Om vi förlorar varandra här i vimlet
Så minns att jag står bakom dig
Och Karin slutade prata och for
Tillbaka till sitt flickrum, hem till mor
Och Anders är alltid glad, alltid glad
Det springer råttor bakom ridån på hans estrad
Och Linnea höll för hårt på sin moral
Varje dag, ett samvetskval
Du blir så ensam när du drömmer grandiost
Du blir så hånad, bränd och blåst
Och tornet i Sofia sträcker upp sig mot himlen
Över torgen här går var och en för sig
Om vi förlorar varandra här i vimlet
Så minns att jag står bakom dig
Dom sista drömmarna sträcker sig mot himlen
Över torgen här går var och en för sig
Om vi förlorar varandra här i vimlet
Så minns att jag står bakom dig
The words of love are not enough
Though sweet as wine, as thick as blood
Passionless moments and we are homeless
Out on the street
But life is cool and things aren't bad
Got what he wants, lost what he had
He's soon adjusted and got accustomed to these new ways
Blame God, how can you loose
Singing such sweet rhythm and blues
Strange days, she said to me
Being in love don't mean you're free
But night reveals what daytime hides
Who lingers on, who sleeps outside
The soft seduction, the strong attraction
Somewhere downtown
A junkie's song, a dancer's knees
The laws of chance strange as it seems
Take us exactly where we most likely need to be
A junkie's song, a dancer's knees
The laws of chance strange as it seems
Take us exactly where we most likely need to be
Oh, father time
That meet a maid who lends one lively winking eye
We dance a borrowed chick while hiding from the fine
Oh, what I wouldn't spend to lend you mine, hmm
Nobody knows where they are going
Oh, how we try to wrap our minds
Over the edge of all our knowings
Be it a bang or the divine
Tip of my iceberg blues are showing
I've never been one for goodbyes
So, till I meet you there, I'm singing
A traveling song to ease the ride
And so you know, everywhere I roam
I'll see you on the road, ooh
Oh, I take it in vain
All the plans and moves that we made
Half a heart is aching to grow
So many times, just lovers you know, I know, I know
Your eyes are the rain, just a soul that's changin' in shape
I'll be laughin' all of the way
Thinkin' 'bout the days, oh
Nobody knows where they are going
Oh, how we try to wrap our minds
Over the edge of all our knowings
Be it a bang or the divine
Tip of my iceberg blues are showing
I've never been one for goodbyes
So, till I meet you there, I'm singing
A traveling song to ease the ride
And so you know, everywhere I roam
I'll see you on the road
So, farewell to my friend
He who taught me to love like a beast
And to feast like the queen that he fed turtle soup
Little boy from Paris to the States, check the facts
That was Magical Max
He was black sheep and mischief and loved for his craft
Then he told me that I was Apollo 13
On that very last day, he said
"Shoot for your dreams, little girl, to the stars,"
Well I'm taking you with me
Now this one is ours
And I know what you'd say, you'd say
"On with the show,"
So on we go
What's happenin', man
It's T.I.P., you know
I'd like to dedicate this song to anyone who done ever lost somebody
To the grave, to the streets, or to the jail cell
I done been in situations when I had to cope with all three, you know what I'm sayin'?
I feel like the only thing I ain't done yet is die, you know
But it ain't how I live while I'm here
It's how I live when I leave, you dig?
Jamie Foxx:
Life's ups and downs, they come and go
T.I.:
But when I die, I hope I live in the sky
All my folk who ain't alive, I hope they live in the sky
Pray to God when I die that I live in the sky
Jamie Foxx:
It's true, what goes around comes back, you know
T.I.:
So when I die, I hope I live in the sky
All my folk who ain't survive, may they live in the sky
Tell God I wanna fly, let me live in the sky
My cousin Toot ain't have to die, right in front of his son
And his wife, he lost his life strugglin' over a gun
Give a damn what he done, it's my motherfuckin' fault
And I loved that nigga to death, no motherfuckin' joke
I can fell my eyes fillin', the Lord is my witness
If I catch 'im, I'ma kill 'im, I made it my business
Back in the day, you stayed in my business
Taught me I ain't have to incorporate yay in my business
Coincidentally, that's why today you're not with me
My cousin died over some yay and I miss him
Plus he had his family out, let's say she the eyewitness
But her boyfriend did the shootin', judge gave a light sentence
I heard that, now I'm dressed up in all black
Shot up the whole 'partments, and still ain't brought back
The best friend I had in Tremell, I lost that
Guess your death was a lesson in life, it taught me that
Jamie Foxx:
Life's ups and downs, they come and go
T.I.:
But when I die, I hope I live in the sky
All my folk who ain't alive, I hope they live in the sky
Pray to God when I die that I live in the sky
Jamie Foxx:

So when I die, I hope I live in the sky
All my folk who ain't survive, may they live in the sky
Tell God I wanna fly, let me live in the sky
You ain't never seen a nigga ago to jail and sleep till day 2?
Well, that's how sick I was when J-Rue
Found out the hard way that was powder that they were tootin'
Overdosed on herion, died at 22
If ya ain't heard about your daughter, she smiles just like you
So cute, even resorts to violence like you
You know your baby mama loose, but ha, what can you do?
And I got for myself, yep, it's been a few
Now everything I do is for King, Messiah, Deyjah, Domani
Tell the Lord, they all I got, so please don't take them from me
From me standin' in the trap with Curran and Sir Cap
Laughin' at the niggas who serve with no strap
Tell 'em niggas, man, y'all trippin' with no maps
Get robbed and that's the part where my pistol ain't no help
Me, you, the crew just fell out over dough and a li'l crack
Never could apologize 'cause you died, that's why they say that
Jamie Foxx:
Life's ups and downs, they come and go
T.I.:
But when I die, I hope I live in the sky
All my folk who ain't alive, I hope they live in the sky
Pray to God when I die that I live in the sky

I bet you niggas think I'm livin' it up
Till you see polices laughin' as they pickin' me up
Went from seein' how many bitches I could fit in the truck
To three hots and a cot, is you kiddin' or what?
Fuck how many millions I got, nigga, so what if I'm hot
When I got prices on my head, feds rushin' my spot?
A million haters want me dead, forced to carry a gat
"But you is a seven time felon, what you doin' with that?"
It's a catch-22, either you lose or you lose
That's the way the game's structured, for real niggas to suffer
And I ain't never been a buster, always stood on my feet
Like a man, prepared to take whatever comin' for me
A pussy nigga or polices with a warrant for me
I'm a G prepared to die for what's important to me
Look anybody in the eye who say he want it from me
Put up the house and bet the odds if it's coming from me
O.G.'s say I need to learn to be patient
You tellin' me with these seven years of probation?
Pistol charges and a host of other open cases
If niggas only knew the kind of time I was facin'
I try to keep it to myself, but sometimes I couldn't it
Got four kids, the smiles on they faces
Mean more to me than my crown and my bracelet
Take that away from me and my life is butt naked
Jamie Foxx:
Life's ups and downs, they come and go

All my folk who ain't alive, I hope they live in the sky

Ay, man, I'd like to dedicate this song to my cousin Toot
Alejandro Tremell Morgan, man, I miss the shit out you, my nigga
I'd also like to dedicate this to my homeboy J-Rue
Jamal Hendrix, what's happenin'
Also my partner Bankhead, (??), what it is, nigga
P$C for life and death
And my li'l homeboy Poncho, and my li'l homeboy Rico
I shed tears writin' this song, homeboy, that was real talk, man
Ay, I wanna live in the sky
Hey, let me live in the sky
Pray to God that I live in the sky
It's time to let go
Time to spend some time alone
Farbeit to explain what has been done
And what is illusion
We have outlived ourselves
By many a ruined year
The future ripped from a tattered page
Like the violence in dream-dead eyes
The reflections of a thousand tangled views
Cause and effect
Like the diamond that cuts the light
Radiation from a single mind
We could outlive ourselves
By many a ruined year
Acting out a tedious wish long fulfilled
Over and over and over again
It's time to let go
Time to spend some time alone
Reconsider what could be done
Unbind the imagination
We're ready for a new age of innocence
I've been thinking for a while
That I should fly
Tired of walking on my feet
They're so tired
They're so tired
The brown shoes are old
And the ground is hard
And the view is much nicer from the sky
From up in the sky they're just people
But from here they're liars, cheaters and thieves
From up in the sky they're just people
But from here they're liars, cheaters and thieves
I've been thinking for a while
That I should fly
I've been thinking for a while
That I should fly
From up in the sky I can't see your lies
I can't see right through your lies
From up in the sky you are kind you are wise
But from here I'd rather be blind
From up in the sky they're just people
But from here they're liars, cheaters and thieves
From up in the sky they're just people
But from here they're liars, cheaters and thieves
I've been thinking for a while
That I should fly
I've been thinking for a while
That I should fly
I've been thinking for a while
That I should fly
I've been thinking for a while
That I should fly

Sun Summer Sun
I won't be long
Everything's in a permanent
State of flux
Enjoy yourself
To the full
We are obsessed
With transitory pictures
Out of sight
Out of mind
Mind the wind, my love
The path to
Salvation is tough
Ha ha ha
Ha ha ha
Life's a joke
A waiting game now.
A juggling of vices
Tiny tiny vices
And they don't anchor me
To the ground
I know who the hangman is
So life's a joke
Ha ha ha
Ha ha ha
The clocks on the wall
Creeps higher.
Save save
Restraint restraint.
It's a joke
And I know who the hangman is
A ship in a vial
A headstone on the wharf
And it will pin me
To the ground
Ha ha ha
Ha ha ha
All the lights look green
So unbend
Your toughest smile
I think we've got
I think we've got
I think we've got
One more mile
Some are dreamers
And some are realists
But, we all welcome change
This is goodbye, gravity
You no longer keep me grounded
This is world as we know it
This is world as we know it
This is world as we know it
This is world as we know it
Some are lovers
And some are fighters
But, we all pump the same red blood into our veins
The new is in, and we're feeling better already
This is world as we know it
(Oh, oh oh oh...)
(Whispers...)
I'm so tired of being here
Suppressed by all my childish fears
And if you have to leave
I wish that you would just leave
'Cause your presence still lingers here
And it won't leave me alone
These wounds won't seem to heal
This pain is just too real
There's just too much that time cannot erase
When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears
When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears
And I held your hand through all of these years
But you still have all of me
You used to captivate me
By your resonating light
Now I'm bound by the life you left behind
Your face it haunts my once pleasant dreams
Your voice it chased away all the sanity in me
These wounds won't seem to heal
This pain is just too real
There's just too much that time cannot erase
When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears
When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears
And I held your hand through all of these years
But you still have all of me
I've tried so hard to tell myself that you're gone
But though you're still with me
I've been alone all along
When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears
When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears
And I held your hand through all of these years
But you still have all of me
Me
Me
She had been here a thousand times before
Memories got spilled without shame
And even though she tried to take the blame
She's walking away, she's walking away
Sleep in silence, reshape, today
Sleep in silence, reshape, another way
She had been here a thousand times before
You're a simple fool without shame
And even though she tried she feels the same
She's walking away, she's walking away
Sleep in silence, reshape
She's another's destiny
I'm trying to break this memory
Until her new face changes
We'll never see her again.
Sleep in silence, reshape
She's dancing, dancing
It's never gonna be the same
Sleep in silence, reshape
She's dancing, dancing
She's never coming back again
She had been here a thousand times before
Memories got spilled without shame
And even though she tried to take the blame
She's walking away, she's walking away
Sleep in silence, reshape
She's another's destiny
I'm trying to break this memory
Until her new face changes
We'll never see her again.
Sleep in silence, reshape
She's dancing, dancing
It's never gonna be the same
Sleep in silence, reshape
She's dancing, dancing
She's never coming back again
Sleep in silence, reshape
She's another's destiny
She's another's destiny
Sleep in silence, reshape
She's another's destiny
Today
She's another's destiny
Elämän keskipäivässä
Minäkin eksyin synkkään metsään
Aamupäiväin kappaleisiin
Iltojen ikävään
Missä
Kasvot puhuvat omaa kieltään
Oppivat suruaan nauramaan
Ja elämän hauraat astiat
Katsovat ihmetellen toisiaan
Askel ja pysähdys kerrallaan
Yksi nurin yksi oikein
Etsi tietä joka hehkuu
Polkua joka puhuu
Se on käsiesi liikkeissä
Se on taivaankannen valoissa
Se on päivällä ja yöllä ja aina
Se on täällä se on muualla
Se ei puhu, ei voi vastata
Olen ymmärtänyt tämän sen valossa
Talvi toi meidät tähän paikkaan
Missä lepäämme kylki kyljessä
Opimme enemmän toisiamme
Opimme ajoissa luopumaan
En ehkä tiedä mitä tehdä
Vaikka joskus olenkin varma
Ja joskus makaan aivan hiljaa
Ja uskallan vain epäillä
Jos yrittäisin puhua vain sanoja
Käsiin jäänyt kosketuksen paloja
Täytyy luopua, ajatella uudelleen
Itsensä ja muut
Se on käsiesi liikkeissä
Se on taivaankannen valoissa
Se on päivällä ja yöllä ja aina
Se on täällä se on muualla
Se ei puhu, ei voi vastata
Olen ymmärtänyt tämän sen valossa
She was so beautiful to watch
Swirling in and out of view
A seemingly Spanish dancer hands and heel
A moonfaced girl with eyes downturned
Subtle flusters beneath blackened threads
Refined and tempting
So shy and enticing yet I fear
She'll disappear before the night ends
Time seems to bring us together again
A decade later and another face
Are you the girl I've been dreaming of?
You look like her smell like her
That raven-haired beauty of another time
A rush of memories washing over me
I've always been waiting for someone to set me free
Those eyes quietly tell me of a passion we could share
The dance reminds me of a life that we once knew
Snares for my hopes snares for my thoughts
Snares for my dreams drifting onto oblivion
Can you tell me about the intuition I feel
Can you tell me about everything I long to understand?
Remnants of a deeper purity
Remnants of a deeper purity
She was so beautiful to watch drifting out into oblivion
A moonfaced memory with eyes downturned
Are you the one the one I've been dreaming of?
You come to me at midnight and say, 'It's dark in here' 
You know you robbed me of my sight, and light is what I fear 
I tell you that I can not see but you persist in showing me 
Those bangles that I paid for long ago
And though my face is smiling I'm really feeling low
And though you say you're with me I know that it's not so
Your skin crawls up an octave, your teeth have lost their gleam 
The peaches snuggle closer down into the clotted cream 
And for some unknown reason my watch begins to chime 
And though I beg and plead with you, you tell me it's not time
And though my face is smiling I'm really feeling low
And though you say you're with me I know that it's not so
The sun seeps through the window to see if we're still dead 
To try to throw some light upon the gloom around our bed 
At quarter-past the doorbell rings, the water faucet drips and sings 
And still my reason will not rhyme, and still you tell me it's not time
And though my face is smiling I'm really feeling low
And though you say you're with me I know that it's not so 
You really know that it's not so
I hear the drizzle of the rain
Like a memory it falls 
Soft and warm, continuing
Tapping on my roof and walls
And from the shelter of my mind
Through the window of my eyes
I gaze beyond the rain-drenched streets
To England where my heart lies
My mind's distracted and diffused
My thoughts are many miles away
They lie with you when you're asleep
And kiss you when you start your day
And the song I was writing is left undone
I don't know why I spend my time
Writing songs I can't believe
With words that tear and strain to rhyme
And so, you see, I have come to doubt
All that I once held as true
I stand alone without beliefs
The only truth I know is you
And as I watch the drops of rain
Weave their weary paths and die
I know that I am like the rain
There, but for the grace of you, go I

This is for all the lonely people
Thinkin' that life has passed them by
Don't give up until you drink from the silver cup
Ride that highway in the sky
This is for all the single people
Thinkin' that life has left them dry
Don't give up until you drink from the silver cup
You'll never know until you try
'Cause, I'm on my way, yes, I'm on my way
Yeah, I'm on my way back home
This is for all the lonely people
Thinkin' that life has passed them by
Don't give up until you drink from the silver cup
She'll never take you down or never give you up
You'll never know until you try
'Cause, I'm on my way, yes, I'm on my way
Yeah, I'm on my way back home
Yes, I'm on my way, yeah, I'm on my way
Yes, I'm on my way back home
Misfortune, got you like a sickness
The saints and angels all agree
Trouble sure as trouble sees it
I need it in writing to believe
To believe
The target was your heart in the beginning
Now there digging soft ground for your grave
I hope the mourners will bring plastic flowers
They'll drink to your death with pink champagne
Pink champagne
Now I hear your widow crying
Her weeping I made into this song
It's popular with the disco dancers
They'll play it on the radio all week long
All week long
Misfortune, got you like a sickness
And the saints, the angels all agree
Trouble sure as trouble sees it
I need it in writing to believe
To believe
Huokaus kulkee, se syliinsä sulkee
Jo vierähtäneen kyyneleen
Tunnelma lämmin ja surullinen
Mutta silti onnellinen
Sun jalkasi hakkaavat katujen kultaa
Mä jähmetyn keskellä jään
Sä lähetät kaukaisen kaupungin luolista
Valoa lämmittävää
Me neroja ollaan sä tiesitkö sen
Me keksimme rakkauden
Sä olen maa, mä olen kuu
Sä olet kuu, mä olen maa
Rakennan sun sydämeesi taloa mä rakastan sua
Enemmän kuin Jumalaa
Rakennan sun sydämeesi taloa mä rakastan sua
Enemmän kuin Jumalaa
Hetkemme kauneimmat liian kauniita
Sanojen viekkaudelle
Rakkaus on rauhaa ja vapautta
Sanoja raiskattuja
On kotini linnaakin komeampi
Sydämesi
On kotisi lämmin ja lohdullinen
Sydämeni
Me neroja ollaan sä tiesitkö sen
Me keksimme rakkauden
Sä olet maa, mä olen kuu
Sä olet kuu, mä olen maa
Rakennan sun sydämeesi taloa mä rakastan sua
Enemmän kuin Jumalaa
Rakennan sun sydämeesi taloa mä rakastan sua
Enemmän kuin Jumalaa
Julistan sun sydämesi valoa mä rakastan sua
Enemmän kuin Jumalaa
Rakennan sun sydämeesi taloa mä rakastan sua

Don't be afraid
It's a harmless moon
All we can do
Is to assume
Our lives must change
A change is due
I hear you say
What are we going to do
I don't know, make it
I don't know, shake it
I don't know, break it down
What are you want to do
I don't know, make it
I don't know, shake it
I don't know, break it down
Oh, weeping night
Oh, grieving sky
Oh, rabbit wind
You just flew by
Grant me this
Some small reward
Don't announce
The time of the final call
I don't know, make it
I don't know, shake it
I don't know, break it down
What are you want to do
I don't know, make it
I don't know, shake it
I don't know, break it down
My dream was this
Across the sky
A slate-grey cloud
That filled the eye
A slate-grey cloud
Comes through the dust
Locust
I don't know, make it
I don't know, shake it
I don't know, break it down
What are you want to do
I don't know, make it
I don't know, shake it
I don't know, break it down
Don't be afraid
It's a harmless moon
Don't be afraid
It's a harmless moon
Ah
My brother dreaming of a new land
Where the rivers wind through the villages
And the people breathe so easily
All the region trees go the same way
Don't have to go
I know you know you know
But if you gotta go
Whoa-oh
Safe travels
My brother wander in the tall grass
It's ok to run we expect you back
Know how to climb a tree
I assume you do
I admit it
Man I'm not as sharp as you
Oh but I know
It's still a war down there
And if ya gotta go
Whoa-oh
Safe travels
Oh oh safe travels
Oh oh safe travels
Oh oh safe travels
Oh oh safe travels
Girl of sixteen
Whole life ahead of her
Slashed her wrists
Bored with life
Didn't succeed
Thank the Lord
For small mercies 
Fighting back the tears
Mother reads the note again
Sixteen candles burn in her mind
She takes the blame
It's always the same
She goes down on her knees and prays 
I don't want to start
Any blasphemous rumours
But I think that God's
Got a sick sense of humor
And when I die
I expect to find Him laughing 
Laughing
Girl of eighteen
Fell in love with everything
Found new life
In Jesus Christ
Hit by a car
Ended up
On a life support machine 
Summer's day
As she passed away
Birds were singing
In the summer sky
Then came the rain
And once again
A tear fell
From her mother's eye 
I don't want to start
Any blasphemous rumours
But I think that God's
Got a sick sense of humor
And when I die
I expect to find Him laughing
I don't want to start
Any blasphemous rumours
But I think that God's
Got a sick sense of humor
And when I die
I expect to find Him laughing
When you fall, when you fall
Into my sleep
I'll turn around
And breathe you out
I'll breathe you out
Little heart
I wake up, I wake up
It's dark again
The lighthouse's burned
There's no way out, no way out
Little heart
I will save, I will save
My home on the streets
Where will I end
But will I be, will I be
Little heart
How can I
Walk around
Like this
(Like this)
How can I
Walk around
Every song, every song
Appears in between
You're someone else
Than before, someone else
Little heart
Maybe I, maybe I
I can find
The last lighthouse
A silent mind
An empty cage
Little heart
We were glass
We were wax
In stranger's hands
We brought us down
It brought us down
To strangest hand
Little heart
How can I
Walk around
Like this
(Like this)
I can see
Floating hearts
I miss
(I miss)
How can I
Walk around
Like this
(Like this)
I can see
Floating hearts
I miss

Mogę wszystko Ci dać
Wszystko czego Ci brak
By przy Tobie znów być
Tak blisko znów
Powiedz tylko, że chcesz
Nie odrzucaj dziś mnie
Nawet gdy dotyk mój sprawia Ci ból
Tylko ból
Jeśli wierzysz dziś, że możesz zmienić to
Jeśli sprawisz, że ja też zapragnę Cię 
Dzisiaj zobaczysz mnie
Taką jak widzieć chcesz
Dzisiaj siłę Ci dam
I uwierzysz, że
Pójdę gdzie zechcesz mnie
Zobaczyć i mieć
Nawet gdy dotyk Twój
Sprawi mi ból
Tylko ból
Pozwól być blisko tak
Tak byś poczuł miłość mą
Chcę byś żył tym co ja
Chcę Ci ofiarować to
Teraz wiem jak bardzo Cię chcę
I czuję to tak
I chcę żebyś poczuł i pragnął jak ja
Nie pozwól mi odejść gdy bardzo
Tak bardzo Cię
Chcę 
Jeśli wierzysz dziś, że możesz zmienić to
Jeśli sprawisz, że ja też zapragnę Cię
Za tę chwilę oddałabym wszystko
Gdybyś tylko pragnął mnie
Days are going faster than I ever could keep up
Overwhelming, the bed I've tried to make so perfectly
I surrender my hands beyond my head
You read me
There's a harvest buried in the bottom of the sky
And I'm thinking what will then become of you, i
Analyzing your moments when you're here
Unrepeating
You know well when it hits me
It could raise these bones again
And I wish that the rumbling
It would shake me till I'm still
If you're walking and nothing's turning out the way I planned
Armaggedon is flooding through the living room and
I, triumphant, stand off dead and tense
We didn't
Call it off now, dramatic as I'm ever going to be
Second chances are slipping off the cliffs of this defeat
And I'm packing my pack again without
My car keys
You know well when it hits me
It could raise these bones again
And I wish that the rumbling
It would shake me till I'm still
Say it like you mean
Mean it like you said it to me
Now it's out of his hands
You can't tear us apart
Because there's nothing to mend
You know well
You know well
You know well
When it hits me
It could raise these bones again
And I wish that the rumbling
quiero ver las culpas sobre la mesa
de otros que no son yo

When you were young enough
Doing all that fun kid stuff
Did you think of what you'd be?
Marco polo in the pool
Kickball games behind the school
Playing tag and hide 'n seek
When you grow up, what kind of boy will you be?
Oh, what will you be?
Drawing pictures with some chalk
Raindrops wash it from the walk
Summer days it never ends
Spin the bottle on the ground
Watch it turning round and round
Maybe he will be my friend
When you grow up, what kind of girl will you be?
Oh, what will you be?
Oh, what will you?
Will you write a book or invent a machine?
Will you be an astronaut or will you sail the sea?
(What will I be when I grow up?) La la, la la, la la, la la
(What will I be when I grow up?) La la, la la, la la, la la la la
(What will I be when I grow up?) La la, la la, la la, la la

When you grow up, what kind of person will you be?
Oh the things you'll be happy

Haven't you noticed there is someone outside
Looking through our window when we sleep at night
You must not leave me alone anymore
Awake all night worried for
You to be with somebody else
Time to be with somebody else
Didn't I tell you about the dream I had last night
We were both in it and everything seemed so right
When I opened up my eyes see you standing beside our bed
Don't remember the look on his face, but I remember
I remember what he said
To be with somebody else
It's time to be with somebody else
For one to hold and for want you
It's time for you to be with someone like me
Somebody touched me and whispered in my ear
Come a little bit closer there's nothing for you to fear here
So I left your side and followed my own voice now
The window was open but he was gone
And I went back to you
To be with somebody else
It's time to be with somebody else
For one to hold and for want you
It's time for you to be with somebody outside

Yes Baby, I been drinkin'
And I shouldn't come by, I know
But I found myself in trouble
And I had no place else to go
Got some whiskey from the barman
Got some cocaine from a friend
I just had to keep on movin'
'Til I was back in your arms again
I'm guilty
Baby, I'm guilty
And I'll be guilty for the rest of my life
How come I never do
What I'm supposed to do
How come nothing that I try to do
Ever turns out right
You know--You know how it is with me, Baby
You know I just can't stand myself
It takes a whole lotta medicine
For me to pretend that I'm somebody else
Under the waves, deep in the drift
I can feel the salt upon my skin.
Under the waves, falling away
I no longer see the rings of rain.
I want to feel it, if just to know it's true
Look me over- it's just a surface wound.
Don't pay to fight it; can't change the color blue.
All I wanted was to impress you.
Under the waves, caught in a dream
Lover, can you hear me breathing?
Under the waves, now that I'm giving up
I can let the current carry me.
I want to feel it, if just to know it's true
Look me over- it's just a surface wound.
Don't pay to fight it; can't change the color blue.
All I wanted was to impress you.
And if I catch myself crying
For things I cannot control
I'll head on back to the wall
Where tears are invisible.
Under the waves, I know who I am
I don't need to spin the story. 
Under the waves, down in the deep
I no longer see the rings of rain.
Max:
Don't live in black and white, do we?
It's just another fight to me
If we don't take it on we won't get far
It seems so far away but so close
It's there for us to take when most
Would waste it, don't waste it
All:
And we try and we fall
And we live another day
And we rise like a phoenix
From the flames
And it burns but it turns out golden
Jay:
We loved to dream aloud
With both feet on the ground
But where's the sense in that?
We'd never get it back
We'd be wasted
Nathan:
We'd be wasted
All:
And we try and we fall
And we live another day
And we rise like a phoenix
From the flames
And it burns but it turns out golden
And went for the sky
And we fell down low
And flew too high
But we still survived 'cause you and I
We turned out Golden
Tom:
They tore it to pieces
We'll build it again
Siva:
Ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah
All:
And we try and we fall
And we live another day
And we rise like a phoenix
From the flames
And it burns but it turns out golden
And went for the sky
And fell down low
And flew too high
But we still survived 'cause you and I
We turned out Golden
Instrumental
Is it a kind of dream
Floating out on the tide
Following the river of death downstream
Oh, is it a dream?
There's a fog along the horizon
A strange glow in the sky
And nobody seems to know where you go
And what does it mean
Oh, is it a dream?
Bright eyes, burning like fire
Bright eyes, how can you close and fail?
How can the light that burned so brightly
Suddenly burn so pale?
Bright eyes
Is it a kind of shadow
Reaching into the night
Wandering over the hills unseen
Or is it a dream?
There's a high wind in the trees
A cold sound in the air
And nobody ever knows when you go
And where do you start
Oh, into the dark
Bright eyes, burning like fire
Bright eyes, how can you close and fail?
How can the light that burned so brightly
Suddenly burn so pale?
Bright eyes
Bright eyes, burning like fire
Bright eyes, how can you close and fail?
How can the light that burned so brightly
Suddenly burn so pale?
Bright eyes
It's desert ice outside, but this diner has thawed my ears
Hot coffee in a clean white mug and a smile when the waitress hears
That I was born in North Carolina
Not an hour from her home town
And we used to play the same pizza parlor pinball
And there's a glance in time suspended as I wonder how it is
We've been swept up just by circumstance to where the coyote lives
Where my days are strips of highway
And she's wiping tables down
Holding on and still waiting for that windfall
But I've come home
Even though I've never had so far to go
I've come home
I pay the check and leave the change from a crumpled ten-dollar bill
Head across the street where VACANCY is burning in neon still
Well, the night eats up my body heat
And there's no sign of another
And I find myself slipping down into that black
But things are good, I've got a lot of followers of my faith
I've got a whole congregation living in my head these days
And I'm preaching from the pulpit
To cries of, "Amen brother"
Closing my eyes to feel the warmth come back
And I've come home
Even though I swear I've never been so alone
I've come home
I just want to be living as I'm dying
Just like everybody here
Just want to know my little flicker of time is worthwhile
And I don't know where I'm driving to
But I know I'm getting old
And there's a blessing in every moment, every mile
Thin white terry, bars of soap and a couple little plastic cups
Old Gideon's Bible in the nightstand drawer saying, "Go on, open up"
Well, I'll kneel down on the carpet here
Though I never was sure of God
Think tonight I'll give him the benefit of the doubt
I switch off the lights and imagine that waitress outlined in the bed
Her hair falling all around me
I smile and shake my head
Well we all write our own endings
And we all have our own scars
But tonight I think I see what it's all about
Because I've come home
I've come home
This ghost lay in a ditch on Thursday
Where I was meant to be
I almost missed my death it's so good
Now he's decked in flowers for me
I hope she doesn't like me
Or I'll still be standing more than likely
Where he once stood
And that's not good
We pretend not to look at each other
But he could see over his shoulder
He got me a time,
He got that a time,
Never a time again
I noticed the hair on her head that's not real
Now I'm left with a dead and a naked ordeal
When all I want is down at the shore,
Sitting in my car
And bitter sometimes
But the taste is sweet
Your friends only like themselves in photographs
I don't like them,
I don't like you
We pretend not to care for another
I stand on my feet when I hold her
We pretend not to look at the change,
And for good I cry
So when the stars look bright above me,
And in the streetlights I can't see
I walk on down to make a stand,
Where he once stood
So now they lie there breast to breast and toe to toe
And all I want is down at the shore,
Sitting in my car
We end it, it's all over,
She'll marry me but I'll hold her
She shoveled the dirt into my face,
But I don't care
I love her
When I feel the morning grass I let down my guard
Because love comes from the dirt in my own backyard
Everytime I think I've finished being young
I catch myself having fun
But the moment passes as the sun moves on
So I turn myself back to you
On a diamond in the rough I spent my better years
And I still see her in the crowd with diamonds in her ears
And it's depressing that I can't forget the tune the organist played
La da da da da da da, la da da da da
Everytime I think I've finished being young
I catch myself having fun
But the moment passes as the sun moves on
So I turn myself back to you
Is our season over?
No four leaf clover
I feel it getting colder
Now that it's late fall
Can you still remember?
April to November
You and I were members
Of the best team in baseball
So we play our games
I've got a girlfriend
You've found a new guy
But it's not the same
And so I drive
Straight up I-5
To let you know I'm still alive
Everytime I think I've finished being young
I catch myself having fun
But the moment passes as the sun moves on
So I turn myself back to you
Is our season over?
No four leaf clover
I feel it getting colder
Now that it's late fall
Can you still remember?
April to November
You and I were members
Of the best team in baseball
Into the trees
Past meadow grounds
And further away from my home
Baying behind me
I hear the hounds
Flock's chasing to find me alone
A trail of sickness
Leading to me
If I am haunted
Then you will see
Searching the darkness
And emptiness
I'm hiding away from the sun
Will never rest
Will never be at ease
All my matter's expired so I run
There falls another
Vapor hands released the blade
Insane regrets at the drop
Instruments of death before me
Lose all to save a little
At your peril it's justified
And dismiss your demons
As death becomes a jest
You are the laughing stock
Of the absinthe minded
Confessions stuck in your mouth
And long gone fevers reappear
Nocturnally helpless
And weak in the light
Depending on a prayer
Pacing deserted roads to find
A seed of hope
They are the trees
Rotten pulp inside and never well
Roots are sucking, thieving from my source
Tired boughs reaching for the light
It is all false pretension
Harlequin forest
Awaiting redemption for a lifetime
As they die alone
With no one by their side
Are they forgiven?
Stark determination
Poisoning the soul
Unfettered beast inside
Claiming sovereign control
And now the woods are burning
Tearing life crops asunder
Useless blackened remains
Still pyre smoldering
This adrenaline rush is keeping me high
Keep it coming around
It keeps the days alive and makes the hours fly
Keep it coming around
And when the hold-ups
Start holding you down
Keep your eyes to the ground
And when the hold-ups
Start holding us down
Just keep your eyes to the ground
For I cannot disgrace myself
When the motion fails for the very first time
Don't give the game away
When it raises its head and it threatens to stay
Don't give the game away
If my time is tabled and my clock is on time
I can keep it alive
And if my day is set and I haven't stopped yet
I can carry on fine
For I will have redeemed myself
Set up the day
Give it away
And everything I've been thinking of
With no time to think
There's no time to sink
I'm looking out for an ambush
From beginning to end
Potential to bend
There can be no interruptions
Set up the day
Give it away
And stop this motion from slowing
This adrenaline rush is keeping me high
Keep it coming around
It keeps the days alive and makes the hours fly
Keep it coming around
And if my time is tabled and my clock is on time
I can keep it alive
And if my day is set and I haven't stopped yet
I can carry on fine
For I will have redeemed myself
Set up the day
Give it away
And everything I've been thinking of
With no time to think
There's no time to sink
I'm looking out for an ambush
From beginning to end
Potential to bend
There can be no interruptions
Set up the day
Give it away
And stop this motion from slowing
Set up the day
Give it away
And everything I've been thinking of
With no time to think
There's no time to sink
I'm looking out for an ambush
From beginning to end
Potential to bend
There can be no interruptions
Set up the day
Give it away
And stop this motion from slowing
Can you hear the night's deep song?
All the shadows say
Telling you when you're asleep,
Tears will fade away
Dream of morning's golden light
When you and I will leave the night ...
And when the moon is high and bright,
Stars will shine on you
Dream of morning's golden light
When you and I will leave the night ...
Make a wish and when
You close your eyes
I will come to you
Dream of morning's golden light
When you and I will leave the night ...
Make a wish and when
You close your eyes
I will come to you
And today, I leave you
But I'll be back someday
And as I fly away
My hope is that we'll meet again
I'm off to my home away from home
I will miss you
But I know
I know you know
I'm coming home to Arizona
I'm coming home to Arizona
I'll take you everywhere I go
I'll show you everything I see
And as we say so long
I know your tears wish me well
It won't be long till I'm back again
We will meet again
We will meet again
You will see, oh
I'm coming home to Arizona
I'm coming home
If I'd been a prophet, I would tell you how the future lies
If I'd been a phoenix, raise us up through embers and fly
But together we wandered
Through a land we didn't know
All we wanted for our love
Was a chance to let it grow
I prayed so hard the rain would come
To calm down the flames but now they've won
No love in a drought
Standing the wrong side of the sun
If I'd been a loner, I would save myself, stay unaware
If I'd been a dreamer, I would float away and not care
But the seasons, they were sleeping
And the fates weren't on our side
And only summer eternal
Never harvest or survive
I prayed so hard the rain would come
To calm down the flames but now they've won
No love in a drought
Standing the wrong side of the sun
We never thought to keep it shaded
We thought the sun would keep our love alive
She took until the colors faded
And it was too late then to run and hide
I prayed so hard the rain would come
To calm down the flames but now they've won
Our love's all burnt out
Oh how did it go so very wrong?
We watched as the heat seared through our skin
Our hearts too exposed, the air too thin
No love in a drought
Standing the wrong side of the sun
Nothing more to say, what's done is done
Standing on the wrong side of the sun
You make it too hard
You make it too hard
You make it too hard
You make it too hard
You make it too hard
You make it too hard
Well, I could use a little comfort
I mean, we could use a little straight on
So don't get tangled up
In all the pretty things you could choke on
You make it too hard
You make it too hard
Well, you just might get it just right
But that could take too long
So I'll stand by all the things that I get wrong
You make it too hard
You make it too hard
You make it too hard
You make it too hard
You make it too hard
You make it too hard
But do you ever let your guard down
I mean, do you ever just get turned on
By something that's simple and easy and true
'Cause I could use a little patience
I mean, we could use a little straight on
It's safe to say that you could lighten up a little and then some
Floating on a sea of superiority doesn't suit you
It only works to dilute you
But still I guess I salute you
For trying
But you make it too hard
You make it too hard
You make it too hard
You make it too hard
You make it too hard
Well, you just might get it just right
But that could take too long
So I'll stand by all the things that I get wrong
You made it too hard
You made it too hard
You made it too hard
no quiere ser desordenado
no quiere que la madre venga acá
¿por qué cuando entra al cuerto le habre todo?
le cambia las cosas de lugar. de donde van.
a veces ella entra y tira todo
¿y qué si es importante o daba igual?
lo que más le revienta es su mal modo
no quiere ser como ella ni su papá,
!que novedad!
Pakko saada aina se mitä en yleensä saa
Pakkomielle, suuri tarve ja juuri sitä kaipaan
Ainoaa, puuttuvaa
Tyhjä paikka aina sille mitä en ikinä saa
Kaikki muu on korviketta ja turhaa ellen mä saa
Ainoaa puuttuvaa
Yhtä en saa, yksi jää aina puuttumaan
Yhtä en saa, mut mä pidän paikkaa
Pakko mennä aina kauemmas kuin minne mä nään
Aidan taakse, sinne missä on
Ruoho vihreämpää
Etsimään puuttuvaa
Yhtä en saa, yksi jää aina puuttumaan
Yhtä en saa, mut mä pidän paikkaa
Yhtä en saa, yhtä en vielä ainakaan
Yhtä en saa ja muu on turhaa
Ootetaan, aina vaan, jotain
Jonka jälkeen ei jää enää mitään puuttumaan
The way you moved
I can't explain
The mood subsides
And grows again
I've lived alone
I've held a hand
I've tried to care
And understand
What is faith
And when belief
And who knows how
These things deceive
I never said
And though I tried
If I could leave
And sleep tonight
I can't imagine
How this ever came to be
I can't imagine
How this ever came to be
"There was a boy
Who liked to wiggle his tooth loose so he could show it
Then we'd watch
While he'd tie it to a doorknob, wind up, and then slam it
That was how he liked to have his teeth pulled out
He told us how he liked to feel it when it came out
He grew tired
Of his doorknobs and so he thought up a brand-new trick
He said he'd tie
His tooth to his dog's tail, find a stick, wind up, and then throw it
That was how he liked to have his teeth pulled out
He told us how he liked to feel it when it came out
He called his dog
But just as he was set to throw, his dad arrived there
He yelled at him
And got some pliers, held him, wound up, and yanked it out right there
That wasn't how he liked to have his teeth pulled out
He wouldn't tell us how it felt when it came out"
Do you pray in the night
Can you appreciate the wind
And I won't care, I won't fight
I need you close to sing
It's the same beginning
Gone away
It's the same old, same old song
Gone away
It's my whole life in words
And I can't breathe when you cry
But I'll be there to hold you tight
And I would kill, I would fight
To keep you close
I keep singing the same way
I won't live if you died
If I can feel you in the wind
And this is me it's my life
I'll need you close to sing
It's the same beginning
Gone away
It's the same old, same old song
Gone away
It's my whole life in words
Gone away
It's the same old, same old song
Gone away
It's my whole life
And I can't say and I don't know
How far I'll go
And I can't say and I don't know
How far I'll go
Gone away
It's the same old, same old song
Gone away
It's my whole life in words
Gone away
It's the same old, same old song
Gone away
It's my whole life
Dwadzieścia cztery smutki 
To zwykła nasza doba. 
I dzień jest nie za krotki, 
I noc się nam podoba. 
Deszcz pada nieustanny 
I nudny, i nużący, 
Za oknem chodzą panny 
Smucące się niechcący 
(niechcący...) 
Za oknem wieczór spływa 
Po dachach i po rynnach, 
I ciemność odpoczywa 
Bezpieczna i bezczynna. 
Dwadzieścia cztery smutki... 
Usiądę sam za stołem, 
Zamyślę się wieczyście 
O życiu niewesołym, 
Przez które ze mną szliście. 
O naszym domu niskim 
I o wysokim niebie, 
O wszystkich i o wszystkim - 
I za was, i za siebie. 
Dwadzieścia cztery smutki...
T's 5 AM, you're sitting at the hotel
Looking at your mermaid friend
So many people forgot who you were
Now they're calling you up again
It's 5 AM, she moves a little closer to you
You're in past your knees, she taps you on your chin
The sea is full of sharks but can you swim
Everybody's hiding in the neon lights
The city is a jungle better learn to fight
Better learn the difference between church and pray
Never let them tell you you can't go your way
Everybody's hiding in the neon lights
The city is a jungle better learn to fight
Better learn the difference between do and say
Never let them tell you you can't go your way
Falling down, all way down to oh, oh, love
It's 7: 02, you're sitting at the diner
Mumbling to the girl in blue
She pours you a drink, the table starts to sink
You hang on but you're falling through
It's 7: 02, someone calls your name
Somewhere in the rubble there's a flame
Somewhere in the dark is your past
Telling you to never look back
Everybody's hiding in the neon lights
The city is a jungle better learn to fight
Better learn the difference between church and pray
Never let them tell you you can't go your way
Everybody's hiding in the neon lights
The city is a jungle better learn to fight
Better learn the difference between do and say
Never let them tell you you can't go your way
Falling down, all way down to oh, oh, love
Falling down, all the way to, to love
Everybody's hiding in the neon lights
The city is a jungle better learn to fight
Better learn the difference between church and pray
Never let them tell you you can't go your way
Everybody's hiding in the neon lights
The city is a jungle better learn to fight
Better learn the difference between do and say
Never let them tell you you can't go your way
As I went out walking, one morning in June
To view the fair fields, and the valleys in bloom;
I spied a pretty fair maid, she appeared like a queen,
With her costly fine robes and her mantle so green
Says I, my pretty fair maid, wont you come with me,
We'll both join in wedlock, and married we'll be;
I will dress you in fine linen, you'll appear like a queen,
With your costly fine robes and your mantle so green.
Says she, now my young man, you must be excused, 
For I'll wed no man, so you must be refused;
To the green woods I will wander and shun all men's view
For the boy I love dearly lies in farmed Waterloo.
Well if you're not married, say your lover's name
I fought in that battle, so I might know the same.
Draw near to my garment, and there you will see
His name is embroidered on my mantle so green.
In the ribbon of her mantle, there I did behold,
His name and his surname, in letters of gold
Young William O'Riley, appeared in my view
He was my chief comrade back in farmed Waterloo
And as he lay dying, I heard his last cry
"If you were here lovely Nancy I'd be willing to die"
And as I told her this story, in anguish she flew,
And the more that I told her, the paler she grew
So I smiled on my Nancy, 'twas I broke your heart,
In your father's garden, that day we did part
And this is the truth, and the truth I declare,
Oh here's your love token the gold ring I wear.
Speak to me in a language I can hear
Humor me before I have to go
Deep in thought I forgive everyone
As the cluttered streets greet me once again
I know I can't be late
Supper's waiting on the table
Tomorrow's just an excuse away
So I pull my collar up and face the cold
On my own
The earth laughs beneath my heavy feet
At the blasphemy in my old jangly walk
Steeple guide me to my heart and home
The sun is out and up and down again
I know I'll make it
Love can last forever
Graceful swans of never topple to the earth
And you can make it last forever
You can make it last forever
You can make it last
And for a moment I lose myself
Wrapped up in the pleasures of the world
I've journeyed here and there and back again
But in the same old haunts I still find my friends
Mysteries not ready to reveal
Your sympathies I'm ready to return
I'll make the effort
Love can last forever
Graceful swans of never topple to the earth
Tomorrow's just an excuse
Tomorrow's just an excuse
And you can make it last forever
You can make it last forever
You can make it last forever you
Forever you
Why must you shed such tender tears
In the evening of your years
No other love could stem the tide
Of the loneliness I hide
Open your heart and let me live
All the promises I could give
The sun and moon and all the stars
They bow down to you whenever you pass
In a world of fading sadness
An emerald ring, a photograph
That look in your eyes the brush of your cheek
These are the moments in life that I seek
No reason or rhyme, no presence of mind
Just a dance to the music of time
Why must you shed such tender tears
In the evening of your years
No other love could stem the tide
Of the loneliness I hide
Inside out, upside down
Obscured by clouds, or underground
The sun and moon and all the stars
They bow down to you whenever you pass
Wherever you are, whenever you speak
These are the moments in my life that I seek
No reason or rhyme, by chance or design
Just a dance to the music of time
Open your heart (babe) and let me live
All the promises that I could give
The sun and moon and all the stars
They bow down to you whenever you pass
No reason or rhyme, no presence of mind
Just a dance to the music of time

Bits and pieces of love for you, so sweet and simple yet
I'm frightened by the way you feel
Little by little you touch my heart, where they had touched it too
And as I smile, I catch myself
Trouble me or I'll go, trouble me with you
Spider, Spider, crawl on the lake, guilty and poison free
I wish that I could be like you
Trouble me or I'll go, yeah I'm human too
Over and over the need needs food will human weakness
And as I act I hate myself
Bits and pieces of love for you, so sweet and simple yet
I'm frightened by the way you feel
And as I act, I hate myself
Take me back to the days gone by
Take me back to the days we played
To the summers I never see
When we're far away, so far
Far away, so far
When we're far away
We had this dream
Locked behind these wicked thoughts
You and I
We felt pain
Passed from him, to me, to you
Reaching out
Into the empty space
We lost our place
It's your life
It's your soul
It's everything
You give to him
It's my heart
In your hands
Keep it or just let it fall
Another stone
Placed in my wall
I brush away
The flaming hair across your cheek
To see these eyes
That lit my life
Now they're cold and dark and gone
With your smile
I'll cross this hopeless line
But don't waste time
It's your life
It's your soul
It's everything
You give to him
It's my heart
In your hands
Keep it or just let it fall
Another stone
Placed in my wall
Can't we see above
This wall?
Rainy days, cold nights to remember
Who will I find, to stay forever
A life without you
No dreams will come true
I won't be fooled just like
Like a pretender
A whisper in the garden of Eden
Like a sound of love and peace on Earth
Silent angel
I want to hold you
Silent Angel
In my fantasy
Silent Angel
Let me love you
Silent angel
Please stay with me
All alone, with a heart of stone
Can a lie never burn so bright?
How can it be that between you and me
There's no way out of misery
A whisper in the garden of Eden
Like a sound of love and peace on Earth
Silent angel
I want to hold you
Silent Angel
In my fantasy
Silent Angel
Let me love you
Silent angel
Please stay with me
A whisper in the garden of Eden
Like a sound of love and peace on Earth
Silent angel
I want to hold you
Silent Angel
In my fantasy
Silent Angel
Let me love you
Silent angel
Please stay with me
Silent angel
You're my silent angel
Silent angel
But I can't get over how the sun looks on your face.
It makes you look so alive.
And your eyes tell me we've made a mistake
And we'll pass on the streets. I won't look away
If you don't look away. I won't look away.
But I can't get over how the sun looks on your face.
It makes you look so alive.
And your eyes tell me we've made a mistake
And we'll pass on the streets. I won't look away
If you don't look away. I won't look away.
When we pass on the streets, I won't look away
If you don't look away. I won't look away.
If you don't look away. I won't look away.
You led my dream to the horizon,
You bore my imprint there;
Carried my feet to the clear lake
For glass lay everywhere.
Under broken shards
Were dreams that never lived,
But they saved lives so many times
When we were cast adrift -
From a bus you saw an old man
Crying about his past,
But he was playing on his violin
A memory made to last.
Are we destined to find
Darkness deep and vast?
Regrets so scattered through our minds
Shine like broken glass - 
Where hope had lured by the thousand
You gently lay me down...
Like a bird on the wire
Like a drunk in a midnight choir
I have tried in my way to be free
Like a worm on a hook
Like a knight from some old fashioned book
I have saved all my ribbons for thee
If I've been unkind
Please just let it go by
If I've been untrue
It was never to you
Like a baby, stillborn
Like a beast with his horn
I've torn everyone who reached out for me
If I've been unkind
If I've been untrue
But I swear by this song
And by all that I've done wrong
I will make it all up to thee
... Unkind
... Untrue
It was never to you
She wails and whispers longingly
Calling out to those no longer listening
Her sweet incantations lost in infamy
Siren fools no one but still she will sing
Fall just like those before you
I will
Fall just like those before you
Pass still
Her lure can redirect the oldest currents
Countless have fallen before
Where winged feet will soar
Fall just like those before you
I will
Fall just like those before you
Pass still
On by
And I will
Pass still
On by
You think you're so sophisticated
With your lady-like ways
Your life is so complicated
Do you remember the days?
Looking through
You're looking through the eyes of a child
You see what you believe
Through the eyes of a child
You see what you believe
I remember the things you hated
All the two-faced lies
The people that smiled and cheated
Looking back on your life
You're looking through
You're looking through the eyes of a child
You see what you believe
Through the eyes of a child
You see what you believe
Act like a lady
Subscribe to all the magazines
Cry like a baby
At all that you have seen
Through the eyes of a child
You think you're so sophisticated
With your lady-like ways
Your life is so complicated
Do you remember the days?
Looking through
You're looking through the eyes of a child
You see what you believe
Through the eyes of a child
You see what you believe
Through the eyes of a child
You see what you believe
Through the eyes of a child
You see what you believe
Through the eyes of a child
Through the eyes of a child
Through the eyes of a child
? quoi bon mentir Si tu peux me dire au revoir
Pardonne-moi si je fus Insensible à tes regards
Je vais fuir sous la terre Si c?�est vrai que tu ne m?�aime pas
Ne me le demande guère J?�essayerais de ne plus te voir
De ne plus te voir De ne plus te voir De ne plus te voir

Chop down the cherry trees on Mango Street
That's the council for you every week
I'm just the kind of seafaring guy
Who waits for the tide and the town to get high
I don't like to do a drop of work
Drive in cab nor paint the church
It's been the same since I don't know when
So I'm going Island hopping again
Casper the suspicious ghost
He floats the cargo down the coast
But that's to risky for a man like me
Whose face is known in the territory
I'm like a fly in Harry's Bar
Don't use my wings don't walk to far
It's been the same since I don't know when
So I'm going island hopping again
Been the same since I don't know when
But I'm going Island hopping again
Now papa Hemingway he rent this boat
With U.S bills I'm sure she'll float
And I ain't buying on the street
Gotta couple of merchants that I gotta meet
I'm waiting here for the firebell to ring
So I can watch somebody doing something
It's been the same since I don't know when
So I'm going Island hopping again
Been the same since I don't know when
But I'm going Island hopping again
Yo. Ain't no better man, for this hype track
Just the veteran taking the mic back
David Letterman, even said he like that track man
Even though he ain't a rap fan
Black radio, they won't play though
Ever since "Summertime" they ain't liked none of mine
Even though the fans went out and bought enough
I guess they think Will ain't hard enough
Maybe I should just have a shoot out
Run up in the bank, bust, grabbin' all the loot out
Whoop somebody ass, taking my boot out
Right on TV so y'all can see me
Just ignorant, attacking, actin' rough
I mean, then will I be black enough
Oh, wait maybe I'll jack a truck
Full of cigarettes, guns and drugs and stuff
Get back
I wish I would have made that
Lean back
I wish I would have made that
I wish I woulda told the girls to 'drop it like it hot'
Summer, Summer, Summertime
Seem like all I got
I always envied how y'all rock wit Dre and the Chronic
The way that Tupac, Biggie, 50 and Jigga got it
A lot like L.L., Chuck D, Slick and Dougie
I think y'all love me, but y'all place other rappers above me
And I don't know if you feel my flow
And be at my show and you'll see where I should go
On the charts of rhyme arts and thoughts in rap form
Damnit, I expanded the platform
Damnit, this Cat's on a rap song
Yeah, it ain't no braids or plats on
Ain't on stage wit no gats on
You know I'm afraid, gettin' my act on
It might have stunted my growth
But I wanted them both
And I hope that it would be less tougher
You do two things and then they both gonna suffer
I chose to act and it broke my heart not to rap
Prodigal son, clever, better than ever, back
I got my swagga back
I got that swagga back, I got that swagga back
I got, I got that swagga back, I got that swagga back
Yo, do you see that lil' bop in my step
Do you see the little drop to the left, huh, yo...
Baseball cap, Timbs when I walk
Do you see that lil' grin when I talk, huh, yo
Do you see me sorta glide when I slide
See lean to the side in my ride, huh, yo...
Do you see it's no ice on my wrist
Fish still bite just like this... right, right
Do you know what it mean when you see a dude's chick on TV gleamin', huh?
Know what it mean to be on the scene and in the audience "Ali", beamin', yo!
I must have a 'S' on my chest, I recovered from the Wild, Wild West, yes!
Yo, I been up the creek without a paddle, now I'm back on the saddle,
I got my swagga back
I got my swagga back
I got that swagga back, I got that swagga back
I got my swagga back
I got that swagga back, I got that swagga back
I got my swagga back
I got that swagga back, I got that swagga back
I got my swagga back
All you see that you see when you seeing me, you ain't seeing all to be seen
Cause there's more for you to see than when you see me on the scene in my
Media machine
I mean madness, sickness, sadness, swaggerless back in the day
Fat, ugly chicks in New York on the radio, saying I'm gay
I had a bonafide downside frown with the swagga not around in my life
Bank account found minimal amounts when countin' cause of my now ex-wife
I had the boar-thick wall and all that, endure pitfalls and all that, fallin'
Callin' for help
With no call back, where was y'all at, gimme the ball back
I got my swagga back
I said goodbye to the river...
The mountains and the trees
Can't you hear they are singing
Their song of birth and agony
I said goodbye to the seasons that were never insincere
By myself I am singing their song
That no one wants to hear
Many words, many dreams I've got to give
But in this racing world there is no place for me
And if I leave today no memories remain...
Why does the sun go on shining?
Why does the sea rush to shore?
Don't they know it's the end of the world?
'Cause you don't love me any more
Why do the birds go on singing?
Why do the stars glow above?
Don't they know it's the end of the world?
It ended when I lost your love
I wake up in the morning and I wonder
Why everything is the same as it was
I can't understand, no, I can't understand
How life goes on the way it does
Why does my heart go on beating?
Why do these eyes of mine cry?
Don't they know it's the end of the world?
It ended when you said goodbye
Don't they know it's the end of the world?
It ended when you said goodbye

Did I disappoint you or let you down?
Should I be feeling guilty or let the judges frown?
'Cause I saw the end, before we'd begun
Yes, I saw you were blinded and I knew I had won
So I took what's mine by eternal right
Took your soul out into the night
It may be over but it won't stop there
I am here for you, if you'd only care
You touched my heart, you touched my soul
You changed my life and all my goals
And love is blind, but that I knew when
My heart was blinded by you
I've kissed your lips and held your head
Shared your dreams and shared your bed
I know you well, I know your smell
I've been addicted to you
Goodbye my lover
Goodbye my friend
You have been the one
You have been the one for me
Goodbye my lover
Goodbye my friend
You have been the one
You have been the one for me
I am a dreamer and when I wake
You can't break my spirit, it's my dreams you take
And as you move on, remember me
Remember us and all we used to be
I've seen you cry, I've seen you smile
I've watched you sleeping for a while
I'd be the father of your child
I'd spend a lifetime with you
I know your fears and you know mine
We've had our doubts but now we're fine
And I love you, I swear that's true
I cannot live without you
Goodbye my lover
Goodbye my friend
You have been the one
You have been the one for me
Goodbye my lover
Goodbye my friend
You have been the one
You have been the one for me
And I still hold your hand in mine
In mine when I'm asleep
And I will bear my soul in time
When I'm kneeling at your feet
Goodbye my lover
Goodbye my friend
You have been the one
You have been the one for me
Goodbye my lover
Goodbye my friend
You have been the one
You have been the one for me
I'm so hollow, baby, I'm so hollow
I'm so, I'm so, I'm so hollow
I'm so hollow, baby, I'm so hollow
I'm so, I'm so, I'm so hollow
In den Bergen liegt ein Tal
In das die Sehnsucht sich begab
Und mit der Freundin Lust
Erwarten sie hier jenen Tag
An dem ein Zeichen von dir kündet
Und das Tal von Rückkehr tönt
Und die Gabe von der Freude
Sich mit ihnen neu versöhnt
Jeden Tag treten sie ans Licht
Schauen hoffnungsvoll hervor
Ob die Winde Botschaft bringen
Aus dem Traum den ich verlor
Doch nur Schweigen in der Ferne
Unverändert liegt das Land
Und ich spüre die Verzweiflung
Ergreift lächelnd meine Hand
Warten auf dich
Langsam mehren sich die Tage
Und die Sehnsucht weicht der Zeit
Bleibt zurück mit ihrer Freundin
Bleibt zurück in der Vergangenheit
Manchmal kann ich dich noch spüren
Doch die Erinnerung verblaßt
An den Tag in meinem Leben
Als du mich verlassen hast
Warten auf dich

And even if I was wrong, I know I don't deserve this
Don't stay too long, I need to hear those words you use to tell me
From way back when we were just friends
Before this love affair began
Tell me how I love you wins
Or how a broken heart can mend
Just tell me this is not the end
Please tell me now
How the fairy tale begins
Or how it was supposed to end
Please tell me that part again
Ad libs
Now tell me what's wrong, I never meant to hurt you, no baby, ooh
Was it the home, the car, or darling all those thing we thought we needed
Tell me even if it ain't true
But baby please don't say we're through
Tell me how I love you wins
Or how a broken heart can mend
Just tell me this is not the end
Please tell me now
How the fairy tale begins
Or how it was supposed to end
Please tell me that part again
Ad libs
I wanna know that
Feelin' that's from way back
A time when it was true that, love was sweet and innocent
When you and I could still be friends
Make all the wrong be right again
Where true love never has to end
Ad libs
Tell me how I love you wins
Or how a broken heart can mend
Just tell me this is not the end
Please tell me now
How the fairy tale begins
Or how it was supposed to end
Please tell me that part again
Ad libs
This boy, breezes in from the South Wells. This boy, sees his days in the Middle East. This boy, eased his way up the silver turns, but what is that, when this boy, he needs love, he needs love.

Inside your head
I'd stroll around in synthesis
And I'd find a way
To connect all things
To search and roam around
Take you far away
To search and roam around
Take you to another place
Inside your own illusion
I stroll around the passages
While I find a way
To connect all things
To search and roam around
Take you far away
To search and roam around
Take you to another place
So what I am dreaming of
What about you
So saturate
Tell me what can I find here
When you vanish in the air
I get caught in the rain
That falls in your doorway
Chance is all you need
Whatever you see
You belong too
No wasting time
Overlook
Wrong decisions
Or my confirmations
So that I can be
Olas y olas que vienen del mar
Olas y olas que vuelven al mar
Olas y olas me llaman del mar
Olas y olas me llaman al mar
me llaman, me llaman
En el fondo se me ve cara de no pensar
desde el fondo puedo ver que depende del cristal
Olas y olas, me hundo, no salgo
Olas y olas, prefiero el fondo del mar.
Yo no sé qué haré
si podré volver
no me quiero ir
me quiero quedar y bajar, bajar, bajar
Afuera está bien, pero soy de acá
yo soy mucho más de acá que ninguno de allá
aunque no sepa nadar.
What is that sad look in your eyes
Why are you crying
Tell me now, tell me now
Tell me, why you're feelin' this way
I hate to see you so down, oh baby
Is it your heart
Oh, that's breakin' all in pieces
Makin' you cry
Makin' you feel blue
Is there anything that I can do
Why don't you tell me where it hurts now, baby
And I'll do my best to make it better
Yes, I'll do my best to make those tears all go away
Just tell me where it hurts now, tell me
And I love you with a love so tender
Oh and if you let me stay
I'll love all of the hurt away
Where are all those tears coming from
Why are they falling
Somebody, somebody, somebody left your heart in the cold
You just need somebody to hold on, baby
Give me a chance to put back all the pieces
Take your broken heart
Make it just like new
There's so many things that I can do
Why don't you tell me where it hurts now, baby
And I'll do my best to make it better
Yes, I'll do my best to make those tears all go away
Just tell me where it hurts now, tell me
And I love you with a love so tender
Oh and if you let me stay
I'll love all of the hurt away
Oh I'm gonna take it all away, baby
Is it your heart
Oh, that's breakin' all in pieces
Makin' you cry
Makin' you feel blue
Is there anything that I can do
Tell me, baby
Tell me, oh yeah
Is there anything I can do, baby
Just tell me where it hurts now, tell me
And I love you with a love so tender
Oh and if you let me stay
I'll love all of the hurt away
No matter how strong
I'm gonna take you down
With one little stone
I'm gonna break you down
And see what you're worth
What you're really worth to me
Dinner at eight was okay
Before the toast full of gleams
It was great until those old magazines
Got us started up again
Actually it was probably me again
Why is it so
That I've always been the one who must go
That I've always been the one told to flee
When it fact you were the one long ago
Actually in the drifting white snow
You left me
So put up your fists and I'll put up mine
No running away from the scene of the crime
God's chosen a place
Somewhere near the end of the world
Somewhere near the end of our lives
But till then no, Daddy, don't be surprised
If I wanna see the tears in your eyes
Then I know it had to be long ago
Actually in the drifting white snow
You loved me
No matter how strong
I'm gonna take you down
With one little stone
I'm gonna break you down
And see what you're worth
What you're really worth to me
I've dreamed of you
Always feeling you
Were there
And all my life
I have searched for you
Everywhere
I caught your smile
In the morning sun
I heard your whisper
On the breeze of night
I prayed one day
That your arms would hold me tight
And just when i
Thought love had passed me by
We met
That first look
In your eyes
I can't forget
You melted me
With your tender touch
I felt all fear and sorrow
Slip away
Now here we stand
Hand in hand
This blessed day
I promise you
As I give to you
My heart
That nothing in this world
Shall keep us apart
Come happily ever after be
The woman I'll love
Until the very end
I've dreamed of you
My great love
And my best friend
For God must know
How I love you so
He's blessed us here today
As man and wife
Come dream with me
As I've dreamed of you
All my life
Come dream with me
As I've dreamed of you
All my life
Everybody's got a hunger
No matter where they are
Everybody clings to their own fear
Everybody hides some scar
Ooh... precious pain
Empty and cold 
But it keeps me alive
I gave it my soul 
So that I could survive
Keeping me safe in these chains
Precious pain
Everybody's got a reason
To abandon their plan
How can I think of tomorrow
With my sorrow in hand?
Ooh... precious pain
Empty and cold 
But it keeps me alive
I gave it my soul 
So that I could survive
Keeping me safe in these chains
Precious pain
Each road that I walk down
Reminds me of you
This whole town is haunted
There'll never be anything new
Precious pain
Empty and cold 
It keeps me alive
I gave it my soul 
So that I could survive
Keeping me safe in these chains
Precious pain
Oh...
Oh... oh...
Oh...
Ah...
Oh... oh...
Oh...
Ah, ah
Ooh... ooh...
Oh...
I grew so old in that house I lived in
They brought me here 'cause I can't take care
I lost my worth and my purpose here
I feel you cry, but I can't speak my mind
Will you hold me and never let me go?
'Cause I hated when you walk outside that door
'Cause I know I won't ever see your eyes
The eyes I gave you
When my eyes shut, they'll take me to the land
For fifty years I lived there with my man
And on my own, I lived for forty more
I watched you grow up from babies on the floor
To the beautiful women that you are
And I hated that you've gone away so far
'Cause I know I won't ever see those eyes
The eyes I gave you
The evenings fall, they'll drag me out the hall
Up to my bunk and drug me 'til I'm numb
But pass the haze, I see your pretty face
Remember me when I'm gone
You know I love you, though I can hardly say
And I hate it when you see me in this way
But in darkness, I'll always see those eyes
The eyes I gave you
I slipped away last night
Took me away from sight and the place I know
All crushed upon my skin
This mess I put you in and the punch I thrown
It was a strange reaction
For someone like you to remain on side
And in a chain reaction
I was down and calling for a place to hide
I saw a broken arm
Machines will all break down in the way I know
Mended and all made clean
I saw up on the screen all the stones I throw
It was a strange reaction
For someone like you to remain so sure
And in a chain reaction
I dissolve and break and then away I crawl
When I look up from my pillow, I dream you are there with me
Though you are far away, I know you'll always be near to me
I go to sleep, sleep and imagine that you're there with me
I go to sleep, sleep and imagine that you're there with me
I look around me and feel you are ever so close to me
Each tear that flows from my eyes brings back memories of you to me
I go to sleep, sleep, and imagine that you're there with me
I go to sleep, sleep, and imagine that you're there with me
I was wrong, I will cry, I will love you to the day I die
You alone, you alone and no one else, you were meant for me
When morning comes once more, I have the loneliness you left me
Each day drags by until finally night time descends on me
I go to sleep, sleep and imagine that you're there with me
I go to sleep, sleep and imagine that you're there with me
Got a wife and kids in Baltimore, Jack
I went out for a ride and I never went back
Like a river that don't know where it's flowing
I took a wrong turn and I just kept going
Everybody's got a hungry heart
Everybody's got a hungry heart
Lay down your money and you play your part
Everybody's got a hungry heart
I met her in a Kingstown bar
We fell in love I knew it had to end
We took what we had and we ripped it apart
Now here I am down in Kingstown again
Everybody's got a hungry heart
Everybody's got a hungry heart
Lay down your money and you play your part
Everybody's got a hungry heart
Everybody needs a place to rest
Everybody wants to have a home
Don't make no difference what nobody says
Ain't nobody like to be alone
Everybody's got a hungry heart
Everybody's got a hungry heart
Lay down your money and you play your part
Everybody's got a hungry heart
You're toast and jam
And you're cotton candy
You're double rainbows
Beside a setting sun
You're wood burnin' outside
There's a fire glowin'
You're sweet as green apples
You must be the one
You bring me
To the heart of a golden man
You bring me
To the natural truth
You take me
To a solid hollow
And keep me sailing
This ocean of youth
That's why...
So take me
To an altar of diamonds
And run with me
Through sheets of jungle rain
Show me all your manly mystery
And let me heal your beautiful pain
Be my island
In crowds of faces
My oasis
Be there
Lead me
To the holy water
Introduce me
To the place you are from
Wherever you go
You know I will follow
So take me there
And I will come
You're sweet as green apples
You must be the one
Daniel is traveling tonight on a plane
I can see the red tail lights heading for Spain
Oh and I can see Daniel waving goodbye
God it looks like Daniel, must be the clouds in my eyes
They say Spain is pretty though I've never been
Well Daniel says it's the best place that he's ever seen
Oh and he should know, he's been there enough
Lord I miss Daniel; oh I miss him so much
Daniel my brother you are older than me
Do you still feel the pain of the scars that won't heal?
Your eyes have died but you see more than I
Daniel you're a star in the face of the sky
Daniel is traveling tonight on a plane
I can see the red tail lights heading for Spain
Oh and I can see Daniel waving goodbye
God it looks like Daniel, must be the clouds in my eyes
Save the wrapping for another.
Dressing doesn't mean a thing to me.
Submission for a ladder rung.
You decide what you're used for,
You decide.
I know what you are, what you are.
I see clearly what you are, what you are.
Every drop
Rattled till it stopped
Shining through a misty tide
I'd felt so insecure that night
You've lost the map
The way out here is trapped
Pure inside enough to see
Pure enough to disagree
Fall into the stain
The stars they used to drain
Until it rains
Your tears have turned the water black
You just stumble and wait for the attack
Your hands protect your eyes
I'm sure you've lost your speech
Things don't happen
Before they've come to grief
I touched his hand
It burned like coal
I put paid to the devil
And I saw the mountain fall
Fall on
Feel like crying
The joke's gone too far
You can be anything you want
Every colour you are
A family man
His patience tried
Put a torch to his home
And warmed his hands by the fire
No greed, no desire
My road's uncrossed
White lined and tarred
By believing in you
Every colour you are
Grow out of your obsessions
You think you're bad but I'm badder than you
'Cause mine has come through consideration,
While your reaction is nothing new
So go on genius be who you are
You're so flat and one dimensional
If you go my way you won't go wrong
You'll find out where you really belong
If you search it out it will make you strong
Then you'll go on and on and on and on
You want what's mine but you don't deserve it
One tenth is all you can have
Why care, why share?
Stamp your feet 'cause life's unfair
Why care, why share?
Stamp your feet 'cause life's unfair
If you go my way you won't go wrong
You'll find out where you really belong
If you search it out it'll make you strong
Then you'll go on and on and on and on
You have to watch for the smallest details
Just to stop the alligator from getting up
The alligator from getting up
The alligator form getting up
The alligator from getting up
Baby won't you please come home?
Cause your daddy's all alone
I have tried in vain
Never no more to call your name
When you left you broke my heart
Because I never thought we'd part
Every hour in the day you will hear me say
"Baby come home"
Baby won't you please come home?
Because your daddy's so alone
I have tried in vain
Never no more to ever call your name
When you left you broke my heart
Because I never thought we'd part
Every hour in the day you will hear me say
"Baby come on home", daddy needs baby
Baby won't you please come home?
Picture me in a boat on the sea
Five fingered leaves keep covering me
Don't you know that the big Ferris Wheel is eventually stalling
I see you I see the animals too
Especially those that are out at the zoo
They look just like me and a lot like everybody
And if we're lucky we might see the end of the day completely
Collect all your things 'cause it's home time
Come on
Collect all your things 'cause it's home time
People walkin' on top of the sea
But this time it doesn't matter to me
Because I've got these magical seeds and the trees are still growing
Stone throwing I've got nothing to do
Only hope I got the message to you
Because if we're lucky we might see the end of the world completely
And if we do than I hope that it's you waiting there to meet me
Collect all your things 'cause it's home time
Come on
Collect all your things 'cause it's home time
Collect all your things 'cause it's home time
Come on
Collect all your things 'cause it's home time
I know you want it too

Lying here with you reminds me of those days
Me and Candice waking up to a heat wave
Mother's in the garden inviting everyone
Ooh, we cut up our old jeans and go outside
Neighbour's always smiling with the baby on her knee
Rhea sat on the front step getting her hair combed out and greased
Music, the bass boomin' from the car parked in the street
Got that new song on repeat, oh oh
I'd, I'd like to put my fingers on you
I'd, I'd like to paint a picture for you
Sometimes you don't understand where I'm coming from
I just like to make you see that
I desire the simple things
Growing up we didn't have a lot of money
Used to spend my summer having parties on the drive
Plastic cups for rum and punch, eating chicken that's hot and sweet
All the women discussing what love is like, ooh you know the way I mean
And I'm just sitting watching hoping the boys will call for me
Got that new song on repeat, oh oh
I'd, I'd like to put my fingers on you
I'd, I'd like to paint a picture for you
Sometimes you don't understand where I'm coming from 
I'm just trying to make you see that
I desire the simple things
Maybe then now and then I would want somebody
Maybe then I used to dream of someone to love
Now you come and you arrive by me
I know I'm in love
I'd, I'd like to put my fingers on you
I'd, I'd like to paint this picture for you
Sometimes you don't understand where I'm coming from
I just like to make you see that
I desire the simple things
I'd, I'd like to put my fingers on you
I'd, I'd like to paint a picture for you
Sometimes you don't understand where I'm coming from
I just like to make you see that
I desire the simple things
I can see clearly now the rain has gone
I can see all obstacles in my way
Gone are the dark clouds that had me blind
It's going to be a bright, bright sunshiny day
It's going to be a bright, bright sunshiny day
I think I can make it now the pain has gone
And all of the bad feelings have disappeared
Here is the rainbow I've been praying for
It's gonna be a bright, bright sunshiny day
Look all around, there's nothing but blue skies
Look straight ahead, nothing but blue skies
I think I can make it now the pain has gone
And all of the bad feelings have disappeared
I can see clearly now the rain has gone
It's gonna be a bright, bright sunshiny day
It's gonna be a bright, bright sunshiny day
It's gonna be a bright, bright sunshiny day
She's doesn't deserve to be in a place like this
All alone
She's underage and so very very brave
A fake ID lent her credibility
She sits at the bar
The gents are gonna try so hard
He said it was a one night stand
But the alcohol didn't let her understand
Yeah, he said it was a one night stand
A one night stand
So what made you think
That he couldn't find a door in the morning?
When he found that bed so easily
In the dark
So what made you think
That he couldn't find a door in the morning?
When he found that bed so easily
In the dark
So the bartender who tends to pretend that he's concerned
Says, "Girlie girlie, you're at your best (you're at your best) when you're sober"
And she slurs, "No no, just one more"
And one turns into four
The fourth drink instinct is taking over
And the gentleman is leading her towards the door
So what made you think
That he couldn't find a door in the morning?
When he found that bed so easily
In the dark
So what made you think
That he couldn't find a door in the morning?
When he found that bed so easily
In the dark
She thought that she could buy happiness by, by the bottle
She thought that she could buy happiness by, by the bottle
She thought that she could buy happiness by, by the bottle
So what made you think
That he couldn't find a door in the morning?
When he found that bed so easily
In the dark
So what made you think
That he couldn't find a door in the morning?
When he found that bed so easily
In the dark
He said it was a one night stand
But the alcohol didn't let her understand
Yeah, he said it was a one night stand
A one night stand
Muy cansado a la mañana,
se levanta y va a trabajar
Es de noche y el zorzal
ya despierto empieza a cantar
Son tres cuadras y allá va
el colectivo que iba a tomar
Toma otro y se sienta,
se adormece, empieza a soñar
Una playa lejos de acá con caracoles y su mamá
Que le dice: -"Ven para acá, come una fruta y ve a nadar"-
Se despierta y sobresalta,
su parada quedó allá atrás
Media hora. Media hora más,
otra vez le descontarán.
Va apurado y al llegar,
el portero dice -"¿Qué tal?
Otra vez llegaste mal,
sigue así y te van a echar"-
-"Ven corriendo con tu mamá , una tormenta se va a largar
Vamos pronto a preparar una comida a tu papá"-
I don't eat well, I don't sleep well
I don't wash and I don't comb
I don't answer the phone
I don't try to move along
Is there something I'm doing wrong?
I don't laugh and I don't smile
I don't leave the past behind
I don't take the helping hand
I don't try to make love last
Is there something I didn't grasp?
Now crow black harm
Is coming on
And I'm all out of light
So I set the child in me on fire
I don't love and I don't talk
I just lay there like a rock
And I wait for it to pass
And I spill beer in the grass
And I try to pick a fight
Is there something I'm not
Doing right?
Abrázame
Y no me digas nada, sólo abrázame
Me basta tu mirada para comprender
Que tú te iras
Abrázame
Como si fuera ahora la primera vez
Como si me quisieras hoy igual que ayer
Abrázame
Si tú te vas
Te olvidarás que un día hace tiempo ya
Cuando éramos aun niños me empezaste a amar
Y yo te dí mi vida, si te vas
Si tú te vas
Ya nada será nuestros tú te llevarás
En un solo momento un' eternidad
Me quedaré sin nada, si te vas
Abrázame
Y no me digas nada, sólo abrázame
No quiero que te vayas pero sé muy bien
Que tú te irás
Abrázame
Como si fuera ahora la primera vez
Como si me quisieras hoy igual que ayer
Abrázame...
Si tú te vas
Me quedará el silencio para conversar
La sombra de tu cuerpo y la soledad
Serán mis compañeros, si te vas
Si tú te vas
Se irá contigo el tiempo y mi mejor edad
Te seguiré queriendo cada día más
Esperaré a que vuelvas, si te vas
Sucaru vaktra mandalam sukarna ratna kundalam
Sucarcitanga candanam namami nanda nandana
Vrajangana sunayakam sada sukha pradayakam
Jaganmanah pralobhanam namami nanda nandanam
Danger, in every corner.
I have become pure water.
I can identify.
I close my eyes.
I'll wear my sword at my side (x2).
Cleanse me.
Deep in the fire.
I have become pure water.
I'll wear my sword at my side (x4).
I have become pure water (x2).
I have become pure water (distorted and echoed)
You're like a lover
In that when you look you make lists
I could do with more of that
More of that
Less of this
Shine your light
I don't mind
Shine your light
I don't mind
You know what words of love
Get squeezed out
By a hand tightening 'round your neck
Tell me love
Tell me it
Hold me tight
I don't mind
Hold me tight
I don't mind
If you ever get famous,
Don't forget about me,
Hope it's everything that you thought it would be
If you ever get famous,
Don't forget about her,
'Cause she was there boy when nobody cared who you were
If you ever get famous,
I'll say a prayer for your heart,
Keep your eyes open wide and beware of the sharks,
'Cause they come out in the dark
If you ever get famous,
Show your face now and then
'Cause all our days are just so many waves in the wind,
You can't get them back again
So many days in the wind, let them roll on by
So many days in the wind, let them roll on by
If you ever get famous,
You're in your white limousine,
It's a rainy night and your headlights hit the water in the street
And the rain beats down
You keep an eye on the driver,
'Cause as the high-way unwinds,
Boy the way home will fade and be so hard to find,
Oh my oh my oh my
So many days in the wind, you keep on running round,
So many days in the wind, you been running all your lift,
So many waves in the wind, I hope you find what you're looking for,
So many days
If you ever get famous,
Don't forget about me,
Hope it's everything that you thought it would be
Now if all my golden moments
Could be rolled into one
They would shine just like the sun 
For a Summer day
And after it was over
We could have it back again
With credit to the editor
For striking out the rain (very clean)
And all it really needed
Was the proper point of view
No one's gonna bring me down
No one's gonna stop me now
Now I gathered up my sorrows
And I sold them all for gold
And I gathered up the gold
And I threw it all away
It all went for a good time and a song (come on)
The laughter was like music
It did float my soul along for awhile
And all it really needed was the proper point of view
No one's gonna reach me here
No one's gonna know I'm gone
You may think I might be crazy
And I guess you might be right
But I know the way I feel today is out of sight
I do not trust my senses to remember your name
Without corrective lenses
Things are never twice the same anyway
And all it really needed
Was the proper point of view
No one's gonna bring me down
No one's gonna stop me now
No one's gonna reach me here
No one's gonna know I'm gone
Jim Adkins
There's no one in town I know
You gave us someplace to go
I never said thank you for that
I thought I might get one more chance
What would you think of me now
So lucky, so strong, so proud?
I never said thank you for that
Now I'll never have a chance
May angels lead you in
Hear you me my friends
On sleepless roads, the sleepless go
May angels lead you in
So what would you think of me now?
Jim Adkins & Rachel Haden (w/ RH subdued)
So lucky, so strong, so proud
I never said thank you for that
Now I'll never have a chance
Jim Adkins & Rachel Haden (w/ RH subdued)
May angels lead you in
Hear you me my friends
On sleepless roads, the sleepless go
May angels lead you in
Rachel Haden
May angels lead you in
Jim Adkins
May angels lead you in
Rachel Haden
May angels lead you in
Jim Adkins & Rachel Haden
May angels lead you in
Jim Adkins
And if you were with me tonight
I'd sing to you just one more time
A song for a heart so big
God wouldn't let it live
Jim Adkins & Rachel Haden
May angels lead you in
Hear you me my friends
On sleepless roads, the sleepless go
May angels lead you in
May angels lead you in
Hear you me my friends
On sleepless roads, the sleepless go
May angels lead you in
On sleepless roads, the sleepless go
May angels lead you in
United states of mind in troubled times
I couldn't find a better life, couldn't find my way inside
Laughter and sirens song, in here I belong
I couldn't tell right from wrong; where is this all coming from
I built a wall inside out of a lie
And now I'm comfortably blind to what goes on outside
Here, in a world of my own
Everything's confused, harmlessly untrue
Here I can almost live and forget you
It is all unreal in this world of ideals
Even the illusions seem so clear
So hard to understand an unstable man
But I'm doing all the best I can to leave this no-where land
Sorrows are easy to hide in states of mind
Then all of a sudden I'm fine and everything's all right
Here, in a world of my own
Everything's confused harmlessly untrue
Here I can almost live and forget you
It is all unreal in this world of ideals
Even the illusions seem so clear
But I still like it, maybe
Now and then
Life, not so crazy,
With any kind of sense
But only in here I get to see you again
And sometimes I feel you
And sometimes I meet the real you
Love, everything's confused harmlessly untrue
Here I can almost live and forget you
It is all unreal in this world of ideals
Even the illusions seem so clear
Otium cum dignitate
Otium cum dignitate
Otium
Sun shines bright
My heart is laughing
I'm happy
What I do is nothing
A light heart
Otium cum dignitate
Otium cum dignitate
Otium
A light heart
Worries have to be driven far away
Only love can bright your day
Waft yourself to regions of stars and light
It's shimmer still beams clear and bright
With my childlike heart
And trusting mind
I'm glad about and blithely
What I find
A light heart
Worries have to be driven far away
Only love can bright your day
Waft yourself to regions of stars and light
It's shimmer still beams clear and bright
At night
Enough is enough, no one stops the catarpillar
The weight of the world, already too much to bear
You do it too loud, mix it up with vanilla
The sound is the best I have heard for a million years
From the thunder that came, I was never the same
And I would stop to think of what to do
I was taking a leap, I was playing for keeps with you
The many touches on my skin
That's lying between now and then
The many kisses on my chin
So severe
I can't believe the state I'm in
I can't believe what's happening
We'll never be this young again
Guenivere
A comic relief that makes room for my decision
To tighten the rope so that you never will forget
The music that comes from when playing with precision
The words are too rough, I can't shake it from off my head
I was making a mess for the better, I guess
With a desire to be understood
There were people around with the need to get down for good
The many touches on my skin
That's lying between now and then
The many kisses on my chin
So severe
I can't believe the state I'm in
I can't believe what's happening
We'll never be this young again
Guenivere
Hello, if you're there, pick up the phone
I'm calling from thirty thousand feet above you
The captain's just informed us that our plane is going down
So I'm calling for one last time, to say I love you
I'm not certain how much time I may have left, so I'll be brief
I'm sorry if this message only amplifies your grief
But I couldn't bear the burden of never havin' said goodbye
And the pain you feel, I promise you, will go away with time
I'm sorry I won't be there to see our children grow
Please tell them that I loved them more than they will ever know
Tell my family and friends how much I love them all as well
I'm sure that we will meet again but only time will tell
I'm sorry most of all that I won't be there when you grow old
To be there by your side and keep you warm when you are cold
Forgive me but I think my time is drawing to a close
So I've one last thing to tell you now before I have to go
I...
All of the drugs, she takes at night,
Keep her awake, Give me a fright,
I don't know what goes through her mind,
When she takes drugs.
All of the lies she tells herself,
Won't be believed by anybody else.
And I can't buy just what she sells,
When she tells lies.
And she takes her pills, And she tells her lies,
And she breaks my heart, and breaks her word,
But I still act sur-, surprised.
Every kiss she gives away, might be a good time,
But you know, the sad thing is the boys all say,
She's something of a slut.
And she takes her pills, and she tells her lies,
And she breaks my heart, and breaks her word,
But I still act surprised.
Angels falling through my hair
I want to leave them tomorrow
Angels falling through my hair
I want to meet them tomorrow
Gade kijan n'ap mache

Angels falling through my hair

Meet them falling through my hair
I want to meet them tomorrow

My tongue is scaling the north face of the neck
And we're glaring like warriors
But I've a feeling you won't look at me that way
In the morning
Cause lately you seem less sure of this thing
You're like Bambi on ice
And there's something in the flash of your arms
A certain longing
Kick the can
I can see you now
Behind that temper and ire
Mister Wolf knows what time it is
He says "It's dinner time!"
I don't know what you're carrying
Or how your heart is wired
But there's a dangerous ticking
I cut the red one
No, the blue one
I cut the red one
No, the blue one
I cut the red one
I cut the red one
I cut the blue one
Raking over the embers and what I come across
Raking over the embers and what I come across
Is that you
Combing your hair?
And is that me
Eating an egg?
And I'll be there
I'll be there
I'll be there
Like John Boy is there
My tongue is scaling the north face of the neck
And we're glaring like warriors
But I've a feeling you won't look at me that way
I've a feeling you won't look at me that way
I've a feeling you won't look at me that way
In the morning
Is this how it goes?
These two final throws?
Is this how it goes?
These two final throws?
I may be slower than some folks
But I always make my way
I move forward with my hopes
And I sometimes save the day
Where do I begin?
Cause there's a whirl pool of information
That you've got to sort through
To get to where it's at
It falls flat and it makes you crazy
But I get the feeling
That I get what it's about
It's just a feeling
I can't really spell it out
I get the feeling
That I get what it's about
>From the bar to the car park
Theories fly about
They fall short for the most part
But I'm not keeping count
And why should I begin?
Cause there's a whirl pool
Of people who will stop
And they will tell you
The things that you will not
They roll their eyes and they call you crazy
But you get the feeling
That you get what it's about
It's just a feeling
You can't really spell it out
You get the feeling
That you get what it's about

I've lost count of how many times we've disagreed
But it's the third time we've fought together this week
Maybe it's nothing, maybe I just need time on my own
Just once, I'm gonna go and get drunk
If you get my name wrong I won't get pissed off cause
I wish I was somebody else
You know nothing about me, I know nothing about you
But maybe the question mark helps
Have you ever been lost?
We could get lost
I wanna get lost
I'm not sure if I'm just thinking 'bout it too much
Or if I'm just looking for an excuse for us to break up
Maybe I want to, maybe I need to
Find a way to tell you that I want to let you go
Just once, I'm gonna go and get drunk
If you get my name wrong I won't get pissed off cause
I wish I was somebody else
You know nothing about me, I know nothing about you
But maybe the question mark helps
Have you ever been lost?
We could get lost
I wanna get lost
Have you ever been lost?
We could get lost
I wanna get lost
(I wanna get lost with you)

Qu'elle était belle à t'écouter
Sur ta voix son corps dansait
Dans ses dentelles virevoltaient
L'effet d'un corps de ballet
Papa,
Tu as pris la route sans dire adieu
Papa,
Tu as laissé son corps, je t'en veux
Ca fait mal de vivre sans toi
Elle a mal et tu ne t'imagine même pas
Comme ça fait mal de rire sans toi
Elle a mal et tu ne reviendras pas
Qu'elle était belle à tes côtés
Dans son regard je voyais
Que tu faisais d'elle un conte de fée
Sur toi elle se reposait
Papa,
Tu as pris la route sans dire adieu
Papa,
Tu as pris son coeur, je t'en veux
Ca fait mal de vivre sans toi
Elle a mal et tu ne t'imagine même pas
Comme ça fait mal de rire sans toi
Elle a mal et tu ne reviendras pas
Papa, tu ne reviendras pas
Ca fait mal de vivre sans toi
Elle a mal et tu ne t'imagine même pas
Comme ça fait mal de rire sans toi
Son sourire appelle au secours
Il est sans amour
Ca fait mal de vivre sans toi
Elle a mal et tu ne t'imagine même pas
Comme ça fait mal de rire sans toi
Elle a mal et toi, tu ne reviendras pas
Et toi tu ne reviendras pas
Papa
All our friends been acting strange
Sunshine smiles - even when it rains
And they pretend that they don't see
The trouble with you and me
But they know you're about to leave
And even you have played a part
Of someone who is still true at heart
Do you think that I don't know
Your love for me turned cold
How sad to see you go ...But
I'm hoping that you'll fall in love again
And never look back on what might have been
I pray that we will stay the best of friends
And in my heart I hope that you will fall for me again
But don't say there is no way
The things you loved before haven't changed
Well I could find somebody new
Who wouldn't tear my heart in two
But I'd never get over you ... Oh, No ... So
So I'm hoping that you'll fall in love again
And never look back on what might have been
I pray that we will stay the best of friends
And in my heart I hope that you will fall for me again
He saw no tears in her eyes
Say you wouldn't kid about it
She's telling all of those lies
She swore she'd never told before
But I doubt it
So he bit his tongue
And tried hard to capture his breath
When she said I waited all my life
For just a little death
Say you wouldn't kid about it
Say you wouldn't kid about it
Say you wouldn't kid about it
Sometimes he takes himself so seriously
She makes her movements mysteriously
Slow fast or furiously
It's a big responsibility
With a face full of mixed ability
Big dreams of elegance
Singing the leaving of liverpool
And turning into americans
Say you wouldn't kid about it
So what if this is a man's world
I want to be a kid again about it
Give me back my sadness
I couldn't hide it even if I tried girl
We fight so frail
Making love tooth and nail
You gave me the kiss of my life
I might even live to tell the tale
Open up till midnight
The butcher waits for someone's desperation
That goes beyond control
Speaking is an invitation
Under fluorescent lights
You can't wash out his desire
Where bodies are indecent
And they are not in decline
From behind the counter he thought you whispered you want more
Cut out the brights of the oncoming cars on the highway
Lightness is forced when you cut out the lines in the paper
Cut the split seconds
The ones over-filled
When you thought you were caught with unknowable thrills
Instead you get absence
Soft haze in the face
The lines in your head have to all be replaced
Cleave the dry stone to a promise
That an answer soon will follow
Grave attention is still focused
On the flashlight and the cold fortune
Down the streets on prospect
The butcher walks home
Orange in the streetlight
Even knows it in the dark
Proves it with his eyes closed
He puts his red coat downstairs
Goes up into his bedroom
Undresses and folds his arms
As if it could impress you
From under the covers he thought you whispered you want more
Did you ever read the words
That said love would end
I read them tonight
Mistakes I can't defend
I didn't stop to think
And I upset her
I've said goodnight tonight
The last time forever
I think of her tonight
She keeps me from my sleep
But what can I do
With all of these memories
I used to be so shy
And hide my temper
I've said goodnight tonight
The last time forever
It all went wrong when I grew jealous
I didn't realize my strength
Could take the life of one so precious
Together we were known as good friends
Did you ever read the words
That say I love you
I read them tonight
But what good can they do
I regret what I have done
It wasn't clever
I've said goodnight tonight
The last time forever

"Modulo incanti
e incanti io so dire
vibrando primavera di capelli
Melodiosa piu di un arpa d'oro,
piu dell'oro,
parlami cetra divina,
trova la voce!
...e tu, si tu Calliope,
flauto dolcenota,
piu d'ogni cosa aleggi..."
(extract from Sappho's poems)
I don't want to be shy
Can't stand it anymore
I just want to say "Hi"
To the one I love
Cherry blossom girl
I feel sick all day long
From not being with you
I just want to go out
Every night for a while
Cherry blossom girl
Tell me why can't it be true
I never talk to you
People say that I should
I can pray everyday
For the moment to come
Cherry blossom girl
I just want to be sure
When I will come to you
When the time will be gone
You will be by my side
Cherry blossom girl
Tell me why can't it be true
Tell me why can't it be true
Cherry blossom girl
Cherry blossom girl
I'll never love again
Can I say that to you
Will you run away
If I try to be true
Cherry blossom girl
Cherry blossom girl
I'll always be there for you
That means no time to waste
Whenever there's a chance
Cherry blossom girl
Tell me why can't it be true
Tell me why can't it be true
Water, only water
Will ever be the same
No ending, no beginning
As the seasons change
The longest time I've been waiting alone like the river
Where as a young girl I used to play a scene
I would throw in flowers and branches
And they would float to my lover
Until the day he'd see them
And they'd bring him here to me
Water, only water
Will ever be the same
My needings only fleeting
As the seasons change
I looked across the lake's surface
And I dreamt of a shelter
I'd go skating to the other side
I know he's out there, catching my faded flowers
Well I could leave tomorrow
But my heart is frozen and the ice is far too thin
Water, only water
Will ever be the same
My needings only fleeting
As the seasons change
Water, only water
Will ever be the same
No ending, no beginning
As the seasons change
Come to the water, play in the water
Walk on the water to me
(Repeat and fade)
"Everybody used to think of him as...
Well more like a bum, sort of, a musical bum...
Than anything else"
(Singing)
Your love, is my sanity
Your love, brings me sunshine
I like what you do to me
I like what you give to me
I wander through this world
Needing you so much
I wander through this world
Dreaming of your touch
(Both)
If I could see you again...
If I could just see you again...
Forget about your sorrows
Forget about your heartache
Life is nothing but a shadow
("Ooh-weeee man!"}
Forget about your worries
Forget about the bad times
Life is nothing but a shadow...
("Ooh-weeee man!"} ...without your sunshine
(Father Guido Sarducci)
Everybody's been wondering where you been
And, now that we know what happened
We're all wondering where you are
And even though we feel bad we won't be seein you around anymore
We want you to know we feel better, we won't have to worry anymore
(Singing)
There's a new star, in the night sky
Could it be you, making me so high
Shine on, shine on, shine on, shine on
Shine on and on and on and on and on...
(Both)
If I could see you again...
If I could just see you again...
Forget about your sorrows
Forget about your heartache
Life is nothing but a shadow
("Ooh-weeee man!"}
Forget about your worries
Forget about the bad times
Life is nothing but a shadow...
("Ooh-weeee man!"} ...without your sunshine
(Father Guido Sarducci)
We know your only worry now is,
You worrying about us worrying about you
And even though we stopped worrying,
It doesn't we're not still sad
And we're happy to let you know that, we always will be
(Sean Lennon)
I used to think time, was on my side
I used to think the world, could be so kind
That was another day...
That was another time...
(Both)
If I could see you again...
If I could just see you again...
Forget about your sorrows
Forget about your heartache
Life is nothing but a shadow
("Ooh-weeee man!"}
Forget about your worries
Forget about the bad times
Life is nothing but a shadow...
("Ooh-weeee man!"} ...without your sunshine
Please carry me
Over land over sea
I hear your voice so clear
I wonder if you can see me
Please guide me
Through times like these
My best regards to you
We will raise our voices for you
We remember great deeds performed by you
Our best regards to you
Without fear you seek more
Like an eagle testing her wings
You go higher than before
Clearly I hear your voice
Please carry me
Over land
Over sea
My best regards to you
We will raise our voices for you
We remember great deeds performed by you
Our best regards to you
There's still time 
To undo the fade
There's still time
To fill the bag with raid
There's still a coat 
And there's still a hat 
What mortals do
The righteous 
Thing
There's still time
To fill the bag with raid
There's still time
What mortals do
Is there really any reason why we take this crap
Cover the floor same as be fore 
Cover the floor same as be fore
C'mon
There's not enough time
There's no room in this town
To try and move
You've dryed me up for now
Don't kill what's left of
You'll never know it's there
I try to argue
But now your skin is bare
And I could try to make you mine
But I haven't got the time
To waste it all on someone like you
Don't kill what's left of
You'd never know it's there
And I try to argue
But now your skin is bare
And I could try to make you mine
But I haven't got the time
To waste it all on someone like you
Ooh
And I could try to make you mine
But I haven't got the time
To waste it all on someone like you
And I could try to make you mine
But I haven't got the time
To waste it all on someone like you
Ooh
I took the N Train in from the ocean
Up to 14th St. Union Square
I swam around with the bodies in motion
Drank in the people, then came up for air
And I am a breeze in the still August air
And I can't believe that I'm still standing here
I am a ghost to everyone I know
A star stands still above while Brooklyn blurs below
Between mistakes and new beginnings
This city swells up like a symphony
I disappear in those bodies of motion
And a comforting wave washes over me
I am a breeze in the still August air
And I can't believe that I'm still standing here
I am a ghost to everyone I know
A star stands still above while Brooklyn blurs below
Picture yourself riding under the freeway
It's 3 in the morning in the sodium sky
Don't be alarmed, it's only a feeling
No one can see us tonight
I am a breeze in the still August air
And I drop my knees with all this beauty here
And I am a ghost to everyone I know
And it feels so free
But it's so cold
It's so cold
When Brooklyn blurs below
I try to pressurise the parts of you I'm wanting,
Try to manipulate your point of view,
I wish that you were not going where you're going,
Everybody's walking over you.
Instrumental
(Swano)
I fly away to another dimension
Far beyond reality
I fly away from these evil voices
Is it time to meet my destiny?
It brings me back to my childhood
And the hateful memories
The show is rolling before my eyes
And once again I see the tragedies
Dreamland is calling I am drifting away
Far from the shadows that's haunting my day
Now I can see the old wood hillside
That's the place where we used to play
It brings me closer to the place I fear
The place where my best friend passed away
I didn't mean it, I couldn't know
But what I did made him fall dead to the ground
I get to see the scene repeated
And then I hear the voices call
Dreamland is showing the dark of my past
One with the shadows, the die has been cast
...And I lost...
...I lost...
Let me wake, let me open up my eyes
Back to reality
This nightmare seems so real
There is no way to be free
I must return to my body
I will die if I don't wake up
The voices say that I should stay
I wish that I could make them stop
Dreamland is hell and I know it for sure
I need to stay alive and this ain't no cure
I feel that I am fading away
The shadow come closer and it forces to stay
I'm falling apart with every beat of my heart
The frost in my soul is so cold
And in the haze I see a hand to hold
I try to reach out but it's moving away
And the voices are laughing
Laughing as I pray...
Your love is king
Crown you in my heart
Your love is king
Never need to part
Your kisses ring
Round and round and round my head
Touching the very part of me
It's making my soul sing
Tearing the very heart of me
I'm crying out for more
Your love is king
Crown you in my heart
Your love is king
You're the ruler of my heart
Your kisses ring
Round and round and round my head
Touching the very part of me
It's making my soul sing
I'm crying out for more
Your love is king
I'm coming up
I'm coming, please
You're making me dance
Inside
Your love is king
Crown you in my heart
Your love is king
You never need to part
Your kisses ring
Round and round and round my head
Touching the very part of me
It's making my soul sing
It's tearing the very heart of me
Crying out for more
Yes, I,
I'm crying out for more
This love is real
Touching the very part of me
It's making my soul sing
I'm crying out for more
Your love is king
This is no, blind faith
This is no, sad and sorry dream
This is no, blind faith
Your love
'Cause your love
Your love
Your love is real
Yes it is
You never, never need to part
Never let me go
I'm coming on strong
I'm coming on strong
'Cause your love, our love
Cause your love is real
I'm telling you now
Your love is real
Your love is real
Your love is real
Your love is real, real, real
Your making me smile
Instrumental
Must have been walking
Don't know this place
Somebody stopped talking
It is written in my face
Thought I'd never leave you
Thought I'd never dare
But I watched you going under
That's a thought I could not bear
Five thousand miles I'm away from you
Drifting by the Spanish steps tonight
Guess you've got my number
Guess you got my line
Guess you got my number
Should I be on your mind
Late at night your footsteps
Barefoot on the floor
Tender eyes from sleeping
In the darkened corridor
I come up the stairway
My naked enemy
Comes stumbling towards me
Wish I could set you free
Five thousand miles I'm away from you
Drifting by the Spanish steps tonight
Guess you've got my number
Guess you got my line
Five thousand miles I'm away from you
Sleeping by the Spanish steps tonight
Guess you got my number
Should I be on your mind
I'm not that hard to find
Five thousand miles I'm away from you
Drifting by the Spanish steps tonight
Guess you've got my number
Guess you got my line
Five thousand miles I'm away from you
Sleeping by the Spanish steps tonight
Guess you got my number
Guess you got my line
I'm not that hard to find
Instrumental
Let me watch by the fire and remember my days
And it may be a trick of the firelight
But the flickering pages that trouble my sight
Is a book I'm afraid to write
It's the book of my days, it's the book of my life
And it's cut like a fruit on the blade of a knife
And it's all there to see as the section reveals
There's some sorrow in every life
If it reads like a puzzle, a wandering maze
Then I won't understand till the end of my days
I'm still forced to remember
Remember the words of my life
There are promises broken and promises kept
Angry words that were spoken when I should have wept
There's a chapter of secrets and words to confess
If I lose everything that I possess
There's a chapter on loss and a ghost who won't die
There's a chapter on love where the ink's never dry
There are sentences served in a prison I built out of lies
Though the pages are numbered
I can't see where they lead
For the end is a mystery no one can read
In the book of my life
There's a chapter on fathers, a chapter on sons
There are pages of conflicts that nobody won
And the battles you lost and your bitter defeat
There's a page where we fail to meet
There are tales of good fortune that couldn't be planned
There's a chapter on God that I don't understand
There's a promise of Heaven and Hell but I'm damned if I see
Though the pages are numbered
I can't see where they lead
For the end is a mystery no one can read
In the book of my life
Now the daylight's returning
And if one sentence is true
All these pages are burning
And all that's left is you
Though the pages are numbered
I can't see where they lead
For the end is a mystery no one can read
In the book of my life
Instrumental
Couldn't make it up as we go along
I don't have any words to put into your song
Looking through the junkyard of your heart
I need to find an engine for my car
Don't know where you are
Don't know where you are
When I drive
When I drive around the bend
Singing bye bye bye bye...
And though I really tried, I never have been good
And for my missing heart, I carve one out of wood
Now I see the termites crawling into me
After they are finished, I wonder where you'll be
I wonder where you'll be
I wonder where you'll be
When I drive
When I drive around the bend
Singing bye bye bye bye...
You never have been young
You never have been sane
And if you say that you don't care,
In your eyes I see the shame
Looking through the window of your mind
I see your lonely shadow running out of time
Running out of time
Running out of time
When I drive
When I drive around the bend
Singing bye bye bye bye...
I have seen the lark soar high at morn 
Heard his song up in the blue 
I have heard the songbird pipe his note 
The thrush and the linnet too 
But there's none of them can sing so sweet 
My singing bird as you. 
If I could lure my singing bird 
From his own cozy nest 
If I could catch my singing bird 
I would warm him on my breast 
For there's none of them can sing so sweet 
My singing bird as you. 
My singing bird as you. 
My singing bird as you.
All I wonder
Is this all the
All I wonder
Is this all
There's a place
Deep down inside
Where I breathe
I concede into the sea
All I wonder
Is this all I see
There's only
You and me
(All I wonder) As I wonder (Is this all the)
Will you wait for me? (All I wonder)
While I struggle to breathe (Is this all the)
(All I wonder) As I wonder (Is this all the)
Will you wait for me? (All I wonder)
While I struggle to breathe (Is this all the)
Cast aside old doubt
To the wind
Let it float away to sea
As I breathe
As I breathe
(All I wonder) As I wonder (Is this all the)
Will you wait for me? (All I wonder)
I struggle to breathe (Is this all the)
Whoa, I struggle to breathe (to breathe)
I struggle to breathe
Will you be there for me
I struggle
I struggle to breathe
(All I wonder) As I wonder (Is this all the)
Will you wait for me? (All I wonder)
I struggle to breathe (Is this all the)
I struggle, I struggle to breathe (repeated)
Over a night
I got yours and no others
Now we'll make a life
Of those hours
I got yours
On a misty height
And so be the morning
I knew all about treasures
Where it was going
But nothing about measures
I got yours
In fronof the fading sun
During the day we could'nt talk about
Moving
You said I was late
But that you knew I was coming
I got yours
In the enlighttened night
And later this evening
I was so full of you
Bow I only have things
I must not ever lose
I am yours
So let every morning come
Just after midnight
You now I can't go
Back where you can't follow
I must stay with you
I'll be yours
Forever will be the shortest time
Over a night
I got yours and I love you
So light and so easy
I love you I love you
I'm yours
Instrumental
A time to live a place to go
Oh my army of lovers

Around the world around the world

A time to go a time to live
A place to be a love to give
When travelling around the world
My army of lovers
Disneyworld to Yellowknife
America my way of life
Riding on a wave of love

A cherry moon a night of fun
We dance into the rising sun
I lost my soul in Tokyo
My army of lovers
Around the world around the world
Around the world be be ay be be ay
St Tropez to La Defense
A perfume latin lovers' scent
A pleasure sweet my body heat

My gentlemen polite and proud
From London Town I wave goodbye
The scorpio is rising high

Around the world around the world
Around the world be be ay be be ay
Pour l'univers on quitte la Terre
Heureux joyeux
L'amour de Dieu n'a pas de frontière
Pour l'armée qui voyage sous la lumière

A royal bed a lovers' nest
Classic art we here explore

Around the world my army of lovers
Around the world be be ay be be ay
Jaded... sickened by your ugly ways
Hated... oblivious to your disgrace
Hollow... forced inside this empty hole
Swallow to die again
But I won't fade away
I won't fade away
Feels like I'm fade away
It's like I'm fade away
Wasted... all the years are left behind
Fated... obscured by the passing time
One day... a light will shine
Along the way
Maybe... I'll walk the line
But I won't fade away
I won't fade away
Feels like I'm fade away
It's like I'm fade away
But I won't fade away
I won't fade away
Feels like I'm fade away
It's like I'm fade away
(Girl singing:
Like the fire needs the air
I won't burn unless you're there)
Yeah, I need you, I need you to hate
So I can use you for your energy
You know, this real shit, feel this!
America got a thing for this gangsta' shit, they love me
Black Chuckas, black skullies, leather Pelle-Pelle
I take Spit over Raymo shit, I'm a vandal
Got the silver duct tape on my tray eight handle
The women in my life be confusion and shit
SO like Nino when New Jack, I holla "cancel that bitch"
Look at me, this is the life I chose
Niggaz around me so cold, man my heart dun froze
I built an empire on the low the narc's don't know
I'm the weatherman
I take that cocoa leaf and make that snow
Sit back, watch it turn to dough, watch it go out the door
O after O, you know, homie I'm just triple beam, dreamin'
Niggaz be schemin', I fiend to live a good life
The fiends are just fiendin
Conceal my weapon nice and easy so you can't see
The penitentiary is definitely out the question for me...
I want the finer things in my life
So I hustle (hustle)
Nigga you get in my way while I'm tryin' get mine,
And I'll buck you (buck you)
I don't care who you run with, or where you from
Nigga fuck you (fuck you)
I want the finer things in my life
So I hustle (hustle)
Yeah, I don't know shit about gymnastics I summersault bricks
Black Talons start flyin, when a nigga flip
I cook crack in the microwave, niggaz can't fuck with me
Man my code name, they called me chef boy r 50
Check my logic, smokers don't like seeds in their weed, shit
Send me them seeds I'll grow 'em what they need
Them ain't chia pet plants in the crib, that's chronic
And I'm sellin 'em for 500 a pop god damn it
I sell anything I'ma hustler, I know how to grind
Step on grapes put in water and tell you it's wine
If you analyze me, what you'll find is the DNA of a crook and
What goes in my mind, its contagious
Hypnotic, it sounds melodic
If rap was the block or spot, I'll be potent product
Now get a load of me, flashy, far from low key
And you can locate me where ever that dope be, gettin' money man
I want the finer things in my life
So I hustle (hustle)
Nigga you get in my way while I'm tryin' get mine
And I'll buck you (buck you)
I don't care who you run with, or where you from
Nigga fuck you (fuck you)
I want the finer things in my life
So I hustle (hustle)
It's a hustler's ambition, close your eyes listen, see my vision
Moussberg pumpin, shotgun dumpin' the drama means nothin'
It's part of the game, catch me in the coupe switchin lanes
Or in the jewler switchin chains
I upgrade from 30 Bs to clean Vs
Rocks that I copped proceeds from the spot
I got the energy to win, I'm full of adrenaline
Play the curv and get nauseous, watchin the spinner spin
I'ma plan to make it, a prisoner of the state
Now I can invite yo ass out to my estate
Them hollow tips bent me up, but I'm back in shape
Pour Crystal in the blender and make a protein shake
I'm like the East coast number one playboy B
Hugh Hefner will tell you he ain't got shit on me
The feds watch me, Icey, they can't stop me
Racist, pointin at me look at the niggaracci
Hello!
I want the finer things in my life
So I hustle (hustle)
Nigga you get in my way while I'm tryin' get mine
And I'll buck you (buck you)
I don't care who you run with, or where you from
Nigga fuck you (fuck you)
I want the finer things in my life
So I hustle (hustle)
If I told a lie, if I made you cry
When I said goodbye, I'm sorry
From the bottom of my heart, dear
I apologize
If I caused you pain, I know I'm to blame
Must have been insane, believe me
From the bottom of my heart, dear
I apologize
I realize I've been unfair to you
Please let me make amends
Don't say that you forgot the love we knew
After all, we were more than friends
Give me back your glance, give me back romance
Give me one more chance, forgive me
From the bottom of my heart, dear
I apologize
If I made you blue, I've had heartaches too
Now I beg of you, forgive me
From the bottom of my heart, dear
I apologize
I could run forever, dear
And all I would reach is this mirror
Empathy and sympathy are sisters,
Are drifters, like we
Forgotten days are heavy hands upon my chest
We can drive until daybreak and then I'll rest
And I'll be there just to make you happy
And I'll be there just to see the sun
And I'll be there just to keep you happy
And I'll be there when the mourning comes
Touch these days and I'll kill you
Some words sung are as solemn as true
Surrender to the tune that's flown
She bared all her teeth and she moaned
Recovering days are heavy hands upon your breasts
We can go until daybreak and then we'll rest
And I'll be there just to make you happy
And I'll be there just to see the sun
And I'll be there just to keep you happy
And I'll be there when the mourning comes
You lay there like a thousand mirrors,
Reflecting only shadows
The skies are blue, it must be tears,
That beat outside my window
Instrumental
Instrumental
Can't stare it in the face
Won't find it in one place
Trace it if I could, but it won't be understood
Who is in control
Will I ever bare that soul
It plays a trick on me and it seems to fool us all
Wish that you and I were lovers
But I don't know the game
Please can I have the rules explained again
Some say its in the stars
But I bet for the moon
The answers ain't that far, but it won't be found too soon
It's playing with my heart
It's passion pulls the pain
Intending to outsmart, but I end up in refrain
Wish that you and I were lovers
But I don't know the game
Please can I have the rules explained again
(Spoken): Frankie, where ever you are, I love you
Though you've found a new love,
I still miss you so
I just can't forget you,
But you'll never know
Frankie, my darling,
I'll never let you see me cry
Once I was your sweetheart,
Now I'm just a friend
Once you really loved me,
Now I just pretend
Frankie, my darling,
I'll never let you see me cry
Oh, Frankie,
I'd rather hide these teardrops deep down inside
I'm crying,
But you'll never see I'd rather cry than have you pity me
Though my nights are lonely
Since you went away
I'll always keep this secret
Deep within my heart
Frankie, my darling
I'll never let you see me cry
(Spoken): Frankie, where ever you are, I love you
Strawberries cherries and an angel's kiss in spring
My summer wine is really made from all these things
I walked in town on silver spurs that jingled too
A song that I had only sang to just a few
She saw my silver spurs and said let pass some time
And I will give to you summer wine
Ooh-oh summer wine
Strawberries cherries and an angel's kiss in spring
My summer wine is really made from all these things
Take off your silver spurs and help me pass the time
And I will give to you summer wine
Ooh-oh summer wine
My eyes grew heavy and my lips they could not speak
I tried to get up but I couldn't find my feet
She reassured me with an unfamilliar line
And then she gave to me more summer wine
Ooh-oh summer wine
Strawberries cherries and an angel's kiss in spring
My summer wine is really made from all these things
Take off your silver spurs and help me pass the time
And I will give to you summer wine
Ooh-oh summer wine
When I woke up the sun was shining in my eyes
My silver spurs were gone my head felt twice its size
She took my silver spurs a dollar and a dime
And left me cravin' for more summer wine
Ooh-oh summer wine
Strawberries cherries and an angel's kiss in spring
My summer wine is really made from all these things
Take off those silver spurs and help me pass the time
And I will give to you my summer wine
Ooh-oh summer wine
We used to go
To the slow
Moonlit river
I'd slip my hand
Into your pants
And make you quiver
And when we'd tasted each other
We'd lie and rest
Half undressed
To the sound of water moving
It's the happy things
That make me cry
When they're within my grasp
And I let them pass by
Like wild game
You could never tame
I know better than to try
I can only watch them
Disappear within my mind
Though I couldn't be your other half
Nor the one to make you come
The ties are not undone
Like a lion fed
I will lay my head
On whoever's thighs are warm
It may not last forever
But it's hard to live alone
It's the happy things
Like holding each other tight
Or the kindness in the smile
A stranger gives sometimes
But when it comes of course
I'm like a frightened horse
I go kicking all around
I throw it off my back and
Watch it shatter on the ground
You openly admit
The things you'd like more of from me
Somehow I find it attractive
That you won't censor anything
With you there is no filter
To sugarcoat what is said
Even though I like your honesty
It won't lead me to your bed
(I won't ever be mislead)
So instead go ahead and say it
Even though you know
It makes me uncomfortable
Go ahead and say it
If you must make me blush
You are so transparent
The farthest thing from perfect
Once again I am left out of breath
On the edge of losing it
So instead go ahead and say it
Even though you know
It makes me uncomfortable
Go ahead and say it
If you must make me blush
Please take me under with you
But I will only let you go so far
It can be our secret
You know what our boundaries are
Go ahead and say it
Even though you know
It makes me uncomfortable
Go ahead and say it
If you must
Please
Make me blush
They wanted me here just to show you my face
But when it comes to the crunch, I just hide in disgrace
You were calling me mad but I know you're the same
'Cause you gotta be seen to be playing the game
Yes, you gotta be seen to be playing the game
Yes, we gotta be seen to be playing the game
It ain't gonna hurt now if you open up your eyes
You're making it worse now every time you criticize
I'm under your curse now, but I call it compromise
I thought that you were wise, but you were otherwise
A specimen like you I would love to obtain
I asked a tedious guy if he'd tell me your name
I'd love to impress you with a back somersault
I wanna take up your love, but it's locked in a vault
I wanna take up your love, but it's locked in a vault
It ain't gonna hurt now if you open up your eyes
You're making it worse now every time you criticize
I'm under your curse now, but I call it compromise
I thought that you were wise, but you were otherwise
When I open my mouth, I'm so brutally honest
And I can't expect that kind of love from you
When you open your mouth, your teeth are beautifully polished
And I can't extract the pain you're going through
No, I can't explain the pain you're going through
It ain't gonna hurt now if you open up your eyes
You're making it worse now every time you womanize
I'm under your curse now, but I call it compromise
I'm under your curse, oh, oh
It ain't gonna hurt now if you open up your eyes
You're making it worse now every time you criticize
I'm under your curse now, but I call it compromise
I thought that you were wise, but you were otherwise
Here we are in the orchestra
A bullet in our breath
We hold our horns like credit cards
And hope to pay the rent
But when the war is done
And we've finished all our songs
Will they offset the colossal karma debt?
The ebony and the ivory
Talked politics again
Then they sat and chewed the scenery
'Til there was nothing left
But will all their peace accords
Amount to something more or something less
Than wasted breath?
I'd give it all, I'd give it all
For a legacy of love
I'd give it all, I'd give it all
For a legacy of love
I'd give it all, I'd give it all
For a legacy of love
Here we are in the orchestra
A bullet in our breath
We hold our horns like credit cards
And hope to pay the rent
But when the war is done
And we've finished all our songs
Will they offset the colossal karma debt?
Listen up
Keep your eyes closed
This is the end of the first phase
Now it's time to move on
You have been my friend
For several years now
And I've never seen you
So sad or so quiet
So let us go out
Let us have some relief now
Let's mix with the crowds
Let's have ourselves a ball
We will find you a sweet wife
We will find me a whoring
Companion
We will find you a sweet wife
So that I can betray you
So that her and I
Can betray you
O que é que eu vou fazer agora 
Se o teu sol não brilhar por mim?      (2x)
Num céu de estrelas multicoloridas
Existe uma que eu não colori
Forte
Sorte na vida
Filhos feitos de amor
Todo verbo que é forte
Se conjuga num tempo
Perto, longe
O que for
Você não sai da minha cabeça 
E minha mente voa                       (2x)
Você não sai
Não sai, não sai, não sai
(Entre o céu e o firmamento 
Não há ressentimento 
Cada um ocupando o seu lugar)
Não sai não
Não sai, não sai, não sai, não sai
O que é que eu vou fazer agora
Se o teu sol não brilhar por mim?          (2x)
Num céu de estrelas multicoloridas
Existe uma que eu não colori
Forte
Sorte na vida
Filhos feitos de amor
Todo verbo que é forte
Se conjuga num tempo
Perto, longe
O que for
Você não sai da minha cabeça   
E minha mente voa                    (2x)
Você não sai
Não sai, não sai, não sai
(Entre o céu e o firmamento
Existem mais coisas
Do que julgam o nosso próprio pensar
Que vagam pelo vento
E aquele sentimento de amor eterno
Entre o céu e o firmamento
Existem mais coisas
Do que julgam o nosso próprio entendimento
Que vagam pelo vento
E aquele juramento de amor eterno)
Have you ever been to North Point
To spend your time and pray?
The prison walls are dark and cold and grey.
The writing on the wall at North Point
Speaks to a silent room.
They shut the bars down, leave you to the gloom.
How could we get any closer?
So high is the wire and the guards won't listen,
They won't believe me.
And then it all came back.
Somewhere far above has a new day risen?
Way beyond the searchlight,
Comes alive, comes alive.
Then on a bright day at North Point
The gate was open wide.
They chanced to look at what was inside.
There were a million stars at North Point,
And from the silent tomb,
They took it to the heart and left for the moon.
How could we get any closer?
So high is the wire and the guards won't listen,
They won't believe me.
And then it all came back.
Somewhere far above has a new day risen?
Way beyond the searchlight,
Comes alive, comes alive.
Have you ever been to North Point
To spend your time and pray?
The prison walls are dark and cold and grey.
In love with a broken heart 
You fell in love with a broken heart 
Love in these modern times 
There'll be someone new everynight 
With some other love yarn 
To wrap my harms around 
No one else can understand 
(Trust me) Not about you 
(Hold me) I can't hear you 
In love with a broken heart 
(Think I'll leave today, I cover it all this way)
You fell in love with a broken heart 
(Every earthly breath, a lifeless testimony)
In love with a broken heart 
(Don't you know) 
Love in these modern times 
I'll become what your first class said 
Fink I'll grab some magazine 
I'm no light weight 
I'll find time to throw us down 
You'd feel my medicine's side effect 
(Promised you) You believed me? 
(I know you) Never seen me 
In love with a broken heart 
(Think I'll leave today, I cover it all this way)
You fell in love with a broken heart 
(Every earthly breath, a lifeless testimony)
(Another lifeless testimony) 
You fell in love with a broken heart 
(And it shows) 
Oh please machine, let's keep this terminal clean 
I'll see your face in every cloud 
Fly girl shouts to keep it down 
Down a Dewar's laugh out loud 
Paddy's wagon draws a crowd 
(Save your days) I don't save days 
(Anyway) I think... leave days 
God grant me the strength to accept the things I can change 
And change them 
(Just for the last time) 
(Show me) I can't miss you 
In love with a broken heart 
(Face in every cloud, makes me laugh out loud) 
You fell in love with a broken heart 
(Don't you know) 
(Shouts to keep it down, wagon draws a crowd) 
In love with a broken heart 
(Lifeless testimony) 
You fell in love with a broken heart 
(And it shows) 
(Lifeless testimony) 
In love with a broken heart 
(In these modern times, what your first class said)
Time to throw us down, medicine's side effects
Remember that one night on the town
We were linking arms and skipping around
Singing songs of love, songs of love
You could be my unintended friend
Remember our affection way back when
Way back when
Look at the blue skies gone gray
Another breath without the girl I like
Another disappointing day
Look at the blue skies gone gray
I never knew that cupid felt like this
I'm willing to buy his arrows of loneliness
Loneliness
When my heart broke did you like the sound of it?
You said at least a song will come out of it
That's what you told your mother, didn't you?
Well, this is a song for you
Look at the blue skies gone gray
Another breath without the girl I like
Another disappointing day
Look at the blue skies gone gray
Another breath without the girl I like
Another disappointing day
Yeah, we're doing fine
The worst is almost over
I'm moving on, I don't even know her
Yes, that's the end
We said our last goodbye
I think I'll go home and cry
This is a song for you
This is a song for you
This is a song for you
It's just another day
It's just another day
It's just another day
This is a song for you
This is a song for you
This is a song for you
It's just another day
It's just another day
It's just another day
This is a song for you
This is a song for you
This is a song for you
It's just another day
It's just another day
It's just another day
Blue skies
Just another day
Blue skies
Just another day

The joke is that we thought we were shooting a dog.
We sure didn't see no man in that fog.
It was just a boring day that we decided to betray.
Me and him are outlaws now.
There ain't no stopping now.
They are coming to get us now.
"You fired that shot and I simply had to watch.
I am putting the blame on you!"
He looked at me and we looked away.
The fog was getting closer.
Our gun was still smoking.
We saw this as a token that we could still run away.
Run, run away.
There ain't no stopping now.
I'll always run away.
Run, run away.
They are coming to get us now!
Minutes later we came back.
We would say that we had found this man in a crack.
Something kept an eye on us,
The eye that always watches us
And we finally told the truth.
A killer is a cold blooded one.
Just like us, he shoots stray cats for fun!
What happened there is beyond, I swear,
We'd never aim to kill or scare!
There ain't no stopping now!
Run, run away.
There ain't no stopping now.
I'll always run away.
Run, run away.
They are coming to get us now!
I've been walking in the park
In a dying afternoon
Like the days when it would rain
And we stared from the windows of school
And I picked my way through elms
In that stillness once again
With the darkness coming down
I don't know what more I can say

Yo, It's a black thing
Yo, It's a white thing
If we talk this teach
We say the wrong thing
Blackness is blackkness
Whiteness is whiteness
Despite this why
We have to fight between us
Nothing to discuss
On the back of the bus
But a cold stare
Avoiding contact
Oblivious to others
This is the social contract
Lack of sensitivity
Lack of sinsibility
Lack of the notion
For better compatibility
I don't front nothing
I am what I am
I do what I can
I nod or I shake your hand
For a greeting
That's the common and pleasing
All right, my man,
Yeah, it's that easy
Yeah, it's that easy
As easy as pie
That shit goes on forever
So make a conscious try
To improve, nothing to lose
But a free ride on
Some old news
Your pop says, your ma says
But their values could be old news
Not knowing the truth
Blaming their troubles
Some problems in the jungle
On certain races
And faces
But I say Yo sit
Just because
They're different
You didn't lose your job to
Some immigrant
You lost employment
From corporate exploitment
Packing up to cash out on
Mexico's mint
Stint your vision
Stunt your growth
It ain't a land to boast about
'Cause it raised you
Left you in a daze of
The vision contort
Sacrificing many for the
Rich man's comfort
The clouding, the cover-ups,
The myths, and
The scandals
These are the ones
That destroyed America
So don't you see hysteria
I remove with incision
Pinpointing facts
Pinpoint precision
It ain't your fault
Or mine on the back of the trolley
We're just people living
Trying to find quality
Not cold and windy
Yes cool and breezy
All right, my brother
Yeah, it's that easy
Yo, you and me used to run ball in the league
We ran the championship team
The best they had seen
But so much to talk about
Now that we've grown
We've been in different scenes
Of a different act
And in the fact we sold out
To the social contract
Meaning we don't hang
And even worse than that
I heard your boys
Fought my boys
With baseball bats
And bats lead to ax
And ax lead to gun
And gun lead to mothers
Losing their sons
I live how I live
I ain't asking you to try it
The problem's too big
To fit me to buy it
The weight is too heavy
The length is too long
Slowing down the everybody get along
If the teachers were to teach
Would you listen to the Sensei
Goodnight my brother
Yeah, it's that easy
I always want more
I'm never gonna get it
You're gonna be the one I never got that got away
And I'll regret it
Just a moment in time
But I can't forget it
Yeah, we almost said it
If this is love, ooh
I should be dying
But I'm going downtown like I still care
Like I'm still trying
I said I was over you but I'm lying
There, I almost said it
Every time you look at me
I say it silently
Oh, when will you wake up and get it
This close, we almost said it
I know you're not evil
So why do you tease me
Yeah, staying around here late at night
You don't make it easy
It's in my body language, read me
We were this close
This close, yeah
And it's like every time you look at me
I say it silently
Oh, wake up, baby, come and get it
This close, we almost said it
You say that you're still not free
Well, I hear selectively
That still means someday you might be
Oh, this close, yeah, yeah
You wrote me a song
I often play it
Depending on where I am with you
I either love it or I hate it
We were just this close but we couldn't say it
We were this close
Hey man, do you wanna hear a story about me?
I'm an old man, you're probably not interested I see
But I'll tell you anyway, about the girl who came to stay
Thirty years, six months and two days ago
She walked into the party
With Joan de Monmarquis
She wore her beauty like a cloak
With the devil up her sleeve
And she was ancient like the Greeks
Amongst us animals and freaks
I lost my mind, never to find
The useless thing again
There was something going on that night
But I don't know what it was
There was something going on that night
I was waiting, we were just waiting for it
I forgot everything I knew
In the ancient sea that night
When she slipped her dress off
Shivering and clung to me so tight
Then she whispered in my ear
"There is nowhere else but here"
Nowhere, nowhere
There was something going on that night
But I don't know what it was
There was something going on that night
I was waiting, we were just waiting
You don't know yourself
You don't know yourself
You don't know yourself
Until she's had her way with you
We spent three weeks in a cheap hotel
Corroding by the sea
Tangled up in sheets and love
And ancient misery
One day I woke to see her leave
She had an eagle on her sleeve
The last I heard she took the bird
To catch snakes in Mexico
There was something going on that night
But I don't know what it was
There was something going on that night
I was waiting, we were just waiting for it
It's not high finance, it's called heart and soul
If it's rock and roll, got to go, go, go, go, go
Gonna keep moving on up to the higher ground
Gonna keep on moving on up, I got to stand my ground
Gonna keep on moving on up, I wanna stick around
Won't let the bastards grind me down
Won't let the bastards grind me down
Won't let the bastards grind me down 
Call me raincheck in the afternoon
Call me raincheck, need a shot of rhythm and blues
Call me raincheck, on a golden autumn day
Call me raincheck, I won't fade away, I won't fade away
I don't fade away, I don't fade away, unless I want to 
Can't take my love away, ah 'cause it's here to stay
If it fades away, come back another day
Gonna keep on moving on up to the higher ground
Gonna keep on moving on up, I wanna stick around
Gonna keep on moving on up, oh gonna stand my ground
Won't let the bastards grind me down
Won't let the bastards grind me down
Won't let the bastards grind me down 
My name is raincheck in the afternoon
My name is raincheck, need a shot of rhythm and blues
My name is raincheck, on a golden autumn day
My name is raincheck, and I don't fade away, I don't fade away
I don't fade away, I don't fade away, unless I want to 
Move it up, move it up, move it up, move it up
Move it up, move it up, move it up, move it up
Move it up, move it up, move it up, move it up, move it up
Grind me down, grind me down, grind me down 
My name is raincheck in the afternoon
My name is raincheck, need a shot of rhythm and blues
My name is raincheck, on a golden autumn day
My name is raincheck, and I don't fade away, I don't fade away
I don't fade away, I don't fade away, unless I want to 
Put on your dancing shoes, dance away your blues
When I'm feeling like this, I got nothing to lose
Wanna keep on moving on up to the higher ground
Wanna keep on moving on up and I'll stick around
Wanna keep on moving on up, got to stand my ground
Won't let the bastards grind me down
Won't let the bastards grind me down
Oh, won't let the bastards grind me down 
My name is raincheck in the afternoon
My name is raincheck, need a shot of rhythm and blues
My name is raincheck, on a golden autumn day
My name is raincheck, and I don't fade away, I don't fade away
I don't fade away, I don't fade away, unless I choose
I choose, I choose, I choose 
No, I don't fade away, I don't fade away, I don't fade away
Unless I choose, I choose, I choose
I choose, I choose, I choose
I choose, I choose, I choose
I choose, I choose, I choose
I choose, I choose, I choose
No, I won't fade away, I won't fade away, I don't fade away
Unless I want to
Turning into something I can't cope
With not having
Stop, stop it
Could I put my hands up
And ask that you stop
Do I need to be in love
I'm lost when it's just me
With only a hope to make
You happy enough to stay
Return the words, the looks
I give you like they're falling out of me
Seconds change
And at the end
Your face is inerasable
True, I need to be in love
I'm lost when it's just me
With only a hope to make
You happy enough
Do I need to be in love
What is there otherwise from loving
Just takes a face
To make everything else erase
Stop, stop it
Could I put my hands up
And ask that you stop
I wanna thank y'all for coming to see the preacher's son tonight (thank you)
Fellas, hold on to your girl right now
Yeah right now we're gonna slow the whole dancefloor down
Oh yeah, take it back to the old school, let's go
Baby, let me holla at you
You know there's no greater love
Than a woman who loves a man
And a man who loves a woman, ah yeah
I wanna love ya
And I ain't talking trash neither, ey
This is something that I can feel deep in my soul, oh, oh

But then you told me a good woman
Is worth more than diamonds and precious pearls
Yeah, yeah, yeah
So lay back, and let me massage you, everywhere now
I can feel them move with your body
Harder, harder, harder, harder, harder
You make me so hot
We gonna listen to some Marvin

We gonna listen to Donny Hathaway
Ooh, would you please lay your body next to mine, ah yeah
Today is gonna be the day
That they're gonna throw it back to you
By now, you should've somehow
Realized what you gotta do
And I don't believe that anybody
Feels the way I do about you now
Backbeat the word is on the street
That the fire in your heart is out
I'm sure you've heard it all before
But you never really had a doubt
I don't believe that anybody
Feels the way I do about you now
Today was gonna be the day
But they'll never throw it back to you
By now you should've somehow
Realized what you're not to do
I don't believe that anybody
Feels the way I do about you now
I said maybe
You're gonna be the one who saves me
After all, you're my wonderwall
Summertime, and the living is easy
Fish are jumping and the cotton is high
Oh, your daddy's rich and your ma is good-lookin'
So hush little baby, Don't you cry
One of these mornings you're gonna rise up singing
And you'll spread your wings and you'll take to the sky
But 'til that morning, there ain't nothing can harm you
With Daddy and Mammy standing by
Summertime, and the living is easy
Fish are jumping and the cotton is high
Oh, your daddy's rich and your ma is good-lookin'
So hush little baby, Don't you cry
One of these mornings you're gonna rise up singing
And you'll spread your wings and you'll take to the sky
But 'til that morning, there ain't nothin' can harm you
With Daddy and Mammy standing by
How long have I been in this storm?
So overwhelmed by the ocean's shapeless form
Water's getting harder to tread
With these waves crashing over my head
If I could just see you
Everything would be all right
If I'd see you
This darkness will turn to light
And I will walk on water
And you will catch me if I fall
And I will get lost into your eyes
I know everything will be all right
I know everything is all right
I know you didn't bring me out here to drown
So why am I ten feet under and upside down?
Barely surviving has become my purpose
'Cause I'm so used to living underneath the surface
If I could just see you
Everything would be all right
If I'd see you
This darkness will turn to light
And I will walk on water
And you will catch me if I fall
And I will get lost into your eyes
I know everything will be all right
And I will walk on water
And you will catch me if I fall
And I will get lost into your eyes
I know everything will be all right
I know everything is all right
Everything's all right
Everything's all right
Drake:
Look, I know girls love Beyoncé
Girls love to fuck with your conscience
Girls hate when niggas go missing
And shawty you ain't no different
These days it's hard to meet women
Feel like my love life is finished
I've been avoiding commitment
That's why I'm in this position
I'm scared to let somebody in on this
No new friends, no no no
You know how this shit go
You got your fair share of admirers that call your phone
You try to act like it's just me, but I am not alone
But if you're alone then, say my name, say my name
James Fauntleroy:
Say my name, say my name
When no one is around you
Say, "Baby, I love you"
If you ain't running games
Say my name, say my name
You actin' kinda shady, baby
Why the sudden change?
Say my name
Say my name
Say my name
Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you
Drake:
Say my name, say my name
'Cause those other men are practice
And this ain't no time for actin'
And this ain't no time for games
And this ain't no time for uncertainty
And this ain't no time for locking your phone and not coming home
And startin' some shit when I'm in the zone
This is why I've been saying
No new friends, no no no
You know how this shit goes
This is not four years ago
Time escapes me
Now forget how it felt when this shit move slow
I come through in whips that make a young boy take the long way home
All my young boys 'round me saying, "Get money and fuck these hoes"
Where we learn these values? I do not know what to tell you
I'm just trying to find a reason not to go out every evening
I need someone that'll help me think of someone besides myself
I need someone I leave through the front door with
'Cause we don't wanna hide no more
Plus you're not shy no more
Neither of us wanna play the side no more
No, I'm not alone
Even though nothing was the same
Let me get your ass alone
Let me make you say my name
Say my name
(Dave)
Something I never would have known
Not knowing knowledge never ennobles
All her ideas were like smoke rings, I had to know things
She was a tangle of questions
How many eggs make up a pound?
How many ears of corn in the niblets?
(Jian)
And how big was the bag?
(Dave)
I was a person who would censor "Pee Wee's Adventure"
She was exceedingly liberal
(Mike, then Jian)
Was she?
(All)
And we fell in love
And the sunshine shone from the sunshine above
Fell in love, whole loaf love
(Dave, w/ "wide... wide" being sung during second line by Jian and Mike)
Try not to think while your inside
Yes keep your wide eyes wide wide open
(Jian)
Keep your eyes open wide
(Mike)
Keep them wide
(Dave)
I made a meal of the lighting, this was exciting
(All)
We had a real urban drama
(Dave)
She always said it again
(Jian and Mike)
She always said it again
(Dave)
Just when she'd said it, that's when she'd say it
(Jian and Mike)
How's that again?
(Dave)
She said my pasta was delicious, bit repititious
(All)
That kind of thing made me crazy
(All)
And we fell in love
And the sunshine shone from the sunshine above
Fell in love, whole loaf love
(Dave)
Take a look around, sun has gone down
And I've had a good time, have you had a good time?
(All)
I've loved without loss, I've put down my cross
You know what I know, an' I'm going go
(Dave, w/ "on fire" being sung by Jian and Mike)
She set my schoolhouse on fire
Down in the fire the angels are singing
(Mike, then Jian)
On fire
(Dave)
Notice a beautiful fire
(All)
Heavenly choir
Ah... Ah... Ah... Ah...
From the Liner:
(Mike-vocals; Murray-bass; Jean-vocals, tambourine; Dave-lead vocal, guitar)
I put a record on
Put it on and sing along with you
Sing along with you
And that's okay by me
That's okay 'cause in a way I'm free
In a way I am free
And you don't have to sympathize
I will try and dry my eyes
And I'm okay if we're drinking
Grab a beer and disappear with me
Disappear with me
And you don't, you don't have to sympathize
I will try and dry my eyes
And I put a record on
Put it on and get it on with you
Get it on with you
This time you'll find some other gonna mess your mind
It's too late or too soon
Some other gonna come too soon
Put it on
I will try and dry my eyes
Put it on
Am I something you despise?
Put it on
I will try to dry my eyes
I put a record on
I put a record on
I put a record on
Too soon
Put it on
And I will try and dry my eyes
Put it on
But am I something you despise?
Put it on
I will try to dry my eyes, my love
Kto kocha naprawdę
Będzie kochać zawsze
Gniew zmieni w kochanie
A zdradę w niepamięć
Nie oceniaj mnie
Ani dobrze ani źle
Po prostu bądź po prostu bądź i patrz
Po prostu bądź po prostu bądź i patrz
Jak dziecko unieś mnie wysoko
Jak dziecko mnie do łóżka kładź
Rano zjedz ze mną śniadanie
Po prostu bądź po prostu bądź i patrz
W zuchwałej chwili pożądania
Nadałam tobie takie imię
Że znajdę cię na końcu świata
I już się z tobą nie rozminę
Po prostu bądź po prostu bądź i patrz
Po prostu bądź po prostu bądź i patrz
Te quiero pero te llevaste la flor
y me dejaste el florero
te quiero me dejaste la ceniza
y te llevaste el cenicero
te quiero pero te llevaste marzo
y te rendiste en febrero
primero te quiero igual
te quiero , te llevaste la cabeza

sé que te quiero y que me esperan
más aeropuertos
te quiero te llevaste la vela
y me dejaste el entierro
primero te quiero igual
te quiero pero te llevaste la flor
y me dejaste el florero
te quiero me dejaste la ceniza
y te llevaste el cenicero
te quiero pero te llevaste marzo
y te rendiste en febrero
primero te quiero igual.
Beauty queen of only eighteen
She had some trouble with herself
He was always there to help her
She always belonged to someone else
I drove for miles and miles
And wound up at your door
I've had you so many times 
But somehow, I want more
I don't mind spending everyday
Out on your corner in the pouring rain
Look for the girl with the broken smile
Ask her if she wants to stay awhile
And she will be loved
And she will be loved
Tap on my window, knock on my door
I want to make you feel beautiful
I know I tend to get so insecure
It doesn't matter anymore
It's not always rainbows and butterflies
It's compromise that moves us along, yeah
My heart is full, and my door's always open
You come anytime you want, yeah
I don't mind spending everyday
Out on your corner in the pouring rain
Look for the girl with the broken smile
Ask her if she wants to stay awhile
And she will be loved
And she will be loved
And she will be loved 
And she will be loved
I know where you hide, alone in your car
Know all of the things that make you who you are
I know that goodbye means nothing at all
Comes back and begs me to catch her every time she falls
Tap on my window, knock on my door
I want to make you feel beautiful
I don't mind spending every day
Out on your corner in the pouring rain, oh
Look for the girl with the broken smile
Ask her if she wants to stay awhile
And she will be loved
And she will be loved
And she will be loved
And she will be loved
Please don't try so hard to say goodbye
Please don't try so hard to say goodbye
I don't mind spending everyday
Out on your corner in the pouring rain
Please don't try so hard to say goodbye
(To be gone EP)
Found love, last summer it faded away.
All marks on my body vanished in a day.
Unwanted, late September when you are eager to find.
Wait to last winter, love of any kind.
You have no one on your side, fight your own troubled mind.
And no help to come by, fight your own troubled mind.
All winter, slept around until my heart fell a sleep.
Never had so much, was afraid to keep.
First of April, love of your life falls out of the blue.
Falling for a bad joke, you love to be the fool.
You have no one on your side, fight your own troubled mind.
And no help to come by, fight your own troubled mind.
So find love, for to night for all nights to come.
As long as you're with someone and never left alone.
As long as you're with someone never left alone.
You have no one on your side, fight your own troubled mind.
And no help to come by, fight your own troubled mind
Back back back in the back of your mind
Are you learning an angry language,
Tell me boy boy boy are you tending to your joy
Or are you just letting it vanquish
Back back back in the dark of your mind
Where the eyes of your demons are gleamin
Are you mad mad mad
About the life you never had
Even when you are dreaming.
Who are these old old people
In these nursing homes
Scowling away at nothing
Like big rag dolls just cursing at the walls
And pulling out all of their stuffing
Every day is a door leading back to the core
Yes, old age will distill you
And if you're this this this full of bitterness now
Some day it will just fill you
When you sit right down in the middle of yourself
You're gonna wanna have a comfortable chair
So renovate your soul before you get too old
'Cause you'r egonna be housebound there
When you're old you fold up like an envelope
And you mail yourself right inside
And there's nowhere to go
Except out real slow
Are you ready, boy, for that ride?
Your arrogance is gaining on you
And so is eternity
You better practice happiness
You better practice humility
You took the air, you took the time
You were fed and you were free
Now you'd better put some beauty back
While you got the energy
You'd better put some beauty back, boy
While you got the energy
(,,Als Tristan and Isolde den Minnetrank getrunken,
vereinte die Macht der Liebe die beiden,
jeder wurde für den anderen so durchsichtig
wie Spiegelglas.
Des Nachts kam die Liebe als Ärztin
und führte den liebeskranken Tristan zu Isolde.
Da wurden sie füreinander zur Medizin.
Owe Tristan und Isolde, dieser Trank ist euer Tod.")

I want to live where soul meets body
And let the sun wrap its arms around me and
Bathe my skin in water cool and cleansing and feel
Feel what it's like to be new
'Cause in my head
There's a Greyhound station
Where I send my thoughts
To far-off destinations
So they may have a chance
Of finding a place where they're
Far more suited than here
I cannot guess what we'll discover
When we turn the dirt with our palms cupped like shovels
But I know our filthy hands can wash one another's and not one speck will remain
I do believe it's true
That there are roads left in both of our shoes
But if the silence takes you
Then I hope it takes me, too
So, Brown Eyes, I'll hold you near
'Cause you're the only song I want to hear
A melody softly soaring through my atmosphere
Where soul meets body
Where soul meets body
Where soul meets body
And I do believe it's true
That there are roads left in both of our shoes
But if the silence takes you
Then I hope it takes me, too
So, Brown Eyes, I'll hold you near
'Cause you're the only song I want to hear
A melody softly soaring through my atmosphere
A melody softly soaring through my atmosphere
A melody softly soaring through my atmosphere
A melody softly soaring through my atmosphere
Instrumental
I wish I could say what words won't amount to,
But now I can't speak your name
Send it in a letter
Wait for your reply
Because you were on my mind
I'm sorry Mary but it's over (you took the best out of me)
I'm sorry Mary but it's over (you took the best out of me)
I'm sorry Mary but it's over (you took the best out of me)
First star I see tonight hangs on my wall
Picture of you that's still there
Wouldn't change anything 
Would you change me if I could
Would you want me to be here
I'm sorry Mary but it's over (you took the best out of me)
I'm sorry Mary but it's over (you took the best out of me)
I'm sorry Mary but it's over (you took the best out of me)
Illusions all but faded 
Sunlight beams in your hair 
Trying me 
I'm sorry Mary but it's over (you took the best out of me)
I'm sorry Mary but it's over (you took the best out of me)
I'm sorry Mary but it's over (you took the best out of me)
It has started
And it can't be stopped
Call the ferryman to cast me off
Send me
Send me
Over the ocean
To find you 
Not the radio
Not today
There is nothing left you can say, just get me get me
Over the ocean
To find you 
Close your eyes, baby
Close your eyes, sunshine
Wait for one more sunrise
And I'm home
Home home. 
Feel the rumbling
Through the chair
Feel the future hanging In the air
Fly me
Fly me
Over the ocean to see you 
And we're hurrying
And we wait
Now we're tumbling
To the gate
Send me
Quickly
Over the ocean
To find you 
Close your eyes, baby
Close your eyes, sunshine
Close your eyes, precious
Close your eyes, wonder
Just this one last sunrise
And I'm home
I'm home
I'll hold you and touch you, and make you my woman,
And give you my love with sweet surrender...
Tonight, our hearts will beat as one,
And I will hold you, touch you, and make you my woman tonight...
There's something in your eyes I see:
A pure and simple honesty...
Hold me in your arms tonight;
Fill my life with pleasure...
Let's not waste this precious time;
This moment's ours to treasure...
Hold me in your arms tonight;
We'll make it last forever...
When the mornin' sun appears,
We'll find our way together...
I believe you when you say that you love me;
Know that I won't take you for granted...
Tonight, the magic has begun,
So won't you hold me, touch me, and make me your woman tonight?
There's something in your eyes I see;
I won't betray your trust in me...
Hold me in your arms tonight;
Fill my life with pleasure...
Let's not waste this precious time;
This moment's ours to treasure...
Hold me in your arms tonight;
We'll make it last forever...
When the mornin' sun appears,
We'll find our way together...
I'll hold you (Hold me...) and touch you (Touch me, baby...), And make you my woman (Make me your woman...), tonight... (Tonight...)
Hold me in your arms tonight; (Hold me in your arms...)
Fill my life with pleasure... (There's something in your eyes I see...)
Let's not waste this precious time;
This moment's ours to treasure...
Hold me in your arms tonight; (Hold me in your arms, ooh, baby...)
We'll make it last forever... (There's something in your eyes I see...)
When the mornin' sun appears, (When the sun appears...)
We'll find our way together...
Hold me in your arms tonight; (Hold me in your arms...)
Fill my life with pleasure... (There's something in your eyes I see...)
Let's not waste this precious time;
This moment's ours to treasure...
Hold me in your arms tonight; (Oh, now, hold me... Just hold me in your arms, baby!)
We'll make it last forever... (There's something in your eyes I see...)
When the mornin' sun appears,
We'll find our way together...
Hold me in your arms tonight...
Your hills and dales and flowery vales
That lie near the Moorlough Shore.
Your vines that blow by borden's grove. 
Will I ever see you more
Where the primrose blows 
And the violet grows. 
Where the trout and salmon play.
With the line and hook, delight I took 
To spend my youthful days. 
Last night I went to see my love, 
And to hear what she might say.
To see if she'd take pity on me, 
Lest I might go away. 
She said, "I love that Irish lad, 
And he was my only joy, 
And ever since I saw his face 
I've loved that soldier boy."
Perhaps your soldier lad is lost 
Sailing over the sea of Maine. 
Or perhaps he is gone with some other lover, 
You may never see him again. 
Well if my Irish lad is lost, 
He's the one I do adore, 
And seven years I will wait for him 
By the banks of the Moorlough Shore.
Farewell to Sinclaire's castle grand.
Farewell to the foggy hill.
Where the linen waves like bleach-ed silk
And the banching stream runs still
Near there I spent my youthful days 
But alas they are not now mine
For cruelty has banished me
Far away from the Moorlough Shore.
Blood boils through your veins and then
Flows gently like the nile
But I will come home again
Tonight
Flowing rivers may have stopped me when (have stopped me when)
I held on to the shore (on to the shore)
But I still chased after you tonight
Still sang your songs that felt (our songs) just right
Silver strings spun a gentle song (the gentle song)
On breezy nights like these (on nights like these)
Storms broken gentle winds just like
Tires rattle heavy walls (the tides) tonight
Dried-out earth comes to life again (to life again)
Through hot and nervous hands (oh nervous hands)
Gardens growing full again with life
But I sit and wait for you (I'll wait) tonight
There used to be nothing in common, there used to be nothing to share
It used to be sit by the window, and stare at what used to be there
It used to be lonely in numbers, impossibly weak on my feet
When the game starts and one person's left out, it used to be me
But that was then and she is now, I once was lost with her I'm found, on this early April morning
Water falling from the sky, the sun that's breaking fills my eye, and it came without a warning now
There used to be nothing in common, there used to be nothing to share
It used to be sit by the window, and stare at what used to be there
Like a king in his court at his table, who is blind to the power he holds
I could never come to understand all the powers I had of my own
But that was then and she is now, I once was lost with her I'm found on this early April morning
Water falling from the sky, the sun that's breaking fills my eye, and it came without a warning now
I trust my love, I trust myself, I trust the love of someone else
I trust that I will get what I've been hoping, waiting for
The prison walls are crashing down as winter dies without a sound, on this early April Morning
Let the struggle end, the joy begin, it's true it's love I'm falling in,
And it came without a warning now
And that was then and she is now, I once was lost with her
I'm found on this early April morning
The water falling from the sky, the sun that's breaking fills my eye,
And it came without a warning now
You come home late and you come home early.
You come home big when you're feeling small.
You come home straight and you come home curly.
Sometimes you don't come home at all.
What in the world has come over you?
What in heaven's name have you done?
You've broken the speed of the sound of loneliness;
Out there running just to be on the run.
I got a heart that burns with a fever.
I got a worried and a jealous mind.
How can a love that will last forever
Get left so far behind?
What in the world has come over you?
What in heaven's name have you done?
You've broken the speed of the sound of loneliness;
Out there running just to be on the run.
It's a mighty mean and a dreadful sorrow.
It's passed the evil line today.
How can you ask about tomorrow;
You ain't got one word to say.
What in the world has come over you?
What in heaven's name have you done?
You've broken the speed of the sound of loneliness;
Out there running just to be on the run.
Out there running just to be on the run.
Out there running just to be on the run.
How many times on this merry-go-round
Over and over again
Up on the horse was a weak, foolish child
Who never believed it would end
How many smokes till I'm satisfied
How many drinks till I'm happy
How much of the day will I watch fade away
Until there is no one to ask me
I was gone, so gone
Gone, so gone
For a while
How many times will I sleep by your side
Turning and dreaming and scared
Of fair grounds that shut down as you ride away
And my horse won't go anywhere
I was gone, so gone
Gone, so gone
For a while
I was wrong, so wrong
Wrong, so wrong
For a while
How many songs will I try to write
All with the same thing to say
I've got two tickets left, won't you please stay with me
For the very last ride of the day
I never thought about it before
Just close your eyes and ignore
The dark that troubles you most
Don't let it be here...
And if you see it again
Hold your breath and pretend
That you're already dead
You'll never be alone
I will always hold your hand
I'll never let you fall,
'Cause nothing
Nothing else matters at all...
If you're scared just think of me
'Cause you know I'll never let you be...
Anywhere... but with me.
Forget the story you heard,
Why are you worried about the dirt.
I don't think that you'll mind
When it's your time.
'Cause I will be there with you
And we'll figure out what to do
So that you don't get bored.
You'll never be alone;.
I will always hold your hand
I'll never let you fall,
'Cause nothing,
Nothing else matters at all...
If your scared just think of me
'Cause you know I'll never let you be.
Anywhere... but with me.
So try to sleep with a smile
I promise I'll wait awhile
To make sure that you've moved on
You won't be lost
I will always hold your hand
I'll never let you fall,
Cause nothing,
Nothing else matters at all...
If your scared just think of me
Cause you know I'll never let you be.
Anywhere... but with me.
Your card the sun
When I am done
Say you will wait long
Wait for the day you come home
Fools rush in where angels fear to tread,
And so I come to you, my love, my heart above my head...
Though I see the danger there,
If there's a chance for me, then I don't care!
Fools rush in where wise men never go, 
But wise men never fall in love, so how are they to know?
When we met, I felt my life begin,
So open up your heart and let this fool rush in!
Fools rush in where wise men never go,
But wise men never fall in love, so how are they to know?
When we met, I felt my life begin,
So open up your heart and let this fool rush in!
Just open up your heart and let this fool rush in!
Well, open up your heart and let this fool rush in!
Last thing I remember is the freezing cold
Water reaching up just to swallow me whole
Ice in the rigging and howling wind
Shock to my body as we tumbled in
Then my brothers and the others are lost at sea
I alone am returned to tell thee
Hidden in ice for a century
To walk the world again
Lord have mercy on the frozen man
Next words that were spoken to me
Nurse asked me what my name might be
She was all in white at the foot of my bed
I said angel of mercy I'm alive or am I dead
My name is William James McPhee
I was born in 1843
Raised in Liverpool by the sea
But that ain't who I am
Lord have mercy on the frozen man
It took a lot of money to start my heart
To peg my leg and to buy my eye
The newspapers call me the state of the art
And the children, when they see me, cry
I thought it would be nice just to visit my grave
See what kind of tombstone I might have
I saw my wife and my daughter and it seemed so strange
Both of them dead and gone from extreme old age
See here, when I die make sure I'm gone
Don't leave 'em nothing to work on
You can raise your arm, you can wiggle your hand
And you can wave goodbye to the frozen man
I know what it means to freeze to death
To lose a little life with every breath
To say goodbye to life on earth
To come around again
Lord have mercy on the frozen man
Lord have mercy on the frozen man
And it's funny how time
Steals the feelings from a love affair
And there's no place to lay the blame
It ain't a case of no one cares
Helplessly just watch it fade away
Neither will admit we both just wanna say
I do
I miss the days when we were crazy in love
When you were not sure of me
And I wasn't sure of you
I do
Bring back the days when we were crazy in love
I wanna feel that way again
When we were crazy in love
Oh it used to be so easy
When we touched and I was so high
I could get intoxicated just by looking in your eyes
Baby is there anything that we can do?
'Cause I know you're missing me
Like I'm always missing you
I do
I miss the days when we were crazy in love
When you were not sure of me
And I wasn't sure of you
I do
Bring back the days when we were crazy in love
I wanna feel that way again
When we were crazy in love
I want to feel crazy in love
More about the days when we were crazy in love
I wanna feel that love with you
It's so cold, under this demon's wing
The shelter I've sought from the storm
My God, what have I done?
I am deceived...
Instrumental
It was a dream I had
This room was in the middle of a sandy plain
The walls were gone but the doors and windows remained
At the side of the bed were soft cushions
Two-dimensional ships like ocean liners sailed across this desert
As they passed, their huge bulks disappearing into a thin line
These ships were always full of people facing windows
And sometimes find their problems seem like a day's work
Following deep tracks, the boats kept passing by
Came to an unmanned sort of harbour
Stood on the sand in no water
(?) Lowered it's doors
And one by one the ships descended to the sand
And sailed off in different directions across the desert
The carrier was then refilled with ships arriving in perfect time
I watched seven or eight of these drop-offs
And realised the process, the ships and the people within them never differed
I thought about following any of these ships to the end of their journey
But suspected I would end up back here
Or a place so similar that I wouldn't be able to tell the difference
I can't sleep in this bed anymore
It's like a padded cell
The sheets are too tight
(?)
A man of your success
I'm tired of it
(?)
Walked over to the window
Climbed on the window-ledge
And jumped out
I wasn't scared
I know I can fly
A quiff, a whiff of smoke, an empty egg
Roses north (I don't know how long we'd been waiting)
A front room (endless hours, weeks, years even)
Lino, yellow formica (we didn't know)
Lots of milky tea (only onward, forward, inward, in, over a field) (I don't want to do this)
Unmatched to match the unmatched plates (the sun sets in the west) (I really really really don't want to do this)
Straight-backed chairs (this is where we started each night) (you made me do it)
Steamy glass-pane window (we could only travel at night) (bang bang bang on the door)
Warped door, embassy no. 6 ashtray (we would conceal ourselves in the missing light till darkness fell) (I awoke, ran downstairs)
Chewy chop (nobody knew where we were) (a letter dropped to the floor)
Toasted cob, mustard (where we were going) (I bent, reached)
Crinkly-cut chips, bendy fork (a vague sense of direction) (swang open)
Polyester, pink gingham ((?)) (cracked my head)
(Nothing told us where we were) (unconscious fell)
(We always somehow managed to keep a straight line) (I awoke, the dog)
(Licking my dick)

Once had a saviour
From child to teenager.
But now I'm a man,
A full grown man.
Spirit's been crippled
And feeling a little,
A little run down,
A little run down.
Could blame the devil;
He gave me the shovel
To dig my own grave.
You have to forgive me.
You just have to forgive me.
I'll make it right.
I'll make it right...
I'll make it through.
I'll make it right.
Came home from the doctor
Feeling a bit stronger.
Tears in my eyes,
My swollen eyes.
It was my decision
To fill the prescription.
Well I had no choice.
I had no choice.
I am sinner,
Ain't no beginner,
But I'm paid up in full.
Until the next time.
And there will be a next time.
I'll make it right.
I'll make it right.
I'll make it through.
I'll make it right.
This time.
This time.
This time.
This time.
This time.
This time.
Here at the top of a mountain
In a clear night under the stars
That seem to fall every next moment
I receive a vision.
A vision of a rising empire.
An union of the strong,
Built upon the hate in man.
At six in the morning the ice in the tree thaws into the millpond returns to the deep I caress where my lover once lay by my side before I turned inwards and forced her to fly we try to connect with the people outside they pass through our slumber like trains in the night I caress where my lover once lay by my side before I turned inwards and forced her to fly after the cold night the raindrops that froze melt into the thin air like the footsteps of ghosts I caress where my lover once lay by my side before I turned inwards and forced her to fly for she could not know me for I know not myself and without understanding love isn't enough
Our hands are in a knot
It's all I'm thinking of
The shape of your elusive arms
Naked by the light
I bring it all back home
Where it don't belong
I stash it in my tiny house
And leave the door ajar
I gotta find a new career
I gotta really try
I'm drowning in this atmosphere
Running dry
I'm digging my own track
No use in turning back
I'm swimming round in circles
It feels that way sometimes
Like a cat that is too weak
To stand
I lay around in corners
Of whatever room I can
I gotta find a volunteer
And space enough to thrive
This loneliness has got me near
Running dry
Celle-là est dédicacée à,
? toutes les filles qu'on rencontre dans le train
Je suis le musicien, le mec sur le microphone
Fanatique de Rome comme Tifosi sous opium
Il faut qu'on donne le maximum sur le podium
Même si c'est dur comme l'iridium, nous sommes
Soudés à l'instar des grains d'maïs
Fatigués on résiste comme jadis aux franquistes, El Pais
C'est mon éthique, elle est plus stricte que les loubavitch
De Greenwitch Village soir de Shabbat dans un foyer Yiddish
Flow automatique. Illusion d'optique
J'ai vu la femme d'Elton John au Lavomatic
Puis j'ai rencontré une jeune nana dans le train
Je l'ai revue le lendemain avec des fleurs à la main
Elle verse des larmes, je l'apostrophe
Et dès la première strophe, je sens que c'est la catastrophe
Scènes de ménages, manèges. Elle déménage, s'allège
Elle a des fleurs et elle pleure son coeur est pris au piège
Je l'appelle Lise no good. Elle boude
Elle est comme une balle et le mec c'est Tiger Wood
La p'tite flippe. J'connais l'type. J'connais l'trip
Ne me quitte pas. J'connais l'titre
(Refrain)
Playmate
Ce mec est un playboy
Un mister love mélangé à Castor Troy
Playmate
Fallait que j'te fixe
Il n'a pas pris la fuite
Il a six domiciles fixes
J'en suis désolé mais, je ne crois pas qu'il t'aimait
La journée il trimait. Et le soir il rimait
Le 8 mai. Il signait un deal, tu lui dis oui, mais
Arrête de l'ver les bras comme en 81, le 10 mai
Tu l'kiffais. Tu lui parlais vrai tandis qu'il frimait
T'es restée la même tandis que lui changeait, te brimait
Rouge Gemey sur les lèvres. Le soir tu fumais
Il est parti sans paix. Sans même allumer le calumet
Et dans l'TGV, vénère, tel la CGT
Elle regrette d'avoir même planifié le bébé
C'est un scorpion. Il les pique, toutes
De Krasnadar jusqu'à Knocke le Zout
C'est la vie quotidienne, ça se passe sous ta fenêtre, sur ta planète
C'est juste une question d'périmètre
Je sais qu'il reviendra. Sois forte
Si tu l'aimes ouvre lui. Sinon claque ta porte
Elle a rêvé de Californie, de lune de miel à Bali
D'aller visiter le Mali mais son visage a pâli
Son ex. Un playboy SDF
A 6 domiciles fixes de Brest à Budapest

Of all the things I've said, I like this the best
Of all the things I've meant, but never meant to say
Holding my breath through tunnels, 
Well I almost crashed
Holding my breath on the way home
Got my wish at last
All the times I've cried
I should have tried to be real
All the times I've cried
I wanted to tell you how I feel
I feel
Though I feel regret, I know that you regret this more
But I feel as if I've never had a crush before
And I never asked to feel this way, or put you off
But when you touch me I forgot and then I couldn't stop
Holding my breath through tunnels, well
I almost crashed
Holding my breath on the way home
What do I wish for now?
For a better life
Under thousands of rainbows
Warm is the sun
Getting wet when the rain goes
For a better life
Taking breath of each other
Dad is the moonlight
Divine is your mother
We'll follow the raindrops
Falling free into love's ocean
We won't be afraid of giving all of our devotion
For a better life
Now or never
As we deserve it
Staying young forever
For a better life
Gorgeous is giving
And isn't it simply
When the day dies the night is for living
We'll follow the raindrops
Falling free into love's ocean
We won't be afraid of giving all of our devotion
Look, those are colours we know
But there are more and I'm gonna show
We won't be late
It's time to go
For a better life
We'll follow the raindrops
Falling free into love's ocean
We won't be afraid of getting lost in the sea of emotions
Look, those are colours we know
But there are more and I'm gonna show
We won't be late
It's time to go
For a better life
For a better life
For a better life.
All this time,
And all is fine,
Don't call me paranoid,
But I think something's going on.
I know you say,
It looks okay, yeah, but I've got my suspicions,
But I don't want to be like this
'Cause I'm a reasonable guy,
But I can't shake this, and I don't know why
Experience brings,
A kinda sense for these things,
Don't call me paranoid,
But I think something's going on.
'Cause it seems all right,
Oh but it's too damn quiet,
And I tell ya, I don't like it,
Oh god I wish it isn't so.
'Cause I'm a reasonable guy,
But I can't shake this, and I don't know why
Katie,
Will you say to me,
Will you just laugh and tell me that I've got it wrong?
Katie,
Will you say to me,
Will you just tell me please what the fuck is going on?
Oh for goodness sake,
Now you know I'd hate to come over obsessive,
'Cause I'm really, really, really I'm not like that at all
Did I say too much?
Yeah, well not as such,
Oh look but there I go again,
No this really is not how I am.
It's just there's something in my mind,
That says "where were you last night?"
Katie,
Will you say to me,
Will you just laugh and tell me that I've got it wrong?
Katie,
Will you say to me,
Will you just tell me please what the fuck is going on?
Going on.
Katie,
Will you say to me,
Will you just laugh and tell me that I've got it wrong?
Katie,
Will you say to me,
Will you just tell me please what the fuck is going on?

I will wait for You there
Down on my knees where I met You
Give You all of my cares
Find a grace to hold onto now
I'm calling for You
I will wait for You there
Far from the world and it's violence
It left broken and bare
I need to hear You in the silence now
I'm calling for You
And with outstretched arms
I will sing out melodies
And my beating heart
Will pour out a symphony
Hallelujah's in the morning
Hallelujah's in the night
I will wait for you as long as I have life
I will wait for You there
Down On my knees where I met you
Cause life is a war fought with tears
But You are the strength I hold onto now
I'm calling for you
There's a wren in a willow wood
Flies so high and sings so good
And he brings to you what he sings to you
Like my brother, the wren and I
Well, he told me if I try, I could fly for you
And I wanna try for you 'cause
I wanna sing you a love song
I wanna rock you in my arms all night long
I wanna get to know you
I wanna show you the peaceful feelin' of my home
Summer thunder on moon-bright days
Northern lights and skies ablaze
And I bring to you, lover, when I sing to you
Silver wings in a fiery sky
Show the trail of my love and I
Sing to you, love is what I bring to you
And I wanna sing to you, oh
I wanna sing you a love song
I wanna rock you in my arms all night long
I wanna get to know you
I wanna show you the peaceful feelin' of my home
I wanna sing you a love song
I wanna rock you in my arms all night long
I wanna get to know you
I wanna show you the peaceful feelin' of my home
We were down at dead man's hill
Smoking vines like cigarettes
Looking through the trashy mags
Trying to feel what's coming next
You told me of crashing cars
Older brothers and late night bars
I told you what I feel most
And you kept it like a ghost forever
Don't you write it down
Remember this in your head
Don't take a picture
Remember this in your heart
Don't leave a message
Talk to me face to face
Talk to me face to face
Lying on the bright blue jumping mat
Dinner bell is ringing
Barking dogs and model planes
And the sound of passing trains
We watch for bonfires in the sky
On the beach in July
Spin the bottle steal the kiss
Postcards to the one I miss forever
The one I miss forever
Don't you write it down
Remember this in your head
Don't take a picture
Remember this in your heart
I'll leave a message
When everything comes apart
(Talk to me face to face)
(Talk to me face to face)
(Everything comes apart)
I'll leave a message
When everything comes apart
I remember cats on fire
Gasoline a burning spiral
Standing underneath the night
Fighting back with all my might
Empty cans and charred remains
Find them in the heat of day
On the top of dead man's hill
This is what I know of shame forever
Hawaiian sunset peeping from the sea
Smiles and says "Aloha" to his sweetheart Hawaii
The drowsy islands slumber one by one
Close their sleepy eyelids, say "Goodnight" to the sun
Then Hawaii like millions of times before
Blossoms in her lover's arms once more
Too soon the sunrise will wake her from her sleep
So until tomorrow, sleep Hawaii sleep
Then Hawaii like millions of times before
Blossoms in her lover's arms once more
Too soon the sunrise will wake her from her sleep
So until tomorrow, sleep Hawaii sleep
Can't get you off or out of my
Can't get you off or out of my
Can't get you off or out of my head
Head for the sun in your belly
You need a soul to find you out
Make you windy windy
We were so windy winding flying
Backwards rolling sliding
Red light crazy shining
Haze garden pure strain highway
Can't get you off or out of my
Can't get you off or out of my 
Can't get you off or out of my head
Red silver suns in your belly
You need a dream to drown you out
Make you windy windy we were so windy
Winding dying inside sucking outside
Spouting heavy moonlight
Dazed shotgun your stain my way
Can't get you off or out of my
Can't get you off or out of my 
Can't get you off or out of my head
Kun ulkona hämärtyy, odotan sinua
Istun keittiön ikkunassa, ei oo tupakkaa
Kadulla seisoo poikia, etsin sua katseella
Täällä ilman sua ei oo mitään
ei ilman sua ei oo mitään
ei mun oo hyvä olla yksin
Täällä ilman sua ei oo mitään
ja tästä ilman sua ei tuu mitään
ei mun oo hyvä olla yksin
Liikenne on lakannut, kuuntelen kaikua
Hiljaiseen käytävään odotan sun askelia
Mä oon istunut tässä jo monta tuntia
mun jalat puutuu (jalat puutuu)
Mä oon istunut tässä jo monta tuntia
mun jalat puutuu (jalat puutuu)
(x2)
Täällä ilman sua ei oo mitään
ei ilman sua ei oo mitään
ei mun oo hyvä olla yksin
(istun tässä jo monta tuntia jalat puutuu, jalat puutuu)
Täällä ilman sua ei oo mitään, ei ilman sua ei oo mitään
(istun tässä jo monta tuntia jalat puutuu, jalat puutuu)
ei mun oo hyvä olla yksin
(istun tässä jo monta tuntia jalat puutuu, jalat puutuu)
Täällä ilman sua ei oo mitään, ei ilman sua tuu mitään
(istun tässä jo monta tuntia jalat puutuu, jalat puutuu)
ei mun oo hyvä olla yksin
You teach me how to feel
It feels all right
There's nothing left to fear
Finding myself
The further I go
Towards you
You teach me how to love
Parts of myself
I hated for so long
Loving myself
Through loving you
I no longer live like a man in the dark
Hiding all the pieces of my broken heart
Way up high I'm holding on
Way up high I'm holding on to you
You teach me to forgive
It feels all right
Compassion for your pain
Compassion for mine
The circle divides
I no longer live like a man in the dark
Holding all the pieces of my broken heart
Way up high I'm holding on
Way up high I'm holding on to you
Way up high I'm moving on
Way up high I'm moving on to you
Pretending that we'll meet
Each time I turn a corner
I walk a little faster
Pretending life is sweet
'Cause love is around the corner
I walk a little faster
Can't begin to see my future shine as yet
No sign as yet, you're mine as yet
Rushing toward a face I can't divine as yet
Keep bumping into walls and taking lots of falls
But even though I meet
At each and every corner
With nothing but disaster
I set my chin a little higher, hope a little longer
Build a little stronger castle in the air
And thinking you'll be there
I walk a little faster
Can't begin to see my future shine as yet
No sign as yet, you're mine as yet
Rushing toward a face I can't divine as yet
Keep bumping into walls and taking lots of falls
But even though I meet
At each and every corner
With nothing but disaster
I set my chin a little higher, hope a little longer
Build a little stronger castle in the air
And thinking you'll be there
I walk a little faster
You're never with me
You're never near me
What time is it?
What time?
Whose time is this?
Give yourself a chance to breathe
I'll give you the room you need
You're never here
You're never near here
What day is this?
What day?
Whose day is this?
Put me in your supermarket list
I'm here, I'm real, it's true, I do exist
Today you may feel a little sleepy
Maybe the morning is too soon
I guess I'll have to borrow
One of your sunny afternoons
But afternoons they never come
There's nothing left for me to borrow
I guess I'll try again tomorrow
I guess I'll try again tomorrow
I guess I'll try again tomorrow
I guess I'll try again tomorrow
You're wasting me
You're breaking, you're wasting me
Can this be love?
Is this?
Whose love is this? 
What is wrong with you?
I don't know
No place in you for me
And me, I need you so
And if you want to be by yourself
No one disturbing, that's alright
I guess I'll have to borrow
A little of yourself tonight
But tonight it never comes
There's nothing left for me to borrow
I guess I'll try again tomorrow
I guess I'll try again tomorrow
I guess I'll try again tomorrow
I guess I'll try again tomorrow
It may seem a little hollow
But I'll try again tomorrow
There's nothing left for me to borrow
I guess I'll try again tomorrow
It was the fear of God that led me to you
And it's the fear of you that takes getting used to
I've never been one to hang my heart on a thread
But you spun me around and you loved me instead
I know I could turn to something other than you
'Cause I don't understand you and why you're after me
I've never been the saint you wanted me to turn to
And I can't see the view from the eyes you look at me through, oh no
But I'm alright, I'm alright, I'm alright, yeah, I'm alright
Baby, I'm alright, I'm alright, I'm alright
So cut below the surface and try hard not to notice
That I could be so foolish thinkin' I'm alright
I've got no one to hold me, I've got no one to carry
Everything inside of me that I won't let you see
Yeah, I'm alright, I'm alright, baby, I'm alright, yeah, I'm alright
Baby, I'm alright, I'm alright, yeah, I'm alright, yeah
Yeah
I'm alright, I'm alright, yeah, I'm alright, baby, I'm alright
I'm alright, yeah, I'm alright, I'm alright, yeah, I'm alright
I'm alright
Yeah, I'm alright
Yeah, I'm alright
Yeah, I'm alright
Yeah, yeah
I'm alright
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, I'm alright
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah
Ooh, there's a grey ocean
Ooh, it's calling me in
I'm getting taken under
Don't know these emotions
Don't think I ever have
So helplessly caught in your tide
Ooh, grey
Why can't I be the simply blue sky
Don't know where you'll take me
Whether you'll do me harm
Just don't leave me stranded in your arms
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
When I'm trying to keep my head above your charm
Trying to stay calm
But I don't know if I'll make it
Or if I ever will
Just don't leave me stranded
Don't leave me stranded
Don't leave me stranded in your arms
Grey Ocean
Grey
I close my eyes, you reappear
I always carry you inside, in here
I fall asleep, you come to me
And once again our love is real
How could I have let you get away?
Why couldn't I have found a way to say
Tu eres el amor de mi vida
Si solo te pudiera encontrar
Con todo el corazon te diria
Tu eres mi amor de verdad
I look outside, I know you're there
And you've found a brand new life somewhere
I only wish it had been us
But I'm happy for your happiness
How could I ever let you go?
How will I ever let you know
Tu eres el amor de mi vida
Si solo te pudiera encontrar
Con todo el corazon te diria
Tu eres mi amor de verdad
Tu eres mi amor
Tu eres mi amor
Tu eres mi amor de verdad
Tu eres mi amor
Tu eres mi amor
Tu eres mi amor de verdad
Gehör mir ganz allein
Ich will der Eine sein
Du bist mir wert und teuer
Komm her, lass mich das Feuer sein
Gehöre mir, mir ganz allein
Die Haut so zart und weiß
Die Stirn vom Atem heiß
Komm, mach dir keine Sorgen
Bleib bei mir, bis der Morgen graut
Ich leck das Salz von deiner Haut
Küss mich, küss mich, küss mich!
Oh bitte, bitte ja
Küss mich, küss mich, küss mich!
Oh, bitte noch ein mal
Küss mich, küss mich, küss mich!
Worte weich wie Haut
Küss mich, küss mich, küss mich!
Und Worte hart wie Stahl
Gehör mir ganz allein
Ich will dein Alles sein
Du bringst mir tausend Wonnen
Die Augen sind mein Sonnenschein
Gehöre mir, mir ganz allein
Komm her, mir ist so kalt
Die Nacht wird langsam alt
Ich will dir alles geben
Du bist, was mich am Leben hält
Du bist das schönste auf der Welt
Küss mich, küss mich, küss mich!
Oh bitte, bitte ja
Küss mich, küss mich, küss mich!
Oh, bitte noch ein mal
Küss mich, küss mich, küss mich!
Worte weich wie Haut
Küss mich, küss mich, küss mich!
Und Worte hart wie Stahl
Wieder
Wieder
Küss mich, küss mich, küss mich!
Oh bitte, bitte ja
Küss mich, küss mich, küss mich!
Oh, bitte noch ein mal
Küss mich, küss mich, küss mich!
Worte weich wie Haut
Küss mich, küss mich, küss mich!
Und Worte hart wie Stahl
Küss mich, küss mich, küss mich!
Oh bitte, bitte ja
Küss mich, küss mich, küss mich!
Oh, bitte noch ein mal
Küss mich, küss mich, küss mich!
Worte weich wie Haut
Küss mich, küss mich, küss mich!
Und Worte hart wie Stahl
Küss mich, küss mich, küss mich!
Oh bitte, bitte ja
Küss mich, küss mich, küss mich!
Oh, bitte noch ein mal
Küss mich, küss mich, küss mich!
Worte weich wie Haut
Küss mich, küss mich, küss mich!
Und Worte hart wie Stahl
Küss mich, küss mich, küss mich!
Oh bitte, bitte ja
Oh, bitte noch ein mal
Küss mich, küss mich, küss mich!
Worte weich wie Haut
Und Worte hart wie Stahl
And you said: I think I know how you're feeling
And I replied: I don't think so at all
Then we wouldn't be here
A reuniting cup of coffee, trying to recall
I know God
What have we done to each other and tell me, dear
Where did we go wrong?
And did we grow apart
Or did we just not grow together?
Living our dreams
When you're sleeping on the couch
When love becomes sacrificing
Then I'm not sure it's gonna be
You and me, anymore
And it's time
Tell me what you are thinking and guide me
Where do we go from here?
Do our ways converge
Or do they separate to nowhere?
Destination unknown
When you're sleeping on the couch
When love becomes sacrificing
Then I'm not sure it's gonna be
You and me, anymore
When you're sleeping on the couch
When love becomes sacrificing
Then I'm not sure it's gonna be
You and me, anymore
When you're sleeping on the couch
When love becomes sacrificing
Then I'm not sure it's gonna be
You and me, anymore
Close one there
Choking in clean underwear
Bleeding tongue
Eight ball pounding in my lungs
Ship to shore
I can't see the coastline anymore
I shouldn't be here
I thought I made that loud and clear
But the master of disaster
Gets tangled in his telecaster
He can't play it any faster
When he plays the blues
When he had the heart to ask her
And every note just shook the plaster
Now he's just a mean old bastard
When he plays the blues
China town
Chasing that old dragon down
Madam Wong's
We play the blues with the curtains drawn
Sidewalks of white
While the la sun beat out the night
Pounding brain
My last transmission down the drain
And the master of disaster
Gets tangled in his telecaster
He can't play it any faster
When he plays the blues
When he had the heart to ask her
And every note just shook the plaster
Now he's just a mean old bastard
When he plays the blues
There's a debt I owe
I'll never pay before I go
So I sing the blues
Hand me down my walking shoes
You're in my heart
Though we may be miles apart
There's my point
I'll see you in another joint
When the master of disaster
Gets tangled in his telecaster
He can't play it any faster
When he plays the blues
When he had the heart to ask her
And every note just shook the plaster
Now he's just a mean old bastard 
When he plays the blues

One by One
I suffer you gladly
One by One
You're all I don't need
And you couldn't see,
The wood from the tree
You're eyes are unkind,
So don't look at me.
And all that you know
Is written in stone
One by One
I suffer you badly,
One by One
You're all I don't need
And life on the road,
It makes you feel old,
Remember the time when friends were around,
When friends were around
(When we were all friends)
Is this the way to be?
Is this the way to be?
One by One
One by One
Thanks to mfait cox for these lyrics
Thanks to Martin for these lyrics
Raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens;
Bright copper kettles and warm woolen mittens;
Brown paper packages tied up with strings;
These are a few of my favorite things.
Cream-colored ponies and crisp apple strudels;
Doorbells and sleigh bells and schnitzel with noodles;
Wild geese that fly with the moon on their wings;
These are a few of my favorite things.
Girls in white dresses with blue satin sashes;
Snowflakes that stay on my nose and eyelashes;
Silver-white winters that melt into springs;
These are a few of my favorite things.
When the dog bites,
When the bee stings,
When I'm feeling sad,
I simply remember my favorite things,
And then I don't feel so bad.
Oh, this is the start of something good
Don't you agree?
I haven't felt like this in so many moons
You know what I mean?
And we can build through this destruction
As we are standing on our feet
So since you want to be with me
You'll have to follow through
With every word you say
And I, all I really want is you
For you to stick around
I'll see you every day
But you have to follow through
You have to follow through
These reeling emotions they just keep me alive
They keep me in tune
Oh, look what I'm holding here in my fire
This is for you
Am I too obvious to preach it
You're so hypnotic on my heart
So since you want to be with me
You'll have to follow through
With every word you say
And I, all I really want is you
For you to stick around
I'll see you every day
But you have to follow through
You have to follow through
The words you say to me are unlike anything
That's ever been said
And what you do to me is unlike anything
That's ever been
Am I too obvious to preach it
You're so hypnotic on my heart
So since you want to be with me
You'll have to follow through
With every word you say
And I, all I really want is you
For you to stick around
I'll see you every day
So since you want to be with me
You'll have to follow through
With every word you say
And I, all I really want is you
For you to stick around
I'll see you every day
But you have to follow through
You have to follow through
You're gonna have to follow
Oh, this is the start of something good
Don't you agree?
Nie mów mi nigdy
Tych słów nie pojmiesz sam
I nie wiesz jak bardzo ich żal
Nie widzisz nigdy
Już nie chcesz widzieć, jak
Jedno z nas rani
Nie ja
Jeśli możesz mi pomóc
Nie odmawiaj, nie mów nie
Tak mi Ciebie brak
Jeśli możesz mi pomóc
Nie odmawiaj, nie mów nie
Tylko powiedz tak
To wszystko czego chcę 
Mam tyle przed sobą
Mój Bóg odnalazł mnie
Lecz nie wiem naprawdę
Kim jest 
Jeśli możesz mi pomóc
Nie odmawiaj, nie mów nie
Tak mi Ciebie brak
Jeśli możesz mi pomóc
Nie odmawiaj, nie mów nie
Tylko powiedz tak
Jeśli możesz mi pomóc
Nie odmawiaj, nie mów nie
Tak mi Ciebie brak
Your only here
Your only here, just for a while
And I, shiver like a child
But you're already underground
Ooh
And for this something that you find
Something that you find, when we unite
And their burning in your eyes
Burning in your eyes, when we unite
And for there's nothing left to fight
Nothing left to fight
When you are down
Oh, nothing left to find
Nothing left to find when you are down
Dooown
And for there's nothing left to fight
Nothing left to fight
When you are down
Ooh
Nothing left to fight
Nothing left to ffind when you are down
Dooown.
I honestly won't give you an apology
You'd come to see
That you'd disagree with my policy
And in truth I saved you
I saved you
You'd fall so deep
And my mountain's steep
You can't brace yourself
So I walk away,
With not much to say
'Cause I know myself
And in truth I saved you
I saved you
I saved you
Nights of missing me there
I saved you
Praying that it ain't fair
I saved you hours of therapy
I saved you from being hurt by me
You'd give your best
But it'd still be less
And that makes no sense
I'd have to leave
And we'd have to grieve
And there's no defense
So in truth I saved you
I saved you ...
I stood close enough to hear you say,
Do as the beautiful once did,
Tore up my picture from it's frame,
Just wanted to be one of you.
Standing on the outside, looking.
Funny how you see the truth,
But the feeling does come back to you.
She's crazy as anyone can be,
That's what they say, they say of me.
Wanting love can make one do,
It isn't my fault, heredity.
Standing on the outside, looking, looking.
State of gray, state of sin.
Standing on the outside, looking, looking.
Cannot feel a single thing,
But the feeling does come back again.
This morning feels like yesterday,
Yesterday followed me along,
Where do you go when no one cares?
Six feet under, underground.
Standing on the outside, looking, looking.
State of gray, state of sin.
Standing on the outside, looking, looking.
I Cannot feel a single thing,
But the feeling will come back again... again.
And you're like a 90's Jesus
And you revel in your psychosis
How dare you?
And you sample concepts like hors d'oeuvres
And you eat their questions for dessert
Is it just me or is it hot in here?
And you're like a 90's Kennedy
And you're really a million years old.
You can't fool me.
They'll throw opinions like rocks in riots
And they'll stumble around like hypocrites
Is it just me or is it dark in here?
You may never be or have a husband
You may have or hold a child
You will learn to lose everything
We are temporary arrangements
And you're like a 90's Noah
And they laughed at you as you packed all of your things
And they wonder why you're frustrated
And they wonder why you're so angry
Is it just me or are you fed up?
And God bless you in your travels, in your conquests, and queries
Your face in a dream returns
Once in a lifetime comes
And it passes by
I'm never on your side
And you must be blind
If you don't know why
"She'll always take you for granted"
A voice in the back of my mind said
"You could be waiting your whole life
For her to open her eyes"
I'm never on your side
And you must be blind
If you don't know why
"She'll always take you for granted"
A voice in the back of my mind said
"You could be waiting your whole life
For her to open her eyes
For her to open her eyes"
"She'll always take you for granted"
A voice in the back of my mind said
"You could be waiting your whole life
For her to open her eyes
For her to open her eyes"
La la la la...
There is no fortune to be made here
It's just a town like any other town
Sure there must be good things left to say
Can't think of one
So I won't say
Nothing
Wears a pretty face and armor
She's got shine at the surface and coal below
Nothing
Please don't tell me
I already know nothing
Living like a mobile spinning off its line
Phillip always said about the wheels-within-wheels
Tension rising higher it's coming through my window
And all I seem to feel is
Nothing
Please don't tell me I already know
Nothing
Oh it's getting better now
But time will show
Nothing
Never goes away
Nothing
Never goes away
Tonight I saw her again
Blood red luna sitting on the bridge
It could have been a sign but I don't believe in signs
I don't believe in
Nothing
Please don't tell me I already know
Nothing
Oh it's getting easier but time will show
Nothing
She's got a brand new set of reasons why she can't let it go
Nothing
Please don't tell me I already know
Nothing
Looks like you're never coming home
Looks like you'll make that road alone
Caught in the headlights of a very mixed up world
Where everything you fear
Where your shadow blocks your light
Oh, beautiful world, to me
Doves cried when she tried to fly
When her wings spread she heard their song
Flies to your flame
But so hard to see at night
Alone in your dreams
Beautiful world, it's a beautiful world, to me
It's a beautiful world, it's a beautiful world to you
Don't let me go outside tonight
Keep me safe within this room
Afraid of what I feel
Afraid of what I'll do
Everything I feel is here
Where your shadow blocks the light
One embrace, one embrace
My heart, sometimes
It's a beautiful world, it's a beautiful world, to you
Cold wind blowing
Cold ice snowing
Light blue longing
My heart stops running
There's no place to hide
Have you ever had the feeling
That the world's gone and left you behind
Have you ever had the feeling
That you're that close to losing your mind
You look around each corner
Hoping that she's there
You try to play it cool perhaps
Pretend that you don't care
But it doesn't do a bit of good
You got to seek till you find
Or you'll never unwind
Try to think
That love is not around
Still it's uncomfortably near
My old heart
Ain't gaining no ground
Because my angel eyes ain't here
Angel eyes
That old devil sent
They glow unbearably bright
Need I say
That my love's misspent
Misspent with angel eyes tonight
So drink up all you people
Order anything you see
Have fun you happy people
The drink and the laugh's on me
Pardon me
But I gotta run
The fact's uncomfortably clear
Gotta find
Who's now number one
And why my angel eyes ain't here
Tell me why my angel eyes ain't here
Excusez moi my angel eyes ain't here
Excuse me while I disappear
Out on the fringe
Where the shallows meet the scratchlands
Out where hope and the highway ends
You can park or cruise
Both ways you lose
This is Flytown now, my friend
You take a walk on Bleak Street
Tonight could be the night you crash
Then you turn and stop
Start to fingerpop
You think you hear a wailin' combo
You climb a flight of twisted stairs
Some cat says "buddy"
If you've got eyes
To rhythmatize
Bring your flat hat and your ax
'Cause tonight at ten
We'll be workin' again
At the Teahouse on the Tracks
The Siegel Brothers were slammin' out a baion
So slick it should have been a crime
Irene and Flocko and little Amy Khan
Lead off the big front line
The crowd was bouncin' in sync with the pulse
You get a case of party feet
Then the room turns bright
And fills up with light
And then from somewhere deep inside you
Some frozen stuff begins to crack
Better hurry
Take the T-Line to Bleak and Divine
Just above the Good Time Flats
It's your last chance
To learn how to dance
At the Teahouse on the Tracks
On Sunday morning
You're back at the wheel
You're feelng calm and crisp and strong
When it feels right
Just drive for the light
That's the groovessential facts
Someday we'll all meet
At the end of the street
At the Teahouse on the Tracks
If you've got eyes
To rhythmatize
Bring your flat hat and your ax
'Cause tonight at ten
We'll be workin' again
At the Teahouse on the Tracks
Take the T-Line to Bleak and Divine
Just above the Good Time Flats
It's your last chance
To learn how to dance
At the Teahouse on the Tracks
When it feels right
Just drive for the light
That's the groovessential facts
Someday we'll all meet
At the end of the street
At the Teahouse on the Tracks
If you've got eyes
To rhythmatize
Bring your flat hat and your ax
'Cause tonight at ten
We'll be workin' again
At the Teahouse on the Tracks
I'm overjoyed, and in the sun,
The second time this year.
I'm on a plane at 30,000 feet.
The only way from here is down.
And that's ok with me.
'Cause I'm overjoyed, I'm ready for the...
Fall (x 3)
'Cause I'm ready for the fall.
There's no surprise I've been forced to learn,
That bliss comes at a price.
And here I am still minin' gold
From the soul I sold like a whore.
The finger of blame is pointing at me,
'Cause I lit that flame, now it's burning me.
But I'm overjoyed and it's no surprise
That I'm ready for the fall.
Fall (x8) (That I'm ready for the fall)
Fall...
One fine night
The air did bring
Two little ones
Called to be
I am, yours to mind
So let that be
Give your life
It's given free
Huuvola, huuvola, huuvola, huuvola
When a time
That will come to part us
Forget me night
For it is here
In those missing times
We send our deepest sense to climb
One fine night
When one heart enjoins
Huuvola, huuvola, huuvola, huuvola
Hark, and be well
Go catch the light in every cell
Let the fire take the fire
And the rain wash the pain
May your soul's waters never wane
Make Eden here
Send angel's prayers
May your garden be sweet
Let the fire take the fire
Let the fire take the fire
And the rain wash the pain
Huuvola
Sheriff's boot heel
Scratching the swingadella's dance floor
What else could she feel?
But fear, if she can't dance no more
On way back home wonders meeting all
Those guys from the folk band
"One day I'll be as tall
As I'll be their friend."
She woke up smiling,
Her night was good and long
She bought a country dream
And paid with a folk song
In the other night
She came back even from far
Held the seller tight
After recognizing his guitar
"So that's you, singing and selling!"
She said " I can't believe I've found
Someone like you around."
(The morning)
For her a cup of coffee
Before the singing of the
Stinger night gale
For him an old city
As scenery to his dreams for sale
After that day
They get close in each other's strings
But if he doesn't play
She doesn't dream
Sweet time came
Time to sing love rhymes
No days were the same
Daily art was dropping lines
Between doors, walls and chords,
Became a time he remembers
From which he says "I miss you so"
I believe that's because
It takes two tango
Than he walks to boozery
Enjoys alone folknocracy
I believe that's because
It takes two tango
Than he walks to boozery
Enjoys alone folknocracy
Write songs telling why he got blindo
And forgets It takes two to tango
He tried to make it clear
But she was almost forgetting
About confusion
It was like she was a bootleg
And the old trunk was just illusion
Stars from constellations
Were the only thing could guide her gold
He made it hard again
After telling her swallowing stories
From dreams he sold.
Than he walks to boozery
Enjoys alone folknocracy
Write songs telling why he got blindo
And forgets It takes two to tango
You are the girl
That I've been dreaming of
Ever since I was a little girl
You are the girl
That I've been dreaming of
Ever since I was a little girl
One!
I'm biting my tongue!
Two!
He's kissin' on you!
Three!
Oh, why can't you see?
One two three four!
The word's on the streets and it's on the news
I'm not gonna teach him how to dance with you
He's got two left feet and he bites my moves
I'm not gonna teach him how to dance, dance, dance!
The second I do, I know we're gonna be through
I'm not gonna teach him how to dance with you
Suspects a thing but I wish I didn't do
I'm not gonna teach him how to dance, dance, dance!
You are the girl
That I've been dreaming of
Ever since I was a little girl
You are the girl
That I've been dreaming of
Ever since I was a little girl
One!
I'm biting my tongue!
Two!
He's kissin' on you!
Three!
Oh, why can't you see?
One two three four!
The word's on the streets and it's on the news
I'm not gonna teach him how to dance with you
He's got two left feet and he bites my moves
I'm not gonna teach him how to dance, dance, dance!
The second I do, I know that we'll be through
I'm not gonna teach him how to dance with you
I suspect a thing, I wish I didn't do
I'm not gonna teach him how to dance, dance, dance!
You are the girl
That I've been dreaming of
Ever since I was a little girl
You are the girl
That I've been dreaming of
Ever since I was a little girl
You are the girl
That I've been dreaming of
Ever since I was a little girl
You are the girl
That I've been dreaming of
Ever since I was a little girl
Southern trees bear strange fruit
Blood on the leaves
Blood at the roots
Black bodies swinging in the southern breeze
Strange fruit hanging from the poplar trees
Pastoral scene of the gallant south
The bulging eyes and the twisted mouth
The scent of magnolia sweet and fresh
Then the sudden smell of burning flesh
Here is a fruit for the crows to pluck
For the rain to gather
For the wind to suck
For the sun to rot
For the tree to drop
Here is a strange and bitter crop
As the sun sets on another day
All the memories will never fade away
Looking back to all those moments that we shared
Where it all began with all those dreams we dared
We leave with no regrets - we will never forget
We'll play on till the end
It's not over not over my friends
We are together tonight
Reunited for all of our lives
And we thank you for it all
We will never forget
When the dark skies came along to test our steel
We came together showed the world just how we feel
So remember this
We can never fall
In our hearts we're all for one and one for all
So now we will rejoice
Tonight with one voice
We'll play on till the end
It's not over not over my friends
We are together tonight
Reunited for all of our lives
And we thank you for it all
We will never forget
In our hearts and in our minds
We know we can't leave this behind
In our hearts and in our soul
You know we'll never be alone
As we relive the best times of our lives
You were there for us and stood right by our sides
Yes we know that all good things come to an end
This is just farewell and not goodbye my friends
And we thank you for it all
We will never forget
We will play on till the end
It's not over - not over my friends
We are together tonight
Reunited for all of our lives
And we thank you for it all
We will never forget
Take me for the rose I am
Lay yourself in my bed again
Showered and covered
In petals of red 
Are you lonely?
Are you lonely?
Blame me for the thorns my friend
Does the pain outweigh the blessing?
Showered and covered
In petals of red 
Are you lonely?
Are you lonely? 
Go slow
And I will cover you
Go slow 
But you left me high and wild
You left me high and wild 
Take me for the rose I am 
Lay yourself in my bed again 
Showered and covered
In petals of red
Instrumental
Thou mighty gulf, insatiate cormorant
Deride me not, thought I seem petulant
To fall into thy chops. Let others pray
For ever their fair poems flourish may.
But as for me, hungry oblivion
Devour me quick, accept my orison
My earnest prayers
Which do importune thee,
With gloomy shade of thy still empery,
My earnest prayers
Which do importune thee,
To vail both me and my poesy
Far worthier lines in silence of thy state
Do sleep securely free from love or hate,
From which this living near can be exempt
But whilst it breathes
Will hate and fury tempt
Then close his eyes
With thy all-dimming hand,
Which not right actions can withstand (2x)
Peace, hateful tongues
I now in silent pace
Unless some hounds
Do wake me from my place
Then close his eyes
With thy all-dimming hand,
Which not right actions can withstand (2x)
I with this sharp, yet well meant poesy
Will sleep secure, right free from injury
I with this sharp, yet well meant poesy
Of cankered hate, or rankest villainy

Why don't you tell me what's wrong, baby? 
I'll do all I can. 
And if it's about where we're heading, 
Maybe, you have the wrong man. 
Cause' I can see for miles 
When the sun is up, 
But it's midnight and I can't see at all. 
It's so hard and I can't think at all. 
It's so hard and I don't think we're working out. 
If you ever got the time, darling. 
Why don't you give me a call. 
I just want to say I'm so sorry. 
I never knew it all. 
It's alright. 
We're so stupid and we're young. 
Love is blind, 
It was words that really stung.
(Mary applegate, roland grosch, bettina mischke, helfried wildenhain)
He smiles like a child
His gentleness flows and flows for miles
And if you look in his eyes
You'll see a thousand lost goodbyes
The honesty of love
Gathered up inside his mind
Is it desire that I want
That has me crossing over lines
If I could change my life
Would I dare to be alone
If I could change my life
How would it be to love and feel everything's the same
So soft in his ways
It calls me to his holy place
Seducing me to stay
Surrender till I must obey
But will it be enough
And will I ever take his name
Is it desire that I want
I can't go back the way I came
If I could change my life
Would I dare to be alone
If I could change my life
How would it be to love and feel everything's the same
If I could change my life
Would I dare to be alone
If I could change my life
How would it be to love and feel everything's the same
I can fly
But I want his wings
I can shine even in the darkness
But I crave the light that he brings
Revel in the songs that he sings
My angel Gabriel
I can love
But I need his heart
I am strong even on my own
But from him I never want to part
He's been there since the very start
My angel Gabriel
My angel Gabriel
Bless the day he came to be
Angel's wings carried him to me
Heavenly
I can fly
But I want his wings
I can shine even in the darkness
But I crave the light that he brings
Revel in the songs that he sings
My angel Gabriel
My angel Gabriel
My angel Gabriel
My angel Gabriel
My angel Gabriel
My angel Gabriel
My angel, my angel, my angel
Gabriel, Gabriel
Slow down the pace...
I have never known me this out of place
If stupid acting dumb
Is the shape of things to come
And I add up that sum
Then this is where I can't get back from...
Take my hand, I will follow
Only you can
Slow this down
Take my hand and I will mellow
'Cause only you can
Hold me like a torniquet...
And make me stay, here with you...
No ego left to bruise...
At least there's something good in most bad news
'Cause I just don't want to cruise
With anyone of all the young dudes
'Cause round for round,
Only uncool will travel on gravel ground...
So take my hand, I will follow
Only you can slow this down
Take my hand and I will mellow,
'Cause only you can slow this down
You can slow this down
So take my hand, I will follow
'Cause only you can slow this down
You take my hand and I will mellow
'Cause only you can
Slow this down...
You can slow this down...
Take my hand, I will follow
'Cause only you can
Slow this down
Take my hand and I will mellow
'Cause only you can
Hold me like a torniquet...
And make me stay...
Here with you...
Tried to clean up
The hazy window
That got steamed up
Tried to call you
And I knew too well
You could not hear me
And I knew too well
You could not see me
You left the platform
In opposite direction
I'd missed again
Any word of affection
And where the rails end
There's no more denying
And when the sun dies
There's no more denying
Oh my love
Now the days are gone
Oh my love
We've been waiting too long
Whatever road to take
I'll hesitate and
Although far too late
Will try to wait and
The word frozen on
My lips and
The bloom closes its
Open calyx and
You left the platform
In opposite direction
I'd missed again
Any word of affection
And where the rails end
There's no more denying
And when the sun dies
There's no more denying
Oh my love
Now the days are gone
Oh my love
We've been waiting far too long
You left the platform
In opposite direction
I'd missed again
Any word of affection
And where the rails end
There's no more denying
And when the sun dies
There's no more denying
Oh my love
We've been waiting far too long
Oh my love
We've been waiting far too long
Oh my love
Now the days are gone
Will I ever learn
How not to fear
What has to be
Can it be
Will I ever dare
With no despair
To recognize
A joy so pure
See everything
See it all come true, come true
Come to you
Feel everything
Feel it all come true, come true
Come to you
Easily
You say to me
Every day is new
The chances few
Don't forget
Don't ask me why
I hesitate
When morning comes
The truth is clear
See everything
See it all come true, come true
Come to you
Feel everything
Feel it all come true, come true
Come to you
Easily
Will I ever learn
A joy so pure
Will I ever learn
A joy so pure
Don't leave me now, we haven't even met yet
Don't even talk, I'd be glad to guess your name
It's just two of us here, or maybe just a few more
But it's just you and me, baby, if you wanna play this game
Just pretend that you know me baby
I'll treat you like you really do
Just pretend that you know me baby
I can't pull myself back from you
Baby, just pretend
We can deja vu backwards, baby, make it seem like a trip
That I could later take you on, like I might've before
And if they ask what you're doing here, look over at me, baby
Then they're gonna know now what never happened for sure
Just pretend that you know me baby
I'll treat you like you really do
Just pretend that you know me baby
I can't pull my self back from you
Baby, just pretend
I've been thinking about you now
For fifteen minutes and change
I feel like I've known you forever, baby
You can read my mind, I don't have to explain why it
Feels like a strong bond, I know you feel it, too
Let's tell the world what we're feeling now
Baby, you'll know what to do
Just pretend that you know me baby
I'll treat you like you really do
Just pretend that you know me baby
I think I'm falling in like with you
Baby, just pretend
When the years have gone by and
We're still clicking like bubble wrap
We can clink our glasses still being entwined
And if find that
My eyes look distant like you never really knew me
I'll tell you what do, then, if you're inclined
Just pretend that you know me baby
I'll treat you like you really do
Just pretend that you know me baby
I can't pull myself back from
Baby, just pretend
Baby, just pretend
Well baby, there you stand
With your little head down in your hand
Oh my God, you can't believe
It's happening again
Your baby's gone, and you're all alone
And it looks like the end
And you're back out on the street
And you're trying to remember, oh
How do you start it over
You don't know if you can
You don't care much for a stranger's touch
But you can't hold your man
You never thought you'd be alone
This far down the line
And I know what's been on your mind
You're afraid it's all been wasted time
The autumn leaves have got you thinking
About the first time that you fell
You didn't love the boy too much
No, no, you just loved the boy too well
So you live from day to day
And you dream about tomorrow
And the hours go by like minutes
And the shadows come to stay
So you take a little something
To make them go away
And I could have done so many things, baby
If I could only stop my mind
From wondering what I left behind
And from worrying 'bout this wasted time
(Ooh) Another love has come and gone
(Ooh) And the years keep rushing on
I remember what you told me
Before you went out on your own
"Sometimes to keep it together
You got to leave it alone"
So you can get on with your search, baby
And I can get on with mine
And maybe someday we will find
That it wasn't really wasted time
A sight for sore eyes to the blind would be awful majestic
It would be the most beautiful thing that they ever had seen
It would cause such surprise, it would make all of their minds electric
How could anyone tell them that some things are not what they seem?
In such disbelief I thought I was asleep when I met you
My heart liquefied and I sighed, "Oh, this must be a dream"
If I forget to set the alarm and sleep on through the dawn don't remind me
I'd rather be dreaming of someone than living alone
If you're searching the lines for a point, well you've probably missed it
There was never anything there in the first place

Don't be afraid when you
Walk through the dark
Just when you feel that
Your day fell apart
Stay strong
Keep holding on
Clear skies ahead and the dark day is done
Keep on lifted
Keep on lifted
I wish you everything
That you could want
Just when the day finds you
Turned back to front
Stay clear
Rescue is near
When you feel
That you're drowned in despair
Keep on lifted
Keep on lifted
You're a bird in the sky now baby
Earthbound
Feet on the ground
Now you can find peace at last
Now you can find peace at last

I have a little house*
Close to town but not to the city
Far from home but near my family
No water views but so close to the sea
I see, this is how my little life could be
And I'm filling it with things
Like furniture that I find on the street
And all the special things I'd like to eat
Pictures of people that I'd like to meet, oh meet
Well I'm orbiting the world
And it's so pretty and so lonely
My little love affairs are all scheduled 'round the TV guide
And my sex life has all been plagiarized
In an attempt to meet a harsh deadline
I'd like to rent a wife 
Then rent a husband to keep her for life
The three of us, we could be so happy
Then with each other, meet with company
I'll see them, I'll find a flight around the world
And it's so pretty and so lonely
I could just die, I might just die
I could just die, I might just die
And at my funeral
They will say "Tom, he was such a nice guy,
He went too early but he went in style"
They'll play my music and then they will cry
Then they'll have a little wake
They'll drink bad wine and they'll eat lemon cake
And my mothers little heart will break 
And she'll say "Wait there must be must some mistake.
He can't be dead, take me instead"
Oh but I'm not dead
They tell me I'm not dead
They say that I'm not dead
That I won't die for some time
I'm in my little house
Just writing little songs to past the time
Which incidentally is 7:49
So don't you worry I'm completely fine, I'm fine
And don't you worry I'm completely fine, I'm fine
Don't you worry I'm completely fine, I'm fine
Don't you worry I'm completely fine, I'm fine
Don't you worry I'm completely fine, I'm fine
I'm just so fucking fine.
Maybe I'm still hurting
I can't turn the other cheek
But you know that I still love you
It's just that I can't speak
I looked for you in everyone
And they called me on that too
I lived alone but I was only
Coming back to you 
Ah they're shutting down the factory now
Just when all the bills are due
And the fields they're under lock and key
Tho' the rain and the sun come through
And springtime starts but then it stops
In the name of something new
And all the senses rise against this
Coming back to you 
And they're handing down my sentence now
And I know what I must do
Another mile of silence while I'm
Coming back to you 
There are many in your life
And many still to be
Since you are a shining light
There's many that you'll see
But I have to deal with envy
When you choose the precious few
Who've left their pride on the other side of
Coming back to you 
Even in your arms I know
I'll never get it right
Even when you bend to give me
Comfort in the night
I've got to have your word on this
Or none of it is true
And all I've said was just instead of
Coming back to you
Saddled up and alive
But not the strength to go anywhere
And this sickening sky
Never clears up above our heads
We must be getting old
Nothing is new
Few emotions are shown
Their face beaten and blue
I'm, not inclined to meet anyone
I tried, but the walls are too thick, too high
I know, all too well
I'm bound, bound to fail
Uptight when I look at your changing ways
I try not to seem too depressed these days
But silence arrives
And it tears down my guise
We could have danced all night
Into the morning light
In that cheap penny arcade
We could have danced all night
Into the morning light
In that cheap penny arcade
But fate is cruel sometimes,
Yes fate is so unkind
In the games
That it plays
Yes fate is cruel sometimes,
Yes fate is so unkind
In to the games of
The games of
That it plays
So now I stand beside
Beside your graveside
And I cry
I cry everyday and so till time does heal every scar
And weal I will cry every day
Until time does heal
Evey scar and weal
I will cry everyday
She's got a moulding
Of her left hand
And she holds it to her chest
Trying to feel
The pulsations
Trying to quiet the unrest
That's taking place
It's taking place
Behind the armour of
Her smiling face
She wants a moulding
Of her features
Of her face and of her feet
Sometimes she says
She wants a double
Made of stone or of concrete
To take her place
To take her place
Then she could disappear
Without a trace
The have nots have had enough and now they're out to kill the king
Of what looks to be an evil empire where short-term earnings mean everything
There's a pressure to deliver here, your gonna get hurt if you don't play this game
Nobody will ever know, just the CEO to the CFO
If you can work some magic, we can double our paychecks, so make the #s look right
Wall street is a ruthless mistress with a quick and painful judgment
Temptation is in deep now, threads of greed run through this fabric
Weaving tapestries over your eyes to prepare the landscapes for disaster
Anthrax or a plane crash, biochemical, or even nuclear attacks
Integrity is too damn expensive, discount the price but still
Nobody's buying so come up with the money boys or you'll be chocking on a barrel
And it just might be your own finger squeezing on the trigger
Call in the reinforcements
You're working hard on a life of your own
Three square meals and a place to call home
The American dream can be found here if you keep your mouth closed
But the teeth you keep clenched is what's killing the chance
Your mouth is watering as you imagine
Swallowing each new possession
Its building a prison
You'll think there's a place where you made it
You searched for this your whole life
New answers will satisfy but then you realize it's never enough
That's the slickest marketing I've ever seen - a spiraling trap
With enough ambition and a firm set of rules you can have anything you want
You can walk right out into the world and capture and kill god
In a little box or a little book to be understood
But no one can argue with the good sense and strength of a solid foundation
Or with the weakness born when corruption is the rule and not the exception
I'm trying hard to forget everything I thought I knew
You've climbed much too high to let the truth stop you now
Or to concern yourself with the investments of
It's quiet simple when I'm listening
You keep leading me all the way home
These messages you've been offering
As a magical child
An essential child
It hinges on the driver's seat
It depends on who's in control
When I waver on the attuning
I kill a magical child
This essential child
Oh
To thine own self be true
To my core self be true
When direction is confounding
When vitality is far gone
When the spark is out, uninspiring
I call the magical child
The essential child
Oh
To thine own self be true
To my core self be true
When I'm lost and I'm unraveling
When I'm off my track and I float
When I need true north and some grounding
I call the magical child
The essential child
This angelic child
This innocent child
To thine own self be true
To my core self, be true
Angelic child
Innocent child
Magical child
Essential child
My funny Valentine
Sweet comic Valentine
You make me smile with my heart
Your looks are laughable
Unphotographable
Yet you're my fav'rite work of art
Is your figure less than Greek
Is your mouth a little weak
When you open it to speak
Are you smart?
Don't change a hair for me
Not if you care for me
Stay little Valentine
Stay!
Each day is valentine's day
Is your figure less than Greek
Is your mouth a little weak
When you open it to speak
Are you smart?
Don't change a hair for me
Not if you care for me
Stay little Valentine
Stay, oh stay!
Each day is valentine's day
Well at least can't you 
Look at me when I'm speaking to you? 
Because there are things I've got to say 
Well what was he sneaking to you 
When you thought I'd looked away? 
I get it, I get it 
Now I understand just what you're playing 
I get it, I get it 
I guess there isn't any point delaying 
You would rather that I wasn't here 
You don't have to say a word, it's crystal clear 
You bought him presents with my money 
That makes me feel just great, although 
I've got to say that it is kind of funny 
That you could think I'd never know 
I get it, I get it
It was just another way of saying 
I get it, I get it 
That you really didn't want me staying 
Oh I bet you just wish that I'd disappear 
You don't have to say a word, it's crystal clear 
Lying in my bed 
You remember when 
It was you who said 
That we'd never be apart again 
But now the longer that I hang around 
The more anxious that you get 
Oh it looks like Romeo has found 
A nervous Juliet 
Because you would rather that I wasn't here 
You don't have to say a word, it's crystal clear 
Oh I bet you just wish that I'd disappear 
You don't have to say a word, it's crystal clear
Instrumental
No drink, no drugs, no cigarettes, no loose women because I'm weak
That's all fine for you to say, but I'm too shy to even speak
I can't go out in the world without a little fire in my soul
That puts a fight into me, you push me and I just can't let it roll, roll
I don't know if I should drink or stay at home alone
Keeping out of trouble, never learning nothing
When I don't know I'm alive, give me fire
I don't know whether to drink or stay at home alone
Keeping out of trouble, never doing nothing
When I don't know I'm alive
There was a time, don't you forget, when I was green and you were red
All boastful lies, no great surprise what shit comes out of my drunken head
I met a woman that night, she loved me for the stories that I told
But when the booze ran out my silence left her ring hand feeling cold, cold
I don't know if I should drink or stay at home alone
Keeping out of trouble, never learning nothing
When I don't know I'm alive, give me fire
I don't know whether to drink or stay at home alone
Keeping out of trouble, never doing nothing
When I don't know I'm alive, give me fire
No drinks, no drugs, no cigarettes
Nothing but silence caused by doubt
There was a good boy inside me
But the landlord tried to kick that good boy out, that good boy out
I don't know if I should drink or stay at home alone
Keeping out of trouble, never learning nothing
When I don't know I'm alive, give me fire
I don't know whether to drink or stay at home alone
Keeping out of trouble, never doing nothing
When I don't know I'm alive, give me fire
You give me fire, you give me fire
You give me fire, you give me fire
You give me fire, you give me fire
You give me fire, you give me fire
I don't know if I should drink or stay at home alone
Keeping out of trouble, never learning nothing
When I don't know I'm alive, give me fire
I don't know whether to drink or stay at home alone
Keeping out of trouble, never doing nothing
When I don't know I'm alive, give me fire

My attends to you
As a mother hears
While her children sleep
Now look
See how they're dreaming
The black reciter reads
While the children sleep
Don't go so
Deep in slumber
Where you'll shy
Know you'll wander
In sleep
Don't you fly
Too far away
Some men die
Without crying
Suffering so long
And alone
Softly, children
Dry your eyes
Gently, children
Be wise
My attends to you
As a mother hears
All her children's fears
So don't cry
All will wash away
When we pray
Soon
Soon
Soon
So if it's okay
I'll wait with you a while
The sun began to shine
Oh, look
Your wings are broken
But never a lie
Was spoken
The murdered thing
Is love, you see
Drifting on a bed
Of memory
Now sleep
Close your eyes
And have no fear
A wide blue sky
Is very near
Soon
Soon
Soon
Soon
Sleep
[My attends to you
As a mother hears
While her children fears
Sleep]
Thank you for leading me home that I 
May one day return to walk through those fields again
I buried a treasure and made a map 
So I'd always find my way back
I guess that don't matter now
Time has had a different effect on you 
Look at you you're blue black and through being that kid I knew 
Life is rich and ripe with
Thoughts unsung, and songs unheard
I'm telling our stories to myself 
I'm trying to make since of me and you
Summertime after our family broke
Was a turning point - so many things there to learn
Time has had a different effect on you 
Look at you you're blue black and through being that kid I knew
I hope it's not too late that I 
Tell you I love you and I always have
Mick Softley
Let me tell you the story of a soldier named Dan.
Went out to fight the good fight in South Vietnam,
Went out to fight for peace, liberty and all,
Went out to fight for equality, hope, let's go,
And the war drags on.
Found himself involved in a sea of blood and bones,
Millions without faces, without hope and without homes.
And the guns they grew louder as they made dust out of bones
That the flesh had long since left just as the people left their homes,
And the war drags on.
They're just there to try and make the people free,
But the way that they're doing it, it don't seem like that to me.
Just more blood-letting and misery and tears
That this poor country's known for the last twenty years,
And the war drags on.
Last night poor Dan had a nightmare it seems.
One kept occurring and re-occurring in his dream:
Cities full of people burn and scream and shoutin' loud
And right over head a great orange mushroom cloud.
And there's no more war,
For there's no more world,
And the tears come streaming down.
Yes, I lie crying on the ground.
Keine Angst, Du hast nichts mehr zu verliern'
Der Bumerang kommt nicht zurück zu Dir
Flieg jetzt los, bis hintern' Horizont
Es gibt nichts, was Dich am Boden hält bei mir
In Deinen Augen, seh ich das was mir wohl fehlt
Kaum zu glauben, wie der Wind sich für Dich dreht
Ich glaube fest, dass Du's alleine schaffst
Du hast hart trainiert und viel riskiert für Dich
Flieg jetzt los, immer weiter
Flieg bitte los, hier wartet keiner
Flieg jetzt los, immer weiter
Dreh Dich nicht um, hier wartet keiner
Es brennt in Dir
Ich verschwende Deine Zeit
Lass mich hier, ich bin noch nicht bereit
Und ich hol Dich ein, wenn mein Glück mich nicht verlässt
Ich werd mit Dir sein, an jedem Tag der kommt
Flieg jetzt los, immer weiter
Flieg bitte los, hier wartet keiner
Flieg jetzt los, immer weiter
Dreh Dich nicht um, hier wartet keiner
Dieses Schicksal trennt uns jetzt
Auch wenn uns das tief verletzt
Kann ich nichts mehr für uns tun
Nur bis hier in geht der Weg,
Der uns beiden offen steht
Du musst alleine weiter
Und hinter Dir, da wartet keiner
Flieg jetzt los, immer weiter
Flieg bitte los, hier wartet keiner
Flieg jetzt los, immer weiter
Dreh Dich nicht um, hier wartet keiner
Flieg jetzt los, immer weiter
Flieg bitte los, hier wartet keiner
Flieg jetzt los, immer weiter
Dreh Dich nicht um, hier wartet keiner
At the weekend
Face down
Teargas and barricades
Downtown
Ah
Seattle
D.C.
Gunships in Genoa
Not me
Anarchists
Tearin' up the Beltway
Molotovs
As if they knew
The right way
I promise not to tell
Build your coffin of balsa wood
Spend all that you earn
When you go you are gone for good
Never to return
Always to thine own self be true
Not to fools like me
Who'll change their minds
For the sake of rhyming schemes
Au revoir joi, bonjour tristesse
Good times come and go
Life owes nobody hapiness
Only pain and sorrow
So don't rely on the starry skies
Screw the universe
You'd ought to try to live your life on Earth
So au revoir joi, bonjour tristesse
Good times come and they go
This life owes nobody happiness
Only pain and sorrow
So don't rely on the starry skies
Screw the universe
You'd ought to try to live your life on earth
I'm gonna try to live my life on earth
Confusion rules this shifting age
And uproar fills the town
My thoughts of you are drowning in the noise
How could you know?
Why should you know me?
You gently nourish my dry skin
A drop of colour saves me from
The fate I'm facing everyday
A single bloom piercing the snowdrift
How softly, the springtime breezes sing
How deeply, the distant mountain breathe
There are so many things to show to you
Oh why does hate bring forth more hate?
A long abandoned fruit
Is hastening the process of decay
This country's starved, it's void of feeling
How softly, the springtime breezes sing
How deeply, the distant mountain breathe
There are so many things to show to you
One of these dayssdfsdfsdfsdfsdfsd
How softly, the springtime breezes sing
How deeply, the distant mountain breathe
There are so many things to show to you
I was blue, just as blue as I could be
Ev'ry day was a cloudy day for me
Then good luck came a-knocking at my door
Skies were gray but they're not gray anymore
Blue skies smiling at me
Nothing but blue skies do I see
Bluebirds singing a song
Nothing but bluebirds all day long
Never saw the sun shining so bright
Never saw things going so right
Noticing the days hurrying by
When you're in love, my how they fly
Blue days, all of them gone
Nothing but blue skies from now on
I should care if the wind blows east or west
I should fret if the worst looks like the best
I should mind if they say it can't be true
I should smile, that's exactly what I do
Lucky me
How bad could it be
To be alone for now
To be free
Oh, don't cry
The time, it passes by
Just think of what you'll get when you're past this
So is it all right if I go?
Is it all right if I go?
Oh, don't cry
Just think about the end
I'll find my best friend
At last
Lucky me
I'm ready for a ride
I'll jump off and take a drive
Today
So is it all right if I go?
Is it all right if I go?
Is it all right if I go?
Oh, don't cry
It's time to say goodbye.
So is it all right if I go?
Is it all right if I go?
Fingertips are all I have
Have you heard the sea?
The water's edge is all I have
Have you heard it breathe?
An endless sigh I cannot hear
Here I cease to run
Arid mouth so hard to speak
Speak? Cat got my tongue
Describe to me how I look
Look what I've become
Describe to me how I look
I'm not scared of dying
I'm not scared of death
I'll keep a smile 'til my last breath
I've loved 'til I've lost
I've lived how I felt
One day I will find peace within myself
Boyish grin, it bears me well
Where can I begin?
Don't forget I'm still around
How the wind feels free
Behind the smile I fade away
The wayward days are gone
I love this power
I love this power
I love this power that's crushed so easily
I love this power
I'm not scared of dying
I'm not scared of death
I'll keep a smile 'til my last breath
I've loved 'til I've lost
I've lived how I felt
One day I will find peace within myself
I want to take all the sadness
Of the world from your shoulders
I want to take all the sadness
Of the world from your shoulders
I want to take all the sadness
This desert road's forever winding
It saps your strength - it has no exit
The drying wind
The burning sun
I'm tossing the burnt out engine aside
Nanimo nai sekai de

Deixa
Fale quem quiser falar, meu bem
Deixa
Deixe o coração falar também
Porque ele tem razão
Demais quando se queixa
Então a gente deixa
Deixa, deixa, deixa
Ninguém vive mais do que uma vez
Deixa
Diz que sim prá não dizer talvez
Deixa
A paixão também existe
Deixa
Não me deixe ficar triste
I'm catching on to all the symptoms that you feign
Another shot of something, warm to numb the pain
Lets just be honest and admit we can't go on
You can begin to be yourself once I am gone
Your kiss was sweet like an apricot
I guess I'm the girl you thought
When you said this would never be undone
Your heart was pure like youth and all it's charms
Now my empty arms are of no use
To me or anyone
I always knew that you deserved much more than me
You are more interesting than I'll ever be
Somehow our whole world has gone spinning in reverse
I hope this heartache of mine won't get any worse
Your kiss was sweet like an apricot
I guess I'm the girl you thought
When you said this would never be undone
Your heart was pure like youth and all it's charms
Now my empty arms are of no use
To me or anyone
Will you forget the scent of violets on my skin
I'll never know the safety of your arms again
Elle se déhanche, s'avance, se penche
Rousse, provocante, elle te mate, elle te vampe!
Toi, tu sais déjà qu'il n'y aura plus qu'elle,
Son corps, sa voix qui t'ensorcellent.
Tu ne vois pas qu'elle t'épie, qu'elle te guette
Quand, avec d'autres, elle rit aux éclats.
Fatale, elle se pâme, t'alarme, te désarme,
S'appuie sur ton épaule, s'accroche à tes paroles.
Toi, tu crois déjà qu'elle chancelle et chavire
Quand, alanguie, elle frémit et soupire.
Tu ne comprends pas qu'elle est de celles qui charment
Avec leur corps, et sans leur âme.
Elle se déhanche, s'avance, se penche.
Frivole, elle papillonne, se pose et puis s'envole.
Toi, tu sens déjà ton coeur qui se lézarde ;
Tu donnerais tout pour qu'elle s'attarde!
Tu n'imagines pas qu'elle l'épie, qu'elle le guette
Quand, avec toi, elle rit aux éclats.
Toi, tu ne vois pas le piège
Qui f'ra voler ton coeur en éclats.
We are children of divorce
Spiritual mothers
Chemical fathers
Wish I learned to love you more
Lonesome brothers
Trustless daughters
We are children born of wars
Fought in places
For the faces
Where happiness is sold in stores
They'll keep you smiling
If you keep buying
But they can't take from you
Something inside you never knew
You always have too much to prove
And never have enough to lose
I seem to see everything you do
We are the unwritten scrolls
Background songs
For dialogues
Always wanting something more
To be the stars
The light shines on
But they can't take from you
Something inside you never knew
You have nothing to prove
And oh, you have so much to lose
I seem to see everything you do
There are times I can leave my heart wide open
There are days I believe I can heal wounds on me
There are times I could come to you and hurt you
I could easily bring you tears, I could send you to hell, I know you
I will find something more
Someone I am made for
Shame on you, baby
Forever yours
I will find something more
Someone I am made for
Shame on you, baby
Forever yours
You were mine and I was yours for one night
You were mine and there is no one who's like me
These screams, they wake me up in the night
They violently fill my room, they keep me awake, I hate you
I will find something more
Someone I am made for
Shame on you, baby
Forever yours
I will find something more
Someone I am made for
Shame on you, baby
Forever yours
I will find something more
Someone I am made for
Shame on you, baby
Forever yours
I will find something more
Someone I am made for
Shame on you, baby
Forever yours
(Forever yours...)
I will find something more
Someone I am made for
Shame on you, baby
Forever yours
I will find something more
Someone I am made for
Shame on you, baby
Forever yours
I will find something more
Someone I am made for
Shame on you, baby
Forever yours
Gone with the wind and home is far away from me
There's no one way to see
Haunted by ghosts the evil force of mystery
No way out for you and me
The end of the time, they're the end of the line
(They're) searching for the stars they couldn't find
The end of the time, they're the end of the line
(They're) searching for the stars they couldn't find
Oh, how much longer will they pay
For the sins of yesterday
With their flesh and their bone from dusk until dawn
They are searching for the temple of the holy
Fading and gone on the wings of the storm
They found shelter in the temple of the holy
Don't touch the magic wall, the sign of the crystal ball
See their faces in the mirror
They're the legions of the damned from an unholy land
Bringing fear and reign of terror
The end of the time, (they're) the end of the line
Searching for the stars they couldn't find
The end of the time, (they're) the end of the line
Searching for the stars they couldn't find
Oh, how much longer will they pay
For the sins of yesterday
With their flesh and their bone from dusk until dawn
They are searching for the temple of the holy
Fading and gone on the wings of the storm
Finding shelter in the temple of the holy
Oh, how much longer will they pay
For the sins of yesterday
With their flesh and their bone from dusk until dawn
They are searching for the temple of the holy
Fading and gone on the wings of the storm
Finding shelter in the temple of the holy
With their flesh and their bone from dusk until dawn
They are searching for the temple of the holy
Fading and gone on the wings of the storm
Finding shelter in the temple of the holy
"There must be some way out of here"
Said the joker to the thief
"There's too much confusion
I can't get no relief
Businessmen, they drink my wine
Plowmen dig my earth
None of them along the line
Know what any of it is worth"
"No reason to get excited"
The thief, he kindly spoke
"There are many here among us
Who feel that life is but a joke
But you and I, we've been through that
And this is not our fate
So let us not talk falsely now
The hour is getting late"
All along the watchtower
Princes kept their view
While all the women came and went
Barefoot servants, too
Outside in the distance
A wildcat did growl
Two riders were approaching
The wind began to howl
I couldn't find you
Last night for quite some time
Wishing to tell you
Everything running through my mind
We would have drove down
Over the bridge and towards the sea
Parking the sad car
In between 24th and 5th
I want to write a song about our love
But there is none
Still I continue
Driving the lonely road
My thoughts running over
Humming a sad forgotten song
Wasting all our time
That you're spending with someone else
Satiate my mind
And calm my nerves to look and find
Words that aren't enough
And never show a single piece of my mind
Night falls... am I dreaming?
The fears are toying with my head
And I'm swept away by the wind
And I can't fight them anymore...
Anymore.
Frantically, I run for my life
Oh, I'm faint with fear
Chase me down with your knife
And I don't want to die
Chase me down with your knife
Tears of pain and salt
Fall once again
Your twisted schemes
Scrape my mind with your hand
And I don't want to die
Chase me down with your knife
And I don't want to die
Chase me down with your knife
And I don't want to die
Chase me down with your knife
Sleep my little child and rest in me...
Sleep my little child and rest in me...
Sleep my little child and rest in me...
Angels falling through my hair
I want to leave them tomorrow
Angels falling through my hair
I want to meet them tomorrow
Gade kijan n'ap mache
Gade kijan n'ape cheche demen
Nou pa men'm gen couraj
Men l'anj-lan ap desann
Pou ba nou couraj
Pou'l ka ba nou fos
Pou nou ka travay
Lap ban nou fos
Pou nou ka rive jus kote nou parle
Angels falling through my hair
I wanna meet them tomorrow
Meet them falling through my hair
I want to meet them tomorrow
Menm si ou we ou pa we demen
Wap toujou rive byen lwen
Piga'w rete cheche
Mache, mache
Nap rive byen lwen
Paske nap we demen
Lap ba nou couraj
Pou'n ka we demen
Lap ban nou couraj
Pou nou ka cheche
Nan tout kote ke nou ale
Nape jwen tout sa'n cheche
Paske l'anj-lan...
Instrumental
It doesn't exist -
You live in regret
I remember the kiss when we first met
I remember the sting
As you finished me off -
And I remember my face when you stopped -
And said
Kid, please try harder while you can
'Cause I'm so tired of it all
With no command.
And I said
Please try harder while you can
I'm now required by love
To be in command.
You're stuck here with me
And I'm stuck here with you
We'll walk through it all -
Like we used to.
And the things you'd forget
When we live without fear
Ill broke on the road -
And I'll be here, singing
Kid, please try harder while you can
'Cause I'm so tired of it all
And all your plans.
Can you please try harder while you can
I'm now required by love
To hold your hands.
You've been flashing white light
From the palms on your hands
You were ready to fight -
Or to land.
You're so easily led
You didn't know how to dance
So that's all you want
From romance.
(Well then, Kid)
Please try harder while you can
'Cause I'm so tired of a love
With all your plans
I said
Please try harder while you can
I'm now required by the law
To hold your hand.
(Can you try?)
(C'mon, try)
(C'mon, try)
(Can we try?)
(Could you try?)
Could you try?
You were flashing white light
From the palms of your hands
You were ready to fight -
Or to land.
You're so easily led
You didn't know how to dance
But if that's all you want
If this is all you want -
From romance.
La Vanité, ce n'est qu'un mot
Mais c'est le pire de tes défauts
Le seul que je ne supporte pas
Le seul qui m'éloigne de toi
Celui qui me fait dire tout bas
Quelques fois
A mi voix
La Vanité est un péché
Je voudrais tellement t'empêcher
De tout gâcher, de gâcher ça
De tout briser d'un geste las
De remiser au débarras
L'amour fou
Qui rend fou
Reines et rois
La Vanité est une offense
A l'âme perdue
De l'enfance
A mon intelligence ou pas
Peu m'importe le résultat
Il n'est pas
Digne de toi
La Vanité vue sous cet angle
N'est pas la main qui nous étrangle
Juste le soleil qui tournoie
Lorsqu'on voudrait qu'il reste droit
Mais í la longue on s'aperçoit
Qu'elle fissure
Le futur
Délicat
Instrumental
Light sleeper
Easy dreamer
Do you dream of me
When I'm far away
Do I drift further every day
When I drink my rivers, drag my feet, and drown in my dreams
It's not as bad as it seems.
Dig deeper
Daylight dreamer
I'll try to dream of you
When you're
Far away
When you seem further every day
I'll drink my rivers, drag my feet, and drown in my dreams
It's not as bad as it seems.
Light sleeper
Easy dreamer
When you dream of me
Am I far away
Do I inch closer every day
Do I drink my rivers, drag my feet, and drown in my dreams
Is it as bad as it seems?
Concentric circles
Forever closing in
Another travesty
That never should have been
The latest entry
On an ever-growing list
And yet you never change your ways
Your denial still persists
Run away, run away
Run away from the setting sun
Run away, run away
Run away from the things you've done
With accusing fingers
You jut into the air
To single out the ones
You blame for your despair
But the mirror's broken
No reflection can it afford
Only scattered glances
Of its pieces on the floor
Run away, run away
Run away from the setting sun
Run away, run away
Run away from the things you've done
The ground beneath you
Will crumble into dust
The breath to forms your words
Will never fill your lungs
And as your senses dull
A thought enters your mind
"I'm that one who caused all this
There was no one else this time"
Run away, run away
Run away from the setting sun
Run away, run away
Run away from the things you've done

It's not very far from Sulphur to Sugarcane
Everywhere I travel the pretty girls call my name
I give them a squeeze and they shoot me a wink
I buy their hard-headed husbands a long cool drink
You better come up smelling sweet 'cause you're a long time stinking
It's a little too late to complain
It's not very far from Sulphur to Sugarcane
Now if you catch my eye and you find that it runs down your leg
It's like striking a match pretty hard upon a powder keg
They tell you from the borders to the waters of the gulf
If you take all the sugar you will end up in the sulphur
And you're burning
Hello baby I'm pleased to meet you
I wouldn't do you wrong, honey
I wouldn't cheat you, honey
When can I see you again?
Wrap you up in cellophane
It's not very far from Sulphur to Sugarcane
It's not very far from Sulphur to Sugarcane
When your eyes fill up with brine
'Cause you're drowning in wine
It's like the last days of Rome
With the despots and divine
And there's no place like home for a little doll from China
It's a little too late to complain
It's not very far from Sulphur to Sugarcane
You can go west to Texas
Go east to Mississippi
You can run out of money
You can run out of pity
Throw open your purse until you're crying for mercy
Go to Alabama
Escape Louisiana
I'm digging like a miner North and South Carolina
And then if you continue you will end up in Virginia
The women in Poughkeepsie
Take their clothes off when they're tipsy
But in Albany, New York
They love the filthy way I talk
Until they gargle with the finest champagne
They can't get the grape and the grain
It's not very far from Sulphur to Sugarcane
It's not very far from Sulphur to Sugarcane
If I could find a piano
Here in Bloomington, Indiana
I would play it with my toes
Until the girls all take their clothes off
The women knock upon my door in odd and even numbers
But none of them as wild as I've discovered in Columbus
I gave up married women 'cause I heard it was a sin
But now I'm back in Pittsburgh, I might take it up again
Because they gargle with the finest champagne
They can't get the grape and the grain
It's not very far from Sulphur to Sugarcane
It's not very far from Sulphur to Sugarcane
Up in Syracuse
I was falsely accused
But I'm not here to hurt you
I'm here to steal your virtue
Down in Bridgeport
The women will kill you for sport
But in Worcester, Massachusetts
They love my sauce
The women in Poughkeepsie
Take their clothes off when they're tipsy
But I hear in Ypsilanti
They don't wear any panties
Once they gargle with the finest champagne
They hitch up their skirts and exclaim
It's not very far, sugar
It's not very far, sugar
Pour a little sugar on me, sugar
It's not very far from Sulphur to Sugarcane
Oh in this day
Show me the ocean
When shall I see the sea?
May this day
Set me in motion
I ought to be on my way
We were there
We were sailing on the Terra Nova
Sailing for the setting sun
Sailing for the new horizon
May this day
Show me an ocean
I ought to be on my way
Ought to be on my way right now
Stepping on the boat
With a lump in my throat
On my way right now
I got a letter from a dear friend of mine
Story of a spirits well awakening
She spoke of her love returning in time
She let me know that she'd be waiting
I should be on my way by now
Walking cross the floor
Reaching for the door
On my way by now
But here I sit
Country fool that I am
Elbow on my knee
And my chin in my hand
My mind in the gutter
And my eye on the street
Whole up in a cave of concrete
And I ought to be on my way right now
Packin' my things
While the telephone rings
On my way right now
I miss my lovely mother
And I love my lonely father
I know I owe my brothers
One thing and another
I hear my sister singing
I ought to be on my way right now
Moving cross the land
With my heart in my hand
On my way By now
Ought to be on my way by now
Oh in this day
Set me in motion
Ought to be on my way
You say you got a heavy heart
You say you got a heavy heart
You say you got a heavy heart
And its hard for you to start
Carrying your heavy old home
You say you got a heavy load
You say you got a heavy load
You say you got a heavy load
Walking down the road
Carrying your heavy old heart
And you sure don't know, where you're going
Sure don't know, where you're going
Sure don't know, where you're going
But I say
The sun don't know, when its glowing
The flower don't know, when its growing
The river don't know, when its flowing
You're doing better than you know
You're doing better than you know
Prendre l'air, parler à quelqu'un
Avoir l'air d'aller plutôt bien
Déjeuner, y penser au moins
Tenir, tenir, tenir debout et demain
Décoller de mon traversin
Faire une liste de trucs qui vont bien
M'y tenir, essayer au moins
Tenir, tenir, tenir debout et demain
Prendre un thé, et puis prendre un bain
Me coiffer, essayer au moins
Balancer tout ces vieux machins
Tenir, tenir, tenir debout et demain
Plus de chocs, et plus de prières
Moins de clopes, plus de somnifères
Refaire la chose que je préfère
Tenir, tenir, tenir debout et demain
Appeler quelqu'un qui m'aime bien
L'étonner, changer de refrain
L'inviter, manger plus ou moins
Tenir, tenir, tenir debout et demain
Mettre une robe, saluer le voisin
Essayer de plaire à quelqu'un
M'amuser de tout et de rien
Tenir, tenir, tenir debout et demain
Prendre l'air, parler à quelqu'un
Avoir l'air d'aller plutôt bien
Déjeuner, y penser au moins
Tenir, tenir, tenir debout et demain
A Woman's Heart
From Quiet Revolution
By Chris de Burgh
Year Released: 1999
A woman's heart is filled with passion,
A woman's heart is filled with lust,
If you don't believe that these things happen,
Could be the biggest mistake that a man can make;
A woman's night is filled with dreaming,
Of the perfect man who may not be you,
If we don't see what she's been missing,
Could be the biggest mistake that a man can make,
She wants to get near to you,
Don't turn her away,
She wants to get through to you,
She wants to say;
Give me your night,
And I will show you my passion,
Give me your lust,
And I will drink you dry,
Give me your dreams,
And I will show you a lover,
Give me your heart,
And I will hold you close,
And I will love you till the day I die.
A woman's day is filled with longing,
For a little romance and company,
If we don't look or just don't listen,
Could be the biggest mistake that a man can make;
A woman's heart is yours forever,
She will be true, to the one in her life,
If we don't give her love and affection,
Could be the biggest mistake, that a man can make.
She wants to get near to you,
Don't turn her away,
She want's to get through to you,
She want's you to say;
Give me your night,
And I will show you my passion,
Give me your lust,
And I will drink you dry...
Give me your dreams,
And I will show you a lover,
Give me your heart,
And I will hold you close,
And I will love you till the day I die.
She wants to get near to you,
Don't turn her away,
She want's to get through to you,
She want's you to say,
Give me your night
And I will show you my passion,
Give me your lust,
And I will drink you dry...
Give me your dreams,
And I will show you a lover,
Give me your heart,
And I will hold you close,
And I will love you till the day I die.
Although I miss you
I know you had to go
I know you had to leave me standing
But I still miss you
I just need you to know
I just wish you could hear me singing
It turned this boy into a man
When you banged out the last beat on your drum
I held your hand
I kissed your hair
When we said goodbye
I miss you, think of you everyday
I hear the words you'd say ringing in my ears
And I can feel you in every single bone
I'll never be alone, no matter where I go
Because this boy is now a man,
And I understand for that you had to go
I guess it's true, what they all say
But it broke my heart
And I miss you
I miss you
I miss you
I miss you
I miss you
I miss you
I wish you were here
I wish you were here
I wish you could hear me singing
Blue light of morning palm trees in rows 
The end of my affair with the west coast
I was already dressed when she opened her mouth 
And decided to give up the ghost 
Helicopters the coast guard and radar screens 
The haunted and lonely technology 
I'll cut all my ties with the dead and the dying 
I have been wasting my time
In need of a substance to steady my hands
I'm gonna make the most of this day's plans 
Falling in love with the shivering engines 
Falling in love with the prettiest sound 
I'm on your side
Behind the frontlines 
A tear in the fabric that no one could see 
But your heart was always unraveling 
I gathered the twine as it trailed from behind 
Collected it all in my coat
The Pacific Ocean you claim as your own 
The vineyard the graveyard the grapes and the bones
Falling in love with the weight of the water 
Falling in love with the taste of the ghost 
I'm on your side 
Behind the frontlines 
On drugs in the dark with the one I love 
That my friends is where I wish I was
Tied up in twine with the dead and the dying 
And dragging back home under her control
She's looking for someone to settle her debts 
And I always settle for the silhouettes
Falling in love with some back lighted stranger
Falling in love and going into the red 
I'm on your side
Behind the frontlines
E se vai all'Hotel Supramonte e guardi il cielo
Tu vedrai una donna in fiammme e un uomo solo
E una lettera vera di notte falsa di giorno
E poi scuse accuse e scuse senza ritorno
E ora viaggi ridi vivi o sei perduta
Nel tuo ordine discreto dentro il cuore
Ma dove, dov'è il tuo amore
Ma dove è finito il tuo amore.
Grazie al cielo ho una bocca per bere e non è facile
Grazie a te ho una barca da scrivere ho un treno da perdere
E un invito all'Hotel Supramonnte dove ho visto la neve
Sul tuo sorpo così dolce di fame così dolce di sete
Passerà anche questa stazione senza far male
Passerà questa pioggia sottile come passa il dolore
Ma dove, dov'è il tuo cuore
Ma dove è finito il tuo cuore.
E ora siedo sul letto del bosco che ormai ha il tuo nome
Ora il tempo è un signore distratto è un bambino che dorme
Ma se ti svegli e hai ancora paura ridammi la mano
Cosa importa se sono caduto se sono lontano
Perché domani sarà un giorno lungo e senza parole
Perché domani sarà un giorno incerto di nuvole e sole
Ma dove, dov'è il tuo amore
Ma dove è finito il tuo amore.

�?Someway, baby, it's part of me, apart from me"
You're laying waste to Halloween
You fucked it friend, it's on it's head, it struck the street
You're in Milwaukee, off your feet
And at once I knew I was not magnificent
Strayed above the highway aisle
Jagged vacance, thick with ice
For I could see for miles, miles, miles
3rd and Lake it burnt away, the hallway
Was where we learned to celebrate
The automatic bought the years you'd talk for me
That night you played me ?�Lit Parade??
Not the needle, nor the thread, the lost decree
Saying nothing, that's enough for me
And at once I knew I was not magnificent
Hulled far from the highway aisle
Jagged vacance, thick with ice
For I could see for miles, miles, miles
Christmas night, it clutched the light
The hallow bright
Above my brother, I and tangled spines
We smoked the screen to make it what it was to be
Now to know it in my memory
And at once I knew I was not magnificent
High above the highway aisle
Jagged vacance, thick with ice
For I could see for miles, miles, miles
A vial of hope and a vial of pain
In the light they both looked the same
Poured them out on into the world
On every boy and every girl
It's in the neon bible, the neon bible
Not much chance for survival if the neon bible is right
Take the poison of your age
Don't lick your fingers when you turn the page
What I know is what you know is right
In the city it's the only light
It's in the neon bible, the neon bible
Not much chance for survival if the neon bible is right
Oh, God, well, look at you now
Oh, you lost it but you don't know how
In the light of a golden calf
Oh, God, I had to laugh
Take the poison of your age
Don't lick your fingers when you turn the page
It was wrong but you said it was right
In the future I will read at night
In the neon bible, the neon bible
Not much chance for survival if the neon bible is true...
You may tire of me as our December sun is setting
'Cause I'm not who I used to be 
No longer easy on the eyes
But these wrinkles masterfully disguise 
The youthful boy below
Who turned your way and saw 
Something he was not looking for
Both a beginning and an end 
But now he lives inside someone he does not recognize 
When he catches his reflection on accident 
On the back of a motor bike 
With your arms outstretched trying to take flight 
Leaving everything behind 
But even at our swiftest speed
We couldn't break from the concrete 
In the city where we still reside 
And I have learned that even landlocked lovers yearn
For the sea like navy men 
'Cause now we say goodnight
From our own separate sides
Like brothers on a hotel bed
Like brothers on a hotel bed
Like brothers on a hotel bed
Like brothers on a hotel bed
You may tire of me as our December sun is setting
'Cause I'm not who I used to be
In a foreign place, the saving grace was the feeling
That it was her heart that he was stealing
Oh, he was ready to impress and the fierce excitement
The eyes are bright, he couldn't wait to get away
And I bet that Juliet was just the icing on the cake
Make no mistake, no
And even if somehow he could have shown you the place you wanted
Well, I'm sure you could have made it that bit better on your own
And I bet she told a million people that she'd stay in touch
But all the little promises, that don't mean much
When there's memories to be made
And I hope you're holding hands by New Year's Eve
They made it far too easy to believe
That true romance can't be achieved these days
And even if somehow they could have shown you the place you wanted
Well, I'm sure you could have made it that bit better on your own
You are the only ones who know
Here come the sun king
Here come the sun king
Everybody's laughing
Everybody's happy
Here come the sun king
Quando para mucho mi amore de felice corazón
Mundo paparazzi mi amore chicka ferdy parasol
Cuesto obrigado tanta mucho que canite carousel
Sleight of hand
Jump off the end
Into a clear lake
No one around
Just dragonflies
Fly to the side
No one gets hurt
You've done nothing wrong
Slide your hand
Jump off the end
The water's clear
And innocent
The water's clear
And innocent
Something always brings me back to you
It never takes too long
No matter what I say or do
I'll still feel you here 'til the moment I'm gone
You hold me without touch
You keep me without chains
I never wanted anything so much
Than to drown in your love and not feel your rain.
Set me free, leave me be
I don't want to fall another moment into your gravity
Here I am and I stand so tall
Jjust the way I'm supposed to be
But you're on to me and all over me
You loved me 'cause I'm fragile
When I thought that I was strong
But you touch me for a little while
And all my fragile strength is gone
Set me free, leave me be
I don't want to fall another moment into your gravity
Here I am and I stand so tall
Just the way I'm supposed to be
But you're on to me and all over me
I live here on my knees as I 
Try to make you see that you're
Everything I think I need here on the ground
But you're neither friend nor foe though I
Can't seem to let you go
The one thing that I still know is that you're keeping me down
Keeping me down
You're on to me, on to me and all over
Something always brings me back to you
It never takes too long
Cold, cold water surrounds me now
And all I've got is your hand
Lord, can you hear me now?
Lord, can you hear me now?
Lord, can you hear me now?
Or am I lost?
Love one's daughter
Allow me that
And I can't let go of your hand
Lord, can you hear me now?
Lord, can you hear me now?
Lord, can you hear me now?
Or am I lost?
Cold, cold water surrounds me now
And all I've got is your hand
Lord, can you hear me?
Lord, can you hear me now?
Lord, can you hear me?
Or am I lost?
Am I lost with you?
One... two...
Steal my heart... and hold my tongue
I feel my time... my time has come
Let me in... unlock the door
I never felt this way before
And the wheels just keep on turning
The drummer begins to drum
I don't know which way I'm going
I don't know which way I've come
Hold my head... inside your hands
I need someone... who understands
I need someone... someone who hears
For you I've waited all these years
For you I'd wait... 'til Kingdom Come
Until my day... my day is done
And say you'll come... and set me free
Just say you'll wait... you'll wait for me
In your tears... and in your blood
In your fire... and in your flood
I hear you laugh... I heard you sing
I wouldn't change a single thing
And the wheels just keep on turning
The drummers begin to drum
I don't know which way I'm going
I don't know what I've become
For you I'd wait... 'til kingdom come
Until my days... my days are done
Say you'll come... and set me free
Just say you'll wait... you'll wait for me
Just say you'll wait... you'll wait for me
Just say you'll wait... you'll wait for me
Speak to me in a language I can hear
Humor me before I have to go
Deep in thought I forgive everyone
As the cluttered streets greet me once again
I know I can't be late
Supper's waiting on the table
Tomorrow's just an excuse away
So I pull my collar up and face the cold
On my own
The earth laughs beneath my heavy feet
At the blasphemy in my old jangly walk
Steeple guide me to my heart and home
The sun is out and up and down again
I know I'll make it
Love can last forever
Graceful swans of never topple to the earth
And you can make it last forever
You can make it last forever
You can make it last
And for a moment I lose myself
Wrapped up in the pleasures of the world
I've journeyed here and there and back again
But in the same old haunts I still find my friends
Mysteries not ready to reveal
Your sympathies I'm ready to return
I'll make the effort
Love can last forever
Graceful swans of never topple to the earth
Tomorrow's just an excuse
Tomorrow's just an excuse
And you can make it last forever
You can make it last forever
You can make it last forever you
Forever you
Do you know where your heart is?
Do you think you can find it?
Or did you trade it for something, somewhere, better just to have it?
Do you know where your love is?
Do you think that you lost it?
You felt it so strong, but nothing's turned out how you want it
Well, bless my soul
You're a lonely soul
'Cause you won't let go of anything you hold
"Well, all I need is the air I breathe and a place to rest my head"
Do you know what your fate is?
Are you trying to shake it?
You're doing your best dance, your best look
You're praying that you'll make it
Well, bless my soul
You're a lonely soul
'Cause you won't let go of anything you hold
"Well, all I need is the air I breathe and a place to rest my head
(Say) All I need is the air I breathe and a place to rest my head"
Do you think you can find it?
Do you think you can find it?
Do you think you can find it better than you had it?
Do you think you can find it?
Do you think you can find it?
Do you think you can find it, yeah better than you had it? (better than you had it)
"(Say) All I need is the air I breathe and a place to rest my head
(Say) All I need is the air I breathe and a place to rest my head"
Do you know where the end is?
Do you think you can see it?
Well, until you get there, go on, go ahead and scream it
Just say...
Some days her shape in the doorway
Will speak to me, a bird's wing on the window
Sometimes I'll hear when she's sleeping
Her fever dream a language on her face
I want your flowers
Like babies want God's love
Or maybe as sure as
Tomorrow will come
Some days like rain on the doorstep
She'll cover me with grace in all she offers
Sometimes I'd like just to ask her
What honest words she can't afford to say
Like I want your flowers
Like babies want God's love
Or maybe as sure as
Tomorrow will come
I'm a fool for that shake in your thighs
I'm a fool for that sound in your sighs
I'm a fool for your belly
I'm a fool for you love
I wanna make this plain
Oh, I know you're faded
Mm, but stay, don't close your eyes
I wanna make this plain
Oh, I know you're faded
Mm, but stay, don't close your eyes
Caught in this pool held in your eyes
Caught like a fool without a line
We're in a natural spring
With this gentle sting between us
I wanna make this plain
Oh, I know you're faded
Mm, but stay, don't close your eyes
I wanna make this plain
Oh, I know you're faded
Mm, but stay, don't close your eyes
Ooh, stay open
Ooh, stay open
Stay open
Stay open
I wanna make this plain
Oh, I know you're faded
Mm, but stay, don't close your eyes
I wanna make this plain
Oh, I know you're faded
Mm, but stay, don't close your eyes
Stay open
Stay open
Stay open
Mm, stay open
Settle down with me
Cover me up
Cuddle me in
Lie down with me
Hold me in your arms
Your heart's against my chest
Lips pressed to my neck
I've fallen for your eyes
But they don't know me yet
And the feeling I forget
I'm in love now
Kiss me like you wanna be loved
Wanna be loved
Wanna be loved
This feels like I've fallen in love
Fallen in love
Fallen in love
Settle down with me
And I'll be your safety
You'll be my lady
I was made to keep your body warm
But I'm cold as, the wind blows
So hold me in your arms
My heart's against your chest
Your lips pressed to my neck
I've fallen for your eyes
But they don't know me yet
And the feeling I forget
I'm in love now
Kiss me like you wanna be loved
Wanna be loved
Wanna be loved
This feels like I've fallen in love
Fallen in love
Fallen in love
Yeah I've been feeling everything
From hate to love
From love to lust
From lust to truth
I guess that's how I know you
So hold you close
To help you give it up
So kiss me like you wanna be loved
Wanna be loved
Wanna be loved
This feels like I've fallen in love
Fallen in love
Fallen in love
So kiss me like you wanna be loved
Wanna be loved
Wanna be loved
This feels like I've fallen in love
Fallen in love
Fallen in love
In the tower above the earth, 
There is a view that reaches far 
Where we see the universe, 
I see the fire, I see the end. 
Seven miles above the earth, 
There is Emmanuel of mothers. 
With his sword, with his robe, 
He comes dividing man from brothers. 
In the tower above the earth, we built it for Emmanuel. 
In the powers of the earth, we wait until it rips and rips. 
In the tower above the earth, we built it for Emmanuel. 
Oh my mother, she betrayed us, but my father loved and bathed us. 
Still I go to the deepest grave, 
Where I go to sleep alone
I am wasted, losing time
I'm a foolish, fragile spine
I want all that is not mine
I want him but we're not right
In the darkness I will meet my creators
And they will all agree, that I'm a suffocator
I should go now quietly
For my bones have found a place to lie down and sleep
Where all my layers can become reeds
All my limbs can become trees
All my children can become me
What a mess I leave
To follow
To follow
To follow
To follow
In the darkness I will meet my creators
They will all agree, I'm a suffocator
Suffocator
Suffocator
Oh no
I'm sorry if I smothered you
I'm sorry if I smothered you
I sometimes wish I'd stayed inside
My mother
Never to come out
Say hello to the rug's topography
It holds quite a lot of interest with your face down on it
Say hello to the shrinking in your head
You can't see it, but you know it's there, so don't neglect it
I'm taking her home with me, all dressed in white
She's got everything I need; pharmacy keys
She's falling hard for me, I can see it in her eyes
She acts just like a nurse with all the other guys
Say hello to all the apples on the ground
They were once in your eyes, but you sneezed them out while sleeping
Say hello to everything you've left behind
It's even more a part of your life now that you can't touch it
I'm taking her home with me, all dressed in white
She's got everything I need, some pills in a little cup
She's falling hard for me, I can see it in her eyes
She acts just like a nurse with all the other guys
She's got everything I need; pharmacy keys
She acts just like a nurse with all the other guys
Say hello to the rug's topography
You look so wonderful in your dress
I love your hair like that
The way it falls on the side of your neck
Down your shoulders and back
We are surrounded by all of these lies
And people who talk too much
You've got that kind of look in your eyes
As if no one knows anything but us
And should this be the last thing I see
I want you to know it's enough for me
Cause all that you are is all that I'll ever need
I'm so in love, so in love
So in love, so in love
You look so beautiful in this light
Your silhouette over me
The way it brings out the blue in your eyes
Is the Tenerife Sea
And all of the voices surrounding us here
They just fade out when you take a breath
Just say the word and I will disappear
Into the wilderness
And should this be the last thing I see
I want you to know it's enough for me
Cause all that you are is all that I'll ever need
I'm so in love, so in love
So in love, so in love
Lumière, darling
Lumière over me
Lumière, darling
Lumière over me
Lumière, darling
Lumière over me
Lumière, darling
Lumière over me
Lumière, darling
Lumière over me
Lumière, darling
Lumière over me
And should this be the last thing I see
I want you to know it's enough for me
Cause all that you are is all that I'll ever need
I'm so in love, so in love
So in love, love, love, love,
So in love
You looked so wonderful in your dress
I loved your hair like that
And in the moment I knew you back
Shorty get down, good Lord
Baby got 'em up open all over town
Strictly biz, she don't play around
Cover much ground, got game by the pound
Getting paid is a forte
Each and every day, true player way
I can't get her out of my mind
(Wow)
I think about the girl all the time
(Wow wow)
East side to the west side
Pushing phat rides, it's no surprise
She got tricks in the stash
Stacking up the cash
Fast when it comes to the gas
By no means average
As long as she's got to have it
Baby, you're a perfect ten.
I like the way you work it
(No diggity)
I got to bag it up
(Bag it up)
I like the way you work it
(No diggity)
I got to bag it up
(Bag it up)
I like the way you work it
(No diggity)
I got to bag it up
(Bag it up)
I like the way you work it
(No diggity)
I got to bag it up
(Bag it up)
She's got class and style
She knowledge by the pound,
Baby never act wild
Very low key on the profile
Catchin' feelins is a no,
Let me tell you how it goes
Curve's the words, spin's the verbs
Lovers it curves so freak what you heard.
Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo
(Hey yo, man that girl looks good)
Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo
(Play on, play on playette)
Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo
(You're my kind of girl, no diggity)
Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo
(Hey)
I climbed your arms
Then you pulled away
New cavity moved into
My heart today
The more she sings
The more it seems
Now, oh
Now I'm through
With the new you
Now I'm through
With the new you
New you
I drove you home
Then you moved away
New cavity moved into
My heart today
The more I scream
The more it seems
Now I'm through
Now I'm through
With the new you
Now I'm through
With the new you
Now I'm through
With the new you
New you
Give me your hand
The dog in the garden road
Is covered in mud
And dragging your mother's clothes
Cinder and smoke
The snake in the basement found
The juniper shade
The farmhouse is burning down
Give me your hand
And take what you will tonight
I'll give it as fast
And high as the flame will rise
Cinder and smoke
Some whispers around the trees
The juniper bends
As if you were listening
Give me your hand
Your mother is drunk as all
The firemen shake
A photo from father's aunt
Cinder and smoke
You'll ask me to pray for rain
With ash in your mouth
You'll ask it to burn again
Dearest constellation
Heaven surrounding you
Stay there soft and blue
Virginia moon
I'll wait for you tonight
Sweetest invitation
Breaking the day in two
Feeling like I do
Virginia moon
I'll wait for you tonight
And now shades become shadows in your light
In the morning when we're through
And tomorrow rescues you
I will say goodnight
Secret fascination
Whisper a quiet tune
Hear me calling you
Virginia moon
I'll wait for you tonight
And now shades become shadows in your light
In the morning when we're through
And tomorrow rescues you
I will say goodnight
Virginia moon
I'll wait for you tonight
And now shades become shadows in your light
In the morning when we're through
And tomorrow rescues you
I will say goodnight
I will say goodnight
I will say goodnight
Why in the night sky are the lights hung? 
Why is the Earth moving 'round the sun? 
Floating in the vacuum with no purpose, not a one 
Why in the night sky are the lights hung? Oh
Why is life made only for to end? 
Why do I do all this waiting then?
Why this frightened part of me that's fated to pretend? 
Why is life made only for to end? Oh
In the city only for a while 
Here to face the fortune and the bile 
I heard you on the radio, I couldn't help but smile 
In the city only for a while, oh
Why in the night sky are the lights hung? 
Why is the Earth moving 'round the sun? 
Floating in the vacuum with no purpose, not a one 
Why in the night sky are the lights hung? Oh
This is just a nightmare
Soon I'm gonna wake up
Someone's gonna bring me around
Running from the bombers
Hiding in the forest
Running through the fields
Laying flat on the ground
Just like everybody
Standing over heads
Running from the underground
This is your warning
Four minute warning
I don't want to hear it
I don't want to know
I just want to run and hide
This is just a nightmare
Soon I'm gonna wake up
Someone's gonna bring me around
This is a warning
Four minute warning
Been over
Been over this before
Been over and over
Been over this before
And over
Been over this before
So over this
Been over this
So over this
Been over this
Over this before
I should have known better
To see what I could see
My black shroud
Holding down my feelings
A pillar for my enemies
I should have wrote a letter
And grieve what I happen to grieve
My black shroud
I never trust my feelings
I waited for the remedy
When I was three, three maybe four
She left us at that video store
Oh, be my rest, be my fantasy
Oh, be my rest, be my fantasy
I'm light as a feather
I'm bright as the Oregon breeze
My black shroud
Frightened by my feelings
I only want to be a relief
No, I'm not a go-getter
The demon had a spell on me
My black shroud
Captain of my feelings
The only thing I want to believe
When I was three, and free to explore
I saw her face on the back of the door
Oh, be my rest, be my fantasy
Oh, be my rest, be my fantasy
I should have known better
Nothing can be changed
The past is still the past
The bridge to nowhere
I should've wrote a letter
Explaining what I feel, that empty feeling
Don't back down, concentrate on seeing
The breakers in the bar, the neighbor's greeting
My brother had a daughter
The beauty that she brings, illumination
Don't back down, there is nothing left
The breakers in the bar, no reason to live
I'm a fool in the fetter
Rose of Aaron's beard, where you can reach me
Don't back down, nothing can be changed
Cantilever bridge, the drunken sailor
My brother had a daughter
The beauty that she brings, illumination
Illumination
I would rather not go
Back to the old house
I would rather not go
Back to the old house
There's too many
Bad memories
Too many memories
There
When you cycled by
Here began all my dreams
The saddest thing I've ever seen
And you never knew
How much I really liked you
Because I never even told you
Oh and I meant to
Are you still there
Or have you moved away?
Or have you moved away?
I would love to go
Back to the old house
But I never will
I never will
I never will
Trouble travels fast
When you're specially designed for crash testing
Wearing wool sunglasses in the afternoon
Come on and tell us what you're trying to prove
'Cause it's a battle when you dabble in war
You store it up, unleash it, then you piece it together
Weather the storm, drain running rampant, just stamp it
And send it to somebody who's pretending to care
Just cash in your blanks for little toy tanks
Learn how to use them, then abuse them, and choose them
Over conversations. Relationships are overrated
"I hated everyone" said the sun
And so I will cook all your books
You're too good looking and mistooken
You could watch it instead
From the comfort of your burning beds
...Or you can sleep through the static
Who needs sleep when we've got love?
Who needs keys when we've got clubs?
Who needs please when we've got guns?
Who needs peace when we've gone above
But beyond where we should have gone?
We went beyond where we should have gone
Stuck between channels my thoughts all quit
I thought about them too much, allowed them to touch
The feelings of rain down on the plains all dried and cracked
Waiting for things that never came
Shock an awful thing to make somebody think
That they have to choose pushing for peace, supporting the troops
And either you're weak or you'll use brute force-feed
The truth is, we say not as we do
We say anytime, anywhere, just show your teeth and strike the fear
Of God wears camouflage, cries at night and drives a Dodge
Pick up the beat 'n' stop hogging the feast
That's no way to treat an enemy
Well mighty mighty appetite
We just eat 'em up and keep on driving
Freedom can be freezing, take a picture from the pretty side
Mind your manners, wave your banners
What a wonderful world that this angle can see
But who needs to see what we've done?
And who needs please when we've got guns?
And who needs keys when we've got clubs?
And who needs peace when we've gone above?
But beyond where we should have gone?
Beyond where we should have gone
We went beyond where we should have gone
(We went) Beyond where we should have gone
Kestrel's breed
Looking further than I can see
Without tact to read
She'd take a shine to me
Beacon, don't fly too high
Beacon, don't fly too high
For all your time, playful crime in rain
Worth it being cold, roofing for the lanes
A lesson lost again
Lesson lost again
Keep haunting the bus with fees of favors gone
Cracks and sailors fast and await the sun to show
Won't tomorrow come?
Won't tomorrow come?
Kestrel's breed
Looking further than I can see
Without tact to read
She'd take a shine to me
Beacon, don't fly too high
Beacon, don't fly too high
I don't want to be adored
Don't want to be first in line
Or make myself heard
I'd like to bring a little light
To shine a light on your life
To make you feel loved
No, I don't want to be the only one you know
I want to be the place you call home
I lay myself down to make it so
But you don't want to know
I give much more than I'd ever ask for
Will you see me in the end?
Or is it just a waste of time
Trying to be your friend?
Just shine, shine, shine
Shine a little light
Shine a light on my life
And warm me up again
Fool, I wonder if you know yourself at all
You know that it could be so simple
I lay myself down to make it so
But you don't want to know
You take much more than I'd ever ask for
Say a word or two to brighten my day
Do you think that you could see your way
To lay yourself down and make it so?
But you don't want to know
You take much more than I'd ever ask for
Tiredness fuels empty thoughts
I find myself disposed
Brightness fills empty space
In search of inspiration
Harder now with higher speed
Washing in on top of me
So I look to my Eskimo friend
I look to my Eskimo friend
I look to my Eskimo friend
When I'm down, down, down
Rain, it wets muddy roads
I find myself exposed
Tapping doors, but irritate
In search of destination
Harder now with higher speed
Washing in on top of me
So I look to my Eskimo friend
I look to my Eskimo friend
I look to my Eskimo friend
When I'm down
Kosketa minua - Touch me
Älä käsilläsi - Not with your hands
Vaan niin että tunnen sinut - But so that I feel you
Halaa minua - Hug me
Älä käsilläsi - Not with your hands
Mutta sielussasi - But within your soul
Minä kaipaan eskimo-ystävääni - I miss my eskimo friend
When I'm down, down, down
When I'm down, down, down
When I'm down, down, down
When you fall asleep
With your head upon my shoulder
When you're in my arms
But you've gone somewhere deeper
Are you going to age with grace?
Are you going to age without mistakes?
Are you going to age with grace?
Oh, only to wake and hide your face
When oh, oh, oblivion
Is calling out your name
You always take it further
Than I ever can
When you play it hard
And I try to follow you there
It's not about control
But I turn back when I see where you go
Are you going to age with grace?
Are you going to leave a path to trace?
But oh, oh, oblivion
Is calling out your name
You always take it further
Than I ever can
When oh, oh, oblivion
Is calling out your name
You always take it further
Than I ever can
Gravitated towards a taste
For foreign films and modern plays
But that machine could only
Bend to squares five to six times
Before your fingers came unwired...
Weights down so that you could move forwards
Pinch to snub that restless nerve
And knock the wind from one last urge
With two fingers and a rock glass,
Time passed and that was that
Quite a slip (a loosened grasp)
Weights down so that you could move forwards
... What a way to cut lengthwise...
Weakly mind, weakly
Ooh I go home...
Weakly...
Weakly mind, weakly
Ooh I go home...
Weakly...
Weakly mind, weakly
Ooh I go home...
Weakly...
Weakly mind, weakly
Ooh I go home...
Weakly...
Ooh ooh
I never needed you to be strong
I never needed you for pointing out my wrongs
I never needed pain, I never needed strain.
My love for you was strong enough you should've known.
I never needed you for judgement
I never needed you to question what I spent
I never asked for help, I take care of myself,
I don't know why you think you got a hold on me.
And it's a little in the conversations
There isn't anything that you can say.
And my eyes hurt, hands shiver, so look at me and listen to me because,
I don't want to
Stay another minute
I don't want you
To say a single word
Hush Hush, Hush Hush
There is no other way
I get the final say
Because
I don't want to
Do this any longer
I don't want you
There's nothing left to say
Hush Hush, Hush Hush
I've already spoken
Our love is broken
Baby Hush Hush
I never needed your corrections
On everything from how I act to what I say
I never needed words, I never needed hurt,
I never needed you to be there everyday
I'm sorry for the way I let go
Of everything I wanted when you came along
But I am never beaten, broken, not defeated
I know next to you is not where I belong
And it's a little late for explanations
There isn't anything that you can do
And my eyes hurt, hands shiver, so you will listen when I say baby
I don't want to
Stay another minute
I don't want you
To say a single word
Hush Hush, Hush Hush
There is no other way
I get the final say
Because
I don't want to
Do this any longer
I don't want you
There's nothing left to say
Hush Hush, Hush Hush
I've already spoken
Our love is broken
Baby Hush Hush
No more words
No more lies
No more crying, ooh ooh
No more pain
No more hurt
No more trying, oh oh yeah
Because
I don't want to
Stay another minute
I don't want you
To say a single word
Hush Hush, Hush Hush
There is no other way
I get the final say
Because
I don't want to
Do this any longer
I don't want you
There's nothing left to say
Hush Hush, Hush Hush
I've already spoken
Our love is broken
Baby Hush Hush
Yeah Oh
Hush Hush, Hush Hush
I've already spoken
Our love is broken
Baby Hush Hush
I've got a symbol in my driveway
I've got a hundred million dollar friends
I've got you a brand new weapon l
Lets see how destructive we can be
I got a brand new set of stencils
I been connecting all the dots
Got my plans in a zip lock bag
Lets see how unproductive we can be
I got a light bulb full of anger
And I can switch it on and off
In situations it can be so bright
I can't believe, how pathetic we can be
I got a perfect set of blue prints
I'm gonna build somebody else
Might cost a little more than money
But what's man without his wealth
I got a phosphorescent secret
But don't you tell nobody else
Next thing you know
The whole world will be talking
About all the clues they got
They just ain't no use
They got fooled
Genius to fall asleep to your tape last night
So warm
Sounds go through muscles
These abstract wordless movements
They start off cells that haven't been touched before
These cells are virgins
Waking up slowly
My headphones
They saved my life
Your tape
It lulled me to sleep
Nothing will be the same
I'm fast asleep
I like this resonance
It elevates me
I don't recognize myself
This is very interesting
My headphones
They saved my life
Your tape
It lulled me to sleep
I'm fast asleep now
I'm fast asleep
My headphones
They saved my life
Your tape
It lulled me to sleep
Since we fell apart I've been nothing but blue
Longing for a night time to bring back my youth
Every night in motion together apart
Apart from the moments so dear to my heart
We were made in the dark
Since I stole this song we have made a new start
My premonition hits hard as our start is apart
Every night the motion must be fixed by glue
Baby be careful, what's fixed as one breaks in two
We were made in the dark
Please remember me happily
By the rosebush laughing
With bruises on my chin
The time when we counted every black car passing
Your house beneath the hill and up until
Someone caught us in the kitchen
With maps, a mountain range, a piggy bank
A vision too removed to mention
But please remember me fondly
I heard from someone you're still pretty
And then they went on to say that the pearly gates
Had some eloquent graffiti
Like 'We'll meet again' and 'Fuck the man'
And 'Tell my mother not to worry'
And angels with their gray handshakes
Were always done in such a hurry
And please remember me at Halloween
Making fools of all the neighbors
Our faces painted white by midnight
We'd forgotten one another
And when the morning came, I was ashamed
Only now it seems so silly
That season left the world and then returned
But now you're lit up by the city
So please remember me mistakenly
In the window of the tallest tower call
Then pass us by but much too high
To see the empty road at happy hour
Gleam and resonate just like the gates
Around the holy kingdom
With words like 'Lost and Found' and 'Don't Look Down'
And 'Someone Save Temptation'
And please remember me as in the dream
We had as rug-burned babies
Among the fallen trees and fast asleep
Aside the lions and the ladies
That called you what you like and even might
Give a gift for your behavior
A fleeting chance to see a trapeze
Swinger high as any savior
But please remember me, my misery
And how it lost me all I wanted
Those dogs that love the rain and chasing trains
The colored birds above their running
In circles 'round the well and where it spells
On the wall behind St. Peter's
So bright on cinder gray and spray paint
'Who the hell can see forever?'
And please remember me seldom
In the car behind the carnival
My hand between your knees, you turn from me
And said the trapeze act was wonderful
But never meant to last, the clowns that passed
Saw me just come up with anger
When it filled with circus dogs, the parking lot
Had an element of danger
So please remember me, finally
And all my uphill clawing, my dear
But if I make the pearly gates
Do my best to make a drawing
Of God and Lucifer, a boy and girl
An angel kissing on a sinner
A monkey and a man, a marching band
All around the frightened trapeze swingers
I know to be there
When and where, I?�ll be there
You know what?�s to be said
We said out loud, we never said
My ṗremonition of the world comes to me
A sun in your hands from the middle life
Says I?�m alright
You said you don?�t have to speak
I can hear you
I can?�t feel all the things you've ever felt before
I said it?�s been a long time
Since someone looked at me that way
It?�s like you knew me
And all the things I couldn't say
Together, to be
Together and be
Together, to be
Together and be
Together, to be
Together and be
Together, to be
Together and be
Together, to be
Together and be
Together, to be
Together and be
Together, to be
Together and be
Together, to be
Together and be
You need not to climb mountain tops
You need not to cross the sea
You need not to find a cure
For everything that makes you weak
You need not to reach for the stars
When life becomes so dark
And when the wind does blow against the grain
You must follow your heart
You must follow your heart
All your friends have come and gone
And the sun no longer shines
And the happiness for which you long
Is washed away like an oceans tide
When all the hard times outweigh the good
And all your words are misunderstood
When the day seems lost from the start
You must follow your heart
You must follow your heart
If you feel you've paid the price
And your wounds should cease to heal
And everything you love in life
Spins like a winding wheel
If you should wake to find you're abandoned
And the road you traveled leads to a dead end
When death creaps in to play it's part
You must follow your heart.
You must follow your heart.
Mother, mother
There's too many of you crying
Brother, brother
Far too many of you dying
You know we've got to find a way
To bring some love in here today
Father, father
We don't need to escalate
War is not the answer
Only love can conquer hate
You know we've got to find a way
To bring some love in here today
Picket lines and picket signs
Don't punish me with brutality
Talk to me, so you can see
What's going on
What's going on
What's going on
What's going on
Father, father
Everybody thinks we're wrong
But who are they to judge us
Simply 'cause our hair is long
You know we've got to find a way
To bring understanding here today
Picket lines and picket signs
Don't punish me with brutality
Talk to me, so you can see
What's going on
What's going on
What's going on
What's going on
Things seem so much better when
They're not part of your close surroundings
Like words in a letter sent
Amplified by the distance
Possibilities and sweeter dreams
Sights and sounds calling form far away
Calling from far away
I didn't know you then, now did I girl?
I couldn't hear you singing softly to me
I didn't know you then, now did I girl?
I didn't see the brave girl so near me
I didn't know you then, now did I girl?
I couldn't hear you sing softly to me
I wanted a mystery that couldn't be solved
I wanted a puzzle with pieces missing
I wanted a story that couldn't be told
Only the fishing part of fishing
I didn't know you then, now did I girl?
I couldn't hear you singing softly to me
I didn't know you then, now did I girl?
I didn't see the brave girl so near me
I didn't know you then, now did I girl?
I couldn't hear you sing softly to me
And now I find
It was you all the time.
I'm in love again-
It's too late now...
I was the best man in a size too small
You were my best friend, going at it all
And what if I put off my inheritance?
Where is the best man? All arise us all in peace
I still know you
And I still like you, the best man
And I still owe you
Everything rises, going at it all
All the surprises in a size too small
And what if I told you I was still in love with this?
Would you surprise us in a size for all of me?
I still know you
And I still like you, the best man
I still know you, the best man
I still owe you
With you on my mind
And my heart held in your hands
Screaming
Break me
Break me
Ooh, oh
With you on my mind
And my heart held in your hands
Screaming
Break me
Break me
Ooh, oh
Hey, where the hell are you, you don't call me back, John
Won't you come here and stay with me
Why don't you come here and stay with me
Hey, where the hell are you, you don't call me back, John
Won't you come here and stay with me
Why don't you come here and stay with me
Show up here loaded with bells on your toes
I don't care what you're into, I'll put
Velvet ropes around you if that's what you need
Why did you listen to that man, that man's a balloon
Oh, you gotta get out and get back to me
John, you gotta get out and get back to me
Why did you listen to that man, that man's a balloon
Oh, you gotta get out and get back to me
Take his limousine, you gotta get back to me
I'm getting nervous, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
No sign of a friend of mine
Red hair and blue eyes
I'm getting nervous, na, na, na, na, na, na
No sign of a friend of mine
I was in a train under a river when I remembered what
What I wanted to tell you, man
What I wanted to tell you, man
I got two sets of headphones, I miss you like hell
Won't you come here and stay with me
Why don't you come here and stay with me?
I'm getting nervous, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
No sign of a friend of mine
Red hair and blue eyes
I'm getting nervous, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
No sign of a friend of mine
Why did you listen to that man, that man's a balloon
Oh, you gotta get out and get back to me
Why did you listen to that man, that man's a balloon
John, you gotta get out and get back to me
Why did you listen to that man, that man's a balloon
Fake a heart attack, you gotta get back to me
Why did you listen to that man, that man's a balloon
John, you gotta get out and get back to me
Waking to these sounds again
I wonder how I'll sleep
Passing out is taking off into the stubborn deep
I'd like to meet a human who makes it all seem clear
To work out all these cycles and why I'm standing here
I'm falling
Over and over and over and over again now
Calling and over and over and over and over again now
Running through my life right now
I don't regret a thing
The things I do just make me laugh and make me wanna drink
I'd like to meet a mad man who makes it all seem sane
To work out all these troubles and what there is to gain
I'm falling
Over and over and over and over again now
Calling and over and over and over and over again now
Projecting what I want is always hard to know
But when it comes between my sights I'll let the damage show
I'd like to meet a space man, who's got it going on
Sailing through the stars at night 'til our world is gone
I'm falling
Over and over and over and over again now
Calling and over and over and over and over again now
Over and over and over and over again now
Calling and over and over and over and over again now
Linked like dog to man
I am sold
And we lay, nocturnal
Speculate what we feel
You said it was a flash of green
But you don't know
And we lay, nocturnal
Speculate what we feel
Speculate what we feel
Speculate what we feel
And that I don't embellish you
The snow coming like a breath
But it may be a new constellation
That shows us where we are
And we lay, nocturnal
Speculate what we feel
And we lay, nocturnal
Speculate what we feel
And we lay, nocturnal
Speculate what we feel
And we lay, nocturnal
It's the most alone you felt
I'm glad I could help
I could talk this over
Twenty times again
Everything you've learned from us I learned
It's the most alone you felt
I'm glad I could help
And that I don't embellish you
The snow coming like a breath
But it may be a new constellation
That shows us where we are
And we lay, nocturnal
Speculate what we feel
And we lay, nocturnal
Speculate what we feel
And we lay, nocturnal
Speculate what we feel
And we lay, nocturnal
And we lay, nocturnal
And we lay, nocturnal
And we lay, nocturnal
Speculate what we feel
Taking time
To walk down all the aisles.
Turning over every stone.
Building new rulers
But still haven't burnt any old.
Please don't let me down this time.
I've come a long way to just fold back into line.
Keep both feet on the ground
While I change the wings.
I promise one day I'll be coming around
From my cloud to see what it's all about.
But please don't let me down this time.
I've come a long way to just fold back into line.
Please hold me back
If I tend to lose it and steer into old tracks.
Please don't let me down this time.
I've come a long way to just fold back into line.
Just like the way that you ran to wine
When they made the new milk turn
Jesus, a friend in the better times
Let your mother's bible burn
Freedom, a fever you suffered through
And the dog drank from your cup
Frozen, the river that baptized you
And the horse died standing up
But when a southern anthem rings
She will buckle to that sound
When that southern anthem sings
It will lay her burdens down
Just like the way you lost your guns
When they cut the clothesline loose
Jesus, a friend of the weaker ones
Said, "I'm all they stole from you"
Freedom, a thistle that withered dry
Still a baby in your hands
Frozen, the ground refused to die
And the guitar rose again
But when that southern anthem rings
She will buckle to the sound
When that southern anthem sings
It will lay her burdens down
And I've been walkin' on these streets so long
I don't know where they're gonna lead anymore
But I think I must have seen a ghost
I don't know if it's my illusions that keep me alive
I don't know what I've seen
Was it all an illusion?
All a mirage gone bad? oh
I'm tired of evil
And all that it feeds
But I don't know
And I've been driftin' on this wave so long
I don't know if it's already crashed on the shore
And I've been ridin' on this train so long
I can't tell if it's you or me who's drivin' us into the ground
I don't know if I'm sane
But there's a ghost in my heart
Who's tryin' to see in the dark, oh
I'm tired of people
Who only wanna be pleased
But I still wanna please you
And I heard of that Japanese girl
Who jumped into the volcano
Was she tryin' to make it back
Back into the womb of the world? oh
And I've been drinkin' all these tears so long
All I've got left is the taste of salt in my mouth
I don't know where I've been
But I know where I'm goin'
To that volcano, whoa
I don't wanna fall in though
Just wanna warm my bones
On the fire a while
I feel alright, I found a place that fits tight
It feels small but I won't get sad about it
The softest voice said to me all through last night
I forget but I won't feel bad about it
I'll stay inside and find a pitch that sounds right
Bombs outside, such a small forest laughing at me
Be me, be mine
I might have not have reminded
You to feel (Mine to feel)
Be me, be mine
I might have not have reminded
You to feel (Mine to feel)
I feel alright, I found a face that fits tight
It feels small but I won't get sad about it
All the wild horses
All the wild horses
Tethered with tears in their eyes
May no man's touch ever tame
May no man's reigns ever chain you
And may no man's weight
Ever defrayed your soul
And as for the clouds
Just let them roll
Roll away
Roll away
As for the clouds
Just let them roll
Roll away
Roll away
Check your pulse It's proof
That you're not listening to
The call your life's been issuing you
The rhythm of a line of idle days
Scared of a world outside
You should go explore
Pull all the shades and
Wander the great indoors
The great indoors
Lamplight makes the shadows play
And posters take the walls away
The T.V. is your window pane
The view won't let you down
So put your faith in a late night show
I bet you didn't even know
Depends on how far out you go
The channel numbers change
Scared of a world outside
You should go explore
Pull all the shades and
Wander the great indoors
Though lately I can't blame you
I have seen the world
And sometimes wish your room
Had room for two
So go unlock the door
And find what you are here for
Leave the great indoors
Leave the great indoors
Check your pulse it's proof
That you're not listening to
The call your life's been issuing you
The rhythm of a line of idle days
Of idle days
When our mouths are filled with uninvited tongues of others
And the strays are pining for their unrequited mothers
Milk that sours is promptly spat
Light will fill our eyes like cats
And they shall enter from the back
With spears and scepters and squirming sacks
Scribes and tangles between their ears
Faceless scrumbled charcoal smears
Through the coppice and the chaparral
The thickets thick with mold
The bracken and the brier
Catchweed into the fold
When our mouths are filled with uninvited tongues of others
And the strays are pining for their unrequited mothers
Milk that sours is promptly spat
The light will fill our eyes like cats
Cataracts
I think that possibly, maybe I'm falling for you
Yes there's a chance that I've fallen quite hard over you.
I've seen the paths that your eyes wander down
I want to come too
I think that possibly, maybe I'm falling for you
No one understands me quite like you do
Through all of the shadowy corners of me
I never knew just what it was
About this old coffee shop I love so much
All of the while I never knew...
I never knew just what it was
About this old coffee shop I love so much
All of the while I never knew
I think that possibly, maybe I'm falling for you
Yes there's a chance that I've fallen quite hard over you.
I've seen the waters that make your eyes shine
Now I'm shining too
Because oh because
I've fallen quite hard over over you
If I didn't know you, I'd rather not know
If I couldn't have you, I'd rather be alone
I never knew just what it was
About this old coffee shop I love so much
All of the while I never knew
I never knew just what it was
About this old coffee shop I love so much
All of the while, I never knew
All of the while, all of the while
If I was a simple man,
Would we still walk hand in hand?
And if I suddenly went blind,
Would you still look in my eyes?
What happens when I grow old?
And all my stories have been told?
Will your heart still race for me?
Or will it march to a new beat?
If I was a simple man
If I was a simple man,
I'd own no home, I'd own no land
Would you still stand by my side?
And would our flame still burn so bright?
Sometimes I wonder why,
I'm so full of these endless rhymes
About the way I feel inside
I wish I could just get it right
If I was a simple man
And I could make you understand
There'd be no reason to think twice
You'd be my sun; you'd be my light
If I was a simple man
If I was a simple man
No I'm not a simple man
If I was a simple man
But I am not a simple man
Sometimes I wonder why
I'm so full of these endless rhymes
About the way I feel inside
I wish
Sometimes (x 12)
Waiting by the mailbox, by the train 
Passin' by the hills 'til I hear the name
I'm looking for a saw to cut the chains in half and all I want is
Someone to rely on as
Thunder comes a-rollin' down
Someone to rely on as
Lightning comes a-starin' in again
I'll wait to be forgiven
Maybe I never will
My star has left me
To take the bitter pill
That shattered feeling
Well the cause of it's a lesson learned
Just don't know if I could roll into the sea again
"Just don't know if I could do it all again" she said, it's true
Waiting in my room and I lock the door
I watch the coloured animals across the floor
And I'm looking from a distance 
And I'm listening to the whispers
And oh it ain't the same, when you're falling out of feeling and you're
Falling in and caught again
Ca-a-a-aught again
I'm caught again in the mystery
You're by my side, but are you still with me?
The answer's somewhere deep in it, I'm sorry that you're feeling it
But I just have to tell that I love you so much these days
Have to tell you that I love you so much these days, it's true
My heart is in economy
Due to this autonomy
Rolling in and caught again
Ca-a-a-aught again
My heart is in economy
Due to this autonomy
Rolling in and caught again
Ca-a-a-aught again
Did you know that you could be wrong
And swear you're right?
Some people been known to do it all their lives
But you find yourself alone just like you found yourself before
Like I found myself in pieces on the hotel floor
Hard times have helped me see
I'm a good man with a good heart
Had a tough time, got a rough start
But I finally learned to let it go
Now I'm right here and I'm right now
And I'm open knowing somehow
That my shadow days are over
My shadow days are over now
Well I ain't no troublemaker
And I never meant her harm
But it doesn't mean I didn't make it hard to carry on
Well it sucks to be honest
And it hurts to be real
But it's nice to make some love that I can finally feel
Hard times, let me be
I'm a good man with a good heart
Had a tough time, got a rough start
But I finally learned to let it go
Now I'm right here and I'm right now
And I'm open knowing somehow
That my shadow days are over
My shadow days are over now
I'm a good man with a good heart
Had a tough time, got a rough start
But I finally learned to let it go
Now I'm right here and I'm right now
And I'm open knowing somehow
That my shadow days are over
My shadow days are over now
I live in America with a pair of Payless shoes
The Upper Peninsula and the television news
And I've seen my wife at the K-Mart
In strange ideas, we live apart
I live in a trailer home with a snowmobile, my car
The window is broken out and the interstate is far
And I drove all night to find my child
In strange ideas, he's been reviled
In strange ideas, in stranger times
I've no idea what's right sometimes
I lost my mind, I lost my life
I lost my job, I lost my wife
The rainiest days
Digital Lion
Digital Lion
I will see you probably
And even if you ask right
My heart feels like love
Whispering this in his days
For all feels like mine
Whispering this in his days
Digital Lion
Digital Lion
She knows a good thing now
With all her heart and darkening door
In my head and in my thoughts
In my head and in my thoughts
We spend the whole days all
We're feeling more apart
And we know you can do more
Please, don't let me hurt you more
It's in your stare and at your core
Please, don't let me hurt you more
Please, don't let me hurt you more
I know this journey's soon
The color of lights and our lives become as you
Please, don't let me hurt you more
It's in your stare and at your core
Please, don't let me hurt you more
It's in your stare and at your core
Got a tattoo that said, 'together through life'
Carved in your name with my pocket knife
And you wonder when you wake up will it be all right?
Feels like there's something broken inside
All I know
All I know
Is that I'm lost
Whenever you go
All I know
Is that I love you so
So much that it hurts
Got a tattoo and the pain's all right
Just want a way of keeping you inside
All I know
All I know
Is that I'm lost
In your fire below
All I know
Is that I love you so
So much that it hurts
I see the road begin to climb
I see your stars begin to shine
I see your colours, and I'm dying of thirst
All I know
Is that I love you so
So much that it hurts
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
So much that it hurts
So much that it hurts
When my soul starts growing
When my soul starts growing
When my soul starts growing
I get so hungry and I wish it never
Never would, never would
Never would, never would
Never would
Never would stop growing
When my soul starts growing
When my soul starts growing
When my soul starts growing
I get get so full and I wish it never
Never would, never would
Never would, never would
Never would
Never would stop growing
When my soul starts growing
When my soul starts growing
When my soul starts growing
I am as I want to be and I know I never
Never will, never will
Never will, never will
Never will stop caring
And now that's it's over, I'll never be sober
I couldn't believe, but now I'm so high
And now that's it's over, I'll never be sober
I couldn't believe, but now I'm so high
But now I'm so high, but now I'm so high
But now I'm so high
Girl, what's your problem
'Cause I know it's hard sometimes, baby just give it some time
Oh honey now girl, we can solve them
If you just give me some time I can open up your mind
If you let it shine, you can free your mind
Cause now I know
And now that's it's over, I'll never be sober
I couldn't believe, but now I'm so high
And now that's it's over, I'll never be sober
I couldn't believe, but now I'm so high
But now I'm so high, but now I'm so high
But now I'm so high
Girl, if it's done right
Well you know it's got to be, something wonderful to me
Oh honey know girl, give it one night
If you just give it a chance, loving you is not my plan
'Cause I know one day you'll see
All the things that we can be
Oh na no no
And now that's it's over, I'll never be sober (I want to be the only one)
I couldn't believe, but now I'm so high
And now that's it's over, I'll never be sober
I couldn't believe, but now I'm so high
But now I'm so
And now that's it's over, I'll never be sober
I couldn't believe, but now I'm so high
But now I'm so high, but now I'm so high
But now I'm so high, but now I'm so high
I go to loud places
To search for someone
To be quiet with
Who will take me home
You go to loud places
To find someone who
Will take you higher than
I took you
Didn't I take you to
Higher places you can't reach without me?
(I have never reached such heights)
Reach without me?
(I feel music in your eyes
I have never reached such heights)
I go to those places
Where we used to go
They seem so quiet now
I'm here, all alone
You go to new places
With I don't know who
And I don't know how
To follow you
Higher
I take you higher and I'll take you
Didn't I take you higher?
I take you higher
I take you higher and I take you
Didn't I take you higher?
Didn't I take you to
Higher places you can't reach without me?
(I have never reached such heights)
Reach without me
(I feel music in your eyes
I have never reached such heights)
I feel music in your eyes
I have never reached such heights
I feel music in your eyes
I have never reached such heights
You're in ecstasy
Without me
When you come down
I won't be around
Somewhere over the Earth
A song, a song
Somewhere I have heard
My brother is gone
Away, under the Moon
Brother, brother
Away, gone so soon
Please singin' his tune
Still singin' his tune
And away he gone day
And away he gone night
And away he gone dark 
And away he gone light
Up and away he gone away
But in a way he gonna stay 
Oh brother of mine 
We'll be singing some day
Yeah we'll sing it someday
Yeah we'll sing it someday
Yeah we'll sing it someday
Undead audio, yes we'll be singing someday
Some say I am to blame
Brother, brother
Some days I feel the same
I'm feelin' that shame 
Away under the moon
Brother, brother
Away, gone so soon
Please singin' this tune
Still singin' his tune
And away he gone dark 
And away he gone light
And away he gone day
And away he gone night
Up and away he gone away
But in a way he gonna stay 
Oh brother of mine 
We'll be singing some day
Yeah we'll sing it someday
Yeah we'll sing it someday
Brother of mine, we'll be singing someday
Undead audio, yes we'll be singing today
Everything is exactly right
When I walk around here drunk every night
With an open container from 7-Eleven
In St. Ides Heaven
Been out haunting the neighborhood
And everybody can see I'm no good
When I'm walking out between parked cars
With my head full of stars
High on amphetamines
The moon is a light bulb breaking
It'll go around with anyone
But it won't come down for anyone
You think you know what brings me down
That I want those things you could never allow
You see me smiling, you think it's a frown
Turned upside down
'Cause everyone is a fucking pro
And they all got answers from trouble they've known
And they all gotta say what you should and shouldn't do
Though they don't have a clue
High on amphetamines
The moon is a lightbulb breaking
It'll go around with anyone
But it won't come down for anyone
And I won't come down for anyone
Don't you call anybody else baby,
'Cause I'm your baby still
You took a long time to make it
But I never changed my mind
I never tried to fake it
Never drew the line
Don't you call anybody else baby,
'Cause I'm your baby still
You took a long time to make it
But I never changed my mind
You speak your fears
Thinking in circles
And checking what mirrors don't see
You live your life like a page
From the book of my fantasy
How I love you
You speak your fears
Thinking in circles
And checking what mirrors don't see
You live your life like a page
From the book of my fantasy
You speak your fears
Thinking in circles
And checking what mirrors don't see
You live your life like a page
From the book of my fantasy
You speak your fears
Thinking in circles
And checking what mirrors don't see
You live your life like a page
From the book of my fantasy
Don't you call anybody else baby (x7)
Sun been down for days
A pretty flower in a vase
A slipper by the fireplace
A cello lying in its case
Soon she's down the stairs
Her morning elegance she wears
The sound of water makes her dream
Awoken by a cloud of steam
She pours a daydream in a cup
A spoon of sugar sweetens up
And she fights for her life
As she puts on her coat
And she fights for her life on the train
She looks at the rain as it pours
And she fights for her life
As she goes in a store
With a thought she has caught by a thread
She pays for the bread
And she goes
Nobody knows
Sun been down for days
A winter melody she plays
The thunder makes her contemplate
She hears a noise behind the gate
Perhaps a letter with a dove
Perhaps a stranger she could love
And she fights for her life
As she puts on her coat
And she fights for her life on the train
She looks at the rain as it pours
And she fights for her life
As she goes in a store
With a thought she has caught by a thread
She pays for the bread
And she goes
Nobody knows
Nobody knows
And she fights for her life
As she puts on her coat
And she fights for her life on the train
She looks at the rain as it pours
And she fights for her life as she goes in a store
Where people are pleasantly strange
And counting the change
And she goes
Nobody knows
Nobody knows
Nobody knows
From the deep silence of my mind
Is something I'm trying to find
When it speaks, you know you will hear my name
Not so complex in design
But harder to mind
As I step in vain
Won't you come down to my arms
There's something I'm ready to say
Would you call my name
Look at where we are
Remember where we started out
Never gonna be without each other's love again
Look at where we are, are, are
I need your name
Look at where we are
Remember where we started out
Never gonna be without each other's love again
Look at where we are, are, are
I need your name
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
A memory tells us that we're blessed
But opening up this chest
I discovered that a heart is lame
Falling behind what we guess
But trying to do our best
Do we stop, do we stop in frame
Won't you come back to my heart
There's something I'm trying to say
Would you call my name
Look at where we are
Remember where we started out
Never gonna be without each other's love again
Look at where we are, are, are
I need your name
Look at where we are 
Remember where we started out 
Never gonna be without each other's love again
Look at where we are, are, are
I need your name
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Feeling used
But I'm
Still missing you
And I can't
See the end of this
Just wanna feel your kiss
Against my lips
And now all this time
Is passing by
But I still can't seem to tell you why
It hurts me every time I see you
Realize how much I need you
I hate you I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to, but I can't put
Nobody else above you
I hate you I love you
I hate that I want you
You want her, you need her
And I'll never be her
I miss you when I can't sleep
Or right after coffee
Or right when I can't eat
I miss you in my front seat
Still got sand in my sweaters
From nights we don't remember
Do you miss me like I miss you?
Fucked around and got attached to you
Friends can break your heart too, and
I'm always tired but never of you
If I pulled a you on you, you wouldn't like that shit
I put this reel out, but you wouldn't bite that shit
I type a text but then I nevermind that shit
I got these feelings but you never mind that shit
Oh oh, keep it on the low
You're still in love with me but your friends don't know
If you wanted me you would just say so
And if I were you, I would never let me go
I don't mean no harm
I just miss you on my arm
Wedding bells were just alarms
Caution tape around my heart
You ever wonder what we could have been?
You said you wouldn't and you fucking did
Lie to me, lie with me, get your fucking fix
Now all my drinks and all my feelings are all fucking mixed
Always missing people that I shouldn't be missing
Sometimes you gotta burn some bridges just to create some distance
I know that I control my thoughts and I should stop reminiscing
But I learned from my dad that it's good to have feelings
When love and trust are gone
I guess this is moving on
Everyone I do right does me wrong
So every lonely night, I sing this song
I hate you I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to, but I can't put
Nobody else above you
I hate you I love you
I hate that I want you
You want her, you need her
And I'll never be her
All alone I watch you watch her
Like she's the only girl you've ever seen
You don't care you never did
You don't give a damn about me
Yeah all alone I watch you watch her
She's the only thing you've ever seen
How is it you never notice
That you are slowly killing me
I hate you I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to, but I can't put
Nobody else above you
I hate you I love you
I hate that I want you
You want her, you need her
And I'll never be her
Tomorrow I'll be quicker
I'll stare into the strobe light flicker
And afloat I'll stay
But I'm quite alright hiding today
Tomorrow I'll be faster
I'll catch what I've been chasing after
And have time to play
I'm quite alright hiding today
And I will play the coconut shy
And win a prize even if it's rigged
I won't know when to stop
And you can leave off my lid, and I won't even lose my fizz
I'll be the polka dots type
I'll know the way back, if you know the way
But if you are, I am quite alright hiding today
Tomorrow I'll be stronger
Running colorful
No longer just in black and white
And I'm quite alright hiding tonight
And I will have a game on the coconut shy
And win a prize even if it's rigged
I won't know when to stop
And you can leave off my lid, and I won't even lose my fizz
I'll be the polka dots type
I'll probably swim through a few lagoons
I'll have a spring in my step
And I'll get there soon
To sing you a happy tune, tomorrow
And you better bring a change of clothes
So we can sail our laughing pianos
Along a beam of light
But I'm quite alright hiding tonight

She was going with a cinematographer
Everyone knew that he was really a pornographer
They went down to the dance and grind
And everybody was feeling fine
She was talking with a syllable lisp
And everybody she knew was gonna get the twist
And they all went down and did the porcupine
And everybody was feeling high
You are so hot
I would like to steal your digits
And I'm so hung up on it
I would like to move away from it
We are so caught up with things
We should pull each other's triggers
And I'm
Off

I've looked everywhere, Mr. Forbes
But I can't find the cello or yet the french horn
And I can't find the harp
I don't know where it's gone
And of course, you can't go without that
I've looked everywhere, Mr. Forbes
But I can't find your clamshells
Your file or your drill
And your sheepskin-lined coat is eluding me still
And of course, you can't go without that
I've looked in the attic, the cellar and hall
I've looked in the studio, study and all
I've looked in the chest where I thought it should be
I've looked in the greenhouses, one, two and three
I've looked everywhere, Mr. Forbes
But I can't find the dagger and oh why oh why
Can't I think what I did with that ol' skill and dye
And of course, you can't go without that
You can't possibly go without that

But it takes you years to know what love is
And It takes some fears to make you trust
It takes those tears to make it rust
It takes the dust to have it polished, yeah

It takes some silence to make sound

It takes a toll to make you care
It takes a hole to make a mountain

From my seat I see the fields move by
Coulours strong - it's been a long, long time
It's the first time I see summer on the Westhill
I lean back and let my eyes just go
Floating now where they want to float
They seem to take to the horizon
Now I know there is a world beyond
The small place I was coming from
I feel at home here in the middle of nowhere
I will never know the names
Of these places that I travel through
To reach the coastline
I've been told I will be there in time
Please ocean cloud
Let there be no storm on the crossing below
Please ocean cloud
Let there be no storm on the crossing below
Please ocean cloud
Let there be no storm on the crossing below
Please ocean cloud
Let there be no storm on the crossing below
We were young souls
On the junk-yard
Now we are stunned minds
Full of junk-goods
But I feel your heartbeat
Just like mine
I feel your heartbeat
All the time
And we were bound to the city life
Flashlights when we're falling into the night
Focused on what you feel
Just when you were calling her love that day

Emily:
The town where she was born
Like the town where I was born
Was built by white settlers seeking gold and other treasures
Like me, she feels uncomfortable in the clothing of her ancestors
It's not easy, she would say
Ripping her fingers into the ashtray
It's not easy to erase your blood
Jimmy:
Rock me now
Emily:
Ahem, sing with me
Jimmy:
In the arms of cobwebs
Roll me out
In the arms of cobwebs
Emily:
Next she found a man to treasure
And together they planted flowers of warning, fearing frost
Late on shallow evenings while their enemies slept
They hammered the soil, asking for answers in green
His value declined when he offered his name
Why did he offer?
Jimmy:
His value declined...
Emily:
Ah ah ah ah ah, ah ah ah ah ah

Emily:
When she was seven years old she saw a man get shot, but
No one came for a long time,
Because it happened in a remote parking lot in Las Vegas
She was waiting for her mom to come back
From working the blackjack table at the Circus-Circus casino and
That night her mom said that the two of them, and the now dead guy
Were the only three people who ever really lived in Las Vegas
Everybody else just arrived,
Ate their complimentary shrimp cocktail
And left.
Jimmy:
Rock me now
In the arms of cobwebs
Emily:
It's a one-room city, yeah, it's a one-room city here
So can you roll me
Jimmy:
Roll me out
In the arms of cobwebs

Emily:
You rent a one-room city here,
It's a one-room city here
The wall-to-wall-to-wall-to-wall
Goes street to street to street.
Frequency so low held on a string
A string that only plays solos
Rain made of echoes
Tidal wave rushing on and on
Under the water you scream so loud
But the silence surrounds you
But I hear it loud when you fall in the deep and I'll always find you
If my red eyes don't see you anymore
And I can't hear you through the white noise
Just send your heart beat, I'll go
To the blue ocean floor
Where they'll find us no more
On the Blue Ocean Floor
On the Blue Ocean Floor
On the Blue Ocean Floor
On the Blue Ocean Floor
On the Blue Ocean Floor
Shell made out of gold
Found on a beach picked up in your hand held so close
Rain washed out its glow, heart beat steady leads me down below
And under the water you scream so loud
But the silence surrounds you
But I hear it loud when you fall in the deep and I'll always find you
If my red eyes don't see you anymore
And I can't hear you through the white noise
Just send your heart beat, I'll go to the blue ocean floor
Where they'll find us no more
On the Blue Ocean Floor
On the Blue Ocean Floor
On the Blue Ocean Floor
On the Blue Ocean Floor
On the Blue Ocean Floor
20,000 leagues away catch up to you on the same day
Travel at the speed of light thinking the same thought at the same time
Heartbeat's at a steady pace, I'll let the rhythm show me the way
No one can find us here, fade out and disappear
If my red eyes don't see you anymore
And I can't hear you through the white noise
Just send your heart beat, I'll go to the blue ocean floor
Where they'll find us no more
On the Blue Ocean Floor
On the Blue Ocean Floor
On the Blue Ocean Floor
On the Blue Ocean Floor
On the Blue Ocean Floor
Instrumental
This is the room where we always dreamed of grass and splendid evenings
Emitting frequencies, lost between the leaves and things
And I held on brightly, crushing quietly
Feeling mountains rising out of make-believe seas, creating typhoons
Of feelings not easily made without need
God bless that smile on your face
God bless the seeds in the ground
God bless my family's keen gaze,
Oh, I know
That whatever happens to you,
Whatever happens to me,
I hope that I'll fall asleep
Knowing that you'll always be
The story with no ending
The whole slew blossomed beautifully,
And I was beside myself
So I gave into your love
As you rapturously commanded
And this is like I have always dreamed:
Cobblestone and dusty feet
That's the way it should always be
Head over heels and deftly
Wonderful and healthy
God bless that smile on your face
God bless the seeds in the ground
God bless my family's keen gaze,
Oh, I know
That whatever happens to you,
Whatever happens to me,
I hope that I'll fall asleep
Knowing that you'll always be
The story with no ending
I never thought you were here
You've never left me, have you?
You've never left me at all
Not once, and
I'm sorry I'm such a bore
I'm sorry I am so hard
I swear to God, I'll be good
From now on, and
God bless that smile on your face
God bless the seeds in the ground
God bless my family's keen gaze,
Oh, I know
That whatever happens to you,
Whatever happens to me,
I hope that I'll fall asleep
Knowing that you'll always be
The story with no ending
For 27 years I've been trying to believe and confide in
Different people I've found.
Some of them got closer than others
Some wouldn't even bother and then you came around
I didn't really know what to call you, you didn't know me at all
But I was happy to explain.
I never really knew how to move you
So I tried to intrude through the little holes in your veins
And I saw you
But that's not an invitation
That's all I get
If this is communication
I disconnect 
I've seen you, I know you
But I don't know
How to connect, so I disconnect
You always seem to know where to find me and I'm still here behind you
In the corner of your eye.
I'll never really learn how to love you
But I know that I love you through the hole in the sky.
Where I see you 
And that's not an invitation
That's all I get
If this is communication
I disconnect 
I've seen you, I know you
But I don't know
How to connect, so I disconnect
Well this is an invitation
It's not a threat
If you want communication
That's what you get
I'm talking and talking
But I don't know
How to connect 
And I hold a record for being patient
With your kind of hesitation
I need you, you want me
But I don't know
How to connect, so I disconnect
I disconnect.
Love, I hope we get old
I hope we can find a way of seeing it all
Love, I hope we can be
I hope I can find a way of letting you see
That I'm so easy to please, so easy
Love, I hope we grow old
I hope we can find a way of seeing it all
Love, I hope we can be
I hope I can find a way of letting you see
That I'm so easy to please, so easy
I thought I felt your shape but I was wrong
Really all I felt was falsely strong
I held on tight and closed my eyes
It was dumb, I had no sense of your size
It was dumb to hold so tight
But last night on your birthday in the kitchen
My grip was loose, my eyes were open
I felt your shape and heard you breathing
I felt the rise and fall of your chest
I felt your fall, your winter snows
Your gusty blow, your lava flow
I felt it all, your starry night
Your lack of light
With limp arms I can feel most of you
I hung around your neck independently
And my loss was overwhelmed
By this new depth I don't think I ever felt
But I don't know, my nights are cold
And I remember warmth, I could have sworn
I wasn't alone
Double OT
I'm a new three
Saucin', saucin', I'm saucin' on you
I'm swaggin', I'm swaggin', I'm swaggin' oh ooh
I'm ballin', I'm ballin', Iverson on you

I ain't rich yet, but you know I ain't broke, I
So if I see it, I like it, buy that from the store, I
I'm with some white girls and they lovin' the coca

Double OT like I'm KD, smokin' OG
And you know me, in my 2-3s and my gold teeth
Bitch I'm smiling, bet you see me from the nosebleeds
I'm the new 3 and I change out to my new 3s
White Iverson
When I started ballin' I was young
You gon' think about me when I'm gone

Slumped over like a dead man
Red and black, 'bout my bread, man

Lace up, learn a lesson

My options right when I walk in, jump all them Jordans

Like I'm Davis from New Orleans
Or bitch I'm Harden, I don't miss nothin'
Fuck practice, this shit just happens, know y'all can't stand it

High average, ball on these bastards, it makes me happy
It's tragic, I make it happen, and all y'all Shaqtin'
White Iverson
When I started ballin' I was young

Watch out, watch out, watch out, yeah
That's my shot, that's my shot, that's my shot yeah
Spendin', I'm spendin' all my fuckin' pay
I'm feeling shyer and the world gets darker
Hold yourself a little higher
Bridge that gap just further
And all your being
I'd ask you to give it up
An ancient feeling love
So beautifully dressed up
Feeling shyer, I'm feeling shyer
I'm feeling shyer
Maybe you should call her
Deep in the night for her
And all your being
I'd ask you to give it up
I'd ask you to give it up
Hang it up now or never
Hang it up again
(Hang it up now or never)
Hang it up now or never
Hang it up again
Hang it up now or never
Hang it up again
Doesn't seem like anything you're saying or doing or doing

You want to be by yourself and all alone
Hang it up now or never

Hold tight, fire's almost out
Keep quiet, we'll hold
Feels like, the time to start
Feel closer now
Hold tight, fire's almost out
Keep quiet, we'll hold
Feels like, fire's almost out
Feel closer now
Riding with them boys and girls and we're high
All we want to do is have a good time
Young wild and reckless is how we live life
Pray that we make it to twenty-one, one, one, one, whoa, whoa
We make it to twenty-one, one, one, one, whoa
Riding with them boys and girls and we're high
All we want to do is have a good time
Young wild and reckless is how we live life
Pray that we make it to twenty-one, one, one, one, whoa, whoa
We make it to twenty-one, one, one, one, whoa
I'm glad we were able to talk about her vice and her evils
There's a more important topic I'd like to discuss
The dysfunctional bastards of the Ronald Reagan Era
Young men that learned to do everything spiteful
This is your generation
Live fast and die young
Who's willing to explain this story?
Riding with them boys and girls and we're high
All we want to do is have a good time
Young wild and reckless is how we live life
Pray that we make it to twenty-one, one, one, one, whoa, whoa
We make it to twenty-one, one, one, one, whoa
Riding with them boys and girls and we're high
All we want to do is have a good time
Young wild and reckless is how we live life
Pray that we make it to twenty-one, one, one, one
What are you afraid of?
I know that you are
Keep it in your sights now
And don't let it go far
What are you afraid of?
Making it better
Keep it by your side now
Whatever the weather
Keep it together
Keep it together
What did you do?
Wonder where your heart came from
What have you done?
My only friend keep on
Wander or leave
Turn into winter lights
Keeping your strength
When it gets dark at night
What are you made of?
Water and glass
Keep it in your sights now
It's keeping you up
Keep it together
Keep it together
What did you do?
Wonder where your heart came from
What have you done?
My only friend keep on
Wander or leave
Turn into winter lights
Keeping your strength
When it gets dark at night
Keep on, keep on
Keep the straight line
I'm running, running
The straight line
What did you do?
Wonder where your heart came from
What have you done?
My only friend keep on
Wander or leave
Turn into winter lights
Keeping your strength
When it gets dark at night
What you're feeling?
It's what I'm feeling, too
What you're made of?
It's what I'm made of, too
What are you afraid of?
I know that you are
What are you afraid of?
I know that you are
I'm glad you came around today
I sure need a good companion
I'm losing it but you're the same
Without you I move at random
Abusing 'cause you're a friend
And there's no Jesus here to explain
And take me higher
Come take me higher
Come take me high above our time
Take me higher
Oh take me higher
Come take me high above our time
We'll make it out of here?oh yeah
You justify, you're not afraid
And I won't feel like this forever
You wait with me, because you know
There's so much more than this before we go
To take us higher
Come take us higher
Come take us high above our time
Take us higher
Oh take us higher
Come take us high above our time
We'll make it out of here
Come take us out of here
Take us anywhere?oh yeah
You know how we've grown
And how they catch our every tone
Everyone's a writer
But I see the pictures of every life
And the day they die
But it's your image burnt into my mind
And again will I find
That it's worth the climb
And I love that it's right on time
Our love comes back in the middle of the night
Our love comes back in the middle of the night
Our love comes back in the middle of the night
Our love comes back in the middle of the night
Our love comes back in the middle of the night
Our love comes back in the middle of the night
Between a crucifix,
And the Hollywood sign,
We decided to get hurt.
Now, there's a few things,
We have to burn.
Set our hearts ablaze,
And every city was a gift,
And every skyline,
Was like a kiss upon the lips,
And I was making you a wish,
In every skyline.
How big, how blue, how beautiful.
How big, how blue, how beautiful.
And, meanwhile, a man was falling from space,
And everyday I wore your face,
Like an atmosphere around me,
A satellite inside me.
And, meanwhile, a man was falling from space,
As he hit the Earth, I left this place,
Let the atmosphere surround me,
A satellite beside me.
What are we gonna do?
We've opened the door,
And now it's all coming through.
Tell me you see it too?
We've opened our eyes,
And it's changing the view.
Whoa, what are we gonna do?
We've opened the door,
Now it's all coming through.
How big, how blue, how (beautiful),
How big, how blue, how (beautiful).
And every city was a gift,
And every skyline,
Was like a kiss upon the lips,
And I was making you a wish,
In every skyline,
(Kiss upon the lips).
And, meanwhile, a man was falling from space,
And everyday I wore your face,
Like an atmosphere around me,
I'm happy you're beside me.
What are we gonna do?
We've opened the door,
And now it's all coming through.
Tell me you see it too?
We've opened our eyes,
And it's changing the view.
Whoa, what are we gonna do?
We've opened the door,
And now it's all coming through.
How big, how blue, how beautiful,
How big, how blue, how beautiful,
How big, how blue, how...
So much time on the other side,
Waiting for you to wake up.
So much time on the other side,
Waiting for you to wake up.
Maybe I'll see you in another life,
If this one wasn't enough.
So much time on the other side.
How big, how blue, how beautiful,
How big, how blue, how...
No more light green leaves
This summer held no words
I would not have come home this year
But I'm still not a bird
If it takes all summer long
Just to write one simple song
There's too much to focus on
Clearly that is something wrong
How long have I been in this storm?
So overwhelmed by the ocean's shapeless form
Water's getting harder to tread
With these waves crashing over my head
If I could just see you
Everything would be all right
If I'd see you
This darkness will turn to light
And I will walk on water
And you will catch me if I fall
And I will get lost into your eyes
I know everything will be all right
I know everything is all right
I know you didn't bring me out here to drown
So why am I ten feet under and upside down?
Barely surviving has become my purpose
'Cause I'm so used to living underneath the surface
If I could just see you
Everything would be all right
If I'd see you
This darkness will turn to light
And I will walk on water
And you will catch me if I fall
And I will get lost into your eyes
I know everything will be all right
And I will walk on water
And you will catch me if I fall
And I will get lost into your eyes
I know everything will be all right
I know everything is all right
Everything's all right
Everything's all right
I forgot fools run
Between, half the time I'm so dead
It's okay - this'll help, inside
I won't fall behind
I won't forget all that I've done
Don't be scared it's over now, I swear
Try to push it back
Try to keep from missing love
It's okay - this'll help, inside
I won't fall behind
I won't forget all that I've done
Don't be scared
It's fine
It's okay, it's over now
I was drunk again, causing accidents.
Oh, you're not a friend,
You're nothing.
I think I should be a little more confident.
In myself,
In my skin.
Take me, take me, home.
Take me, take me, home.
'Cause I don't stand a chance in these four walls.
And he don't recognise me anymore.
Burned out flames should never re-ignite.
But I thought you might...
Take me, take me, home.
Take me, take me, home.
Now he's moving close,
My heart in my throat.
I won't say a word,
But I think he knows...
That I've hardly slept,
Since the night he left.
His body always kept,
Mine inside of it.
Keep the nightmares out,
Give me mouth to mouth.
I can't live without ya,
Take me to your house.
Take me, take me, home.
Take me, take me, home. (Take, take, take, take...)
Take me, take me, home. (Me, me, me, me...)
Take me, take me, home. (Home, home, home...)
But I thought you might...
Take me, take me, home, home.
Take me, take me, home, home.
Home.
Only when the goal is unattainable
Do I start to feel like I'm losing myself
And this deep secret that hasn't come out yet
Is buried down deep with the rest
I can't coerce you into this one
Jealousy lay all your spells to bed
I'll choose unloved instead
If only songs were sung to guide the doubtful ones
Beyond the rough where not as much is good enough
Oh if you find yourself amongst the lonely ones
I will be waiting here with open arms
I can't coerce you into this one
Jealousy lay all your spells to bed
I'll choose unloved instead
If the road I travel goes bad
If the life I live comes unhappy or sad
I close my eyes, and I dream of my butterfly
Coming down to rescue me
She's my butterfly
She's my butterfly
If the road I travel goes bad
If the life I live comes unhappy or sad
I close my eyes, and I dream of my butterfly
Coming down to rescue me
She's my butterfly
She's my butterfly
Ah She's my butterfly
Yah, She's my butterfly
(She's my butterfly) She's my butterfly
(She's my butterfly) She's my butterfly
(She's my butterfly) She's my butterfly
(She's my butterfly) She's my butterfly
Ah, She's my butterfly butterfly butterfly
Yah, She's my butterfly butterfly butterfly
I said, She's my butterfly butterfly butterfly
I said, She's my butterfly butterfly butterfly
And you don't know it
What hides inside me
If nothing's so different
Don't close the door
I'm not asking for more
Oh god, I'd give my life for you
For just one second that was true
Keep me feeling so brand new
You know why yesterday was a lie
And even when you're sad
I walk away
And even when you're happy
I stay
Did I sell my soul for this feeling
So long ago
Did I give my heart for that waste
Of time
I'm not asking for much
Don't hide me
Then you'll wander in my heart
Did I sell my soul for that feeling
You know why yesterday was a lie
I can't keep thinkin' I was right
Don't go
Darling you're with me, always around me
Only love, only love
Darling I feel you, under my body
Only love, only love
Give me shelter, or show me heart
Come on love, come on love
Watch me fall apart, watch me fall apart
And I'll be yours to keep
A wind in the shadow, a whale song in the deep
A wind in the shadow, a whale song in the deep
Darling you're with me, always around me
Only love, only love
Darling I feel you, under my body
Only love, only love
Give me shelter, or show me heart
Come on love, come on love
Watch me fall apart, watch me fall apart
And I'll be yours to keep
A wind in the shadow, a whale song in the deep
A wind in the shadow, a whale song...
Darling you're with me, always around me
Only love, only love
Darling I feel you, under my body
Only love, only love
Give me shelter, or show me heart
Come on love, come on love
Watch me fall apart, watch me fall apart
Watch me fall apart, watch me fall apart, watch me fall apart
(Only love)
Only love, love, love
Only love, love, love
Only love, love, love
Girl show me heart
Come on love, love, love
Come on love, love, love
Come on love, love, love
Watch me fall apart
Come on love love love
Come on love love love
Come on love love love
Girl show me heart
Show me love, love, love
Show me love, love, love
Show me love, love, love
Watch me fall apart
(Watch me fall apart)
Darling I feel you under my body
Darling you're with me forever and always
Give me shelter or show me heart
And watch me fall apart, watch me fall apart
They won't know who we are
So we both can pretend
It's written on the mountains
A line that never ends
As the devil spoke we spilled out on the floor
And the pieces broke and the people wanted more
And the rugged wheel is turning another round
Dorian, carry on
Will you come along to the end
Will you ever let us carry on
Swaying like the children
Singled out for praise
The inside out on the open
With the straightest face
As the sad-eyed woman spoke we missed our chance
The final dying joke caught in our hands
And the rugged wheel is turning another round
Dorian, carry on
Will you come along to the end
Will you ever let us carry on
Dorian will you follow us down
I undressed you with my eyes I have
Maybe even raped you
In a dark and eerie corner of my mind
I tucked you there
And touched you in a dream last night
Pushed you aside when you entered
My thoughts at the wrong time
I have sat up upon your lap and
Saddled my thighs around your hips like ropes
I rode you on a chair and in the shower
And all the while I clung heavy to your back
My desire deeply harnessed in your spine
While I squeezed you like a tree trunk
You may have been one
Sexless and comfort in your mind
Even barer than a child's
I'm riding recklessly through a thick and humid
Jungle growing anxious with the deep and primal
Yearning that stirs
Deeply pulsing up toward the surface
Like sap rising or honey or tar
The night.
She brushed her hands upon my flushed cheek
Smelled of childhood remnants of a dusty weeping willow
Clouds soothe, Shredded by the calico
Were oh so vast and quick as I was on my own now.
This time like every other time I believe that I never find
Another sweet little girl with secret sea foam eyes
Ocean lapping voice smile coy as the brightest quiet span of sky
And I'm all alone again tonight not again, not again, not again.
And don't it feel all right, and don't it feel so nice
Lovely. Lovely, lovely
Say it again, say it again.
Still I'm unable to inhale all the riches
As I'm awkward as a wound on my bones
Still I've got cobblestone joints and plate glass points
As I'm all by myself tonight not again not again
And don't it feel all right., and don't it feel so nice
Lovely. Lovely, lovely
Say it again, say it again.
And if you should nervously break down
When its time for the shakedown would you take it
It's when you cry just a little
But you laugh in the middle that you've made it
And don't it feel all right, and don't it feel so nice.
Lovely.
Say it again. Lovely. So lovely. to do it again
Again. Loving again. It's coming again.
Lovely...
Piss-poor, ride in her sun bathing fireside
We're here for the porn and the sirloin
Get your T-bone
Let your backbone slide
Tunnel and sky collide
Lose friends to the air waves and the airlines
I wanna make it right
Some future in my eyes, bright
Hush don't explain
When you water down my name
I'll be up too late
Call me when you get
Better at your game
You haven't beat me yet
The waitress
The actress
Got the skin and the bones
With a hairbrush and an air brush
She'd be white gold
She asked the piss-poor "Why you lookin' for that
Party in the sky
It's just a movie 'bout a movie to old to die"
But I'm gonna make it right
Future in my eyes, bright
Hush, don't explain
When you water down my name
I'll be up too late
Call me when you get
Better at your game
You haven't beat me yet
Though my vision is strainin'
I'm gonna make it right
Some future in my eyes, bright
Hush, don't explain
When you water down my name
I'll be up too late
Call me when you get
Better at your game
You haven't beat me yet
Baby says I can't come with him.
And I had read all of this
In his eyes.
Long before he even said so,
Why go? I asked.
You know,
And I know why.
And it'll be just as quiet
When I leave
As it was
When I first got here.
I don't expect anything,
I don't expect anything...
Take care.
I've been hurt before.
Too much time spent
On closing doors.
You may hate me,
But I'll remember to love you.
Goodbye,
Don't cry.
You know why.
And it'll be just as quiet
When I leave
As it was
When I first got here.
I don't expect anything,
I don't expect anything...
All the waves of blame arrange as broken scenery,
As they steal your best memories away.
What if I was someone different in your only history?
Would you feel the same
As I walk out the door?
Never to see your face again;
Never to see your face again.
And it'll be just as quiet
When I leave
As it was
When I first got here.
It'll be just
As quiet,
When I leave
As it was
When I first got here.
I don't expect anything,
I don't expect anything,
I don't expect anything,
I don't expect anything,
I don't expect anything,
I don't expect anything
To change
When I leave.
Don't think it's what you're afraid of
Come in you know what's been made up
Hold you tight, words have a new sound
Reading the signs that just seep out
You've got to leave it
"Don't you go evade me now
Come see what you've done"
Each of your reasons has broken
Call it off once you have spoken
Filled to the top then split open
Repeating over and over
Now you have to leave it
"Don't you go evade me now
Come see what you've done
I've been thinking lately how
All these feelings won"
Oh, noose
Tied myself in, tied myself too tight
Looking kind of anxious in your cross-armed stance
Like a bad tempered prom queen at a homecoming dance
And I claim I'm not excited with my life anymore
So I blame this town, this job, these friends, the truth is it's myself
And I'm trying to understand myself and pinpoint who I am
When I finally get it figured out, I've changed the whole damn plan
Oh, noose
Tied myself in, tied myself too tight
Oh, noose
Tied myself in, tied myself too tight
Talking shit about a pretty sunset
Blanketing opinions that I'll probably regret soon
Changed my mind so much I can't even trust it
My mind changed me so much I can't even trust myself
I always knew you in your mothers arms
I have called your name, I've an idea
Placed in your mind to be a better man
I've made a crown for you, put it in your room
And when the bride groom comes, there will be noise
There will be glad and a perfect bed
And when you write a poem
I know the words, I know the sounds
Before you write it down
When you wear your clothes
I wear them too, I wear your shoes
And the jacket too, I always knew you
In your mothers arms, I have called you son
I've made amends between father and son
Or if you haven't one, rest in my arms
Sleep in my bed, there's a design
To what I did and said
Rest in my arms, sleep in my bed
There's a design to what I did and said
Rest in my arms, sleep in my bed
There's a design to what I did and said
Rest in my arms, sleep in my bed
There's a design to what I did and said
Rest in my arms, sleep in my bed
There's a design to what I did and said
Rest in my arms, sleep in my bed
There's a design to what I did and said
Rest in my arms, sleep in my bed
There's a design to what I did and said
Rest in my arms, sleep in my bed
There's a design to what I did and said
Rest in my arms, sleep in my bed
There's a design to what I did and said
Rest in my arms, sleep in my bed
There's a design to what I did and said
Rest in my arms, sleep in my bed
There's a design to what I did and said
Rest in my arms, sleep in my bed
There's a design to what I did and said
Rest in my arms, sleep in my bed
There's a design to what I did and said
Rest in my arms, sleep in my bed
There's a design to what I did and said
Oh Mary of silence
You pick my heart with a smile
Oh sweet Mary
Come inside for a while
Help me get a hold on you
Or I will
I thought of myself beside you
Take me into your skin
Oh, sweet Mary of silence
Oh, sweet Mary of silence
We have a steady confusion
You're looking at fear
It doesn't seem like the first time
You walked out in a hurry
I look in
In your window
To check my head in your pane
My last thoughts
They come to me
I can't take the pain
Oh, sweet Mary of silence
Oh, sweet Mary of silence
Help me walk with you
To the sky in?
Shuddering in myself... myself
Oh where
Oh where
Oh where
Sweet Mary of silence
Sweet Mary of silence
Sweet Mary of silence
Don't let them see you cry
When the dam breaks down and the city is covered in water
'Cause I believe we fly
When the moon takes shape and I dose off, on your shoulders
I trust that you see it too
So breathe while you're alive
Let the big band play as you tap leather with your fingers
And I tried to write in style
But the words just come and I write them as soon as I see them
And I trust that you write them too
And I trust that you love me too
Stuck
On the fence with you
This I'm always prone to do
Forge something new
And leave it all behind with you
And leave it all behind with you
Back at the front of the...
I see all those boys again
I shift through you
And leave it all behind, it's true
And leave it all behind, it's true
Faceless fall from this life and ah, if you can't
See the star, probably gone too far
Like the voice that cried on the lonesome tide
Like the wave was the only love it ever saw
"What's this dying for?"
Asks the stork that soars
With the owl, high above
Canyons mighty walls
Owl said, "Death's a door
That love walks through
In and out, in and out
Back and forth, back and forth"
Turn from the fear of the storms that might be
Oh, let it free, that caged on fire thing
Oh, hold its hands, it'll feel like lightning
Oh, in your arms safe from the storms
Sky bends, the moon's dress' slung low, slung low
Dog star taught a dance
It goes, goes, goes, goes, goes, goes, goes
Arms out, knees bend, the motion flows
Like the soft, open petals of a Jessica Rose
So serious
So it falls apart
It just reveals the perfect nothing
Of everything you are, everything we are
Candle of life lights the blights and bruises
Oh, lay it down in the night, let it soothe this
Oh, hold its hands and we'll know what truth is
Oh, in its arms safe from the storms
If you want to find yourself by traveling out west
Or if you want to find somebody else that's better
Go ahead
Go ahead
If you want to buy a brand new fancy automobile
Or if you want to build a place up in cold-water canyon
Go ahead
Go ahead
Go ahead
I wish you would
Go ahead
If you want to hold your own hand going up that cliff
Or if you want to just hold back cause you ain't up to it
Go ahead
Go ahead
Go ahead
Be my guest
Go ahead
If you want to hold on to the first girl that you meet
Or if you want to settle down and plant roses at my feet
Go ahead
Go ahead
Go ahead
I wish you would
Go ahead
If you want to have your cake and eat it too
And if you want to have other people watch you while you eat it
Go ahead
Go ahead
Go ahead
Be my guest
Go ahead
If you want better things
I want you to have them
If you want better things
Then I want you to have them
Go ahead
Go ahead
Go ahead
I wish you would
Go ahead
Go ahead
I wish you would
Go ahead
Where is the sea?
I don't know why, I was just looking for the sea
But the only thing I found was a desert
A desert around me
What can I see?
You close my eyes when I just need to go and see
If you want me to be blind, I will stay here
With this desert around me
The world I can see is a nowhere land
Without you, I'm a nowhere girl
In the desert
In the desert with you
Where is the sea?
I don't know why, I was just looking for the sea
But the only thing I found was a desert
A desert around me
Where is the sea?
I am alone. I am dreaming of the sea
But you are not here next to me
The world I can see is a nowhere land
Without you, I'm a nowhere girl
In the desert
In the desert with you
Oh, the cold wet wind blew over the heather
You wrote "Charlie and Mary for forever"
On the back of a rock
That you picked up on the way
And in that perfect moment
I nearly ruined it
By saying, "I love you" and nearly meaning it
But you know I would never waste those words
Oh, when I last saw Mary
She lied and said it was her birthday
Oh, when I last saw Mary
She lied and said it was her birthday
But then she tried to kiss me
And I said, "Don't bother.
You know we don't really love one another.
And there's no use in burning out this flame."
Oh, but then things changed
In a way I couldn't predict
She said, "I love you." and it suddenly clicked
That she was only saying what she wanted me to hear
And I said, "Please don't lie to me, Mary."
And I said, "Please don't lie to me, Mary."
I said, "Please don't lie.
Oh. it makes me cry in bed"
I said, "Please don't lie.
Oh. it makes me cry in bed"
I said, "Please don't lie.
Oh. it makes me cry in bed"
And she said, "Shut your mouth.
You don't know what you're talking about."
Oh she said, "Shut your mouth.
You don't know what you're talking about."
Drive slow, homie
Drive slow, homie
You never know, homie, might meet some hoes, homie
You need to pump your brakes and drive slow, homie
My homie Marley used to stay 79th and May
One of my best friends from back in the day
Down the street from Calumet, a school for the Stones
He nicknamed me K-Rock so they would leave me alone
Bulls jacket with his hat broke way off
And walked around the mall with his radio face off
Plus he had the spinner from his Daytons in his hand
Keys in his hand, reason again to let you know he's the man
Back when we rocked Ellesses, he had dreams of Caprices
Drove by the teachers, even more by polices
How'd he get the cash? The day his father passed away
Left him with a little somethin', sixteen he was stuntin'
Al B. Sure nigga with the hair all wavy
Hit Lake Shore, girls go all crazy
Hit the freeway, go at least 'bout eighty
Boned so much that summer, even had him a baby
See back-back then-then, if you had a car
You was the Chi-Town version of Baby
And I was just a virgin, a baby
One of the reasons I looked up to him crazy
I used to love to play my demo tape when the system yanked
Felt like I was almost signed when the shit got cranked
We'd take a Saturday and just circle the mall
They had they Lincolns and Auroras, we was hurtin' 'em all
With the girls a lot of flirtin' involved, but dog
Fuck all that flirtin', I'm tryin' to get in some drawers
So put me on with these hoes, homie
He told me don't rush to get grown, drive slow, homie
Drive slow, homie
Drive slow
You never know, homie, might meet some hoes, homie
You need to pump your brakes and drive slow, homie
Paul Wall:
What it do? I'm posted up in the parking lot, my trunk waving
The candy gloss is immaculate, it's simply amazing
Them elbows pokin' wide on that candy 'Lac
Trunk open, screens on, neons lit with fifth relaxed
I'm on a mission for dime-pieces and sexy ladies
Allow me to introduce you to my CL Mercedes
It's a star-studded event when I valet park
Open up my mouth and sunlight illuminates the dark
You see them fours crawling? You see them screens falling?
The disco ball in my mouth insinuates I'm ballin'
I'm leaning on the switch, sitting crooked in my slab
But I could still catch boppers if I drove a cab
A young Houston hard hitter all about the scrilla
Ridin' something candy coated, crawling like a caterpillar
I'm tipping on them fours, I'm jamming on that Screw
I'm looking for them hoes, baby, what it do? Drive slow, homie
GLC and Kanye West:
Turn your hazard lights of when you see them hoes (Drive slow, homie)
If you're riding around the city with nowhere to go (Drive slow, homie)
Live today, 'cause tomorrow, man, you never know
(You never know, homie, might meet some hoes, homie
You need to pump your brakes and drive slow, homie)
(My car's like the movie, my car's like the crib
I got more TVs in here than where I live)
And that don't make no sense, but baby, I'm the shit
And everything I flip, you know it's something serious
I got the custom grill, I got the Brabus rims
I got the baller genetics, baby, this evidence
You see a player flicking, and how you ain't convinced
That you should go on and kiss it, just a little bit (Just a little bit)
I got my custom kicks, I got my Jesus chain
My canaries is gleamin' through my angel wings
They see me, hoes actin' like they seen a king
With that mean lean, smoking on that finest Cali green
My woodgrain oak, I'm ridin' on Vogues
My cylinder quiet, like tip-toes
I sold O's, and this I know
When you see them hoes, little homie, drive slow
Kanye West:
Yeah, drive slow, homie
Drive slow, homie
You never know, homie, might meet some hoes, homie
You need to pump your brakes and drive slow, homie
Drive slow, homie
Fog's rollin' in off the East River bank
Like a shroud, it covers Bleecker Street
Fills the alleys where men sleep
Hides the shepherd from the sheep
Voices leaking from a sad café
Smiling faces try to understand
I saw a shadow touch a shadow's hand
On Bleecker Street
A poet reads his crooked rhyme
Holy, holy is his sacrament
Thirty dollars pays your rent
On Bleecker Street
I heard a church bell softly chime
In a melody sustainin'
It's a long road to Caanan
On Bleecker Street
Mm-mm-mm-mm
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Bleecker Street
A finger's touch upon my lips
It's a morning yearning
Pull the courtains shut, try to keep it dark
But the sun is burning
The world awakens on the run
And will soon be earning
With hopes of better days to come
It's a morning yearning
Another day, another chance to get it right
Must I still be learning
Baby crying kept us up all night
With her morning yearning
Like a summer rose, I'm a victim of the fall
But I'm soon returning
Your love's the warmest place the sun ever shines
My morning yearning
Everyday in every way I'm falling
Everything that everyone says turns me on
Shine a light on me
So that everyone can see
That I wanna stay here indefinitely
Time exists but just on your wrists, so don't panic
Moments last and lifetimes are lost in a day
So wind your watches down, please
'Cause there is no time to lose
And I'm gonna stay here, indefinitely
And I wanna stay here, so just let me be
Now I can see the light circle around your reflection
And I'm gonna stay here indefinitely
And I'm gonna stay here so just let me be
Indefinitely
Indefinitely
Indefinitely
Indefinitely
Indefinitely
Indefinitely
Common and Gil Scott-Heron:
Yeah
(I'm on way home)
Common:
They say home is where the hate is, my dome is where fate is
I stroll where souls get lost like Vegas
Seen through the eyes of rebel glasses
Pray to God that my arms reach the masses
The young smoke grass in grassless jungles
Rubber band together in cashless bundles
We wear strugglin' chains, divided only hustle remains
Makin' sense of it, we hustle for change
Revolution ain't a game it's another name for life fightin'
Someone to stay in they corner like Mike Tyson
Hypes fightin' for hits to heighten they hell
Don't he know he could only get as high as he fell?
Show money becomes bail, relationships become jail
Children are unheld, I wish love was for sale
Behold the pale horse got me trapped like R. Kell, I bail and it
Gil Scott-Heron:
Might not be such a bad idea if I never, never went home again
I'm on my way home
I left three days ago, but no one seems to know I'm gone
Home is where the hatred is
Home is filled with pain and it
Might not be such a bad idea if I never, never went home again
I don't know if I can do this alone
Oh after all our sweet love has flown
I've been runnin'
I've been skipping like a stone
And I don't know if I can do this alone
When I met her she was standing by a door
I ain't never seen a light like that before
Now she's left me for something more sure
And I don't know if I can do this anymore
Lovers will come
Lovers will go
And it's a rare seed
From which true love might grow
And if you see her won't you please say hello
'Cause I don't know if I can do this alone
Everybody says
I'm a lonesome kind of guy
I've been defeated by them all
If they can find me
I'm done
Everybody knows
That it really doesn't matter at all
All the good things that I've done
I'm up against the wall
How come
My file has been deleted
If this is what they want
I can tell you
That the order's alphabetical
Don't you get it?
Sooner or later
I'll be recruited by someone
Everybody knows that it really doesn't matter at all
Everybody says
I shouldn't mess with you no more
If you see me on my own
Drive on
If I were dismissed
I would've gotten much more
If I wasn't that kind
I wouldn't care at all
Sooner or later, sooner or later
Sooner or later
I'll change my whole perspective
If this is what they want
I can tell you
That the order's alphabetical
Don't you get it?
Sooner or later
I'll be recruited by someone
Isn't it better
Sooner or later, sooner or later
Sooner or later
I'll change my whole perspective
I'll be recruited by someone.
There's a pleasure we must all feel
And it's a pleasure I know
Of losing your heart
And then letting love grow
What can I say any simpler
Than now is all there is
That you're free to be any person
And you're all that you give
'Cause my bones were made in the womb
And now the brains are leaving my tomb
And every piece will be consumed
By the love my heart endured
But if you do what you do
Yeah, you'll do fine
Yeah, if you do what you do
Yeah, well, you'll do fine
Oh, and when love comes a-calling
Don't forget the tune
And when love comes a-calling
Don't forget the tune
And just do what you do
Oh, and the ones who taught you how to live
Oh, they know no more than you
So if you trust what's in your heart
Oh, what better can you do
Than if you do what you do
Yeah, you'll do fine
I use the lock that has no key, bind you with chains
But no one else can see
Let the water creep over your face, I'll send it in waves
Just to watch you perform the great escape
How long can you hold your breath?
While you hold mine I cannot wait
Just to watch you perform the great escape
I'll pull your arms tight behind your back, use myself as weight
And wonder why you fade
How long can you hold your breath?
While you hold mine, I cannot wait
Just to watch you perform the great escape
Calm down
Deep breaths
And get yourself dressed instead
Of running around
And pulling all your threads saying
Breaking yourself up
If it's a broken part, replace it
If it's a broken arm then brace it
If it's a broken heart then face it
And hold your own
Know your name
And go your own way
Hold your own
Know your own name
And go your own way
And everything will be fine
Hang on
Help is on the way
Stay strong
I'm doing everything
Hold your own
Know your name
And go your own way
Hold your own
Know your name
And go your own way
And everything, everything will be fine
Everything
Are the details in the fabric
Are the things that make you panic
Are your thoughts results of static cling?
Are the things that make you blow
Hell, no reason, go on and scream
If you're shocked it's just the fault
Of faulty manufacturing.
Yeah everything will be fine
Everything in no time at all
Everything
Hold your own
And know your name
And go your own way
Are the details in the fabric (Hold your own, know your name)
Are the things that make you panic
Are your thoughts results of static cling? (Go your own way)
Are the details in the fabric (Hold your own, know your name)
Are the things that make you panic (Go your own way)
Is it Mother Nature's sewing machine?
Are the things that make you blow (Hold your own, know your name)
Hell no reason go on and scream
If you're shocked it's just the fault (Go your own way)
Of faulty manufacturing
Everything will be fine
Everything in no time at all
Hearts will hold
When you're smoking in tenfold in the morning
It's gonna be a cold day
When you're keeping everything inside you
It can only hurt you 
Unrelated sounds
The sun will shine again
You hold it in your hands
This land is a young land let it stay that way
It's pollution only turns it to
Something you don't wanna see ever grow up
The reflection of the bad you receive
You got on the stars
And the sun won't shine again
So maybe you're all in love
And aluminium
The cling and a clang
Is the metal in my head when I walk
I hear a sort of; this tinging noise
Cling clang
The cling clang
So many things happen while walking
The metal in my head clangs and clings as I walk
Freaks my balance out
So the natural thought
Is just clogged up
Totally clogged up
And we need to unplug these dams
And make the natural flow
It sort of freaks me out
We need to unplug the dams
You cannot stop the natural flow of thought
With a cling and a clang
And wake me up again until
We're aluminium
You hold it in your hands
The sun will shine again
The sun will shine again
The sun will shine again
The sun will shine again
The sun will shine again
The sun will shine again
B.b.b.b. can't you see that I'm smiling???
Can't you see, there's a part of me that's brand new???
Used to be, was a part of me felt like hidin, but now it comes through!
Deep in my heart, that's where the knot comes loose.
Deep in my heart, I will remember you.
All my lovely life I been waitin, hot heels anticipatin.
Another love I found not to let it down.
Deep in my heart, that's where the knot comes loose.
Deep in my heart, I will remember you
Candy told me nothing really matters anymore
When I ask her what she means, she says I ought to know
Candy says she's made arrangements for me in the sand
Candy says she wants me with her down in Candyland
Candy says she wonders why we try
I couldn't think of what to say, I had no ready reply
Candy says I'd like it where she is
She says it's an opportunity I don't want to miss
Candy says she's made arrangements for me in the sand
Candy says she wants me with her down in Candyland
Candy says she wants me with her down in Candyland
Candy asked me if she died, if I could go on
Of course I said I couldn't and of course we knew that's wrong
But Candy, I said, Candy no you can't do that to me
Because you love me way too much for you to ever leave
Candy says she's made arrangements for me in the sand
Candy says she wants me with her down in Candyland
Candy says she's made arrangements for me in the sand
Candy says she wants me with her down in Candyland
Candy says she wants me with her down in Candyland
Candy says she wants me with her down in Candyland
Candy says she wants me with her down in Candyland
December come to me
I hope I can see
You not just in dreams
I will let you be
Why can't you believe
How much you really mean
December won't you come
Back with snow even sun
Don't say that it's done
I will carry you home
Take you from the loneliest
Place you have known
I will carry you home
Take me from the loneliest
Place I have known
Well I can hardly stand
But I really don't care to know
And you can take my hand
But I don't care where we go
And if you think you know
What I'm thinking about
Then I can read your thoughts
Without any doubt
So we can go
Well let's go home
And if I happen to fall
Then please don't pick me up
'Cause we're enjoying our time
And I wouldn't want to interrupt
They worked out so well
When you discovered that it's all the same
We get lost sometimes
But the reality will keep us sane
I know I think too much
I know I waste my time
And I can't figure out
Which one is yours or mine
That's fine
I really couldn't say I mind
Didn't mean to leave you hanging on
I didn't mean to leave you all alone
I didn't know what to say
I didn't know what to say
Didn't mean to leave you hanging on
I didn't mean to leave you all alone
I didn't know what to say
Didn't know what to say
Merry Christmas, baby
(Merry Christmas, baby)
Merry Christmas, baby
(Merry Christmas, baby)
Merry Christmas, baby
(Merry Christmas, baby)
Merry Christmas
Instrumental
Well I watched your black tied family
Rise up from graves near cemeteries
That I have not been to since your goodbye
And I drank another simile
And compared your Jesus to a thief
He took my bones and turned them into bread.
'Cause I can feel your pain, in my bones, in my bones.
I was scared to call your mother
For news that you weren't getting better
Well my God, what the hell am I supposed to do?
And I ran off and ran on to something
That I swore was everything but beautiful
I only say that word for you
'Cause I can feel your pain, in my bones, in my bones.
And I can feel your pain, deep in my bones, deep in my bones.
And hallelujah to the one in our bones
And hallelujah to the one that we love
The wind changed, the first day that you came through
Cut the corn, washed it clean
Now everything that's ever gone before, is just a blur
It's all because of you
And now I find, this cities like a stranger to me
I once was fooled by cadillacs and honey
But no one feels like you
Not like you
Not like you
Not like you
Cause even though the flower fades something takes it's place
A marching band on a sunny day, two pretty eyes or a a pretty face
Then in the forest I made my home
Lay down on hard and ancient stone
Then if my heart should somehow stop
I'll hang on, to the hope
That you're not too late
That you're not too late
And there are times I know when I will have to chase you
The further from my side you go, the longing grows
And though I hate this, I'll still want you,
I will hate this, but I'll still want you
Even though the flower dies somethings by it's side
A helping hand or a kiss goodbye, to ease it on it's way
I would like to think our paths are straight
Disconnected from choices we make
That there is no reason why it can't be like you said
One day it's gonna happen
I don't know when
I'll be on your street
But I know one day it's gonna happen
You're gonna be swept off your feet
I would like someone to make a map
Mark my home and draw some lines that match
All of the reasons why
It can be like you said
One day it's gonna happen
I don't know when
I'll be on your street
But I know one day it's gonna happen
You're gonna be swept off your feet
I don't know when
I don't know why
I don't know when
I don't know why
One day it's gonna happen
I don't know when
I'll be on your street
But I know one day it's gonna happen
You're gonna be swept off your feet
But all that I know is it's gonna happen
I don't know when
I'll be on your street
But I know one day it's gonna happen
You're gonna be swept off your feet
Talking on the phone and watching "Cribs"
He doesn't know what kind of guy he is
He's got a gold-plated ceiling and a TV show
A broken heart and he doesn't even know
He's glad to see you
Yes, he's glad to see you
Open your arms and sing
The world's been waiting, they've been waiting for years
And they've just gotta hear it
The kids are waiting, they've been shedding tears
So open your arms and sing for us
The world can be quiet when you're up too late
I'm just a childhood prisoner of the garden gate
If it's broke then kick it, dust yourself off
Find a quiet place and have a good laugh
I'm glad to see you
Yes, I'm glad to see you
Open your arms and sing
The world's been waiting, they've been waiting for years
And they've just gotta hear it
The kids are waiting, they've been shedding tears
So open your arms and sing for us
Did you believe them when they told you they discovered you?
And that everything is free as long as you do what they tell you to
You think it's true
But nothing could be farther from the truth, my love
Did you even listen when they told you to change your name?
And how nobody wants honesty when looking at a perfect frame
Play the game
But nothing could be further from the truth, my love
And nothing is more powerful than beauty in a wicked world
Play it girl
Play it girl
Play it girl
Does it make you feel good when they tell you what you want to hear?
And after they suck all your soul, well, that's when they'll disappear
Disappear forever, and ever
Like a prince in your little fairy tale
And you will find, the day when they put your soul on sale
That nothing could be further from the truth, my love
And nothing is more powerful than beauty in a wicked world.
Scold me, that's all you've got to say
Coldly hurt me and turn away
You say I'm not sorry that
I'm resolved to what is next
I head for the shadows
Hold me, taking it back in tears
You've told me, slowly confessed your fears
But I've got myself to protect
It's too soon for me to forget
I wait in the shadows
In the shadows, where I end up loved
They help me see that I've finally won
We wait in your heart
So until I truly believe
That your words convey what you mean
I wait in the shadows
I wait in the shadows
I don't mind the shadows
If you can't sleep, I'll be there in your dreams
I'll be there in your dreams
If you can't sleep at all
And in your dreams, I'll touch your cheek
And lay my head on your shoulder
Goodbye, shadows
Goodbye, shadows
If you're far away, if you can't see my face
If the world is cold, but the sun shines the same
Shut your eyes, there are bluer skies
For you're embraced in my heart
Goodbye, shadows
Goodbye, shadows
If you can't sleep, I'll be there in your dreams
I'll be there in your dreams
If you can't sleep at all
And in your dreams, I'll touch your cheek
And lay my head on your shoulder
Leaving the central state from shallow ground
Home in the valley but the rent's paid south
You said the urn was half full when I said it was half empty
With what was left of our fair city
Call in the army corps of architects
To flatten the skyline and begin again
I knew the years would move quickly,
But never quite as fast as this
So bring the discrepancies, I'll pour the drinks
If you wanna ride, you can come out and see me
I could be home by now
When the whistle blows and we pull out slow
This is where I build my home
And I wait for you so patiently
Letting you find your own
If you wanna try, you could come out and see me
I could be home by now
But anywhere I am, tell me you're waiting for me
I could be home by now
When I am old, let the tension flee
I was born crying out and it's come back to me
When everyone else is setting up to fall
I'll just think back on it all
I'll remember long drives sitting in the back
Looking out at endless snow
Waiting in the silence; if you won't spill your heart
I'll chase you for the words you owe
And you know, and you know
And they're begging "come home"
If you wanna ride, you can come out and see me
I could be home by now
Technicolor girls are always on the phone
Talking about their homes
And the conversations continue endlessly.
Technicolor boys, transistor radios
Blasting their treble tones
And the arguments are disputed after school,
In the parking lot as the teachers bend the rules.
Patiently you waited for a courting boy's embrace,
Then everyone would know.
But the letter jacket wasn't yours to own
And it proves to be on temporary loan.
And as they all grow older the truth will be understood,
'Cause we never turn out the way we thought we would.
If you conjure up a fear
Make it loud so I can hear the tambourine
I just want to let you know
I could be your suicide policeman
Don't you go
Till my eyes have left your face
Everybody hopes and waits
I can't believe
Everybody hopes and waits
I can't relate to my predicament
Brother, if you're feeling low
Tell me one thing I should know of your situation
I could stand out in the hall
I could be your suicide policeman
Arrest your fall
When you're afraid to hit the ground
If you take another drag
Of that cigarette would it be so bad
If your lungs are aching
And your tongue's still shaking
I could be your suicide policeman
Go ahead and put it down
I'm drunk and so is everyone else
In this devil town
They wont let me turn around
To get one last look at my baby
While she's still around,
While she's still around,
While she's still around,
While she's still around
Go ahead and build it up again
This cities just cementaries enhaced
Forgotten and
My only hopes to see you
And even if I never do
While she's still around,
While she's still around,
While she's still around,
While she's still around
And I know what you're thinking
That won't stop this drinking
It's the least I can do
'Cause this life is anything but certain
When they close the final curtain
You'll get a glimpse of the truth
'Cause you're still around,
While she's still around,
While she's still around,
While she's still around
Go ahead and burn it down
I'm drunk and so is everyone else
In this devil town
You can compliment me on the style of my hair
Give me marks out of ten for the clothes I wear
You probably thought I had more upstairs
I disappoint you, I can see through your perfect smile
He likes to read books written for girls
Prides himself on being a man of the world
In the darkest of places he gets his thrills
He will disappoint you if you see through his perfect smile
I think separation is OK, you're no star to guide me anyway
You only wanted me to play the fool, play by your rule
Now my door has swollen from the rain
God knows we'll never see her face again
People get shattered in many ways
They can disappoint you if you see through their perfect smiles
I think separation is OK, you're no star to guide me anyway
You only wanted me to play the fool, play by your rule
The fool, play by your rule
You're holding bits of styrofoam
With your face painted on to your friends,
You listen to them whine and moan
About everything you can't understand.
Can I just say I don't fear the light,
But darkness descends once more into my life.
And suddenly we're all alone in silence,
So I take a step away.
I look up to the falling snow
As it makes its home upon my face.
Well I wouldn't want to ruin something I couldn't save,
The gap will keep us safe,
The gap will keep us safe.
Step away, get me when I'm down.
And suddenly I'm five years old
And I'm just so cold I want to cry.
I haul up on my gentlemen,
Who have always been there in hard times.
They're just not like that man of mine,
Who visit me from time to time.
My love, I treasure you.
I hear that summer's coming back
So I stretch out my back and travel a long,
The winter though it darkens me
It is pure and clean and all I want.
I'll apologize to the ones I love,
For leaving them when the sun comes up.
Too bright for me, darkness descends.
Oh well I'm not well again,
And once more darkness it descends.
The ground is falling under me,
And I can't find the means to leave.
Convinced that I am going mad,
Oh I bury my head into his hands
So sure that I'm losing faith,
Oh I clear a space in his fathers land.
You deal with God far too young,
Before you know it your life has run away.
I could help myself to something
Like a little bit of revelation
You could be the one to help me help myself
Maybe if I could see exactly what
Was in your way I'd move it for you
Don't always need to do it by yourself
I'm not trying to find a way to get in your bed
I'll just sing for you
Until you fall asleep then I will go
I never understood how you should feel
You've been left out I'd never do that
It's all in your imagination dear.
Calm down
Deep breaths
And get yourself dressed instead
Of running around
And pulling all your threads saying
Breaking yourself up
If it's a broken part, replace it
If it's a broken arm then brace it
If it's a broken heart then face it
And hold your own
Know your name
And go your own way
Hold your own
Know your own name
And go your own way
And everything will be fine
Hang on
Help is on the way
Stay strong
I'm doing everything
Hold your own
Know your name
And go your own way
Hold your own
Know your name
And go your own way
And everything, everything will be fine
Everything
Are the details in the fabric
Are the things that make you panic
Are your thoughts results of static cling?
Are the things that make you blow
Hell, no reason, go on and scream
If you're shocked it's just the fault
Of faulty manufacturing.
Yeah everything will be fine
Everything in no time at all
Everything
Hold your own
And know your name
And go your own way
Are the details in the fabric (Hold your own, know your name)
Are the things that make you panic
Are your thoughts results of static cling? (Go your own way)
Are the details in the fabric (Hold your own, know your name)
Are the things that make you panic (Go your own way)
Is it Mother Nature's sewing machine?
Are the things that make you blow (Hold your own, know your name)
Hell no reason go on and scream
If you're shocked it's just the fault (Go your own way)
Of faulty manufacturing
Everything will be fine
Everything in no time at all
Hearts will hold
Send away for a priceless gift
One not subtle, one not on the list
Send away for a perfect world
One not simply so absurd
In these times of doing what you're told
Keep these feelings, no one knows
What ever happened to the young man's heart
Swallowed by pain as he slowly fell apart
And I'm staring down the barrel of a .45 (.45)
Swimming through the ashes of another life (another life)
No real reason to accept the way things have changed
Staring down the barrel of a .45
Send a message to the unborn child
Keep your eyes open for a while
In a box high upon a shelf
Left for you, no one else
There's a piece of a puzzle known as life
Wrapped in guilt, sealed up tight
What ever happened to the young man's heart
Swallowed by pain as he slowly fell apart
And I'm staring down the barrel of a .45 (.45)
Swimming through the ashes of another life (another life)
No real reason to accept the way things have changed
Staring down the barrel of a .45
Everyone's pointing their fingers
Always condemning me
Nobody knows what I believe
I believe
And I'm staring down the barrel of a .45 (.45)
Swimming through the ashes of another life (another life)
No real reason to accept the way things have changed
Staring down the barrel of a .45
And I'm staring down the barrel of a .45 (.45)
And I'm swimming through the ashes of another life (another life)
There is no real reason to accept the way things have changed
Staring down the barrel of a .45
(.45)
.45 (Staring down the barrel of a .45)
Instrumental
On the way to the heaven's light
Where the time doesn't matter
You're so fine
Take my hand
Put me on the top of the world
On the way to the heaven's light
You'll be hiding behind the moon
You're so fine
You look in my mind
Put me on the top of the world
On the way to the heaven's light
Things go up things go down
All love stays around
Put me on the top of the world
Traveling lightly in your neighbor's yard
Burned out roman candle, calling cards
Someone forgot the golden rule
Let's go find another swimming pool
Oh oh ho oh, oh oh oh, oh oh
Traveling lightly in your neighbor's yard
Burned out roman candle, calling cards
Someone forgot the golden rule
Let's go find another swimming pool
Oh oh ho oh, oh oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh ho oh, oh oh oh, oh oh
Oh love, you were a sickly child
And how the wind knocked you down
Put on your spurs, swagger around
In the desperate kingdom of love
Holy water cannot help you now
Your mysterious eyes cannot help you
Selling your reason will not bring you through
The desperate kingdom of love
There's another who looks from behind your eyes
I learn from you how to hide
From the desperate kingdom of love
At the end of this burning world
You'll stand proud, face upheld
And I'll follow you, into Heaven or Hell
And I'll become, as a girl
In the desperate kingdom of love
Some people say that rappers don't have feelings
We have feelings (We have feelings)
Some people say that we are not rappers (We're rappers)
That hurts our feelings (Hurts our feelings when you say we're not rappers)
Some people say that rappers are invincible
We're vincible (We're vincible)
What you are about to hear are true stories
(Real experiences)
Autobiographical raps
Things that happened to us, all true
Bring the rhyme
I make a meal for my friends,
Try to make it delicious,
Try to keep it nutritious,
Create wonderful dishes
Not one of them thinks about the way I feel
Nobody compliments the meal
I got hurt feelings, I got hurt feelings
I feel like a prize asshole
No one even mentions my casserole
I got hurt feelings, I got hurt feelings
You coulda said something nice about my profiteroles
Here's a little story to bring a tear to your eye,
I was shopping for a wetsuit to scuba dive,
But every suit I tried is too big around the thighs,
And the assistant suggested I try a ladies' size
I got hurt feelings, I got hurt feelings
I'm not gonna wear a ladies' wetsuit I'm a man
I got hurt feelings, I got hurt feelings
Get me a small man's wetsuit, please
It's my birthday, 2003
Waitin' for a call from my family
They forgot about me
I got hurt feelings, I got hurt feelings
The day after my birthday is not my birthday, Mum
I call my friends and say, "Let's go into town,"
But they're all too busy to go into town
So I go by myself, I go into town
Then I see all my friends, they're all in town
I got hurt feelings, I got hurt feelings
They're all lined up to watch that movie "Maid in Manhattan"
Have you even been told that your ass is too big?
Have you ever been asked if your hair is a wig?
Have you ever been told you're mediocre in bed?
Have you ever been told you've got a weird-shaped head?
Has your family ever forgotten you and driven away?
Once again, they forgot about J
Were you ever called "homo" 'cause at school you took drama?
Have you ever been told that you look like a llama?
Tears of a rapper
(Don't want to make a rapper cry then watch what you say)
I'm crying tears of a rapper
(Pouring like the bullets of my AK)
Goldplated tears of a rapper
(These are the tears of a rapper now)
These are diamond tears of a rapper
(These are the bulletproof 24 carat gold tears - of a rapper)
I fell into the ocean
When you became my wife
I risked it all against the sea
To have a better life
Marie you are the wild blue sky
And men do foolish things
You turn kings into beggars
And beggars into kings
Pretend that you owe me nothing
And all the world is green
We can bring back the old days again
When all the world was green
The face forgives the mirror
The worm forgives the plow
The questions begs the answer
Can you forgive me somehow?
Maybe when our story's over
We'll go where it's always spring
The band is playing our song again
And all the world is green
Pretend that you owe me nothing
And all the world is green
We can bring back the old days again
When all the world was green
The moon is yellow silver
Oh the things that summer brings
It's a love you'd kill for
And all the world is green
He's balancing a diamond
On a blade of grass
The dew will settle on our graves
When all the world is green
Pretend that you owe me nothing
And all the world is green
We can bring back the old days again
When all the world was green
City streets (passing by)
Underneath (stormy skies)
Neon signs (in the night)
Red and blue (city lights)
Cargo trains rolling by
Once again (someone cries)
Trains and winter rains
No going back (no going home)
Trains across the plains
And in the sky (a star alone)
Every time (it's the same)
One more night (one more train)
Everywhere (empty roads)
Where they go no-one knows
Trains and winter rains
No going back (no going home)
Trains across the plains
And in the sky (a star alone)
Trains and winter rains
No going back (no going home)
Trains across the plains
And in the sky (a star alone)
Trains and winter rains
No going back (no going home)
Trains across the plains
And in the sky (a star alone)
Trains and winter rains
No going back (no going home)
Trains across the plains
And in the sky (a star alone)
You left your black gloves on my table
You left your dark horse in the stable
Thinking of a way to get you to stay 
And I'll promise to fight the wind and waves for you
I'm an owl with tired eyes
I'm the scarecrow in disguise
The absolute con
I would babe sing 
When all I want to do is stay inside 
And look out the window with you
There was a dead mouse in your arms
That was the moment that you lost your charm
No bear paw sitting in a jar
And your tree, it never grew any leaves
Shake my arms, shake my head
I fell asleep on your cobweb
And I'm turning from all the lights tonight
Saw you in a crowded bar, pale with hungry eyes
My harbor has a boat in it
The water makes its way 'round it
When the sun shines down the hills the winds blow
I miss you more
You said I am young, and I am yours
I am free, but I am flawed
I am here and your heart
I was here from the start
The forests had a rock in it
Roots and animals were blocked by it
When they turned all their bones, changed to stone
They lost their faith
You said I am young, and I am yours
I am free, but I am flawed
I am here and your heart
Was here from the start
There when the rain came and settled on your skin
Not like before and you let it all in
To your heart was the only part
From the start you set upon
You said I am young, and I am yours
I am free, but I am flawed
I am here and your heart
Was here from the start
Like a cat dragged in from the rain
Who goes straight back out to do it all over again
I'll be back for more
It's something that is out of our hands
Something we will never understand
It's a hidden law
The apple falls
Destiny calls
I follow you
Like a pawn on the eternal board
Who's never quite sure what he's moved towards
I walk blindly on
And heaven is in front of me
Your heaven beckons me enticingly
When I arrive it's gone
The river flows
The wise man knows
I follow you
I'm yearning, I'm burning
I feel love's wheels turning
Like a moth on love's bright light
I will get burned each and every night
I'm dying to (o)
The sun will shine
The bottom line
I follow you
You kissed me on the forehead, now this kiss is giving me a concussion
We were love at first sight, now it's crush, it's crushing
I traced your steps through the city of romance lazily
I took to the desert with your harshest words and they saved me
I'll bail you out again, I've got the readies
I'm not a child I know, we're not going steady
Your pain's gigantic but it's not as big as your ego
Promise not to abandon you, please let me go
Now I've been worrying about your feelings, yeah, they were worth protecting
They say I'm too kind and sentimental like you could catch affection
Oh in your eyes there's a sadness enough to kill the both of us
Are those eyes overrated? They make me want to give up on love
I'll brace myself for the loneliness
Say hello to feelings that I detest
This maudlin career has come to an end
I don't want to be sad again
This maudlin career has come to an end
I don't want to be sad again
This maudlin career has come to an end
I don't want to be sad again
This maudlin career has come to an end
I don't want to be sad again
This maudlin career has come to an end
I don't want to be sad again
There goes the day, oh what a shame.
It's OK, that's all the same.
It's all right, it's OK, because the night is just another day.
Oh, there's the night, oh what a shame.
It's all right, that's all the same.
It's OK, it's all right, because the day is just another night.
Oh, when you came back from the scene it's true, you brought a melody.
Oh, I know it's hard but you stay with me, oh oh, we've got a memory.
Oh, there's the day, oh what a shame.
It's OK, that's all the same.
It's all right, it's ok, because the night is just another day.
Oh when you came back from the scene it's true, you brought a melody.
Oh I know it's hard but you stay with me, oh oh, we've got a memory.
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh, when you came back from the scene, it's true, you brought a melody.
Oh, I know it's hard but you stay with me, oh, you got a memory.
Oh, when you came back from the scene, it's true, you brought a melody.
Oh, I know it's hard but you stay with me, oh, oh.
There's an eclipse in your eye
Where I used to shine
Every secret untold
Is a planet aligned
Don't need prophets or preachers
To make sense of the signs
When the buried and hidden
Can be seen by the blind
You're right,
Some words are just unspoken
So right,
Then it all just falls apart
The day I break your heart
I caught my reflection
In the corner of your eye
You said "Don't even ask the question,
And I won't tell the lie"
Where there's no accusation
There's no need for denial
And if you hadn't heard that whisper
There'd be no tear to wipe from your eye
You're right,
Some words are best unspoken
So right,
Then it all just falls apart
The day I break your heart
Never took no advice
Not the foolish, not the wise
All the truth that I needed
Was right there in your smile
Every prophecy written
Of what's going to be
All beginnings and endings, 
They're about you and me
You're right,
Some words are best unspoken
So right,
Until it all just falls apart
You're right,
Some words are best unspoken
So right,
Then it all just falls apart
The day I break your heart
Here comes Dick, he's wearing a skirt
Here comes Jane, you know she's sporting a chain
Same hair, revolution, same build, evolution
Tomorrow who's gonna fuss
And they love each other so
Androgynous
Closer than you know, love each other so
Androgynous
Don't get him wrong, and don't get him mad
He might be a father, but he sure ain't a dad
And she don't need advice that'll center her
She's happy with the way she looks, she's happy with her gender
And they love each other so
Androgynous
Closer than you know, love each other so
Androgynous
Mirror image, see no damage, see no evil at all
Kewpie dolls and urine stalls
Will be laughed at the way you're laughed at now
Now, something meets boy, and something meets girl
They both look the same, they're overjoyed in this world
Same hair, revolution, unisex, evolution
Tomorrow who's gonna fuss
And tomorrow Dick is wearing pants
Tomorrow Janie's wearing a dress
Future outcasts and they don't last
And today the people dress the way that they please
The way they tried to do in the last centuries
And they love each other so
Androgynous
Closer than you know, love each other so
Androgynous

If you're all done like you said you'd be
What are you doing hanging out with me?
Why you tell me stuff that's so plainly untrue?
If you'll be straight with me, I'll be straighter with you
If you're all done like you said you'd be
What are you doing hanging out with me?
I've been wanting to do anything for a long time
But whatever you got right now will probably suit me fine

Whenever I go, you stay with me,
They won't see you leave.

Whenever I turn, you are gone from me.
And I won't see you leave.
Whereever I go, your shadow follows me
I don't want to see you leave.
Are you here with me?

You are here with me.
And I am here with you.
You are here with me.

There's plenty of time left tonight,
I promised I'd have you home before daylight.
We do the best we can in a small town;
Act like big city kids when the sun goes down.
If it's not too late for coffee,
I'll be at your place in ten.
We'll hit that all-night diner
And then we'll see.
There's so many things I have to say,
I'll stay up all night to hear about your day.
We do the best we can in a small town;
Act like kids in love when the sun goes down.
If it's not too late for coffee,
I'll be at your place in ten.
We'll hit that all-night diner
And then we'll see.
There's a love that transcends
All that we've known of ourselves,
And I'll wait for it to come,
I'll wait for it to come.
Well, it's got to be strong to touch my heart
Through its shell,
And I'll wait for it to come,
I'll wait for it to come.

I'll wait for it to come down.
Well it's your hometown
I think I've outgrown
I wanna travel the world but I, I just can't do it alone
So I'm just waiting on fate to come.
Wrap around me
Think about all the foreign places we could be
I'll be flicking stones at your window
I'll be waiting outside till you're ready to go
Won't you come down? Come away with me
Just think of all the places we could be
I'll be waiting, waiting on a brand new day
Riding on waves, walking on sand
Digging in caves to find the treasures of the land
And if we find gold
Well, we'll just throw it away
We can write stories 'bout the journeys that we made
(We could be big in Japan)
I'll be flicking stones at your window
I'll be waiting outside till you're ready to go
Won't you come down? Come away with me
Just think of all the places we could be
I'll be waiting, waiting on a brand new day
Waiting on a brand new day
They said they'll keep me here
But I couldn't do another year
I said I'll see you soon
Because I whistle to a different tune
Think of all the places we could be
Think of all the people we could meet
I'll be flicking stones at your window
I'll be waiting outside till you're ready to go
Won't you come down? Come away with me
Think of all the places we could be
I'll be waiting, waiting on a brand new day
Think I'm goin' home
I think I'm gettin' lost for a while
Tired of getting stoned
And thinkin' 'bout you in the night
So I'll file away all my dreams
Though I still believe in everything
I wished your love away
I wished your love away
Honestly over you
Honestly over you
One lie short of true
Honestly over you
Lookin' for some hope
Polished off the whiskey tonight
You turned a man to stone
For lookin' at you straight in the eyes
So I'll drive away with all my things
Though I've a faint belief in everything
I wished your love away
I wished your love away
Honestly over you
Honestly over you
And I'll tell the world
Honestly over you
I wished your love away...
I've got no need for open roads
'Cause all I own fits on my back
I see the world from rusted trains
And always know I won't be back
'Cause all my life is wrapped up in today
No past or future here
If I find my name's no good
I just fall out of line
But I miss you
But there's comin' home
There's no comin' home
With a name like mine
I still think of you
But everyone knows
Yeah everyone knows
If you can, let it go
I seen more places than I can name
And over time they all start to look the same
But it ain't that truth we chase
No, it's the promise of a better place
But all this time, I been chasin' down a lie
And I know it for what it is
But it beats the alternatives
So I'll take the lie
I still miss you
There's no goin' home
There's no goin' home
With a name like mine
I still dream of you
But everyone knows
Yeah everyone knows
If you can, let it go
Call Louise Louisa do
I assess myself through you
Call Louise Louisa do
I had such a night
Come true
Overhead
Morning skies all for you
What a day I have had
What a day I have had
Now it's over, isn't it?
What a day I have had
What a day I have had
Now it's over, isn't it?
There goes Louisa
There goes Louisa
Dig out yourself from rubble
Removing all your skin
And don't ever think of trouble
The darkness that has been
Don't patronize me sorrow
I don't mean to
I'm in a car
I don't know where we are headed for
Stay with me
Don't want to be alone
Just a song we shared, I'll hear
Brings memories back when you were here
Of your smile, your easy laughter
Of your kiss, those moments after
I think of you,
And think of you
And think of you.
Of the dreams we dreamt together
Of the love we vowed would never
Melt like snowflakes in the sun
My days now end as they begun
With thoughts of you,
And I think of you
And think of you.
Down the streets I walked with you
Seeing others doing things we do
Now these thoughts are haunting me
Of how complete I used to be
And in these times that we're apart
I'll hear this song that breaks my heart
And think of you
And I think of you
And think of you
And think of you
And I do
I still smell you, distance aside
Still smell the rain, distance aside
Oh water that had kept me alive
I will miss you, distance aside
Jesus the Mexican boy, born in a truck on the fourth of July
Gave me a card with a lady naked on the back
Barefoot at night on the road, fireworks blooming above in the sky
I never knew I was given the best one from the deck
He never wanted nothing, I remember
Maybe a broken bottle if I had two
Hanging behind his holy even temper
Hiding the more unholy things I do
Jesus the Mexican boy gave me a ride on the back of his bike
Out to the fair though I welched on a $5 bet
Drunk on calliope songs, we met a home-wrecking carnival girl
He's never asked for a favor or the money yet
Jesus the Mexican boy born in a truck on the 4th of July
I fell in love with his sister unrepentantly
Fearing he wouldn't approve, we made a lie that was feeble at best
Boarded a train bound for Vegas and married secretly
I never gave him nothing I remember
Maybe a broken bottle if I had two
Hanging behind his holy even temper
Hiding the more unholy things I do
Jesus the Mexican boy, wearing a long desert trip on his tie
Lo and behold he was standing under the welcome sign
Naked, the Judas in me fell by the tracks but he lifted me high
Kissing my head like a brother and never asking why
There's always something in the way
There's always something getting through
But it's not me
It's You
It's You
Sometimes ignorance
Rings true
But hope is not in what I know
It's not in me
It's in You
It's in You
It's all I know
It's all I know
It's all I know
And I find peace when I'm confused
And I find hope when I'm let down
Not in me, me,
In You
It's in You
I hope to lose myself for good
I hope to find it in the end
Not in me, me,
In You
In You
It's all I know
It's all I know
It's all I know
In You
In You
It's in You
In You
There's always something in the way
There's always something getting through
But it's not me
It's You
It's You
It's You
It's You
It's You
(It's all I know)
It's You
It's You
(It's all I know)
It's You
It's You
(It's all I know)
It's You
It's You
(It's all I know)
It's You
I had a dream
Strange it may seems
It was my perfect day
Open my eyes
I realize
This is my perfect day
Hope you never grow old
Hope you never grow old
Hope you never grow old
Hope you never grow old
Do-do-do-do
Birds in the sky
They look so high
This is my perfect day
I feel the breeze
I feel at ease
It is my perfect day
Hope you never grow old
Hope you never grow old
Hope you never grow old
Hope you never grow old
Forever young
I hope you stay
Forever young
Do-do-do-do
Wake up, we're stealing cars
And we're gonna bust into bars
1996, 1997
1998, we're all waiting for the year 2000
Just the smell of the summer can make me fall in love
Just the smell of the summer can make me fall in love
We go to the parties and listen to the DJ's
Dance, dance, dance, and go crazy
Dance, dance, dance, and go crazy
We go to the parties and listen to the DJ's
Dance, dance, dance, and go crazy
Dance, dance, dance, and go crazy
She's a party queen and she's in party heaven
Her clock is stuck on late, got a first name basis at 7-Eleven
We go to the parties and listen to the DJ's
Dance, dance, dance, and go crazy
Dance, dance, dance, and go crazy
Just the smell of the summer can make me fall in love
Just the smell of the summer can make me fall in love
Hold the slip and slide, taste the sweat, it's salty
Irrigation in a swimming hole, nation-wide loved the movie
Just the smell of the summer can make me fall in love
Just the smell of the summer can make me fall in love
Instrumental
I can love you desperately, though your love ain't guaranteed
Oh, I wish you knew the deal, gotta learn from far away
And I simply needed space, space for me to be
And I think you need it too
Though I know you call me selfish for assuming
I did this for you too, you still got me around your finger
Even though I'm far away
Please believe me when I say
Everything I do, I'm gonna think of you
Don't know what else to do
You got me, you got me, baby
Everything I make, I only make for you
Baby, be patient for me
And please don't fall in love with someone new
I promise one day I'll come back for you
Oh, you say you hate me now, and you burn me with your words
Calling me a fool, saying that I've effed up everything
And you'll never forgive me, though I'm doing this for you
Baby, can't you see if there is such a thing
Of loving someone so much that you need
To give them time to let them breathe
But you don't understand, I wish you understood
Oh, I hope one day you do
Everything I do, I'm gonna think of you
Don't know what else to do
You got me, you got me, baby
Everything I make, I only make for you
Baby, be patient for me
And please don't fall in love with someone new
I promise one day I'll come back for you
Believe in you, believe in me, we're meant to be together
I told you, weren't lyin', I know you aren't relying
And now I am supplying you the time and space
To let you grow into the person that I know, that I know you can be
And I can be one too
And I'll come back to you
And I am ready for you, baby, I am ready for you now
I'm not ready for you now, please don't hate me
Everything I do, I'm gonna think of you
Don't know what else to do
You got me, you got me, baby
Everything I make, I only make for you
Baby, be patient for me
And please don't fall in love with someone new
I promise one day I'll come back for you
I promise one day I'll come back to you
I promise one day I'll come back to you
I promise baby, one day I'll come back to you
I promise baby, one day I'll come back to you
I'm a hopeless romantic
You're a terrible flirt 
Cool and unfazed
You're always amazed 
When someone gets hurt 
I live on the blue planet 
That I saw in your eyes 
But now I can't stay 
Knowing it's made 
Of beautiful lies 
But my sentimental melody 
Like a long-lost lullabye 
Will ring in your ears 
Down through the years 
Bringing a tear to your eye 
Goodbye 
Love can kill people, can't it 
Well it still might kill me 
Each drop of rain 
Is a glass of champagne 
It's sweet and it's free 
When I drink I don't panic 
When I drink I don't die 
When I'm far gone 
It's all just a song 
Just beautiful lies...
But my sentimental melody 
Like a long-lost lullabye 
Will ring in your ears 
Down through the years 
Bringing a tear to your eye 
Goodbye
Abigail
Can you feel my heart in the palm of your hand 
And do you understand
Why I can't stay
Abigail
An evil wind is blowing through the land
And they need every man
To drive it away 
When I come home
If I come home
You'll be a grown woman 
When I come home
If I come home
Don't be alone, Abigail, belle of Kilronan
Abigail's
Gonna be the beauty of County Galway
And she will live always 
In a world of love
Abigail
I'm off to the war
But you can be sure 
I will know you're
What I'm fighting for...

Deeper down
It's everywhere I look
From Las Vegas to right here
Under your dresser
Right by your ear
It's creeping in sweetly
It's definitely here
There's nothing more deadly
Than slow growing fear
Life was full and fruitful
And you could take a real bite
The juice pouring well over
Your skins delight
But the shadow it grows
And takes the depth away
Leaving broken down pieces
To this priceless ballet
The shallower it grows
The shallower it grows
The fainter we go
Into the fade out line
The shallower it grows
The shallower it grows
The fainter we go
Into deeper down
Did we build all those bridges
To watch them thin down to dust?
Or blow them voluntarily
Out of constant trust?
The clock is ticking its last couple of tocks
And there won't be a party with weathering frocks
The shallower it grows
The shallower it grows
The fainter we go
Into the fade out line
The shallower it grows
The shallower it grows
The fainter we go
Into the fade out line
Heading deeper down
We're sliding without noticing
Our own decline
Heading deeper down
We're hanging onto
Sweet nothings left behind
Deeper down
Deeper down
Deeper down
Deeper down
Down deeper down, yeah
Did we build all those bridges
To watch them thin down to dust?
Or blow them voluntarily
Out of constant trust?
The clock is ticking its last couple of tocks
And there won't be a party with weathering frocks
Did we build all those bridges
To watch them thin down to dust?
Or blow them voluntarily
Out of constant trust?
The clock is ticking its last couple of tocks
And there won't be a party with weathering frocks
The shallower it grows
The shallower it grows
The fainter we go
Into the fade out line
The shallower it grows
The shallower it grows
The fainter we go
Into the fade out line
We are all plunging straight towards our own decline
Without noticing
We slide down, deeper down
The shadow grows without ever slowing down
We are heading straight
Into the fade out line
Deeper down
Swept away
By the wonder of it all
So amazed
Never saw it coming
Left me dazed
And I don't know where to turn
Here and now
Seems I'm standing on the edge
Looking down
I can clearly see your face in the crowd
Makes me feel I'm not alone
If I fall, if I fall, if I fall, will you catch me?
Seems to me
I'm exactly where I dreamt
I would be
And the view from here is something to see
But I need a hand to hold on to
If I fall, if I fall, if I fall, will you catch me?
If I fall, if I fall, if I fall, will you catch me?
If I fall, if I fall if I fall
(Will you catch me, make it alright, 'cause I'm standing, on the edge now, see your face and) 
Will you catch me?
If I fall, if I fall, if I fall
(Will you catch me, make it alright, looking down I, see your face, yeah, if I fall now)
Will you catch me?
If I fall, if I fall, if I fall will you catch me?
I still have a flame gun
For the cute, cute, cute ones
And I saw your hand
With a loose grip
On a tight ship
I still have a flame gun
For the cute ones
To burn out all your tricks
And I saw your hand
With a loose grip
On a very tight ship
And I know
In the cold light
There's a very big man
There's a very big man
Leading us into
Temptation
Jackson, Jesse, I've got a son in me
Jackson, Jesse, I've got a son in me
And he's related to you
He's related to you
He is waiting to meet you
He's related to you
He's related to you
He is dying to meet you
Backhand, role reversal
Where is someone?
Backhand, reversible roles
I know there's someone
I still have a flame gun
For the cute ones
To burn out all your tricks
And I saw your hand
With a loose grip
On such a tight ship
And I know in the cold light
There's a very big man
Leading us into
Temptation
Jackson, Jesse, I've got a son in me
Jackson, Jesse, I've got a son in me
And he's related to you
He's related to you
He is waiting to meet you
He's related to you
He's related to you
He is dying to meet you
He's related to you
He's related to you
He's related to you
He's nude as the news, nude as the news
Nude as the news, nude as the news
All over, all over, all over, all over, all over, all over, all over
You
I'm sure
Allow me
Please
Get help
Only in your note
Only listen
Where are you going
Oh, the song would
Whose mousse
Sell our little home
That's what I'm saying
It's almost right
It's a loved one
It's oh, so hard
You should go home
Through the pain
Sure
Bravo
Please
Please
Pull
Only the lonely
Sell some
Sell our minnow
Suppose he can
If we aren't home
So come over
So sleep
It's so hard
It's also ugly
Leveled home
Bricks so
So firm
If you don't mind, why don't you mind?
Where is your sense of indignation
You are too kind, much too kind
Where is the madness that you promised me?
Where is the dream for which I paid dearly?
When things go wrong I sing along
It is the nature of the business
But you're not here to make my sad songs more sincere
No one will ever love you honestly
No one will ever love you for your honesty
No one will ever love you honestly
No one will ever love you for your honesty
(Feat. Miguel)
(Verse 1: Asher Roth)
He leans back from his desk
Rubs the back of his neck, the stress takes effect
Grips the bridge of his noise
Squints while he's showing emotion he normally won't
At 56, he re-evaluates
Possibly regretting some decisions that he's made
Black is turning grey, patches of his age
Reflecting from the glasses of passive of every page
Passionately Dave reads, reading on occasion
Dreaming of the day when he can do the same thing
He's always wanted to write, that's all he's wanted in life
With two daughters, a son and a remarkable wife
He's in a bind, he has to provide
A family is relying on a millie to survive
His father died at 56
So he's well aware how vital a father figure is
How big of a responsibility it is
To be a good husband and care for your kids
Never miss an event, helping them with their homework
Discipline to prevent things when they're older
His only son is only 21
And focus as a poet has only just begun
Papa isn't dumb, he understands what this means
His dream is my dream, my dream is his dream
(Chorus: Miguel)
I close my eyes and I can see (His dream)
The sacrifices he made for me (His dream)
Put it aside for his family (His dream)
Yeah, so I'ma keep it alive, Yeah
(Verse 2: Asher Roth)
And so he targeted to be the dream guardian
Guarding it from anything and anyone whose harming it
But in his heart, he knows the hardest thing about it is
Giving up on his dream to be all about his kids
As he kisses the lips of the misses
For 24 years going on the 25th
He thinks to himself, this alone is a wealth
It's greater than what's bought and then sold on the shelf
Sometimes a dream is all that we have
We have to continue to dream
Cause once it is lost amongst other thoughts
Then what really are we, what are we?
(Verse 3: Asher Roth)
So he sits back at his desk
Cracking his knuckles and back of his neck
Faxing a paper displaying his name
On another application explaining the main
Things they should know but the things that they don't
Are the things that distinguish him as an adult
And over the phone, he can never expose
The role that he chose, the role in his home
And at home, he's a leader, a father
He'll prove it by using his son and his daughters
In their life, he'll be playing the part of
The one who inspires, the one we admire
His only son is only 21
And focus as a poet has only just begun
Papa isn't dumb, he understands what this means
His dream is my dream, my dream is his dream
Solitary motion in the wake of an avalanche
Deer in the headlights, there goes a weaker one
He's listenin' in the fast gaze, I don't care now to see the way
Do you hear the silence? I was far too late
Oh, living for the city and it's always troubling
To keep it in the hot lane, I don't care about no scenery
And you run from it then, now you can't escape
'Cause it's all you see
But we're all just an end to a simple thing
And it's all you see and it's all you see
We're just tamer animals
We're just tamer animals
Solitary motion in the wake of an avalanche
We took a hit then, trying to see if you hold it in
And you run from it then, now you can't escape
'Cause it's all you see
But we're all just an end to a simple thing
And it's all you see and it's all you see
We're just tamer animals
We're just tamer animals
We're the same as animals
Hey, I wanna crawl out of my skin
Apologize for all my sins
All the things I should have said to you
Hey, I can't make it go away
Over and over in my brain again
All the things I should have said to you
Counting stars wishing I was okay
Crashing down was my biggest mistake
I never ever meant to hurt you
I only did what I had to
Counting stars again
Hey, I'll take this day by day by day
Under the covers I'm okay I guess
Life's too short and I feel small
Counting stars wishing I was okay
Crashing down was my biggest mistake
I never ever meant to hurt you
I only did what I had to
Counting stars again
Counting stars again (5x)
In peking
There is a son who
Is much greater
Than you want to be
Carnival arms have
A medical wonder
Who would of guessed that
It was not a real body part
In peking
There is a mother
Who is laden
With who she has to be
Carnival arms have
A medical wonder
Who would of guessed that
It was not a real body part
In peking there is someone who
Is who they should exactly be.
Yeah
Still at it
Villmatic,
What a life we chose
I'm sending this out to those
Who fell down, but then rose
I'm hot, I'm hell bound with these flows,
Cole,
And when my story's told
Let it be known that I'd never fold
I took my time
I gave my soul
I watched you shine
But me I glow, so
I'm coming for what I'm owed
Ya know
Might have been a while
Since you've been loved
Like you should be loved
Might have been a while
Since you've been kissed
Like you should be kissed
Tender lovin' arms
Might be something you miss
Well summerbreeze is blowin' through your window
And summerbreeze is blowin' through your hair
And something in your eyes
That you cannot disguise
Don't tell me it ain't there
Might have been a while
Since you've been loved
By one who really loves you
It might have been a while
Since you could trust
That someone really cares
Were people like us
Meant to go 'round in pairs?
Summerbreeze is blowin' through your window
Summerbreeze is blowin' through your hair
Something in your eyes
That took me by surprise
Don't tell me that it ain't there
It's, oh, so late to start wishing
This heart of mine, you're gonna own
They fade away and now you're here
I didn't know there's only you
Valentine
Go out in the light
Why suffer back in the game
All living, all our sin the same
All the faithful heal, they're all praying
They refer to
Valentine
Oh, return
They release you then you turn to see
Make it feel alright
The only thing is that I didn't
I tried to climb my felon home
I feel overwhelmed and still your here
Your coming home but before you do
Valentine
Go out in the light
Out in the moonlit sky
I saw you there in blue
It was just before the moon hung
Her weary heavy head in
The gallows and the graves of
The milky milky cradle
His tears have turned to poppies
A shimmer in the midnight
A flower in the twilight
A flower in the twilight
And our screaming
Is in his screaming
Our screaming in the willow
They took him to the gallows
He fought them all the way though
And when they asked us how we knew his name
We died just before him
Our eyes are in the flowers
Our hands are in the branches
Our voices in the breezes
And our screaming
Is in his screaming
Our screaming in the willow tree
We're waiting by the willow
Our milky milky cradle
Our lockets long have rusted
His picture worn and weathered
Our hair is in the garden
Our voices in our toeses
Our heart are in the blossoms
Our eyes are in the branches
And our screaming
Is in his screaming
Our screaming in the willow tree
Heard a shout of someone calling
Strained in darkness.
Vapour, like a veil, hangs over
The city tonight.
Hanging there behind the trees,
A blood-red moon is
Watching. I was waiting for you,
Dread in my heart.
Where the wind sings by the river
Laughing. Broken.
Hair swept out into the water,
Ripples of black.
Run, you better run,
You better run for your life.
Oh, it rips through the sky.
Oh, a light flickers on.
Jo, I know you would say,
"Don't wait for me now".
Shiver while you're breathe in,
Hold on while you breathe loud.
I see the dawn.
Shiver while you breathe in,
Hold on while you breathe loud.
Ah.
Filigree of time remaining
Sunset. Spoken.
Where the wind sits by the river,
Ripples of black.
Days, you gotta run,
You gotta run for your life.
Run, you better run,
You better run for your life.
Days, you gotta run,
You gotta run for your life.
Run, you better run,
You better run for your life.
Days, you gotta run,
You gotta run for your life.
Run, you better run,
You better run for your life.
Days, you gotta run,
You gotta run for your life.
Run, you better run,
You better run for your life.
Days, you gotta run,
You gotta run for your life.
Run, you better run,
You better run for your life.
Days, you gotta run,
You gotta run for your life.
Run, you better run,
You better run for your life.
Oh, you live till you breathe,
Don't run with me.
Breathe your life while you wait,
Don't wait for me now.
Days, you gotta run,
You gotta run for your life.
Run, you better run,
You better run for your life.
Days, you gotta run,
You gotta run for your life.
Run, you better run,
You better run for your life.
Days, you gotta run,
You gotta run for your life.
Run, you better run,
You better run for your life.
All things past in the pick-up
Found my brother's badge
Abraham is live and well in the pick-up
And his wife casts no more spells
In the pick-up
Found myself in the pick-up
Seatbelt on my lap
And my sister with her braids
In the pick-up
Kissed my mother on the face
In the pick-up
Clapping with the human race
In the pick-up
Have the people went to the high hill?
From the start they didn't know exactly why was.
When their game made it so oh look alike, look alike.
Underneath the grass will grow aiming at the sky.
It was swift, it was just another way of a miracle, but no one, nothing at all, will go for the kill.
If they call don't very soul, and the land on the moon.
Only them, what they know blessing in this curse.
The curse will come from the underground down by the shore,
Where all grow even hunger to live like before.
The curse will come from the underground down by the shore,
Where all grow even hunger to live like before.
Tell me more of the very soul, look alike, look alike.
Do you know this change of hope covering their eyes?
If I call on very soul on the land, on the moon.
Tell me if a lover know a blessing in this curse.
The curse will come from the underground down by the shore,
Where all grow even hunger to live like before.
The curse will come from the underground down by the shore,
Where all grow even hunger to live like before.
Rosalie
I've been waiting all evening
Possibly years I don't know
Counting the passing hours
Everything merges with the night
I stand on the beach
Giving out descriptions
Different for everyone I see
Since I just can't remember
Longer than last September.
Santiago
Under the volcano
Floats like a cushion on the sea
Yet I can never sleep here
Everything ponders in the night.
Rosalie
We've been talking all summer
Picking the straw from our clothes
See how the breeze has softened
Everything pauses in the night.
Is it ok if I don't make it?
Is it ok if I don't come around?
The light is fading and the sun has gone down
Bring it on back, Bring it on back, Bring it on back
Where's the day that never ended?
Tell me when it's time to open up my eyes
Light the morning with the sun on the rise
Bring it on back, Bring it on back, Bring on back
Bring it on back, Bring it on back, Bring it on back
For all that you do
For all that you had
For all that you said
Would you take it all back?
When all that you see
Is much more than you have
I'll Bring it on back, Bring it on back, Bring it on back
You wont know me till you need me
But I won't let you down so open up your eyes
The day is done, the sun has set in the sky
Be on your way the sun has set in the sky
Bring it on back, Bring it on back, Bring it on back
Bring it on back, Bring it on back, Bring it on back
For all that you do
For all that you had
For all that you said
Would you take it all back?
When all that you see
Is much more than you have
I'll Bring it on back, Bring it on back, Bring it on back
Just because your eyes are open
Doesn't mean you can see
So where do we go?
Well, that's between you and me
For all that you do
For all that you had
For all that you said
Would you take it all back?
When all that you see
Is much more than you have
I'll Bring it on back, Bring it on back, Bring it on back
October and the trees are stripped bare
Of all they wear.
What do I care?
October and kingdoms rise
And kingdoms fall
But you go on
And on.
Keep changing your mind
Like clouds in the sky
Love me when you're high
Leave me when you cry
I know it all
It takes time
Like a river running dry 
When the sun's too bright
So long, this is goodbye
May we meet again in another life
Like strangers passing by
May we see clearly in a different light
Keep dodging lights
Like a thief in the night
The sun will rise
And expose all the lies
So why deny that you and I
Lead different lives
The rivers from your eyes
Can't change my mind
So long, this is goodbye
May we meet again in another life
Like strangers passing by
May we see clearly in a different light
The rivers from your eyes
Can't change my mind
So long, this is goodbye
May we meet again in another life
Like strangers passing by
May we see clearly in a different light
He asked me, "So where have you been?"
Let me think, now let me see
I stood once where Hitler's feet had stood
When he made his speech in Nuremberg in '38
He tried to build the perfect race
He said,
"Black man ain't gonna run
Alongside our perfect sons."
It was Dallas to the library
The place they ended Kennedy
I stood where Oswald took his shot
In my opinion there's a bigger plot
Costners back into the left
The picket fence, the better bet
Paris came and Summer went
The tunnel's now a flower bed
The famous turf that made Geoff Hurst
The vodka stops to quench my thirst
Golden gate stroke Alcatraz
And the fat man failed to get us passes
Jimmy's corner in Raging Bull
De Niro's jokes and bottled pills
Elvis tales from Mr Woodward
Any Richard Burton if you could?
The tourists stare at tourist stops
One more picture, one more god
Another top up for a change
It makes you think, it makes you sane
Talking more about yourself
There's a mirror to have a check
Cheques are always passing through
Some depart but a lot come too
Restaurant talk of pick your teeth
You bite your tongue or chew your meat
Sleep to drink or drink to sleep
One more week and we will meet
We'll talk of what we haven't done
Since we departed back a month
We argue why we have to shout
All in all, it's nice to be out
City bird, haven't you heard?
Hasn't anybody told you?
The city blocks can't hold you
Your place is in the sky, how can I show you?
City bird, haven't you heard
Of the boundlessness of your freedom?
The sky is your blue kingdom
You neglect your wings like you don't need them
City bird, maybe these hands that feed you need you
Maybe you understand that, city bird
City bird, maybe these hands that feed you need you
Maybe you understand that, city bird
City bird, haven't you heard?
Hasn't anybody told you?
The city blocks can't hold you
Your place is in the sky, how can I show you?
This game of cruelty
Hardly becomes me
This game of cruelty
It's easily the most boring part of your week
Why can't you just say to me
I mean something to you?
Cause everybody knows
Everybody sees
That this is the thing you do to me
You think I'm living it, living it, living it, living it up
In the spotlight
You think I'm living it, living it, living it, living it up
It's a lie, lie
To what's next in your journal of ardency
Private, yes
But I think it's me
So give me a sign
Give me a warning
Please don't lie
Or take your time
Cause everybody knows
Everybody sees
That this is the thing you do to me
I don't care what you say
Just care what you do
When you touch me
You think I'm living it, living it, living it, living it up
In the spotlight
You think I'm living it, living it, living it, living it up
It's a lie, lie
Cause everybody knows
Everybody sees
That this is the thing you do to me
I don't care what you say
Just care what you do
When you touch me

Anger steaming up your glasses, you've been holding parties all your life.
Of course it's long gone down, you're still hanging around.
It's not over till it starts again.
Ha ha ha!
Hear me laughing! Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha ha! It died out long ago.
Did you hear me laughing in your head, when I saw you stuck in a rut again?
Oh that drink went down smoothly, just like the one before the last you had.
Questions I have answered, you are still asking yourself again.
Passed-out in the gutter, worn-out in your head,
Your voices aren't clear enough after all.
Ha ha ha!
Hear me laughing! Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha ha! It died out long ago.
Anger steaming up your glasses, you've been holding parties all your life.

Outside the storm clouds gathering
Moved silently along the dusty boulevard
Where flowers turning crane their fragile necks
So they can in turn reach up and kiss the sky
They're driven by a strange desire
Unseen by the human eye
Someone's calling
I remember when you held my hand
In the park we would play
When the circus came to town
Look over here
Outside the circus gathering
Moved silently along the rain swept boulevard
The procession moved on, the shouting is over
The fabulous freaks are leaving town
They're driven by a strange desire
Unseen by the human eye
Someone's calling
The carnival is over
We sat and watched
As the moon rose
For the very first time
Walt Grace, desperately hating his old place
Dreamed to discover a new space
And buried himself alive
Inside his basement
The tongue on the side of his face meant
He's working away on displacement
And what it would take to survive
'Cause when you're done with this world
You know the next is up to you
And his wife told his kids he was crazy
And his friends said he'd fail if he tried
But with the will to work hard and a library card
He took a homemade, fan blade, one-man submarine ride
That morning the sea was mad, and I mean it
Waves as big as he'd seen it
Deep in his dreams at home
From dry land, he rolled it over to wet sand
Closed the hatch up with one hand
And pedaled off alone
'Cause when you're done with this world
You know the next is up to you
And for once in his life, it was quiet
As he learned how to turn in the tide
And the sky was aflare when he came up for air
In his homemade, fan blade, one-man submarine ride
One evening, when weeks had passed since his leaving
The call she planned on receiving
Finally made it home
She accepted the news she never expected
The operator connected the call from Tokyo
'Cause when you're done with this world
You know the next is up to you
Now his friends bring him up when they're drinking
At the bar with his name on the side
And they smile when they can as they speak of the man
Who took a homemade, fan blade, one-man submarine ride
And you said it would be funny
To keep me hanging in suspense,
Then I'd run over to your house
And I'd scale the chain link fence
That borders your back yard
And that I'd climb through your window
And I'd whisper that I love you
As you fall out of your clothes
And we'd lay there in the darkness
Like the dream of you I had
Where we captured all the fireflies
And we knew what time we had
Could be counted on our fingertips
That almost made you cry
You let me hold you tightly
As we said all our goodbyes
May I say I loved you more
May I say I loved you more
And It must have been an hour
That I clutched you in my arms
And I must of said the the right things
Because you instantly felt warm
And you heard my heart stop beating
And you wanted not to cry
As your sympathetic whispers
They told a tale of bad goodbyes
And you swore you say me laughing
And I swore I saw you smile
And this time we spent together
Has got to last us quite awhile
As I take this piece of you with me
I'll carry it to my grave
Knowing that for someone you're an angel sent to save
(Keep breathing my angel, if you go down I go down with you, keep breathing, just keep breathing)
May I say I loved you more
(Keep breathing my angel, if you go down I go down with you, keep breathing, just keep breathing)
May I say I loved you more
Lets drink to the memories that we shared
Down one to all the hopes and cares
Here's two for being unaware, that you're gone
Because before too long you'll be a memory
Lets drink to the memories that we shared
(Before too long you'll be a memory)
Down one to all the hopes and cares
(Because before too long you'll be a memory)
Here's two for being unaware
(I said before too long you'll be a memory)
That you're gone
I said before too long you'll be a memory

Baby, why'd you have to leave?
Something up your sleeve?
Baby, I find it hard to breath
Moody (It's got me) x 8
Baby, why'd you have to leave?
Why'd you have to break free?
Why'd you have to go?
Moody (It's got me) x 7
Baby, why'd you have to run? 
Looking after number one?
Baby, why'd you have to go?
Why'd you have to phone? (??)
Something you're afraid to show? (??)
Someone else you'd rather phone? (??)
Moody (It's got me) Mooday (It's got me)...
You could never be a face in the crowd
So you're travelin' on, travelin' on out
Well you know I'd never say it out loud
But I'll be travelin' on, travelin' with you
Hey I'm too weak it's too much to fight off
A past so strong
But now, I don't think too much all the time
I'll just try to keep up
I can't believe what's happening now
I can't believe what's happening now
If you notice that I'm falling behind
I'm taking my time, taking it all in
So call me when you get where you're going
I'll keep travelin' on, travelin' to you
Hey don't be too hard on yourself
I'll be okay
'Cause we won't leave this place any worse than when we came
I can't believe what's happening now
I can't believe what's happening now
I love the way it's happening now
Their feet are cracked
As they break their back
In the sun-heat
It's all, yes, it's all
For your pennies
Their kids can't go to school
In the morning
Because narcotics grow better than books
And my only hope
Is for their mothers and their daughters
To be loved
Only New York can make it right
If they want to
The consensus is rather apathy
My soul, my soul cries for them
In the morning
Because I'm guilty just the same
But eye to eye
I haven't been
But my cries are swelling
'Cause they have faces
They have faces
And my only hope
Is for their mothers and their daughters
To be loved
There was a time, dark and divine
Exciting and new, shameful and true
Free to explore, we had it all
Towering trust, insatiable lust
Clouding the truth, both of us knew
This sordid affair is ending in tears
Yet we would go on, knowing the wrong
Until the day it was taken away
Oh, all our love fell down to Earth
Here, broken and cold, with great remorse
Before a while it all made sense
It might have been just a dark pretense
But you had me and I loved it
To be with you, to be the one
To live a lie, it really got me all excited
I felt wanted
Then in the night, the sorrowing sigh
Was taken away, deliverance came
Fell from the sky, heaven replied
Salvation in streams, silent and clean
All that we were, all that we knew
Faded away with tears in the rain
Yes all that we were, all that we knew
Is fading away like tears in the rain
All that we were, all that we knew
Fading away
All that we were, all that we knew
Fading away

Amanda said, "You have to go."
Amanda said, "It's time to go."
She said, "I'm tired of being homeless, restless."

I know it's hard to tell how mixed up you feel
Hoping what you need is behind every door
Each time you get hurt, I don't want you to change
Because everyone has hopes, you're human after all
The feeling sometimes, wishing you were someone else
Feeling as though you never belong
This feeling is not sadness, this feeling is not joy
I truly understand. Please, don't cry now
Please don't go, I want you to stay
I'm begging you please, please don't leave here
I don't want you to hate;
For all the hurt that you feel,
The world is just illusion, trying to change you
Being like you are
Well this is something else, who would comprehend?
But some that do, lay claim
Divine purpose blesses them
That's not what I believe, and it doesn't matter anyway
A part of your soul ties you to the next world
Or maybe to the last, but I'm still not sure
But what I do know, is to us the world is different
As we are to the world but I guess you would know that
Please don't go, I want you to stay
I'm begging you please, please don't leave here
I don't want you to hate for all the hurt that you feel
The world is just illusion trying to change you
Please don't go, I want you to stay
I'm begging you please, oh please don't leave here
I don't want you to change;
For all the hurt that you feel,
This world is just illusion, always trying to change you
Please don't go, I want you to stay
I'm begging you please, please don't leave here
I don't want you to hate for all the hurt that you feel
The world is just illusion trying to change you
Please don't go, I want you to stay
I'm begging you please, oh please don't leave here
I don't want you to change;
For all the hurt that you feel,
This world is just illusion, always trying to change you
Cannot hear what you're saying
Could I tell you so
And I can't leave my troubles 
And I'm going home
(Lie and) sleep
Under deep
You know
While the cold winter waitin'
While you (stumble home)
All these things we were searchin' 
Now we just don't know
(Lie and) sleep
Under deep
I think you know
For the rhymes of an hour
Now I'm goin' home
And I can't believe I'm nothin'
'Cause I'm coming DOWN
(Lie and) sleep
Under deep
Do you know
If I'm laughing
It comes from cry
I don't have tears anymore
(This part is sung in persian)
In her mourning
In her grave
Don't you miss the way
That she brushed her heavy hair
Oh la la la la la
ACID BURNed FACE CLOWNY TEAR SMILE
She's the one who made you wild
She made you question all your answers
Made you beg for her forgiveness
BABY GIRL don't cry
Momma's gonna buy you a glass eye
And it will glimmer like starlight
She's got no reservations
Ain't got no place to be
The graveyard's in the backyard
Where the meadows used to be
Lord knows my destination
Lord hears my inner prayer
Mom'll find me by the river
Sunken with her party balloons
Flowers for the ones you loved
Flowers for the lost at sea
Flowers for the ones you loved
Flowers for the lost at sea
Flowers for the ones you loved
Flowers for the lost at sea
Flowers for the ones you loved
Flowers for the lost at sea
Flowers for the ones you loved
Flowers for the lost at sea
Flowers for the ones you loved
Flowers for the lost at sea
Wiggly days, wiggly nights
When it's dark bring in light so you can see
What a sound, straight through my spine bounced off of me
Makes me round, 3-D sound, push it down, move it around
See, I'm fine
Ain't it strange that I can dream?
You can say it's night or day
Snow or rain it's all the same
When there's nothing I have ever seen
In here, in here
Ain't it strange that I can dream?
You can say it's night or day
Snow or rain it's all the same
Ain't it strange that I have brain activity?
In here, in here
Who brought those cameras in?
Who gave who the right?
Lennart Nilsson, shut off those lights
Inside a sea turned from frog to freak to tiny red and meek
Ain't it strange that I can dream?
You can say it's night or day
Snow or rain it's all the same
Strange that I'm a human being
Ain't it strange that I can dream?
You can say it's night or day
Snow or rain it's all the same
Living in the womb
Running out of room
Have to come out soon
Have to meet the sun and moon and
I like to stick to walls
Observing conversations, lifting them when they fall
I am a fire escape
My spine is made of iron, my heart pumps out old red paint
Save yourself, save yourself, yourself
Save yourself, save yourself
I see the seasons change
All the young faces come and replace the dying ones
Sit out on Lexington and Vine
All the pimps and prostitutes wave you down at stopping signs
Save yourself, save yourself, yourself
Save yourself, save yourself
Los Angeles, I've been waiting for you
To pick yourself up and change
The city you've made on this ocean of sand
Was founded on liars and self-made men
I've watched the dreamers find their legs
And I've seen the ones that come get reduced to bones and rags
'Cause I am a fire escape
My spine is made of iron, my heart pumps out old red paint
Save yourself, save yourself
(Save yourself) Save yourself, save yourself
Bros before hos,
Disagree on the sidelines.
Fight for a fee.
The man needs a maid.
The maid needs a maid.
Bros before hos
Is a rule, read the guidelines
You trouble me.
Your breasts heave when you sing,
Your mouth should be working for me
For free
Sewing up the fold,
'Cause I've been laid up.
Would you put on the fire for me,
Draw the bath and remind me to eat?
You won't need a real job.
You won't need a real job because I would love to pay for you.
You could be a good wife to me.
I would love to pay for you.
You are the maid for me.
I fell in love and I needed a road map
To find out where you lived, so excited now
Sleepwalking
'Cause I'm sleepwalking
The white trash boys listen to their headphones
Blasting white noise in the convenience store parking lot
I hung around there wasting my time
Hoping you'll stop by
'Cause I'm sleepwalking
I'm sleepwalking
A mutual friend's parents left town for a week
So we raided their liquor stash and walked down to the riverside
Sleepwalking
'Cause I'm sleepwalking
Who let you get on my train
Who let you pick up the mic
Who let the dogs out
Who's gonna clean up your mess
Fuck you, you fucking fuck
You ain't got nothing but bad, bad luck
Bad luck you've got in my ring
You dance like you've got
An unenviable case of ring sting
Who let you eat in my face
I ain't gonna clean up your mess
Who told you you could get on this stage
All dressed up like you're in some kind of rage
All dressed up like you're from some other age
Bet you thought you'd get away, didja
Bet you thought you'd hide from me, didja
Tanto, tanto, tanto claro
E tanto gris
Que raro, raro, raro
Que seja tanto assim
Sonâmbulo o um esquilo
Te faço gargalhar
Será que sou assim me vou sem ver o que não vi
Será que penso que me vou ainda fico aqui
Rubro, rubro, ouro, rimo
Desnuda o mineral
E qualquer nome lhe foi dado
Assim tá sem pensar
Pensam que na sabe nada
Que tu não pode amar
Dizem que é ver pra crer
Inútil explicar
Te tiram da tua calma e tua mãe a te buscar
Sem me lábios sem parar não pode tem encontrar
A vera rosa
Estranha rosa
Índio limpo, limpo, lindo
Sangue e algodão
Montanha viva, sacra, ferida, doce e celestial
Começa assim com tal tristeza
Termina tudo igual, tudo igual
Termina tudo igual, igual
Estranha rosa
Estranha rosa
Estranha rosa
Estranha rosa
Estranha rosa
Estranha rosa
Estranha rosa
Estranha rosa

Lips are falling 
Hair is falling to the ground

Falling, falling 
Down in silence to the ground 
All the world is falling, falling 
All the blue
From me and you
Tear drops falling to the ground
Tear drops
I'm talkin' 'bout your tear drops
For instance, oh my mama
She's been falling
Falling down for quite some time
And oh my papa
He's been falling
Falling down for quite some time
Oh, my friends
I've watched them falling
Falling softly to the ground
Like the leaves
The leaves are falling
Down in silence to the ground
Is this the rapture?
Is this the rapture?
Why don't you tell me?
Is this the rapture?
Is this the rapture?
Our father who art in heaven
For the kingdom, the power, the glory, yours
Now and forever
There's a love between us still
But something's changed and I don't know why
And all I want to do is go home with you
But I know I'm out of my mind
I want to touch you but I'm too late
I want to touch you but there's history
I can't believe that it's been three years
Now when I see you, it's so bittersweet
There's a love between us still
But something's changed and I don't know why
And all I want to do is go home with you
But I know I'm out of my mind
You want to touch me but you're too late
You want to touch me but there's too much history
Starting to live the lies we tell ourselves
I only need you to be friends with me
There's a love between us still
But something's changed and I don't know why
And all I want to do is go home with you
But I know I'm out of my mind
I've never felt so close
But now I know it's over
And all I want to do is go home with you
But I know I'm out of my mind
(Between us)
There's a love between us still but something's changed and I don't know why
(I've never felt so close, but now I know it's over)
And all I want to do is go home with you but I know I'm out of my mind
(Between us)
(Never felt, never felt, never, never felt)
Living next door to challenge
Things will never be the same again
I close my eyes and remember
A place in the sun
Where we used to live
Now death is in my yard
It's sneaking around out there
Hoping that I step on out
It longs for me, and someday we
Will go downtown in his car
Ask someone who knew me
They will never be the same again
They tell their lies and something dies
Inside us all, it makes me cry
Even though I know
This ship will still sail on
Long after I'm gone
Gone... I'll be gone
In this world of wisdom
No one never really has a clue
They kill their lives every day
With what they say and what they do
But heaven knows I know
That the ship will still sail on
Long after I'm gone
Gone... I'll be gone
The sun goes down as the city lights
Pave their way through the darkest night
Raindrops fall as an old man cries
Never thought to ever think twice
Of all he had
Of all he lost
A selfish life
That just comes with the cost
Hey, remember me
I remember you walking away
Hey, remember me
I remember you walking away
The same old streets just a different name
Same old house just the family's changed
Picket fence, the windows stained
Freedom spelled by a man in chains
Silence is all we have to give
And the memories of a life I wish we'd lived
Hey, remember me
I remember you walking away
Hey, remember me
I remember you walking away
From all that you made
That you lost
Or threw away
Traded in for a brand new life
But I can't
Can't let go
Can't turn around
Hold my head high and walk away
Hey, remember me
I remember you walking away
Hey, remember me
I remember you walking away
Lookin' back at the crash site
I don't see me by the roadside
Well this heart is on wheels tonight
Straight through the ghettos and without lights
Now every heart has a blind side
Where it knows how to improvise
Well this place is a whorehouse tonight
Cheap lovers make expensive wives
But all of these horses
That you chase around
In the end they are the ones
That always bring you down
This invisible city
Where no one sees nothing
We're touching faces in the dark
Feelin' pretty is so hard
Now all of these voices
And all of these noises
With all their illusions of choices
They've come to my door
With one dozen roses
The imitation of good faith
Is how you stumble upon hate
It may've been the first of mistakes
When we held on too loosely that opened the gates
Now all of these horses
That you chase around
In the end they are the ones
That always bring you down
This invisible city
Where no one sees nothing
We're touching faces in the dark
Feelin' pretty is so hard
Now I try not to tell lies
But there's pressures from inside
So I've learned how to compromise
Good people for alibis
But all of these horses
That you chase around
In the end they are the ones
That always bring you down
This invisible city
Where no one sees nothing
We're touching faces in the dark
Feelin' pretty is so hard
Yeah
There's something in your ways, that makes me wanna stay here for a thousand years
So just cry your fears, yeah, I need you everyday
Inside you I just want to wipe away your fears
So just cry your tears yeah
I wish I was with you
If I stay, well than your tears will set you free
If I stay right here and forever with you
Everything I feel for you, is everything I want to stay with you
If I stay right here, and forever with you
My eyes, my eyes
This is tearing me apart, I wish I could be in your soft arms
Feel you again, anytime I feel like I'm too far
Then I will try to remember all ours, and, your memories I know
I wish I was in you
If I stay, well then your tears will set you free
If I stay right here than forever with you
Everything I feel for you, is everything I want to stay with you
If I stay right here, than forever with you
My eyes, my eyes
My eyes, my eyes
Instrumental
All my friends,
They all live in pain.
Longing for the warmth of childhood
To bring them home again.
All my friends
Got broken hearts.
And if the world's a stage,
We're searching for our parts.
We'll face the winds
That break the strongest of trees.
And beckon for the sweet, soft, summer breeze.
All my friends
Got broken wings.
Never will you hear them asking why
The caged bird sings.
All my friends,
Know how to live.
Oh so much sorrow,
So much love to give.
We'll face the winds,
That break the strongest of trees.
Beckon for the sweet, soft, summer breeze.
We all know that storm is coming.
Everybody wants to know which way to go.
I see the crowds running,
Aw, the winds gonna blow.
All my friends
Are dear to me.
Oh when the storm comes,
They're as close as family.
All my friends
Are the ones I chose.
Oh, if I hear them knocking,
You know I can't refuse.
We'll face the winds
That break the strongest of trees.
And beckon for the sweet, soft, summer breeze.
All my friends.
I found your house and I saw your car
But I've no idea where you are from the dial-a-view
Tire scraps on the federal roads look like crash landed crows
From the dial-a-view

Good luck
I dream at night (ha)
Of goin' home someday
Somewhere so far away
So dream all right (ha)
I know it's gonna take some time
I'm going home someday
Fifteen years is almost done
And I don't recognize anyone from the dial-a-view
My home, my friends and you
I watch them fade but what can I do
From the dial-a-view?

I dream...
When no one cares
And the phone never rings
The nights are endless things
You're like a child that cries
And no one heeds the crying
You're like a star that dies
And seems to keep on dying
When no one cares
You count souvenirs
And they glisten with your tears
You can't believe a love like hers
Could come from someone new
When no one cares but you
When no one cares but you
When no one cares but you
London, did you have to take my child away?
You buried him under rent and low pay.
I've been cycling in circles 'round your empty streets.
I've been searching in the pouring rain.
I've been going alone to the cinema.
I've been stealing all my food from the electric avenue.
Now the pigeons gather 'round my feeding hand.
And we talk till the evening fades.
I have learnt how it goes.
What you wait for never shows.
And what you least wanted, holds you down like a stone.
Just like a stone.
So.
Now I feed the birds. Day after day.
Only they can hear me pray for.
A lighter heart. A lighter load.
To be moving. Moving. Moving my way home.
My, way home.
Way home.
My, way home.
It's so funny
We went down to the store
We got the money
So we'll put you down
We got the money, we got the money, we got the money
We got the money, we got money, we got the money now
It's so funny, we went down to the store
We got the money so we'll put you down
It's so funny, we went down to the store
And I won't even let you home
We got the money, we got the money, we got the money
We got the money, we got money, we got the money
Instrumental
Everything I've learned I have forgotten
Everything I've forgotten looks just like new
I pulled the ends out for the tie that binds
To keep my promise with you
With my eyes on the prize
And my mind on you
I put my pride on the line
My whole life too
Now anything you ask me for is yours
Now say the word and I'll lay it at your feet
I'll meet the pavements down the line somehow
If you keep your promise with me
With my eyes on the prize
And my mind on you
I put my pride on the line
And my whole life too
You say, take your axe and fashion me a kind of swing
Walkin' blues have played a number on my feet
I'll dance whatever dance you need to dance
'Cause you keep you promise with me
You'll keep your promise with me
You'll keep your promise
You'll keep your promise
You'll keep your promise with me
I turned them all away
I turned it all away
When I leave there's nothing left to say
I won't answer my phone
You call it all you want
River runs and takes the boats away
I thought I'd never see
River so clear and mean
How many others have you drowned?
River's bottom dark and blue
Why do I love you so?
River so clear and blue
I'm so in love with you, but you'll drown me.
You'll drown me.
River so clear and blue
What it takes to ignore you
How many boys have you drowned?
Chokes me until I'm dead
There are places in my head
That I could never conquer.
River so clear and blue,
I am in love with you.
River's bottom dark and blue,
Why do I love you?
You'll drown me.
You'll drown me.
I lost myself on a cool damp night
Gave myself in that misty light
Was hypnotized by a strange delight
Under a lilac tree
I made wine from the lilac tree
Lost my heart in its recipe
It made me see what I want to see
And be what I want to be
But I think more than I ought to think
I do things I never should do
I drink much more than I ought to drink
Because it brings me back you...
Lilac wine is sweet and heady
Like my love
Lilac wine, I feel unsteady
Like my love
Listen to me...
I cannot see clearly
Isn't that he coming to me nearly here?
Lilac wine is sweet and heady
Where's my love?
Lilac wine, I feel unsteady
Where's my love?
Listen to me, why is everything so hazy?
Isn't that he, or am I going crazy, dear?
Lilac Wine, I feel unready
For my love... feel unready
For my love

Everyone has their obsession
Consuming thoughts, consuming time
They hold high their prized possession
That defines the meaning of their lives
You are mine
There are objects of affection
That can mesmerize the soul
There is always one addiction
That just can not be controlled
You are mine
Everyone has their obsession
Consuming thoughts, consuming time
They hold high their prized possession
They hold high their prized possession
You are mine
So you trying to do what they did
Your friends that turn to liquid
And got lost in the sea
And now you're drowning me
With your talk of four leaf clovers
You turn to rocks and omen
To beat the ambient harm
But it's bruising your karma
Oh I wish my arms were wider
I wish that I could hide you
So you can rest and repair
Without the blanket of sorrow
The thick and the grey
Your blanket of woe
So heavy and stained
And it only weighs you down
So you thought that getting sober
Would mean your life was over
I don't think it's that bad
I don't think it's that sad
Just you sleep a little baby
Leave the world alone and later
If you wake up alive
That old blanket of sorrow
Could be feathers and down
Your blanket of woe
Would leave you alone
And I can love you till you drown
Come to me let's drown
Come baby let's drown
In feathers and down
Echoes start as a cross in you,
Trembling noises that come to soon.
Spatial movement which seems to you,
Resonating your mask or feud.
Hollow talking and hollow girl,
Force it up from the root of pain.
Never said it was good, never said it was near,
Shadow rises and you are here.
And then you cut;
You cut it out,
And everything
Goes back to the beginning.
Silence seizes a cluttered room,
Light is shed not a breath too soon.
Darkness rises in all you do,
Standing and drawn across the room.
Spatial movements are butterflies
Shadows scatter without a fire.
There's never been bad, there has always been truth,
Muted whisper of the things she'll move.
And then you cut;
You cut it out.
And everything
Goes back to the beginning.
Never said it was good, never said it was new,
Muted whisper of the things you feel.
Yeah we were running and how we were running
Across the hills in the pop art blue
Buzzards fly above the car
Circling us as if they knew
If I falter, If I falter
Darling will you reel me in?
If I lose it, If I lose it
Will you remind where we've been?
So we were climbing and how we were climbing
The cartoon trees up to the sky
As the sun dropped off the page
Gold it flew into my eye
Well it's all up from here.
It's like I can taste opportunity near.
I cut myself on barbed wire, getting wood for the fire
I was too... busy staring at you...
You...
So then we were floating up, we were floating like particles into the night
High above the factories
We hitched a lift on a satellite
Lover, will you spin me round?
May we never fall back to ground
Well it's all up from here
It's like I can taste opportunity near
I cut myself on barbed wire
Getting wood for the fire
I was too... Busy staring at you...
Well it's all up from here
It's like I can taste opportunity near
I cut myself on barbed wire
Getting wood for the fire
I was too... Busy staring at you...
I was too... Busy staring at you...(Falling into) (Getting wood for the fire)
I was too... Busy staring at you...(Into your eyes) (Getting wood for the fire)
I was too... Busy staring at you...(Falling into) (Getting wood for the fire)
I was too... Busy staring at you...(Into your eyes) (Getting wood for the fire)
You... (Falling in to)
(Into your eyes)
(Into your eyes)
(Getting wood for the fire)
(Getting wood for the fire)
(Falling into)
(Into your eyes)
(Falling into)
(Into your eyes)
We'll stick together forever
Stay sick together
Be crazy forever
I was sleeping by the wasteside of tomorrow
But it's better than sleeping by the wasteside of today
All the barbershops and funeral homes were open, oh
And the customers were coming
And the business was doing great
I was sleeping by the wasteside of tomorrow
Dreaming dreams and drooling on my bed
All the people in my town would be born
And they'd, and they'd get themselves a hair cut
And then promptly after they'd be dead
I was sleeping by the wasteside of tomorrow
When a drunk girl awoke me on the train
But I did not hear her mumbling
And I did not hear her stumbling
As I dubbed myself a passenger
And kindly stepped away
I was sleeping by the wasteside of tomorrow, of tomorrow
I was sleeping, I was sleeping by the wasteside
I was sleeping, I was sleeping by the wasteside of tomorrow
I was sleeping, ladies and gentlemen
I was sleee-eeeahhhh
I was sleeping by the wasteside of tomorrow
But it's better than sleeping by the wasteside of today
All the barbershops and funeral homes were open
And the customers were coming
And the business was doing so, so great
Instrumental
The grass is screaming long
Midnight cars roll past
I've been chasing your room
While the summer lasts
So count it on your fingers if we got it wrong
It's because the days have no numbers
If we leave tonight then we leave it all behind
Drinking alphabetically because the beauty's gone all sore
Honey dripping pale of skin while there's bodies underneath
The floor
So count it on your fingers
If we got it wrong it's cause the days have no numbers
If we leave tonight
Then we leave it all behind
After the show you walked right past
Arms reached out for your autograph
And as you flashed your backstage pass
I caught your eye with a camera's flash
When the band came out they stood behind you
Cymbals crashed, the lights went blue
You stood alone in the halo's haze
Shiny guitar hung on gold lamé
And you, you were the lonely one
You were the lonely one
When you perform it's so intense
When the critics pan I write in your defense
I understand I'm just a fan
I'm just a fan
When I get home, I turn off the alarm
I've checked the phone, no messages on
I play the ones from yesterday
I play you're song just to hear you say that
You, you're the lonely one
You are the lonely one
You, you're the lonely one
You are the lonely one
You could have it all
You could pawn it off
You could learn to crawl
Where you used to walk
And I... I'm only burning vanities
You could tell a tale
You could sell it off
You could find a grail
Made of cinder block
And I... I'm only burning vanities
Chasing fireflies
Lucid dreams
This pre-life crisis, is killing me
Beautiful, tragedy of who I was
Was it me, yeah yeah
(Ooh ah) You make it eaiser to be (ooh ah)
Easier to be me (ooh ah)
It's hard to believe (ooh ah)
You make it easy
Speaking silence
Words can break
It feels like we are falling awake
In a place, in a time of our own, yeah yeah
(Oh ah) You make it eaiser to be (ooh ah)
Easier to be me (ooh ah)
It's hard to believe (ooh ah)
You make it easy
Feel from the world
Feel from my feet
Give up on myself
You didn't give up on me
Let myself go
You were still there
Like coming home
Coming up for air
Yeah Yeah
(Ooh ah) You make it easier to be (ooh ah)
Easier to be me (ooh ah)
It's hard to believe (ooh ah)
You make it easy (ooh ah)
Easier to be (ooh ah)
To be me (ooh ah) (ooh ah)
Maybe I didn't realize
The way I loved the way you moved
Till I moved so far away
I couldn't see you anymore
And maybe all those secret times
Didn't seem so bad until I knew
All of my little secrets
Weren't all that secret anymore
Maybe it's all right
I mean, I went and found the modern world
But I miss the way life was
When you were my girl
I know I never noticed then
Just what it was I had
Up until I lost you,
And man, did I lose you
Ain't that the way it always goes?
And I know you are gonna be just fine
You know they say it's better
To have loved and to lose it
Than to never ever know it
Easy come and easy go, whatever
Maybe it's all right,
I mean, I went and found the modern world
But I miss the way life was
When you were my girl
Spinning your umbrella over your head
You should be in bed but you're here instead
Walking with me towards a midnight swim
I can give you, baby, what you can't get from him
Songbird's singing in an old dead tree
The way you drive honey scares the hell out of me
A hundred miles an hour on a brand new road
Look at me again, you'll make my heart explode
Hey, hey, little fighter girl
It's you and me up against this whole wide world
Sleeping together in the lion's den
Got your earrings in my pocket till I see you again
Clouds roll by, laying up on the hill
Everything is still, do you think we will?
If we do, there'll be no turning back
If we don't, well, there is no chance of that
Hey, hey, little fighter girl
It's you and me up against this whole wide world
Sleeping together in the lion's den
Got your earrings in my pocket till I see you again
Yeah, yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Yeah, yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Yeah, yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Yeah, yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Come on, kiss me
Keep on kissin' me
Come on, kiss me
Keep on kissin' me
Cars in the distance, a bicycle bell
Dogs are barking as the kingdom fell
In its place stood a golden town
Where people walk without touching the ground
Hey, hey, little fighter girl
It's you and me now against this whole wide world
Sleeping together in the lion's den
Baby, I can't sleep at all until I see you again
Yeah, yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Yeah, yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Yeah, yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Yeah, yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Come on, kiss me
Keep on kissin' me
Come on, kiss me
Keep on kissin' me, yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Skapaður í mynd manns í líki karls og
Konu tvöföld var sú synd hans sgaði hans
Sonur ekki hryggja heldur sefa mín lífs-
Speki alltaf rétt ?
Betra er að þiggja en gefa sagði sá ríki og
Öll hans stétt ég sem kenndi hér svo margt
En engin nam það á mig fékk en ég lærði
Að lífið hér var hart enda var ég það sem á
Krossinum hékk heiðarlegur einfari það var ég það ég sver
En hinn breiði vegur var greiðfærari hann geng ég og krossinn ber

Hey friends don't you think you better cool it down
You're always gettin' curious and leavin' town
You know I like it being in your family
I wonder what would happen if nobody left
We'd all stick around if we'd all stick around
And here's a question that's been tested:
Tell me, if we sleep together
Would it make it any better?
If we sleep together
Would you be my friend forever?
If we sleep together
Would it make it any better?
If we sleep together
Would you be my friend?
Hey friend listen up their playing our song
On the radio, do you have to go?
I really like it, this rock and roll
Makes me want a little sugar in my bowl
It's like the glory days, it's like a fortune sold
And here's a question that's been tested:
Tell me, if we sleep together
Would it make it any better?
If we sleep together
Would you be my friend forever?
If we sleep together
Would it make it any better?
If we sleep together
Would you be my friend?
Let's none of us forget about who we are
So choose a path and follow it
Take a pill and swallow it
None of us forget about who we are
It's not forever we can fool around in the dark
If we sleep together
Would it make it any better?
If we sleep together
Would you be my friend forever?
If we sleep together
Would it make it any better?
If we sleep together
Would you be my friend forever?
Supercollider
Dust in a moment
Particles scatter
Parting from the soup
Swimming upstream
Before the heavens crack open
Thin pixelations
Coming out from the dark
In a blue light
In a green light
In a half life
In a work light
I'm a B-spin
Flip flopping
I'm a pulse wave
Outstepping
I'll put the shadows
Back into
The boxes
I am open
I am welcome
For a fraction
Of a second
I have jettisoned
My illusions
I have dislodged
My depressions
And put the shadows
Back into
The boxes
And put the shadows
Back into
The boxes
I've seen the angels
Hanging over
The balcony
I've seen the angels
Hanging over
The balcony
Over here
The ladies all want sweet perfume
But there's never a rose
And over there
The roses are frightened to bloom
So they never can grow
And over here they need wool
For weaving their baby's new clothes
But nobody has any wool
And the sheep are all lost in the harbour
Lost in the harbour
And over here
They want diamonds to wear
But there aren't any here
And over there
Everyone's hiding their tears
But they're crying inside
And the wall won't come down
Till they're no longer afraid of themselves
If you don't believe me ask yourselves
And then I can come down to the harbour
Down to the harbour
And then I will fill the ocean back up with my tears
I still have a couple more years
And then I can come back to the harbour
Down to the harbour
Car is parked, bags are packed, but what kind of heart doesn't look back
At the comfortable glow from the porch, the one I will still call yours?
All those words came undone and now I'm not the only one
Facing the ghosts that decide if the fire inside still burns
All I have, all I need, he's the air I would kill to breathe
Holds my love in his hands, still I'm searching for something
Out of breath, I am left hoping someday I'll breathe again
I'll breathe again
Open up next to you and my secrets become your truth
And the distance between that was sheltering me comes in full view
Hang my head, break my heart built from all I have torn apart
And my burden to bear is a love I can't carry anymore
All I have, all I need, he's the air I would kill to breathe
Holds my love in his hands, still I'm searching for something
Out of breath, I am left hoping someday I'll breathe again
It hurts to be here
I only wanted love from you
It hurts to be here
What am I gonna do?
All I have, all I need, he's the air I would kill to breathe
Holds my love in his hands, still I'm searching
All I have, all I need, he's the air I would kill to breathe
Holds my love in his hands, still I'm searching for something
Out of breath, I am left hoping someday I'll breathe again
I'll breathe again
And so you could become very sensitive to everything, you start walking through the studio, you go: 'ah yes, it's going to be a good day, I can feel -
Give me your hand
The dog in the garden road
Is covered in mud
And dragging your mother's clothes
Cinder and smoke
The snake in the basement found
The juniper shade
The farmhouse is burning down
Give me your hand
And take what you will tonight
I'll give it as fast
And high as the flame will rise
Cinder and smoke
Some whispers around the trees
The juniper bends
As if you were listening
Give me your hand
Your mother is drunk as all
The firemen shake
A photo from father's aunt
Cinder and smoke
You'll ask me to pray for rain
With ash in your mouth
You'll ask it to burn again
(Come to)
I'm kneeling down 
To get closer to the sign 
And you're breaking my back every time
It's hard to see it 
For all the rust 
But I saw it fading and I have some faith in us
Don't need to tell me 
You know this ain't nothing new 
Of course I love you 
Of course I do
But to outplay is not to love 
And yet I keep on coming back to call your bluff
It's hard to see it 
For all the rust 
But I saw it fading and I have some faith in us
Your evening eyes, the rain outside, the way I know
No fear that I'll be fading out alone
It's hard to see it, for all the rust
But I saw it fading and I have some faith in us
One of these days you'll be
Under the covers you'll be
Under the table and you'll realize
That all of your days are numbered;
All of them one to one hundred.
All of them millions.
All of them trillions.
So what are you gonna do with them all?
You can not trade them in for more.
No, no
Take every moment, you know that you own them.
It's all you can do, use what's been given to you.
Give me a reason
To fight the feeling
That there's nothing here for me.
'Cause none of its easy,
I know it wasn't meant to be.
I know it's all up to me,
I know it's all up to me.
So what am I gonna do with my time?
Oh
I'll take every moment, I know that I own them.
It's all up to you to do whatever you choose.
Live like you're dying and never stop trying.
It's all you can do, use what's been given to you.
All of the moments you didn't notice;
Gone in the blink of an eye.
All of the feelings you can't help feeling
No matter how you try.
Oh oh
Take every moment, you know that you own them.
It's all you can do, use what's been given to you.
Live like you're dying and never stop trying.
It's all you can do, use what's been given to you.
Live like you're dying and never stop trying.
It's all up to you, use what's been given to you.
Oh oh

By digitising thunder and traffic noises, Georgia was able to compose aleatoric music
Heey, uh, ummmm, heey, oh girl, oh girl
We did everything we could do
To try to maake it work (we did, we did)
Baby, you look so confused, cause it feels like, there was no way we could lose (no way, no way)
Baby, I just don't reply 'cause I can't find the things you need in me (I can't, I can't girl)
Baby, they know just know what to say, the trying to break us away from one another, but maybe their right for a change
I think, God will give you
Someone, much better
Than me, trust me your eyes will be o.k. it will be all right.
You'll be just fine (just fine, just fine)
I know that baby we would disagree constitly on the basic things (we did, we did)
You thought that there was someone else, all along (no way, no way)
Baby I, want ? to decide ? by his side (I can't, I can't)
Baby, they know just what to say.
They wanna keep us away from one another
But Maybe they're right for a change
I think, God will give you
Someone, much better
Than me, trust me your eyes will be
O.k.(o.k.), all right (all right), just fine (just fine)
I know, baby baby can't you see that another fella just may be the kinda man you need
Baby you desvere it and I know that

You earned it (you earned it)
I think, God will give you
Someone, much better
Than me, trust me your eyes will be
O.k., it will all right, it will be just fine (just fine)

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Sits down by the fire
Ease his worried mind
If only I could try
Reach the light inside
Feels so hard to say
Chase his fears away
Know that I won't try
Catch his dreams today
There are very many things
I would like to say to you
But I've lost my way
And I've lost my words
There are very many places
I would like to go
But I can't find the key
To open my door
The weight of my words
You can't feel it anymore
The weight of my words
You can't feel it anymore
There are very many ways
I would like to break the spell
You've cast upon me
Because all the time
I sacrificed myself
To make you want me
Has made you haunt me
The weight of my words
You can't feel it anymore
The weight of my words
You can't feel it anymore
The weight of my words
You can't feel it anymore
There are very many things
I would like to say to you
But I've lost my way
And I've lost my words
There are very many places
I would like to go
But I can't find the key
To open my door
Near the east Waverly Hills, your hair pinned back
In previous lives, we were frozen sticks
But these aren't so rigid
I throw off my coat to feel this January air
They wrote a book for the two of us
To read our books on
The darkest light before a darker night
We slip underwater
The bridge disappears, the deer hunt is in the frigid air
Somewhere around here there are witches
Somewhere around here there are witches
Somewhere around here, somewhere around here
Somewhere around here, somewhere around here
Somewhere around here, somewhere around here
Somewhere around here, somewhere around here
Somewhere around here, somewhere around here
Somewhere around here, somewhere around here
Somewhere around here, somewhere around here
Somewhere around here
How did you know?
It's what I always wanted
Could never have had too many of these
Well you, quit kicking me under the table
I'm trying; will somebody make her shut up about it?
Can we settle down, please?
This world, I've been right
Bite down deep breaths
This world, I've been right
Bite down deep breaths
This world, I've been right
Bite down deep breaths
This world, I've been right
Bite down deep breaths
This world, I've been right
Bite down deep breaths
This world, I've been right
Bite down deep breaths

Bite down deep breaths

Memories we share together
Moments no one else can know
I will keep them close to me
Never let them go
Once you filled my hands with roses
Then you gave your heart to me
When a kiss had followed this
Love was meant to be
Time goes by
And the snow is drifting
Slowly in the sky
Cold, cold night
As you lie beside me
I can hear your heartbeat
You have lost yourself in dreaming
I have lost myself in you
Now we lie beneath the sky
Stars and midnight blue
Wheels on fire
Why don't you
Tell me lies
You ought to
Wheels on fire
Why don't you say goodbye
Well there's a light
And there's a hope
Come swing me baby
From this here rope
I sold you a lie
And prayed that maybe
Someday you'd return it
Lord knows I've earned it
I keep finding words that leave you - I told you I don't mind
Something tells me I'm not meant to - I told you I don't mind
I keep finding words that leave you
Wheels on fire
Why don't you
Tell me lies
You ought to
Wheels on fire
Why don't you say goodbye
Well there's a light
And there's a hope
Come swing me baby
From this here rope
I sold you a lie
And preyed that maybe
Someday you'd return it
Lord knows I've earned it
I keep finding words that leave you - I told you I don't mind
Something tells me I'm not meant to - I told you I don't mind
I keep finding words that leave you
Wheels on fire
Why don't you
Tell me lies
You ought to
Wheels on fire
Why don't you say goodbye
Wheels on fire
Why don't you
Tell me lies
You ought to
Wheels on fire
Why don't you say goodbye
Wheels on fire
Why don't you
Tell me lies
You ought to
Wheels on fire
Why don't you say goodbye
Wheels on fire
Why don't you
Tell me lies
You ought to
Wheels on fire
Why don't you say goodbye
I met Ferdinand de Saussure
On a night like this
On love he said
"I'm not so sure
I even know what it is
No understanding
No closure
It is a nemesis
You can't use a bulldozer
To study orchids"
He said...
So we don't know anything
You don't know anything
I don't know anything
About love
But we are nothing
You are nothing
I am nothing
Without love
I'm just a great composer
And not a violent man
But I lost my composure
And I shot Ferdinand
Crying "It's well and kosher
To say you don't understand
But this is for Holland-Dozier-Holland"
His last words were
We don't know anything
You don't know anything
I don't know anything
About love
But we are nothing
You are nothing
I am nothing
Without love
His fading words were
We don't know anything
You don't know anything
I don't know anything
About love
But we are nothing
You are nothing
I am nothing
Without love
"Carving my initials on your-"
"Carving my initials on your forehead"
"Carving my initials on your-"
"Carving my initials on your forehead"
Now, if you're never gonna move
Oh, my love
You'll make me come to you
But I'm still dancing on my own
Still dancing on my own
Although I'm coming close to you
Oh, my love
I'll keep the dance floor warm
But I'm still dancing on my own
Still dancing on my own
Won't dance, not without you
Small steps, they don't lead to your heart
You keep me wishing in the dark
What's wrong, you cannot lose
My eyes only see to your heart
You keep me wishing in the dark
"Carving my initials on your-"
"Carving my initials on your forehead"
Now, if you're never gonna move
Oh, my love
You'll make me come to you
But I'm still dancing on my own
Still dancing on my own
Although I'm coming close to you
Oh, my love
I'll keep the dance floor warm
But I'm still dancing on my own
Still dancing on my own
I know you hear me but can you reach me
Feel free to touch me and we can play hard
With body's jerking, but still I'm working
On you to move in and we can play hard
Now, if you're never gonna move
Oh, my love
You'll make me come to you
But I'm still dancing on my own
Still dancing on my own
Although I'm coming close to you
Oh, my love
I'll keep the dance floor warm
But I'm still dancing on my own
Still dancing on my own
We can play hard
"Carving my initials on your-"
Hard, hard
"Carving my initials on your forehead"
We can play hard, hard, hard
We can play hard, hard, hard
Hard, hard
"Carving my initials on your-"
Hard, hard
"Carving my initials on your forehead"
We can play hard, hard, hard
We can play hard
"Carving my initials on your-"
Hard, hard
"Carving my initials on your forehead"
Hard, hard
Now, if you're never gonna move
Oh, my love
You'll make me come to you
But I'm still dancing on my own
Still dancing on my own
Although I'm coming close to you
Oh, my love
I'll keep the dance floor warm
But I'm still dancing on my own
Still dancing on my own
Now, if you're never gonna move
Oh, my love
You'll make me come to you
But I'm still dancing on my own
Still dancing on my own
Although I'm coming close to you
Oh, my love
I'll keep the dance floor warm
But I'm still dancing on my own
Still dancing on my own
Tell me
Tell me that you want me
And I'll be your completely
For better or for worse
I know
We'll have our disagreements
Be fighting for no reason
I wouldn't change it for the world
'Cause I know
The first day that I met you
I was never gonna let you
Let you slip away
And I
Still remember feeling nervous
Trying to find the words to
Get you here today
'Cause you make my heart feel like it's summer
When the rain is pouring down
You make my whole world feel so right when it's wrong
That's why I know you are the one
That's how I know you are the one
In life
It's easy to get scared oh
But with you I am prepared for
What has yet to come
'Cause our two
Hearts will make it easy
Joining up the pieces
Together making life
'Cause you make my heart feel like it's summer
When the rain is pouring down
You make my whole world feel so right when it's wrong
That's why I know you are the one
That's how I know you are the one
When we are together you make me feel like my mind is free and my dreams are reachable
Whoa
You know I never ever believed in love, I believed one day you were gonna come along
Free me
'Cause you make my heart feel like it's summer
When the rain is pouring down
You make my whole world feel so right when it's wrong
That's why I know you are the one [x4]
Way up high.
And you tell me, you tell me not to cry.
Did you understand I can't help it?
Did you understand I don't have a choice?
Do you want to go?
Do you really know?
I don't ever stay away for you, oh no.
Do you want to go?
Do you really know that I can't, I can't afford you?
Stay.
I'm saving money.
And I know, I don't got the money.
You are no angel.
Because I can't give you what you need.
No, I can't give you what you need, all by myself.
Do you want to go?
Do you really know?
I don't ever stay away for you, oh no.
Do you want to go?
Do you really know that I can't, I can't afford you?
I am yours.
I am tired.
And I, I... I don't say that you're right, no no...
I know...
Do you want to go?
Do you really know?
I don't ever stay away for you, oh no.
Do you want to go?
Do you really know that I can't, I can't afford you?
Destiny turned her face
Nightmares and violent shapes
State of dreaming
Has left me numb
Blue eyes and wandering lips
True lies with fingertips
Hidden tales of forbidden
Love
You've left me miserable
Miserable
Miserable
Mis-er-a-ble
Love
You've left me miserable
Miserable
Miserable
Mis-er-a-ble
Maybe we're just sleepwalking
Maybe we're just sleepwalking
Visions of better times
Kingdoms and lilac wine
Why did God fail
To improve us
Teardrops of acid rain
Burning down through my veins
Can't I just sleep for now
Now
Despite my fears
I dance for you
And did what others knew
I
Would care
Would wait
And live again
More desperate
Desperate
Yeah
Maybe we're just sleepwalking
Maybe we're just sleepwalking
Yeah
Maybe we're just sleepwalking
Maybe we're just sleepwalking
Maybe we're just sleepwalking
(Now despite my fears I dance for you)
Maybe we're just sleepwalking
Maybe we're just sleepwalking
(Oh would care would wait and live again)
Maybe we're just sleepwalking
Maybe we're just sleepwalking
Maybe we're just sleepwalking
Into the brave new world
I hope I see you on the other side of this changing world
Baby when my ship pulls in
I try to believe in anyone look at the state I'm in
But for now I'm just sitting at the table
Hearing songs wishing I was able, stable
Nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah, nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah
Nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah (I hope I see you on the other side)
Nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah (I hope I see you on the other side)
Brother don't try to find
Don't try to believe in anyone for I would change your mind
Baby when my ship pulls in
I try to believe in anyone look at the state I'm in, I'm fine
But for now I'm just sitting at the table
Hearing songs wishing I was able, stable
Nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah (I hope I see you on the other side)
Nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah (I hope I see you on the other side)
Nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah (I hope I see you on the other side)
Nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah (I hope I see you on the other side)
I hope I see you on the other side, I hope I see you on the other side
I hope I see you on the other side, I hope I see you on the other side
I hope I see you on the other side
But for now I'm just sitting at the table
Hearing songs wishing I was able, stable
Nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah, nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah
Nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah (I hope I see you on the other side)
Nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah (brave new world)
Nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah (I hope I see you on the other side)
Nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah (brave new world)
When I lose I will find out
When I lose for the last time
She's aware of her implant
That she bears a wingspan
She's afraid of her implant
It is out of her hands
Her wing beat is humming loud, is humming loud
Send her seeds, a painful sound
Her wing beat is humming loud, is humming loud
Send her seed, a painful sound
... Loud
Instrumental
So far away and so alone 
How could I ever take you home
You're beautiful, beautiful 
You've got a devastating point of view
And everything you say is true 
You're beautiful, beautiful
The nightbirds start to sing their favorite song
"The Way You Say Good-Night" 
The nightbirds start to sing their favorite song 
And the moon begins to sing 
I kiss you and the sun goes down 
How come it's always dark when you're around
You're beautiful, beautiful 
The nightbirds start to sing their favorite song 
The moon begins to sing 
You're beautiful, beautiful
The stars begin their Busby Berkeley dance
"The Way You Say Good-Night"
And the night becomes a musical extravaganza
"The Way You Say Good-Night"
The way you say good-night 
I dream of all day long 
Oh, I could write a song about the way you say good-night...
Last night I saw a ghost
He seemed familiar to me
I welcomed him
With open arms
He said my name
And laid me down
Awoke the dreams still sleeping in my bones
You are my precious ghost
I close my eyes to see
I've touched you once again
You spent the night with me
Guilty were our pleasures
Nameless was our crime
Come back my forbidden ghost
One more time
You must leave I understand
So tell your lie to me
How in the morning everything will be all right
Yeah but to get to the morning first you have to get through the night
Oh no, I didn't mean to say what I did say
About lovers and how they should lay
That was never for me to say and say
Don't you see now how I pay
I see the sun rising
But all you see is fall, fall, fall
So come on up
Wasn't you who said life was like a plastic cup
To be used and then disposed of
But that's no way to live a life like yours
Don't you see now how I pay
I see the sun rising
But all you see is fall, fall, fall
For all the times I never
Never turned away
And now she's here on someone else's arm
For all the times I never
Never turned her way
And now she's here on someone else's arm
Take everything away
This gnarled, weird face
This ripe swollen shape
I want blank
I want frozen lake
I want deep space
Tuck the whole thing
In the body of a violin
String it up on a fence
Cover it with semen
I am done
I am done with it
Don't
Sing me that song
It
Will only prolong
This
Instrumental
And I knew I was close to you
And I will
Catch me flying in the sun
Catch me drinking of your wine
I'm gonna put something in you
Make the devil feel surprised
All your sisters wanna fly
Around my golden sky
Around my golden sky
Just because you feel, hollow inside it's real
Just because you feel, hollow inside it's real
I'm gonna put something in you
Make the devil feel surprised
Make the devil feel surprised
And I knew I was close to you
And I knew
Catch me flying in the sun
Catch me drinking of your wine
Look deep INTO the April face
A change is clearly taking place
Looking for the summer
The eyes take on a certain gaze
And leave behind the springtime days
Go looking for the summer
This ain't no game of kiss and tell
The implications how you KNEW so well
Go looking for the summer
The time has come and they must go
To play the passion out that haunts you so
Looking for the summer
Remember love how it was the same
We scratched and hurt each OTHER'S growing pains
We were looking for the summer
And still I stand this very day
With a burning wish to fly away
I'm still looking, looking for the summer
I love the way
You say my name
It sounds different everyday
I used to think
That I'd seen you walk away 
Too many times
Now I know 
You're here to stay
Now it's you and me who walk away
I love the way
You say my name
It sounds different everyday
When you're not home
I always liked being alone
But not anymore
Instrumental
Don't cry, my love, don't cry no more
A crashing sky, a roaring screen
A city drowning, God's black tears
I cannot bear to see
She lay under the midnight moon
Her restless body stirring
Until the magic morning hour
Like poison it succumbs her
Her baby skin, her old black dress
Her hair it twists 'round her necklace
Constricts and chokes like ruthless vines
'Til sleep, she overtakes her
Her room is painted heron blue
Lit by candlelight and chandelier
And from her headboard, perched so high
A million dreams have passed her
Don't cry, my love, don't cry no more
It overwhelms my breaking heart
A minor swell of violins
I cannot bear to hear them
A mother shepherds her young birds
She fills their mouths and warms their souls
'Til they are strong and good to fly
Away from her, alone she'll die
Cradle on quiet old oak limbs
As heaven blue her light fails
A breath of soot into her lungs
A life, a journey's end in one
Don't sing that old sad hymn no more
It resonates inside my soul
It haunts me in my waking dream
I cannot bear to hear it
Don't play those violins no more
Their melancholic overtones
They echo off the floor and walls
I cannot bear to hear them
Will you go ahead to the Aventine
In the holly red in the night
Dirt under my shoe from the old at heart
Right under you, grinning in the dark
You carried my heart in the night
To bury the wave in the tide
You carried me onto the fields
There is a grove, there is a plot
Deep in the snow, breaking your heart
One step ahead, a thousand miles
A trail ablaze to the Aventine
You carried my heart in the night
To marry the wave with the tide
You carried me onto the fields
You carried my heart in the night
To bury the wave in the tide
You carried me onto the fields
Play it down, play it down
I remember it was that Wednesday
Oh when it rained and it rained
They traipsed mud all over the house
It took hours and hours to scrub it out
All over the hall carpet
I took my mop and bucket
And I cleaned and I cleaned
The kitchen floor
Until it sparkled
Then I took my laundry basket
Put all the linen in it
And everything I could fit in it
All our dirty clothes that hadn't gone into the wash
And all your shirts and jeans and things
And put them in the new
Washing machine
Washing machine
Washing machine
I watched them go 'round and 'round
My blouse wrapping itself around your trousers
Ooh and the waves are going out
My skirt floating up around my waist
As I wade out into the surf
Oh and the waves are coming in
Oh and the waves are going out
Oh and you're standing right behind me
Little fish swim between my legs
Oh and the waves are coming in
Oh and the waves are going out
Oh and the waves are coming in
Out of the corner of my eye
I think I see you standing outside
But it's just your shirt
Hanging on the washing line
Waving its arm as the wind blows by
And it looks so alive
Nice and white
Just like it's climbed right out of my
Washing machine
Washing machine
Washing machine
Slooshy sloshy slooshy sloshy
Get that dirty shirty clean
Slooshy sloshy slooshy sloshy
Make those cuffs and collars gleam
Everything clean and shiny
Washing machine
Washing machine
Washing machine
Mean Mr. Mustard says he's bored
Of life in The District.
Can't afford the French Quarter high.
Says it gets old real quick.
And he pales up next to me
Scrawled on the pavement.
It says:
Son, time is all the luck you need.
And if I stay lucky then my tongue will stay tied
And I won't betray the things that I hide.
There's not enough years underneath this belt
For me to admit the way that I felt.
Mean Mr. Mustard says don't be
The wave that crashes
From a sea of discontent.
He says he's wrestled with that blanket.
It leaves you cold and wet
Any way you stretch it.
Divine apathy! Disease of my youth
Watch that you don't catch it.
And if I stay Lucky then my tongue will stay tied
And I won't betray the things that I hide.
There's not enough years underneath this belt
For me to admit the way that I felt.
And I'm the wave that crashes
From a sea that turns itself
Inside out every chance I get to
See what it's like in hell.
And if I stay Lucky then my tongue will stay tied
And I won't betray the things that I hide.
There's not enough years underneath this belt
For me to admit the way that I felt.
And if I stay Lucky then my tongue will stay tied
And I won't betray the things that I hide.
There's not enough years underneath this belt
For me to admit the way that I felt.
Open the window
Let the sunset in
If only for the last time
Let me see you smile again
I'll take my records
You can have your books
I'm sorry I never read them
But it says so much about us
Always trying
To make love out of care
The perfect recipe
But something wasn't there
And I wish you Sunrays and Saturdays
Perfect starry nights
Sweet dreams and moonbeams
And a love that's warm and bright
Sunrays and Saturdays
Friendship strong and true
Oceans of blue and a room with a view
To live the life you choose
You'll write me letters
I'll call you on the phone
A wire away from touching
And never quite alone
We'll get to know ourselves again
And we'll heal our hearts
It's not that we're bad together
We're just better off apart
Always trying
To have one and one make two
And even though it never worked
I still feel love for you
Paperclips, melody
Hold together all these memories
Memories, memories
I don't wanna think at all
I don't wanna be like you anymore
I don't wanna see your face at my door
And I'll never leave like you, that's for sure
I don't wanna be like you anymore, anymore, anymore
Take a trip, down memory lane
You will never wanna go again
Take your leave, take your leave
I don't wanna sing at all
I don't wanna be like you anymore
I don't wanna see your face at my door
And I'll never leave like you, that's for sure
I don't wanna be like you anymore, anymore, anymore
Ever talk, decide out
We get by, we'll get by
And I won't take this
No more sadness, no, no
Paperclips, memories
Hold together all these melodies
Melodies, melodies
I don't wanna sing at all
I don't wanna be like you anymore
I don't wanna see your face at my door
And I'll never leave like you, that's for sure
I don't wanna live like you anymore, anymore, anymore
This day is getting older in fading light, it's beautiful
This wind is blowing colder and too soon I feel its pull
Still I took all my chances, earned myself an even score, tried to learn my lessons well
And I don't have the answers for those questions anymore,
Only love can be both heaven and hell
So sturdy up sturdy up your heart for the road is long ahead
I'll be with you even though we're apart
But your road is yours to tread
And so it goes and so it goes and so it goes
Slows your mind mind mind
So it goes and so it goes and so it goes slows your mind mind mind mind mind
I've grown old on this ocean, gave her all my stronger years
Gave my wife my devotion, when she died the ocean my tears
I've tried to teach you well son all of everything I knew of how to live
This life be true, don't bow your head to no one and no matter what you do
If you start then see it through
So sturdy up sturdy up your heart for the road is long ahead
I'll be with you even though we're apart
But your road is yours to tread
And so it goes and so it goes and so it goes
Slows your mind mind mind
So it goes and so it goes and so it goes slows your mind mind mind mind mind
She haunts the roads
She waits for a new
Face
Her arms red and injured
She wants to rest, she can't till we have
Face
I've cut your armies down
And torn your heart
You wait
I wait
Outside, awake
I've cut your armies down
And torn your heart
You wait
I wait
Outside, awake
I wait
She haunts the roads
She waits for a new
Face
Face
Uh oh, uh oh, down low, down low
I am not who I want to be
I probably will not ever be
I drove my car on June 14th
I drove it right on down the street
I had not had any sleep
So I ate Minithins to stay awake
You crashed your car right into me
There's two days, I had to leave
Uh oh, uh oh, down low, down low
I am not who I want to be
I probably will not ever be
I took a trip down to
California
Karma payment plan
Karma payment plan
Karma payment plan
Karma payment plan
My car broke down on the street
The radiator sprung a leak
I met this guy he said that
He could help me
I'm on the karma payment plan
I'm on the karma payment plan
We went to his house and did some speed
He said karma would pay for this deed
He got it fixed and he
Started to scare me
I ditched him eventually
And came back for the van the next morning
I'm on the karma payment plan
I'm on the karma payment plan
I went to L.A. the next day
I got jacked in a really bad way
I cannot tell you but
It's a long story
The sun is setting
And you're right here by my side
And the movie is playing
But we won't be watching tonight
Every look (every look)
Every touch (every touch)
Makes me want to give you my heart (ooh)
I'll be crashing on you, baby
Stay right where you are, cause
I never knew, I never knew
You could hold moonlight in your hands
Till the night I held you
You are my moonlight, ohooh
Moonlight
I kiss his finger tips
As a wish and he's all mine
He's giving me Elvis
With some James Dean in his eyes
Put's his lips on my neck
Makes me want to give him my body
I'll be falling for you, baby
And I just can't stop, cause
I never knew, I never knew
You could hold moonlight in your hands
Till the night I held you
You are my moonlight, ohooh
Moonlight
Baby, I'll be falling
You're my moonlight, ohooh
Moonlight
He's so bossy
He makes me dance
Tryna sit in the back of his whip
And just cancel my plans
Sweet like candy
But he's such a man
He knows just what it does
When he's holdin' me tight
And he calls me moonlight too
It hangs above my altar
Like they hung Him from a cross
I keep one in my wallet
For the times I feel lost
In a wooden frame with splinters
Where my family kneels to pray
And if you listen close
You'll hear the words He used to say
I've got a picture of Jesus
In His arms so many prayers rest
We've got a picture of Jesus
And with Him we shall be forever blessed
Now it has been spoken
He would come again
But would we recognize
This king among men
There was a man in our time 
His words shine bright like the sun
He tried to lift the masses
And was crucified by gun
He was a picture of Jesus
With Him so many prayers rest
He is a picture of Jesus
In His arms so many prayers rest
With Him we shall be forever blessed
Somedays have no beginning
Some days have no end
Some roads are straight and narrow
And some roads only bend
So let us say a prayer 
For every living thing
Walking towards a light
From the cross of a King
We long to be a picture of Jesus 
In His arms so many prayers rest
I long to be a picture of Jesus
With Him we shall be forever blessed.
Living on a diet of Chocolates and Cigarettes
I wanna call you again
Ill drink tea sometimes when its cold
This is getting old
I call you again
Still too young to fail, too scared to sail away
But one of these days Ill grow old
And Ill grow brave and I'll go
One of these days
Blowing out the candles from my cake
I choke on the smoke as I look around the room
Everybodys wishing for no more mistakes
And all that I can think about is you
Still too young to fail, to scared to sail away
But one of these days Ill grow old
And Ill grow brave and I'll go
One of these days
La da la da la da
Still too young to fail, to scared to sail away
But one of these days Ill grow old
And Ill grow brave and I'll go
One of these days
La da la da la da
(Winter coming
Winter for sure, For sure
Oh, winter for sure
Winter - the snow, winter moves on)
The last night on Maudlin Street
Goodbye house - goodbye stairs
I was born here, I was raised here and
I took some stick here
Love at first sight may sound trite
But it's true, you know
I could list the details
Of everything you ever wore
Or said, or how you stood that day
As we spend the last night on Maudlin Street
"Goodbye house, forever!"
I never stole a happy hour around here
Where the world's ugliest boy
He became what you see
Here I am - the ugliest man
Oh the last night on Maudlin Street
Truly I do love you
Oh, truly I do love you
When I sleep with that picture of
You framed beside my bed
Oh, it's childish and it's silly
But I think it's you in my room
By the bed (...yes, I told you it was silly...)
And I know I took strange pills
But I never meant to hurt you
Oh, truly I love you
Came home late one night
Everyone had gone to bed
But you know, no one stays up for you
I had sixteen stitches all around my head
The last bus I missed to Maudlin Street
So, he drove me home in the van
Complaining: "Women only like me for my mind.."
Don't leave your torch behind, a power-cut ahead 1972, you know
And so we crept through the park
No, I cannot steal a pair of jeans off a clothesline for you
But you without clothes
Oh I could not keep a straight face
Me - without clothes?
Well, a nation turns its back and gags...
And I'm packed
I am moving house
A half-life disappears today
With every hag waves me on
Secretly wishing me gone
Well, I will be soon
Oh - I will be soon, I will be soon...
There were bad times on Maudlin Street
They took you away in a police car
Dear Inspector - don't you know?
Don't you care? Don't you know about Love?
Your gran died and your mother died
On Maudlin Street
In pain and ashamed
With never time to say
Those special things
I took the keys from Maudlin Street
Well, it's only bricks and mortar!
Oh... truly I love you
Wherever you are
Wherever you are
Wherever you are
I hope you're singing now
Oh I do, I hope you're singing now
You and me created something special
You and me always standing at the threshold
Forgive me, I've created a monster
The police said that they cannot help your daughter
Sometimes it takes a tough/strong man to hide
Sing it soft just like a lullaby
I'll fall apart from the inside and die
Kept my faith from the day that you left
With a big old hallelujah carved into my chest
You smothered me in images of death
Don't play around now, take my life instead
I don't doubt that everything is what you gave me
But I've gotta be frank, and baby
It just wasn't enough
How my thoughts they spin me 'round
And how my thoughts they let me down
And how my thoughts they spin me 'round
And how my thoughts they let me down
How my dreams they spin me 'round
And how my dreams they let me down
And how my thoughts they spin me 'round
And how my thoughts they let me down
And then there's you
Then there's you
And then there's you
Then there's you
How my love it spins me 'round
And how my love it's let me down
And how my thoughts they spin me 'round
And how my thoughts they let me down
And then there's you
Then there's you
And then there's you
Then there's you
You know I know who that you love
I've written it on myself, if you can't tell
With a melody that climbs and then falls, then falls, then falls
Without you, without you
How my days they spin me 'round
And how today it sets me down
And how my days they spin me 'round
And how today it sets me down
Alongside you
Alongside you
Alongside you
We started out so brand new darling
But now it seems that nothing can change your mind
I have seen your city lights
But have you seen my country skies
Watch the world go twirling by
And perhaps it's common fears
Or uncommon hearts
That makes us insincere
And torn apart
But when will I learn
Love is just my fantasy disguised
An angel without wings can hardly fly
And love without a dream it will not survive
But now I can see
I am lucky just to have a heart
Discovery will knock you on your knees
And lonely tears can only hope to freeze
Yeah, they'll freeze and fall on down
And so our sun is sinking low
And your spirit's close behind
But there's something you should know now
That you're on my mind
But where are you now
When will you share your winter nights
In another town
Don't let me forget
In another town
Mouth full of regrets
In another town
Please, please place final bets
In another town
I'll know...
In another town
My fingers so cold
In another town
My soul feels so old
In another town
I've sold all my gold
In another town
I'll know...
I love you...
In another town
They've given me the key
In another town
I'm drinking for free
In another town
A girl just like me
In another town
I'll know...
In another town
The night fills my room
In another town
They're painting my wound
In another town
I won't see it soon
In another town
I'll know...
I love you...
Oh Florida please be still tonight
Don't disturb this love of mine 
Look how she's so serene
You've gotta help me out
And count the stars to form the lines
And find the words we'll sing in time
I want to keep her dreaming
It's my one wish, I won't forget this
I'm outdated, overrated
Morning seems so far away
So I'll sing a melody
And hope to God she's listening
Sleeping softly while I sing
And I'll be your memories
Your lullaby for all the times
Hoping that my voice could get it right
If luck is on my side tonight
My clumsy tongue will make it right
And wrists that touch
It isn't much, but it's enough
To form imaginary lines
Forget your scars, we'll forget mine
The hours change so fast
Oh God, please make this last
I'm outdated, overrated
Morning seems so far away
So I'll sing a melody
And hope to God she's listening
Sleeping softly while I sing
And I'll be your memories
Your lullaby for all the times
Hoping that my voice could get it right
Could get it right
You could crush me
Please don't crush me
'Cause baby I'm a dreamer for sure
And I won't let you down
I swear this time I mean it
And I'll sing a melody
And hope to God she's listening
Sleeping softly while I sing
And I'll be your memories
Your lullaby for all the times
Hoping that my voice could get it right
Until now, I knew this of myself
That if you had thrown yourself down
Into the lion's den
My brother I'd follow you in
Perhaps I lack some foresight (should have known)
Brother you were so right
Sure as the setting sun
Can't trust just anyone
That's what you want, but it's not what you're asking for
I said that's what you're asking, but you're gonna get more than you bargained for
I said that's what you had, but you don't have it any more
You had it coming
I never imagined you dead (I never)
But tell me, are you even aware
That all that we did, you undo
Iscariot, you fool
That's what you want, but it's not what you're asking for
I said that's what you're asking, but you're gonna get more than you bargained for
I said that's what you had, but you don't have it any more
You had it coming
Oh you know you had it coming my friend, my friend
You know you had it coming my brother, oh my brother
Had it coming my friend, my friend
You know you had it coming my brother, oh my brother
Had it coming my friend, my friend
You know you had it coming my brother, oh my brother
Had it coming my friend, my friend
You had it coming.
This was the centre of the world for me once
Where I saw "I love you" all over the place
And that was where the Stones played once
And these are the bricks that shattered my heart
This is the place where I felt
Like the world's tallest self-supporting tower
At least for a little while anyway
Hiding out in the subway system
Hanging out in the library system
You made me feel like a harbour
And you made me feel like a fortress
This is the place where I felt
Like the world's tallest self-supporting tower
Or maybe number two
At least for a little while anyway
Concrete heart
Concrete heart
Concrete heart
Concrete heart
Instrumental
I took a river and it wouldn't let go
I want you to stay and I want you to go
I took a river and the river was long and it goes on
I want to be there tonight
I want to get there but it's just out of sight
I took a river and felt so slight so hold on
So hold on
Hold on
It goes on
I took a river and the river was long
I want you to stay course I want you to go
I took a river and the river was long and goes on
It goes on
Ooh it goes on
It goes on
I live in turn
It's alright
I'm not gonna wait for you tonight
Live from the stage
I'm sure
I'm not gonna wait for you anymore
I live in new wave
It's alright
I'm walking away from you tonight
Live form the stage
I'm sure
I'm not gonna look at you anymore, the same way
Instrumental
Drive on, drive on
My special one
Don't you stop till you know you're gone
Your sister and me have a set of keys
Don't you worry your head 'bout a thing
Drive on, drive on
My special one
Don't you stop till you know you're gone
Drive on, drive on
My special one
Don't you stop till you know you're gone
Your sister and me will keep your place clean
So it shines when you finally come home
Drive on, drive on
My special one
Don't you stop till you know you're gone
Down by the seashore
The waves are bigger than normal
I asked you if I could flicker out
You say, don't think so
I just want you to believe
Even though I know it's impossible for me
There goes another day
Don't suppose I'll come out to play with you
I'll just sit at home
Write another song about how I wanted to
Down by the seashore
I'll say it's the spray
I'm not crying
Such a little thing, anyway
There goes another day
Don't suppose I'll come out to play with you
I'll just sit at home
Write another song about how I wanted to
All I wanted was for you to believe
All I wanted was for you to believe
All I wanted was for you to believe in me
All I wanted was
There goes another day
Don't suppose I'll come out to play with you
I'll just sit at home
Write another song about how I wanted to
There goes another day
Don't suppose I'll come out to play with you
I'll just sit at home
Write another song about how I wanted to
There goes another day
Don't suppose I'll come out to play with you
I'll just sit at home
Write another song about how I wanted to
There goes another day
Don't suppose I'll come out to play with you
I'll just sit at home
Write another song about how I wanted to
There goes another day
Don't suppose I'll come out to play with you
I'll just sit at home
Write another song about how I wanted to
Cross over and turn
Feel the spot, don't let it burn
We all want, we all yearn
Be soft, don't be stern
Lullaby
Was not supposed to make you cry
I sang the words I meant
I sang
Come dry me out
'Cause I've been drinking all night
Before I pass out I need your ghost to tell me this bloodless voice
Is as meaningless as it sounds
Hard fought for some spare time
To sit around and search for something I ain't never gonna find
Colors fade in the night sky
Lightning bugs are flashing on the front porch
No it's in my head
To take me back to another time
Cause once its gone it's just something you ain't never gonna find
No matter how hard you try
There's no reason to stop it
And you couldn't if you wanted now
Come dry me out
Just not with your fist
I'm not looking for a fight
Hard fought for some spare time
To search through books and records
For something you ain't never gonna find
If you could just make up your mind
Train tracks
Can't decide
Tennessee morning leaves you paralyzed
Instrumental
And the women tug their hair
Like they're trying to prove it won't fall out
And all the men are gargoyles
Dipped long in Irish stout
The whole place is pickled
The people are pickles for sure
And no-one knows if they've done more here
Than they ever would do in a jar
This could be Rotterdam or anywhere
Liverpool or Rome
'Cause Rotterdam is anywhere
Anywhere alone
Anywhere alone
And everyone is blonde
And everyone is beautiful
And when blondes and beautiful are multiple
They become so dull and dutiful
And when faced with dull and dutiful
They fire red warning flares
Battle-Khaki personality
With red underwear
This could be Rotterdam or anywhere
Liverpool or Rome
'Cause Rotterdam is anywhere
Anywhere alone
Anywhere alone
The whole place is pickled
The people are pickles for sure
And no-one knows if they've done more here
Than they ever would do in a jar
This could be Rotterdam or anywhere
Liverpool or Rome
'Cause Rotterdam is anywhere
Anywhere alone
This could be Rotterdam or anywhere
Liverpool or Rome
'Cause Rotterdam is anywhere
Anywhere alone
I just about managed to forget you when you appear in a dream
And you're even more beautiful there than I remember you being
So I've come to decide that fate is telling me you will not go
And considering this I want you to know
If the world ends, I hope you're here with me
I think we could laugh just enough to not die in pain
If the world ends, it won't finish you
You're not the type they can capture, you flit like a fly catcher
They can't pin you down, can't pin you down
In my dream you're playing with buckets of sand
And water was running through both of your hands
And I don't think I ever heard you speaking
'Cause I was too wrapped up in the dream I was dreaming
So if the world ends, I hope you're by my side
I don't think with you here it will be too much pain
And when you cry, darling, I wish you'd feel my love
Your heart is way beyond capture, flitting like a fly catcher
They can't pin you down, whoa, they can't pin you down, whoa
Can't pin you down
Can't pin you down
Can't pin you down
Before you ask me again
You better think it over
Is this what you wanted in life
I'm the last one
I know you think that you know me
'Cause it's been a long time
I don't ask any questions
When you tell me that I'm the last one
I'm the one to forget
The one you won't regret
I'm the one to forget
The one you won't regret
So let me, let me go
'Cause you don't
And you'll never know
If you can't tell the real from the imaginary
It will seem surprising when I disappear
Like the last one
I'm the one to forget
The one you won't regret
I'm the one to forget
The one you won't regret
So let me, let me go
'Cause you don't
And you'll never know
So let me, let me go
'Cause you don't
And you'll never know
Pretty bird, pretty bird
Why you so still?
Pretty bird, pretty bird
We've been waiting on you
You go west for the black setting sun
You go south to the white spirit world
You go east for those real green eyes
You go north walk the good red road
Pretty bird
There's a mirror in heaven
Pretty bird, pretty bird
There's a window on earth
You go west for the black setting sun
You go south to the white spirit world
You go east for those real green eyes
You go north, walk the good red road
Pretty bird
Some pity me, yeah
Oh, pity me, yeah
Stars pity me
For the blood of the pretty
The blood of the pretty
The blood of the pretty bird
Pretty bird, pretty bird
Who's starving you still?
You go west for the black setting sun
You go south to the white spirit world
You go east for those real green eyes
You go north, walk the good red road
Pretty bird
Never been so inside
When I give in to you
Never been so existent
You can't know unless you feel it
Come back
Body's aching
From the want and the waiting
I get this pain when you're leaving
Never felt this before
Never felt this before
Is it written on my back?
Take it back and then let it go
Let it go
Is it written on my back?
Take it back and then let it go
Every day is the day that you save me
Light into darkness
Cut on the sharpness of you
Never been so inside
And fallen into you
Never been so resisting
You can't fall unless you feel it
Come back
Body's aching
From the want and the waiting
Coming down with a sickness
Staying in control
Steady and in control
Is it written on my back?
Take it back and then let it go
Let it go
Is it written on my back?
Take it back and then let it go
Every day is the day that you save me
Light into darkness
Cut on the sharpness of you
I want to love you, baby
Come back
Body's aching
From the want and the waiting
I get this pain when you're leaving
Never felt this before
Never felt this before
Is it written on my back?
Take it back and then let it go
Let it go
Is it written on my back?
Take it back and then let it go
Let it go
Instrumental
The moon has blocked the sun
That I haven't seen for days
It walks the street as the chimneys burn
I'll drink some beer as to find my way
My way home, my way home
My way home, my way home
The streets were made for horse and cart
They talk to mine behind close doors
Stood in the rain to feel the part
This maze I stand of concrete walls
My way home, my way home
My way home, my way home
Suspicious corpse without a face
The screen light's a hidden dim
This black hawk can't find its place
Through the night we swim
My way home, my way home
My way home, my way home
"It ain't my fault
It's 6' o' clock in the morning"
He said
As he came up out of the night
When he found I had no coins to bum
He began to testify
Born in a depression
Born out of good luck
Born into misery
In the back of a truck...
I'm telling you this mister
Don't be put off by looks
I been in the ring and I took those right hooks
Oh the loneliness
Used to knock me out - harder than the rest
And I've worked for breakfast
'N' I ain't had no lunch
I been on delivery and received every punch
Suddenly I noticed that it weren't quite the same
Feel different one morning
Maybe it was the rain
But everywhere I looked all over the city
They're runnin' in an out of the bars
Someone stopped for a pick-up driving one of those cars
Y'see I always wanted one of those cars
Long black 'n' shiny an' pull up to the bars
Honk your horn, put down your windows, push yer button
Hear it coming in
You can say I can see the light ... roll!
Forward! Drive! Green lights! Green lights!
Intersection city coming
A running comeback home
I run back not that strong now
Yes who's there now, can I help you?
Calling Intel station light
Did you put it in
It say go, I say go, she say go
So we say go
'Cause I can see the light all night tonight
This night right now
Coming on forward motion across the ocean
An' up the hills yeah boys let's strike for the hills
While that petrol tank is full
Gimme a push gimme a pull
Gimme a llama gimme a mule
Gimme a donkey or gimme a horse
Down the avenue
So fine
In style
Since I met you. this house has started to decay
And every wall that once was clean. has turned a shade of grey.
So much to rescue. so much you just can't understand
Now the streets are dark and empty. and the problems in our hands.
I can't leave you. see back home my house is falling down.
I can't leave you. and back home my house is falling down
Since I met you. my basement has started to bleed
The floors are all collapsing. still I'm begging to be free
Slow dancing tight,
My barren heart and I.
Your name used to taste so sweet
Then you beat the love right out of me.
It's a mystery how people behave!
How we long for a life as a slave
When he kissed me I gladly gave in
To a fight nobody could win
Man, he left me blue
And if I could I would do it too
I tell you now like I told you before
Love is a powerful force
And it's a mystery how people behave!
How we long for a life as a slave
And tumble into any open arms
That will only ever do you harm
Oh, you, you, it's always you
The best kisser that I ever knew
True love is cruel love
Not much to be proud of
Nerve-wrecking, acrobatic backwards bend
All for a happy end
It's a mystery how people behave!
How we worry ourselves to the grave
When he kissed me I lost everything
Then I got up and did it again
Oh you, you, it's always you, 
The hardest hitter that I ever knew
True love is cruel love
Not much to be proud of
Ass-kissing, mercy-missing, faithless friend
All for a happy end
Dad, your boy is about to fall.
He walks the razor's edge.
He's on the brink of fading out.
He's at his bitter end.
Dad, your boy he used to run, you taught him how to crawl.
He left home to find his own, now all he had is gone.
In your eyes I see a darkness that torments you
And in your head where it dwells.
I'd give you my hand if you'd reach out and grab it,
Lets walk away from this hell.
Mom, your baby's on his way.
He'll soon be at your side.
'Cause he's forgotten all he's known.
A part of him has died.
Mom may never understand why baby's come and gone.
He left home to find his own, now all he has are lies.
In your eyes.
In your eyes.
In your eyes.
In your eyes.
Instrumental
Open hearts, empty spaces, dusty roads to distant places
But all the time when I'm alone I think of you and how you've grown
Far and wide, sweet and simple Jehovah knows that I've been sinful
But if Jesus comes to take your hand I won't let go, I won't let go
I'm not cruel and you're not evil and we're not like all those stupid people
Who can't decide which book to read unless the paper sows the seed
You're the kind of person that I've always wanted to be with
Well, you're really cool and you always say the right things to me
Now I'll tell you something for my heart beats for you deep inside
You'll never be a burden and my love for you will never die
Never die, never die, never die
If Jesus comes to take your hand I won't let go, I won't let go
If Jesus comes to take your hand I won't let go, I won't let go
Good times around the corner, good times around the corner
Good times around the corner, I swear it's getting warmer
Good times around the corner, good times around the corner
Good times around the corner
I'm gonna live till I die, I'm gonna live to get high
Cut it down go put it away
Take an inside look on the outside
Another day
Take time look at the sunshine
Have mine it's better on you anyway
Nobody's perfect all the time
But I know you
And you know me
And it's all right
I'm waking up gonna buy me some shoes
Take a long walk out of the hindsight start anew
Look around maybe buy a new topcoat
Stop moping the rain's gonna rain through
Rain through on you
Yes it's true that
Nobody's sunny all the time
But I know you and you know me
And it's all right
And it's your life
And it's my life
It's our life in the city
Get a new place out in the hills
Plant a seed I'm in need of a break from the fire drill
Repaint where all the paint ain't
Get a clean slate and maybe we can buy a thrill
I'll foot that bill
Yes I will 'cause
Nobody's busy all the time
But I know you
And you know me
And it's all right
Instrumental
I got a get a date,
Fall the gather, forward...
I got a get a date,
Fall to the date.
I got a get a date,
Fall the gather, forward...
I got a get a date,
Fall to the date...
Loneliness, don't come around here
I've boarded up all the doors
There's nothing to give no more
I recall, a time when I knew it all
Wish someone done me wrong 
So I can then do no wrong
But if you try to keep moving on
And it seems like it's always so hard
And if you left me
Darling I know I'll be found
And if you need me
Don't you let me know
It's alright...
Maybe I, had too little love to realise
All that I tried to give 
Could never, ever be enough
But if you try to keep moving on
And it seems like it's always so hard
But if you left me
Darling I know I'll be found
And if you left me
And if you try
Oh and if you try
Oh and if you try, try
Oh and if you try, try
Oh and if you try, try
Oh and if you try...
We're at the tip-top, yeah, we're not getting any better than this
I'm out of lines, girl, we're not getting any smoother than this
But could you blame me if I... if I... if I...
Took you all for prisoner with just one line, one lie
Because I'll be the preacher to all his converts,
"Donate now to my rightful cause."
But what good is a quick healing to go?
If the lesson is never learned it's just like stitches for show
They say the Carolina heat
Isn't something that keeping a cool head can beat
But don't discount their winter winds
And all the cold shoulders that the slightest draft lets in
And with empty stomachs and hungry eyes
Our only choice was to swallow pride
But I guess, I guess you just ate much better than the rest
We're at the ground floor
But our numbers they only get higher from here
It's not the failure, but the cost of success
Is the thing I can't help but fear
This isn't righteous, it's a mid-life crisis
I'm not compelled, you just convinced me to write this
It's for the greater good, 'cause I'd rather be great than good
They say the Carolina heat
Isn't something that keeping a cool head can beat
But don't discount their winter winds
And all the cold shoulders that the slightest draft lets in
And with empty stomachs and hungry eyes
Our only choice was to swallow pride
But I guess, I guess you just ate much better than the rest
(We're at the ground floor.)
Your skin was appealing wallpaper
Now your skin is just peeling wallpaper
Your skin was appealing wallpaper
Your skin was appealing wallpaper
Now your skin is just peeling wallpaper
Your skin was appealing wallpaper
Now your skin is just peeling, your skin is just peeling
They say the Carolina heat
Isn't something that keeping a cool head can beat
But don't discount their winter winds
And all the cold shoulders that the slightest draft lets in
And with empty stomachs and hungry eyes
Our only choice was to swallow pride
But I guess, I guess you just ain't better than the rest
Instrumental
I fell asleep in the chair by the fireplace
And I woke up in the kitchen sink
With an umbrella full of holes overtop my head and
I fell asleep on the table with your picture in hand
And I woke up in the cupboard
With some scrapes on my arms and a mouthful of hell
Chains are rattling in the attic again
And the birds are building nests in the windowsill
Dust has settled over everything
And the ceiling fan still cuts a lazy circle
I got a picture on the mantle piece
Of the way that I thought that we'd end up
But this shares no resemblance to that
Yeah, that shares no resemblance to that at all
I tore the dreams from my head and tossed them in the flames
And the smoke smelled like my past
And it stung my eyes, but I was too stubborn to blink and
I slept inside the piano till the rain was gone
And I woke up when I saw the sun
And wiped the sleep from my eyes
Yeah, I knew my time had come
We're all still a part of everything that we were
And we'll all float along with everything
And in turn, we'll all fall apart with everything
But we'll learn just what things are like outside our heads
And I hear them singing
And I hear my name
And I feel you scrub my skin
And I was happy to fade
Jennifer dates a man in a sixties cover band
He's the Ess-Dog, Sean if you wish
She's eighteen, he's thirty-one
She's a rich girl, he's a son of a Coca-Cola middle man
Kiss when they listen to "Brothers in Arms"
And if there's something wrong with this
They don't see the harm
In joining their forces and singing along
See those rings on her toes?
Check that frisbee and his Volvo
It's a Volvo with ancient plates
They've got a dog she named Trey
A retriever with a frayed bandana 'round his neck
Trey has a window into their relationship
The baby-talk voices and the post class A nasal trip
But it all seems to function
At least in the dog's mind
Let me out of here
Let me out of here
You got to let me out of here
You got to let me out of here
Let me out of here, out of here, out of here, out of here
Let me out of here
Running
Running
Running
Running
Jennifer left for school up in Boulder
And that Ess-Dog came to visit when he could
But the strain was too much
They could not make up for distance
And the distance between their years
Neither one listens to "Brothers in Arms"
And the Ess-Dog waits tables and he sold his guitar
Jenny pledged Kappa and she started Pre-Law
And off came those awful toe rings
Off came those awful toe rings
Sing your life
Any fool can think up words that rhyme
Many others do
Why don't you?
Do you want to?
Sing your life
Walk right up to the microphone
And name
All the things you love
All the things that you loathe
Oh sing your life
The things that you love
And the things you loathe
Oh sing your life
Oh sing your life
La la la la
Sing your life
Others sang your life
But now's your chance to shine
And have the pleasure of saying what you mean
Have the pleasure of meaning what you sing
Oh make no mistake my friend
All of this will end
So sing it now
All the things you love
All the things you loathe
Oh sing your life
The things that you love
And the things you loathe
Oh sing your
Oh sing your
La la la la
Sing your life
Don't leave it all unsaid
Somewhere in the wasteland of your head
And make no mistake, my friend
Your pointless life will end
But before you go
Can you look at the truth?
You have a lovely singing voice
A lovely singing voice
And all of those
Who sing on key
They stole the notion
From you and me
So sing your life
Sing your life
Everything You are
Is everything we have
You're the only good thing
A sun came
Burned our faces round
Burned our faces red
You are still the rage, a rock
From the enemy
There is still a house, a cage
For the enemy
When my friends turned out, I found out
There is still a Lord
But I never felt so lonely
A sun came
Candlelight and all things bright come into our room 
Candlelight and all things bright come into our room 
Now now the winter glows 
See the leaves beneath the trees come into our room 
See the leaves beneath the trees come into our room 
Now now the winter glows 
Now now the winter glows 
It's wonderful, no it's wonderful with you 
Snug as bugs inside your love come into our room 
Snug as bugs inside your love come into our room 
Now now the winter glows 
Now now the winter glows 
Now now the winter glows
It's wonderful, no it's wonderful with you 
Fingerbobs has wolfed the lot come into our room 
Fingerbobs has wolfed the lot come into our room 
Now now the winter glows 
Now now the winter glows 
Now now the winter glows
It's wonderful, no it's wonderful with you 
Come into your room 
Come into your room 
Come into your room 
Come into your room 
Come into your room 
Come into your room
I feel the skin that separates us, start to fade
And when I lie on top of you, I'm afraid
I can see right through myself, crystal clear
I am disassembling
I could disappear, disappear
There is a voice inside of me, I don't know
And all his words keep echoing tremolo
I've been waiting for a sign to appear
He has a message waiting for me
But I don't wanna hear
I promise, I swear
I can keep it together
I can keep it together
I can keep it together
I can keep it together
I ca...
I can keep it together
I can keep it together
I can keep it together
I can keep it together
I can keep it together
I can keep it together
I can keep it together
I can keep it together
I can keep it together
I can keep it together
I can keep it together
I can keep it together
I can keep it together
I can keep it together
The word 'Hurricane' is the name given to nature's strongest storm.
A hurricane occurs when high pressure and low pressure masses of air
Come in contact with one another.
There is often a significant difference in temperature
Between the two masses.
One mass is warm, while the other is cold.
The warmer air rises, and the cooler air falls.
Likewise, the low pressure area slides down the sides
Of the high pressure area.
They swirl in and around one another, creating the beginnings of the storm.
We're too busy 
We're just too busy 
Always making predictions 
Never make an exception 
To the rules 
Why do we fight? 
All through the night? 
Why do we fight at all? 
Oh Oh Oh Oh 
Let's just turn the whole damn thing upside down 
Do you recognize the one you knew before 
The closing of the doors? 
Don't you remind me of someone? 
Don't you remind me? 
I knew you better 
Don't you remind me? 
Much better than that 
I never loved you blindly 
I new a man who was better 
Much better than that 
Once you've said it 
Oh Oh Oh Oh 
You can't take it back 
Oh Oh Oh Oh 
I knew you'd find that note someday 
SO I wrote down 
All the things that I couldn't say 
You and I 
Up all night 
Why do we fight at all? 
The closing of the doors 
The calling of time 
Don't you remind me of someone
Don't you remind me
Instrumental
From the housetops to the gutters
From the ocean to the shore
The warning signs have all been bright and garish
Far too great in number to ignore
From the cities to the swamplands
From the highways to the hills
Our love has never had a leg to stand on
From the aspirins to the cross-tops to the Elavils
But I will walk
Down to the end with you
If you will come
All the way down with me
From the entrance to the exit
Is longer than it looks from where we stand
I want to say I'm sorry for stuff I haven't done yet
Things will shortly get completely out of hand
I can feel it in the rotten air tonight
In the tips of my fingers, in the skin on my face
In the weak last gasp of the evening's dying light
In the way those eyes I've always loved illuminate this place
Like a trashcan fire in a prison cell
Like the searchlights in the parking lots of hell
I will walk down to the end with you
If you will come all the way down with me
Instrumental
Ooh
It's a cold night, beneath the street light, there's a man whose pants are too tight
Oh no, his pants are too tight
My pants are too tight
He stands there, an empty stare, trying to make enough money for his cab fare home
He'll have to walk home tonight
Don't have enough for the ride
The streets are cruel, he tries to act cool, he goes to work with only his one tool
You can put away your tool, Jemaine
You don't have to be, a prostitute
No no no no no
You can say no, to being a man hoe
A male gigolo
You don't have to be, a prostitute
No no no no no
You can say no to being a night looker, boy hooker, rent boy, bro, hoe
He can't see his way out
I can not see my way out
He can't see his way out
Male prostitution seems to be my only option
He can't see his way out
I can not see my way out
He can't see his way out
No, no, no, no, no
He sends cheap thrills, to pay expensive bills
But check your résumé, you must have some other skills
Do you have any other skills?
Like typing?
They see him, want him to please them, want him to play them, but they don't even pay him
Oh no, they don't think he's worth it at all
Don't think I know when, he tries to bring them home, maybe that would be a way if he lived alone
Oh, you have a roommate Jemaine, don't bring them home
You don't have to be, a prostitute
No no no no no
You can say no, to being a man hoe
A male gigolo
You don't have to be, a prostitute
No no no no no
You can say no to being a night looker, boy hooker, rent boy, bro, hoe
All I see scares me
No one waits...
You will never waste my time
No
You will never waste my time
Well she looks at the doors and turns
Says we will always be safe here in this bed
All I see scares me
And no one waits forever
So come closer baby
I want to see what you're made of, see what you're made of
Cause this isn't all we could be
You're not the same, and I'm, I'm not the same and...
No one could ever wait for you
And no one, yeah, no one could ever wait for you
I'll wait for you love
But you are the never ending sleep that I love to treat
With this medicine I get from my, my closer friends
But all I see...
So come closer baby
I want to see what you're made of, see what you're made of
Cause this isn't all we could be
You're not the same, and I'm, I'm not the same and...
Instrumental
Left behind everything I knew
All the colors were bone light and sky new
Hit the continent running
Engines were humming just to break through
Antarctica, my only living relative
Antarctica, I can't wait anymore
Under ice there's a world moving slow
Carnelian stars and the bars down below
Serve only vodka and gin
I try to stay drunk so nobody knows
Antarctica, my only living relative
Antarctica, I can't wait anymore
And then there's morning
Each one feels like the first one
A morning, so clean so pure
Nothing so clear now that I'm here
When I get back to the city
Everything's cluttered and pretty
I won't regret my return
I'll just remember the wind, and the snow
And the howling so loud that it alone drowns out the inside of me
Antarctica, my only living relative
Antarctica, I can't wait anymore
I think I'm going back to California
Somewhere distant and it's all far away
It's so far, it's so far far away
I think I'll drift across the ocean now
Clouds look so clear in your eyes
Let me dream all my, let me dream all my friends
I think I'll fly across the ocean
I can watch the sky turning grey
I think I'm going back, I think I'll go back
I think I hear the whisper of my own best friend
I think I hear the bells ringing in the square
California, California
Your name here 
Believe me 
It's not what you think 
Wish what you want 
It's all the same to me 
Well not really, but anyway 
It's just it's nothing so simple 
Nothing so silly 
Nothing so mundane 
Go east on Sunrise Highway 
Turn left at Carmen's Avenue 
Go right at the first stop-light 
And I'll be outside, waiting for you 
I'll Be waiting for you 
Your name in lights 
It was only a matter of time 
Your name in parenthesis 
Cause after this mess 
I guess you bet 
That I'd collapse before you do 
Well maybe that's true 
Or maybe it's not at all 
Go east on Sunrise Highway 
Turn left at Carmen's Avenue 
Go right at the first stop-light 
And I'll be outside, waiting for you 
I'll be waiting for you 
Go east on Sunrise Highway 
Turn left at Carmen's Avenue 
Go right at the first stop-light 
And I'll be outside, waiting for you
Seen all good things and bad
Running down the hill
All so battered and brought to the ground
I am hungry again
I am drunk again
All the money I owe to my friends
When I'm like this
How can you be smiling, singing
How can you be sure?
How can you be sure?
If you walk out the door
Will I see you again?
If so much of me lies in your eyes
I am hungry again
I am drunk again 
All the money I owe to my friends
When I'm like this
How can you be smiling, singing
How can you be sure I don't want you?
How can you be sure I don't want you?
How can you be sure I don't want you?
How can you be sure I don't want you?
I don't want you, I don't want you anymore
I don't want you, I don't want you anymore
The lameness of an unborn child
The tidiness of cry
The only way I'm leaving here
Is curling up and die
The way our shelter moves above
Controlled by just my hand
Insures the death you're dreaming of
The drowning down of man
O love, O love, O careless love
I only want to lay with you
My love, my love, my careful love
I've found the hard way love is true
And always love the smiling one
And rounding out will come
With bitter bile and heartless fun
And consciousness made numb
And fearful hate that's steming out
From fear and only fear
Has made your inner croco shout
And bring his victims here
O love, O love, O careless love
I only want to lay with you
My love, my love, my careful love
I've found the hard way love is true
A creature born in listlessness
His hatred to become
It's here his love is swollen in
And consciousness made numb
And relegate your youth and trust
Your table and your skin
And share the love the godly must
And hold it till the end
O love, O love, O careless love
I only want to lay with you
My love, my love, my careful love
I've found the hard way love is true
I only want to lay with you
My love, my love, my careful love
I've found the hard way love is true
I carry it, your body,
From the freeway.
I cried as if my tears
Would bring you back to me.
The sirens followed close behind,
But they were too late,
Deserved to drown
The last words.
Then you whispered;
Suddenly is soon, sooner than you think.
Suddenly is soon, sooner than you think.
Suddenly is soon...
...Sooner than you think.
Outside, under, a road.
Backwards, into, the ground.
Miss you.
Down, down.
Miss you.
Down, down.
Suddenly is soon, sooner than you think.
Suddenly is soon, sooner than you think.
These flowers are coming up wild
They're coming up, they're coming up
They're coming up wild
These flowers are coming up wild
They're coming up, they're coming up
They're coming up wild
They are like those children
Go off to school and don't come back
And I am like their mother
Waiting around about to crack
Crack
Crack
I want them back
Crack
Crack
I want them back
Back
Back
Back
You are like a flower
You rise and rise to the sun
You do not look back at where you came from
I wanna be like that
That
That
That
And the boys they run faster
And they throw harder
And they get stronger
And they are gone, they are gone, they are gone
I wanna be like that
That
That
That
And the girls they are pretty
And they get silly
When they get giddy
And they are gone, they are gone, they are gone
I wanna be like that
That
I'm on my knees in the corner
Wiping my floor, wiping my floor, yeah
And they are gone, they are gone, they are gone
I wanna be like that
That

These flowers are coming up wild
They're coming up, they're coming up
They're coming up wild
I go dancing by myself
I go dancing with no one else
Solo dancing, watch me as I go
I go dancing, it's so intense
I will dance till the bitter end
No point in asking 'cause I always dance alone
Hypnotised by the law of motion
Music stops and the spell broken
I go dancing by myself
I go dancing with no one else
Solo dancing, watch me as I go
(Watch me as I go go go)
I go dancing, it's so intense
I will dance till the bitter end
No point in asking 'cause I always dance alone
Don't hold back, my dance devotion
It's the path that I have chosen
Hypnotised by the law of motion
Music stops and the spell broken
(Broken, broken, broken...)
Move... How I move
Move... Don't hold back, my dance devotion
How I move, how I move, how I move
I go dancing by myself
I go dancing with no one else
Solo dancing, watch me as I go (go go go...)
I go dancing it's so intense
I will dance till the bitter end
No point in asking 'cause I always dance alone
Don't hold back, my dance devotion
It's the path that I have chosen
Hypnotised by the law of motion
Music stops and the spell broken
Poor boy
Head against a pillow
Fast asleep
Poor girl
Head against a window
Lost in a dream
One day they will be as giants
Stronger than the sun
But that day ain't yet come
Wide world
Wide world of sorrow
Won't stand a chance
Wide world
Wide world of sorrow
Won't stand a chance
One day they will be as giants
Stronger than the sun
But that day ain't yet come
Julie Christie, the rumors are true
As the pages turn, my eyes are glued
To the movie star and his sordid life
Mr. Ex and his old-suffering wife
I spent so much time dreaming about Eleanor Bron
In my room with the curtains drawn
See her in the arms of Paul
Say it, I can say no more
As the music swells somehow stronger from adversity
Our hero finds his inner peace
So now I'm looking for a lucky charm
With a needle hanging out of its arm
As time goes by I know it's gonna happen
I know it's going away
Gonna take its toll, gonna take its toll
Gonna take my time
And I'm thinking about the way things are
And I'm thinking about the way things were
Thinking about Eleanor Bron
And I'm thinking about a lucky charm
And I'm thinking about the needle
Oh, I'm thinking about the needle
And I'm thinking about...
Instrumental
Trouble, more trouble can you get anymore
Slow bubble boiling on the bedroom floor
Lonely ain't lonely, someone calling at the door
Someone lovely and she's bringing bad news
She clenches and she cries and she lays on the stairs
Pounding on the earth and yanking at her hairs
And showing such fear at being found unawares
To be here and be bringing bad news
Well, something bad happens and a lot of people go
Bad themselves, that's how awful it is
Turning half the heart into something hard and dark
And she had to bring here this
Well, she's told, "Hold your buttons and look at the sky
Someone will fix things if you let your face dry
Keep your face near the earth and your heart beat high
And you may transcend the bad news"
Well, something bad happens and a lot of people go
Bad themselves, that's how awful it is
Turning half the heart into something hard and dark
And she had to bring here this
For all hammers and nails
For all leaves and winds
For all love ambitions
And enemies and friends
She shakes her face so fiercely that all her features go
She lays like a monkey unclothed in the snow
And her voice it decays and before it does she goes
"I will never again deliver bad news"
Something bad happens and a lot of people go
Bad themselves, that's how awful it is
Turning half the heart into something hard and dark
And she had to bring here this
Mm, hey little bird - hey little bird
Thank you for not letting go of me when I let go of you
Hey little bird - hey little bird
Thank you for not letting go of me when I let go of you
(Hey little bird - hey little bird)
Thank you for not (letting go of me when I let go of you)
I fell in love and I needed a road map
To find out where you lived, so excited now
Sleepwalking
'Cause I'm sleepwalking
The white trash boys listen to their headphones
Blasting white noise in the convenience store parking lot
I hung around there wasting my time
Hoping you'll stop by
'Cause I'm sleepwalking
I'm sleepwalking
A mutual friend's parents left town for a week
So we raided their liquor stash and walked down to the riverside
Sleepwalking
'Cause I'm sleepwalking
Heaven
Is the whole of the heart
And heaven don't tear you apart
Yeah heaven
Is the whole of the heart
And heaven don't tear you apart
There's too many kings
Wanna hold you down
And a world at the window
Gone underground
There's a hole in the sky
Where the sun don't shine
And a clock on the wall
And it counts my time
And heaven
Is the whole of the heart
And heaven don't tear you apart
Yeah heaven is the whole of the heart
And heaven don't tear you apart
There's a song on the air
With a love-you line
And a face in a glass
And it looks like mine
And I'm standing on ice when I say
That I don't hear planes
And I scream at the fools
Wanna jump my train
And heaven is the whole of the heart
And heaven don't tear you apart
Yeah heaven is the whole of the heart
And heaven don't tear you apart
Yeah heaven
Ah heaven
Yeah heaven
In history, your bluest grace
Falls apart, cascading down
Speak to me of beautiful hate
Of island chains swept with the tide
Tragedy ripening on
The coral leis of a conquering king
They're swept away
Oh, but not lost
Swept away
Oh, but not lost
Beneath the waves of trembling stars
The roads wind towards windward side
My soul is saved, I see city lights
My face is framed by the blanket of night
Swept away
Oh, but not lost
Swept away
Oh, but not lost
Swept away
Oh, but not lost
Swept away
Oh, but not lost
Not lost, not lost
Not lost
Was I too proud to sat or to wish for
Words that I knew were forbidden?
'Cause I don't want to know, I didn't want to see
What I saw when I looked in the distance
In the distance
Swept away
Oh, but not lost
Swept away
Oh, but not lost
Swept away
Oh, but not lost
Swept away
Oh, but not lost
Just another grey autumn day
You're the sunshine trying to break through
No I never imagined that my path would lead to you
A look in your eyes as they met mine
Seem to say we're the same
In so many ways
Though we're worlds apart
I will promise you
I won't let you down
No I won't let you down
There are so many reasons to keep us apart
But it won't stop me losing
My mind or my heart
What would I give
To touch your hand
Oh just feel your skin
I'd breathe you in
Could this ever be
You'll be next to me
No I won't let you down
No I won't let you down
I know myself so well
But I've never been here before
You're just out of my reach
But I will be here
Of that you can be sure
Can be sure
It's another grey autumn day
You're the sunshine trying to break through
I can only imagine that I'm walking with you
I realise if you were mine
We may fall apart
Oh you'd have my heart
There's too many things between you and me
No I won't let you down
No I won't let you down
No I won't I won't let you down
No I won't let you down
No I won't I won't let you down
No I won't I won't let you down
No I won't I won't let you down
No I won't let you down
I found your photograph in a cardboard box in a magazine
I can't remember you, remember us or anything
I taught you how to feel, but you just feel numb
They taught you how to feel, but you just feel numb
She comes apart in the avalanche
Fades out like a dance
Crawls back into bed
When it's over
When it's over
When it's over
And it's over
I watch the window and listen for the sound of cars
I can't remember the last time that it was yours
I taught you how to feel, why do you feel numb
They taught us how to feel, but we just feel numb
She falls apart in the avalanche
Fades out like a dance
Crawls back into bed
When it's over
When it's over
When it's over
When it's over
She falls apart in the avalanche
Fades out like a dance
Crawls back into bed
When it's over
And it's over
When it's over
Peel off the color 
Of the night
A second skin
A floating spit is hovering
The other side is opening now
I don't think that I can hold it
Tear off the color 
Of that night
A second skin
A floating spit is hovering
The other side is opening now
I don't think that I can hold it
Sweetheart
How I miss your heart
Beating next to mine
The right words
Were always hard to find
When all our time was fine
When darling you were mine, all mine
And I know
I know you had no choice
But I how I miss your voice
Singing right with mine
Flesh of my flesh
Soul of my soul
Come back home
All this darkness cannot hurt us
'Cause they made you from the light
Here on birthplace, don't be nervous
You will make it through this night
Sweetheart
How I miss your heart
Beating next to mine
Flesh of my flesh
Soul of my soul
Come back home
If the sky is burning
When the clouds move in
We come so close
When we just miss
We can't see the start
We can't hide the end
Find our way to fall
Find our way to fall
Find our way to fall
Find our way to fall
I can't see between
I can't find the need
We come so close
When we just miss
Find our way to fall
Find our way to fall
Find our ways to, find our way
Find our way to fall
We can't see the start
We can't hide the end
When the sky is burning
If the clouds move in
Find our way to fall
Find our way to fall
Find our ways to, find our way
Find our way to fall
And here we are
Locked together
And here we are
Falling from the sun
And here we are
Locked together
Find our ways to, find our way
Find our way to fall
Find our ways to, find our way
Find our way to fall
Find our ways to, find our way
Find our way to fall
Find our ways to, find our way
Find our way to fall
Oh I still remember when you
Could that have been back in the sweet summer of 1993
It was a sweet summer's night on Hammer Hill
Oh the sound of distant carnival drums
The Spanish guitar someone strums
It was a sweet summer's night on Hammer Hill
My heart goes like
Bum bu bum bu bum bu bum bu bum bu bum bu bum
Can you hear the beat of my heart?
Bum bu bum bu bum bu bum bu bum bu bum bu bum
Can you hear the beat of my heart?
Oh, the memories come a-streamin',
When I'm walkin' round here dreamin'
It's a sweet summer's night on Hammer Hill
Oh, the memories come a-streamin',
When I'm walkin' round here dreamin'
It's a sweet summer's night on Hammer Hill
My heart goes like
Bum bu bum bu bum bu bum bu bum bu bum bu bum
Can you hear the beat of my heart?
Bum bu bum bu bum bu bum bu bum bu bum bu bum
Can you hear the beat of my heart?
Oh no (Oh no!)
Oh no (Oh no!)
Oh no (Oh no no no no no!)
Oh no (Oh no!)
Oh no (Oh no!)
Oh no (Oh no no no no no!)
Oh no (Oh no!)
Oh no (Oh no!)
Oh no (Oh no no no no no!)
Oh no no no no,
It's come back to me
Oh no no no no,
It's come back to me
It's a sweet summer's night on Hammer Hill
My heart goes like
Bum bu bum bu bum bu bum bu bum bu bum bu bum
Can you hear the beat of my heart?
Bum bu bum bu bum bu bum bu bum bu bum bu bum
Can you hear the beat of my heart?
Candle is blue, could see me through
I'm colorblind
You tell me it's blue, I'm a believer
That's why I'm blind
Live on the freeway, listen to signs
And we drive by fields
Be a believer, believe everything
You'll be right half the time
Candle is waxing, takes my apartment
Now bask in its magic
All of the firefighters put out my fires
Took all my matches
Staying up later, waking up old
And I'm leaving her never
Ordering in all friends and lovers
And we're making our weather with a lone lifeboat
I'm tired of fighting, so I'll demolish
That's the way
Some make exhaustion a mode of expression
And that's the way
I'm just a question, knowing my answer
Hope I'm wrong
I know the answer, it's four in the morning
I'm right again, I'm Chinatown
Now in a hurry, running up urgent
To get home to doc
Was my miss mistress, messed up my mattress
I missed the catch
Last of the pictures, catfish done hunting
Hairy lung
Most of the killers never get famous
And it's hard on everyone
I'm tired of fighting
I'm tired of fighting
I'm tired of fighting
I'm tired of fighting
I'm tired of fighting so I'll demolish
That's the way
Some make exhaustion a mode of expression
And that's the way
I'm just a question, knowing my answer
Hope I'm wrong
I know the answer, it's four in the morning
I'm right again, I'm Chinatown
Lady future's arms are lily white
They stretch before you come inside
There's room enough, she's generous
Come on, come up, while we're still young
You want to love your life from a prison?
Of all this uninvited altruism
The homemade weapons you're fashioning
Are hellbent on doing us both in
You never mean what you say
Why don't you say what you mean?
I never get anywhere
I get the space in between
Beautifully mutilated
Instantly antiquated
I will admit I almost always underestimate it
You better mean what you say
Why don't you say what you mean?
I never get anywhere
I get the space in between
Beautifully mutilated
Instantly antiquated
I will admit I almost always underestimate it
Let's begin at the beginning
Let us revisit the past
Like when the houselights are dimming
Like silver screen photograph
It makes a beautiful sound
When nobody else is around
It has a wonderful way
Of eating up entire days
We'll go swimming in libations
Forgive unexplained lacerations
The otherworldly manifestations
I could live in the breath you're wasting
You never mean what you say
Why don't you say what you mean?
I never get anywhere
I get the space in between
Beautifully mutilated
Instantly antiquated
I will admit I almost always underestimate it
You never mean what you say
Why don't you say what you mean?
I never get anywhere
I get the space in between
Beautifully mutilated
Instantly antiquated
I will admit I almost always underestimate it
You better mean what you say
Why don't you say what you mean?
I never get anywhere
I get the space in between here
We go over again beautifully mutilated
Instantly antiquated let's wash our hands
Of everything
I will admit I almost always underestimate it
You don't owe them anything
No, you don't owe them anything
No, you don't owe them anything
You never mean what you say
Why don't you say what you mean?
I never get anywhere
I get the space in between
Beautifully mutilated
Instantly antiquated
I will admit I almost always underestimate it
You never mean what you say
Why don't you say what you mean?
I never get anywhere
I get the space in between
Beautifully mutilated
Instantly antiquated
I will admit I almost always underestimate it
I know a girl laying down 
She's sleeping 
Weeks at a time 
And when she wakes up 
She watches TV 
Counting cracks in the ceiling 
No, I don't know what she's thinking 
So I give up, waiting for someone waiting 
Talking to someone, staring 
I never come around
I never come around 
I left her fifteen years behind
Girl's laying down 
Never come around 
So much for girl staying 
In afraid of 
Beeing needed 
And seen she watches 
The world on a screen 
She's distant 
And God knows I tried to leave her 
But she's got a constant fever 
I let it slip my mind 
I never come around
I never come around 
I left her fifteen years behind 
I know a girl laying down 
No, I never wasted my time 
We have something in common 
She's as different as I am
You could go anywhere anytime and find someone
But how will you know if he's kind
The sun is out but happiness
Only reminds you of the people you hurt
Mistakes that you made when you were down
And where are you now?
You're sweeping up these sorry streets
And I knew somehow when you looked up and over me
That you could look up these words
But you still won't understand
They mean nothing to you
So write them in the sand
And watch the water wash them away
But you could sit on your front porch
And watch the moths dive down
You could go out every night
And force cheap beer down
You could go all day
And not make a sound
The orange was the size of a watermelon to me
Well, at least that is my memory
Sunshine made my bare feet burn upon the road
Far away we'd roam
I'd be howlin' out a song in the back seat
The boys would laugh and tease about my black feet
They'd tell stories that would warm my soul
Motorbikes and chrome
Jimmy could not wait to get home
Homebird sing
Fly me high on an angel's wing
Homebird sing
Leave out nothing, tell me everything
Everywhere we went just looked the same to me
The skies were blue and the grass was green
I wonder how different I might see them now
Yet I see them somehow
Through the fallen memories when that angel baby signs
Oh, the little magic that his solo brings
Making up songs and words and singin' from the soul
Oh, the stories told
None but him and Jimmy could know
Homebird sing
Fly me high on an angel's wing
Homebird sing
Leave out nothing, tell me everything
Homebird sing
Fly me high on an angel's wing
Homebird sing
Leave out nothing tell me everything
I used to take your breath away
I used to make you laugh about anything
I used to be your getaway
Your getaway, your dream, I was everything you needed
You used to lean your eyes on me
You used to open up and share your world
You used to lose yourself in me
Let the hours pass all running by so fast but now
What I'm doing?
I don't know what I'm doing
'Cause I don't even feel it
Bodies growing colder with the distance now
And I don't even mean it
Got my hands all over you but not a sound
I'm always so in love, all in
Till I start going numb thinking
Thought you'd make me feel it
Thought that I'd be different this time around
This time around
We started out as lonely hearts
We started with a promise built on highs
You said I was the missing part
Looked into my eyes, said, you're my fix for life but now
What I'm doing?
I don't know what I'm doing
'Cause I don't even feel it
Bodies growing colder with the distance now
And I don't even mean it
Got my hands all over you but not a sound
I'm always so in love, all in
Till I start going numb thinking
Thought you'd make me feel it
Thought that I'd be different this time around
This time around
Don't know what I'm doing this time around
This time around
Don't know what I'm doing this time around
This time around
Ooh
'Cause I don't even feel it
Bodies growing colder with the distance now
And I don't even mean it
Got my hands all over you but not a sound
I'm always so in love, all in
Till I start going numb thinking
Thought you'd make me feel it
Thought that I'd be different this time around
This time around
Don't know what I'm doing this time around
This time around
Don't know what I'm doing this time around
This time around
Welcome to the lonesome world of Abel
Where every brother's knife is set to slay you
And paranoia keeps you healthy
Crooked deals can keep you wealthy
Serum vials to help you when you're sad
Every other face is bent and broken
Wrap your teeth around the only game in town
Made you clothes from insulation
Break your day for pay and ration
Hide
Hide
Hide...
Killed by an angel
Lost inside amazing colors
It's never how you feel
It comes in a bottle
Let's say you found a gun;
How would your bad side burn?
It's never how you feel
It comes in a bottle
Relax and all these whores will lick the membrane
Just a touch, a stain, a hole in your brain
It's cold when you remove the nails
Beg for more when all else fails
Serum vials to help you when you're sad
Killed by an angel
Lost inside amazing colors
It's never how you feel
It comes in a bottle
Let's say you found a gun;
How would your bad side burn?
It's never how you feel
It comes in a bottle
The way the sea reflects the sun
Long gone
And all the miracles of love
Long gone
You hold your heart out in your hand
One last long sigh gone
One last long sigh gone...
When you see the sores you can't believe them 
Pathogenic lovers in a basement cell
Dirty white sheets cut up in strips
Cracks in the mirror and your mind slips
Serum vials to help you when you're sad
Killed by an angel
Lost inside amazing colors
It's never how you feel
It comes in a bottle
Let's say you found a gun;
How would your bad side burn?
It's never how you feel
It comes in a bottle
Killed by an angel
Killed by an angel...
Well let me tell you a story
About a girl and a boy
He fell in love with his best friend
When she's around, he feels nothing but joy
But she was already broken, and it made her blind
But she could never believe that love would ever treat her right
Did you know that I loved you or were you not aware?
You're the smile on my face
And I ain't going nowhere
I'm here to make you happy, I'm here to see you smile
I've been wanting to tell you this for a long while
Who's gonna make you fall in love
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
You're not gon' be scared at all, oh my love
But you can't fly unless you let yourself,
You can't fly unless you let yourself fall
Well I can tell you're afraid of what this might do
'Cause we got such an amazing friendship and that you don't wanna lose
Well I don't wanna lose it either
I don't think I can stay sitting around while you're hurting babe
So take my hand
Well did you know you're an angel who forgot how to fly?
Did you know that it breaks my heart every time to see you cry
'Cause I know that it pains if he's gone every time he move over on the shoulder you crying
And I hope by the time that I'm done with this song that I figure out
Who's gonna make you fall in love
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
You're not gon' be scared at all, oh my love
But you can't fly unless you let yourself,
You can't fly unless you let yourself fall
I will catch you if you fall
I will catch you if you fall
I will catch you if you fall
But if you spread your wings
You can fly away with me
But you can't fly unless you let your...
You can't fly unless you let yourself fall
Who's gonna make you fall in love
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
You're not gon' be scared at all, oh my love
But you can't fly unless you let yourself,
You can't fly unless you let yourself fall,
So fall in love
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
You're not gon' be scared at all, oh my love
But you can't fly unless you let yourself,
You can't fly unless you let yourself fall
I will catch you if you fall
I will catch you if you fall
I will catch you if you fall
If you spread your wings
You can fly away with me
But you can't fly unless you let your... let yourself fall
Where the river cross, crosses the lake
Where the words jump off my pen and into your pages
Do you think, just like that, you can divide this
You as yours, me as mine, to before we were us
If the rain has to separate from itself
Does it say, "Pick out your cloud"?
Pick out your cloud
Voice 1:
I'm going to stay right here
I'm going to stay with this
I'm going to stay right here
I'm going to stay with this
I'm going to stay right here
Voice 2:
If there is a horizontal line
That runs from the map off your body
Straight through the land
Shooting up right through my heart
Will this horizontal line
When asked know how to find
Where you end, where I begin
"Pick out your cloud"
How light can play and form a ring
(I found, I found, I found a thrill)
Of rain that can change bows into arrows
(I found, I found, I found a thrill)
Who we were isn't lost before we were us
Indigo is his own, Blue always knew this
If the rain has to separate from itself
Does it say, "Pick out your cloud"?
Pick out your cloud
Voice 1:
I'm going to stay right here
I'm going to stay with this
I'm going to stay right here
I'm going to stay with this
I'm going to stay right here
Voice 2:
If there is a horizontal line
That runs from the map off your body
Straight through the land
Shooting up right through my heart
Will this horizontal line
When asked know how to find
Where you end, where I begin
"Pick out your cloud"
If the rain has to separate from itself
Does it say, "Pick out your cloud"?
Oh, love is so good
When you're treated like you should be
The sky goes on forever in a symphony of song
And how the water can flow like it's streaming out of fountains
And all you gotta do is find a sword and a stone
And how it takes all the night
Like birds of paradise
Like way down in Pollyanna where the race runs wild
Oh, but if you're gonna leave
Better call the undertaker
Take me under, undertaker
Take me home
Oh, just place me in a box
And fasten all the locks
And with a one-two throw me over the bayside bridge
'Cause love is so good
When it's treated like it should be
The sea goes on forever in a symphony of song
Oh, but if you're gonna leave
Better call the undertaker,
Take me under, undertaker
Take me home
Yeah, if you're gonna leave,
Better call the undertaker,
Take me under, undertaker
Take me home
Now, I see winter's dawn
The wind turns traitor cold
Seems long since summer time
And the stories that were told
We spoke of dreams that came to us
When we were young
But as the morning rose
We spoke with forked tongues
My love is a fleeting one
My man could be anyone
And our love is a setting sun
As we took those evening walks
Down through the graveyard
Those names engraved always
Put a new shade to my thoughts
But he and I, we both knew
The bread that we break
Would never take their place
What's cold, you mustn't await
My life is a fleeting one
My work is just a web I've spun
Oh, my life is a setting sun
I don't know where I'm going
But no one is coming with me
I won't give up chasing love, son
Here I go, look at me run
Here I go
Look at me run
Here I go
Look at me run
My love is a fleeting one
My man could be anyone
And our love is a setting sun
My life is a fleeting one
My work is just a web I've spun
Oh, my life is a setting sun
Baffled by the lies we blamed
We met the end too soon
I was honest when I told you
We're as cryptic as the moon
There is a growing golden light
A flower unfolding behind the mirror of your eyes
If an angel could hold it in his polished white hand
I know he'd release it like a bird to the sky
Now you are the warrior who will conquer this land
On a horse made of clouds, you will scatter the sands
Some people say God is long dead
But I heard something inside you with my head to your chest
Oh within all the wrong
They say I have done
There lies a seed
Of a million more just waiting to become
Send them home
Send them home
Send them home
Use your sword, use your voice
And destroy and destroy
Then begin again
Autumn falling from trees
The snow is up to our knees
I let you borrow my keys
To sleep in my room
You threw away my shoe
I brought you to central park zoo
Then I drew your eyes very blue
And I stuck them on the fridge
And I believe it was you
Who I wanted to be walking next to
And I believe we were friends
And I believe we will be again
So you sighed and swept your broom
Under the wintery moon
Well I called up this afternoon
Your words were "Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye"
And I believe it was you
Who I wanted to be talking to
And I believe we were friends
And I believe we will be again
Oh, if I knock on your door would you let me in?
Do you know any more than I do?
Keep on wonderin' about you
Even if you don't want me to
The girl you once knew
Is the person we are
And I believe it was you
Who I wanted to be walking next to
And I believe we were friends
And I believe we will be again
We figure out the past through photographs
They took while we were young
Even though there's no way out, we'll find one
We're the love-struck ones
The degrees of separation close in
Look who just walked in
A finger on the pulse is not enough
To show who's wrong from right
You know it's gonna be a long drive
Not an easy ride
The degrees of separation close in
Look who just walked in
Leave the lights on
If you're the last one alive
There's too many strangers on this long
Lonely drive
I'll be by your side
Believe me
Now, no-one knows the year
You're from the past
You look like you're alive
You know it's gonna be a long drive
Not an easy ride
The degrees of separation close in
Look who just walked in
I kept the photograph upon the dash
It helped me realise
That it didn't have to be a long drive
But an easy ride
The degrees of separation close in
We're alone again
Leave the lights on
If you're the last one alive
Let's say sunshine for everyone
But as far as I can remember
We've been migratory animals
Living under changing weather
Someday we will foresee obstacles
Through the blizzard, through the blizzard
Today we will sell our uniform
Live together, live together
(Blizzard, blizzard, blizzard, blizzard)
(Blizzard, blizzard, blizzard, blizzard)
(Blizzard, blizzard, blizzard, blizzard)
(Blizzard, blizzard, blizzard, blizzard)
(Blizzard, blizzard, blizzard, blizzard)
(Blizzard, blizzard, blizzard, blizzard)
(Blizzard, blizzard, blizzard, blizzard)
(Blizzard, blizzard, blizzard, blizzard)
We played hide and seek in waterfalls
We were younger, we were younger
(Blizzard, blizzard, blizzard, blizzard)
We played hide and seek in waterfalls
We were younger, we were younger
(Blizzard, blizzard, blizzard, blizzard)
We played hide and seek in waterfalls
We were younger, we were younger
(Blizzard, blizzard, blizzard, blizzard)
We played hide and seek in waterfalls
We were younger, we were younger
(Blizzard, blizzard, blizzard, blizzard)
Someday we will foresee obstacles
Through the blizzard, through the blizzard
Crawling down
From high hopes to the ground
While trouble sings along
Baby my heart and soul
A giant in the room
I left him long ago, following you
Wind heavy on the ground
A cloak before the moon
I guess I've never known
Someone like you
Falling down
From high hopes to the ground
There's no way out
Baby my heart and soul
A giant in the room
We took the walk alone
And now we are through
Wind heavy on the ground
A cloak before the moon
I guess I've never known
Someone like you
Nature will get her way
Though you took her for a fool
Walking on the lake
Frozen under you
Baby my heart and soul
There's nothing we couldn't do
Summer's blowing cold
And now we are through
I'm alright here in your arms, darling
I'm alright here in your arms, darling
I'm alright only in your arms, darling
I'm alright here in your arms, darling
Sing me to sleep
Sing me to sleep
I'm tired and I
Want to go to bed
Sing me to sleep
Sing me to sleep
And then leave me alone
Don't try to wake me in the morning
'Cause I will be gone
Don't feel bad for me
I want you to know
Deep in the cell of my heart
I will feel so glad to go
Sing me to sleep
Sing me to sleep
I don't want to wake up
On my own anymore
Sing to me (Sing to me)
Sing to me
I don't want to wake up
On my own anymore
Don't feel bad for me
I want you to know
Deep in the cell of my heart
I really want to go
Sing me to sleep
Sing me to sleep
There is another world
There is a better world
Well, there must be
There must be
There is another world
There is a better world
I stand at your gate,
And the song that I sing is of moonlight.
I stand, and I wait
For the touch of your hand in the June night.
The roses are sighing
A moonlight serenade.
The stars are aglow,
And tonight, how their light sets me dreaming.
My love, do you know
That your eyes are like stars brightly beaming?
I bring you, and I sing you
A moonlight serenade.
Let us stay till break of day
In love's valley of dreams.
Just you and I, a summer sky,
A heavenly breeze, kiss in the trees.
So don't let me wait-
Come to me tenderly in the June night.
I stand at your gate
And I sing you a song in the moonlight.
A love song, my darling-
A moonlight serenade.
I know that you say I get mean when I'm drinking,
But then again sometimes I get really sweet
So what does it mean if I tell you to go fuck yourself
Or if I say that you're beautiful to me
It's affection always,
You're gonna see it someday
My attention for you
Even if it's not what you need
Sometimes we talk all night long, we don't shut up
& when it's late we'll say we're still wide awake so...
We love to talk about how you'll come up to visit me
& we'll rent a car & we'll drive upstate
It's affection always,
You're gonna see it someday
My attention's on you
Even if it's not what you need
I think of you,
I want you too,
I'd fall for you
It's affection always...

Six o'clock in the morning wipe the sleep from my eyes (yeah).
Felt just like an ordinary day. Just around the corner such a surprise,
A beautiful angel materialised. Time stood still, face to face. I'm
Sure we'd met in another time and place (met in another time and place)
Our eyes met as you passed me by (passed me by).
Two souls intwined in the blink of an eye (yeah). And I had to figure
Out what I'd be missing.
So I turned to you and asked you if you wanted to.

I said I'm sorry to change my mind
It was a little bit cold that night
Was dreading the ride back to Little Italy
And needing to hide out from my mind
When you walk, you move like Moses
When you look, you look like red roses
Every day breaks, bitter river was a flood
Why do you leave me in between Siamese cities?
I saw the sky in you
What did you see in me?
This Rubbermaid's had better days
Shake it out, static anonymity
Vanity, dull roar die down
When you take, you turn me over
From the street, rock radio plays Crimson and Clover (over and over)
Every day breaks, bitter river was a flood
Why do you leave me in between Siamese cities?
When you walk, you move like Moses
When you look, you look like red roses
Every day breaks, bitter river was a flood
Why do you leave me? 
Why'd you leave me?
Why'd you leave me in between Siamese cities?
Sha la la la, sha la la la
Sha la la la, temporarily
She is shaking out static anonymity
She is shaking out static anonymity
She is shaken (temporarily)
Shaken (temporarily)
(Uh uh)
She is shaking out static anonymity
She is shaking out static anonymity
Anonymity (sha la la la)
Anonymity (sha la la la)
(Uh uh)
Anonymity (sha la la la)
Anonymity (sha la la la)
She is shaking out static anonymity (sha la la la, sha la la la) 
She is shaking out static anonymity (sha la la la, temporarily)
(Uh uh)
Anonymity (sha la la la)
Anonymity (sha la la la)
Anonymity (sha la la la)
Two jumps in a week
I bet you think that's pretty clever, don't you, boy?
Flying on your motorcycle
Watching all the ground beneath you drop
You'd kill yourself for recognition
Kill yourself to never ever stop
You broke another mirror
You're turning into something you are not
Don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry
Don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry
Drying up in conversation
You will be the one who cannot talk
All your insides fall to pieces
You just sit there wishing you could still make love
They're the ones who'll hate you
When you think you've got the world all sussed out
They're the ones who'll spit at you
You will be the one screaming out
Don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry
Don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry
It's the best thing that you ever had
The best thing that you ever, ever had
It's the best thing that you ever had
The best thing you have had has gone away
Don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry
Don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry
Don't leave me high
Don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry
So you're proud to be a good one
But the good ones always complain
About the stuff they never did
Don't make a think about the bad kind
'Cause the bad kind don't even know
All the hearts they're messing with
You can point fingers all you want
I don't care
I love you anyway 
You can point fingers all you want
I don't care
I love you anyway
Yeah I've fallen in love and I hope that you want me
The way that I am
Fallen in love and I know I can't change me
Do you understand?
Fallen in love and I hope that you want me
The way that I am
Fallen in love and I know I can't change me
Do you understand?
I've been told I am the problem
And the problem's my honesty
When it's worse than how it seems
And I tell you all the wrong things
All the things you don't wanna hear
'Cause they change your perfect dream
You can point fingers all you want
I don't care
I love you anyway 
You can point fingers all you want
I don't care
I love you anyway
Yeah I've fallen in love and I hope that you want me
The way that I am
Fallen in love and I know I can't change me
Do you understand?
Fallen in love and I hope that you want me
The way that I am
Fallen in love and I know I can't change me
Do you understand?
Fallen in love and I hope that you want me
The way that I am
Fallen in love and I know I can't change me
Do you understand?
Fortune presents gifts
Not according to the book
Fortune presents gifts
Not according to the book
When you expect whistles it's flutes
When you expect flutes it's whistles
What various paths are followed
In distributing honours and possessions
She gives awards to some
And penitent's cloaks to others
When you expect whistles it's flutes
When you expect flutes it's whistles
Sometimes she robs the chief goatherd
Of his cottage and goat pen
And to whomever she fancies
The lamest goat has born two kids
When you expect whistles it's flutes
When you expect flutes it's whistles
Because in a village a poor lad
Has stolen one egg
He swings in the sun
And another gets away with a thousand crimes
When you expect whistles it's flutes
When you expect flutes it's whistles
Water may stop warmth, this do not forget
When things become too warm make them a little wet
And douse them with a mouthful, put the baby down
Clean the earth surrounding and cause the warm to drown
And introduce to every soul a drink made of tears
Hear them bicker, watch them die impaled on balsa spears
And looking in the morning the streets are flooded out
The men are wailing toothless, the ladies ghostly pout
And they shout:
Our shoes are wet, our skin is cold
And we no longer fear the voices of the brave or bold
Making what is to come clear
Well, future is diminished by what today we did
We wetted warmth and killed it and in the water hid
We wetted warmth and killed it and in the water hid
You want to catch your breath, you want to get out 
But as you surface you don't really know how 
How to live upon the solid ground 
Well, sometimes it's just easier to let yourself drown 
Love is 
Thick like 
Blood like 
Honey 
You cannot spell it out there are no words 
Mrs. Johnson never taught me those verbs 
On how to give myself and how to receive 
It is something that's inside of you and me 
Love is 
Thick like 
Blood like 
Honey 
Forget everything you ever learned 
No one listens when you want to be heard 
Just bleed the bittersweet 
Seven sunrises and seven more nights 
You'd think that we could learn to do it right 
If nothing changes then I'm gonna stop 
But do I really have a choice? 
Oh, no I think not
I found an old rock in the dry dirt outside
The door of my motel room
It was a triangle with soft, rounded edges and a split down the middle of one corner
It was darker than English moss, green like the soft frills of a peacock's plume
I waited for you but I never told you where I was
It was who taught me how to write these kinds of equations
I waited on the steps for you and I hid in the bushes whenever a car pull into the parking lot
You taught me how to listen to these distant stations
Distant stations
I saw the sky break
I threw a rock at a crow who was playing in the mulch of some rosebushes by the motel office
Missed him by a good yard or two
I sang old songs from nowhere
Los Angeles, Albuquerque
I said a small prayer for the poor and the naked and the hungry
And I prayed real hard for you
I waited for you but I never told you where I was
It was who taught me how to write these kinds of equations
I waited on the steps for you and I hid in the bushes whenever a car pull into the parking lot
You taught me how to listen to these distant stations
Distant stations
Imagine if the life that you thought you shared wasn't really there
It was made up in your mind, could be anyone, anywhere
'Cause you'd be living in a world of your own design, undermined
In another place, other space and time
As the dust clears and it all starts to disappear
It may get harder, cause you just restarted
And wherever you are, land on another star
It may get harder, cause you just restarted
You better get real, real, real and realise that the situation is going nowhere
Because you act so tough, I totally lost control
So please try to understand that if I could, I'd call and I would be there
And if I didn't hurt so much, you know I'd give you it all
You know I'd give you it all
Imagine if the friend that you thought you knew wasn't really true
It just existed in your head, the reflection used wasn't you
Completely unaware, could be anywhere, anytime
Cause there was a shift in the paradigm
As the dust clears and it all starts to disappear
It may get harder, cause you just restarted
And wherever you are, land on another star
It may get harder, cause you just restarted
You better get real, real, real and realise that the situation is going nowhere
Because you act so tough, I totally lost control
So please, try to understand that if I could, I'd call and I would be there
And if I didn't hurt so much, you know I'd give you it all
You know I'd give you it all
It may get harder, cause you just restarted
It may get harder, cause you just restarted
You saved me from melting, baby
You saved me from stinging and being holed up
And braking in snow and killing more
And overspilling my runneth cup
You had light in your hands and your eyes closed
You had movement out of my sight
You wore no shoes and ate like a leopard
And slept with your legs apart every night
And if I had to live
This is what it should be
To have such a woman with me
When tidal wave hit and our house was in splinters
I thought you had took all you had to take
But you snuggled to me on the ground in the winter
And your breath smelled like honey in the frosty air wake
And if I had to live
This is what it should be
To have such a woman with me
Instrumental
We come together, here we go
Around the fire, here we go
Flaming higher, here we go
To my surprise a fever grows
Lamps will glimmer on the gloom
Prey on the light in the room
As we fill it to the brim
We say the words we take them in
Oh how the hills were laughing
How the creeks they cried
How the grass would cheer on
As we passed them by
Room for many, room for few
Here in the dark I made for you
Oh why do I hear you and believe
That we come together to make it sweet
Oh how the hills were laughing
How the creeks they cried
How the grass would cheer on
As we passed them by
You don't know how to ease my pain
You don't know...
You don't know how to ease my pain
You don't know what the sound is darlin'?
It's the sound of my tears falling
Or is it the rain?
You don't know...
You don't know how to play the game
And you cheat, you lie
You make me want to cry
You make me want to cry
Cry...
You make me want to cry!
You don't know how to ease my pain, you don't know
You don't know how to ease my pain
Don't you hear any voices crying?
That's the sound of our love dying
Here comes the rain
You don't know how to play the game
And you cheat, you lie
You don't even know how to say goodbye
You make me want to cry
You don't know...
You don't even know how to say goodbye
You make me want to cry!
You don't even know how to say goodbye
You make me want to cry!
Cry...
Cry...
Cry...
Cry...!
The concrete broke your fall
To hear you speak of it
I'd have done anything
I would do anything
I feel like a cartoon brick wall
To hear you speak of it
You've been so sad
It makes me worry
Why not smile?
You've been sad for a while
Why not smile?
I would do anything
To hear you speak of it
Why not smile?
You've been sad for a while
You've been sad for a while
Caught a bird and let it go, had a rope and don't you know
When I pulled it down, it settled on the ground
Caught a bird and in a trap, had a lot to give back
When the sun came by you opened up your eyes
Oh brother, will you let me in again?
Oh sister, I am stumbling again
Oh Sophie, will you be my good friend?
Oh Sophie, will you be here in the end?
Then you whispered in my ear, "I am lost, but you're here."
As the scene unfolded, truth got moved away
Caught a bird and let it go, had a rope and don't you know
When I pulled it down, it flew from the ground
Oh brother, will you let me in again?
Oh sister, I am stumbling again
Oh Sophie, will you be my good friend?
Oh Sophie, will you be here in the end?
Even though the scene was never golden.
All the while you're bones have gotten frozen.
You stood still.
Oh brother, will you let me in again?
Oh sister, I am stumbling again.
Oh Sophie, will you be my good friend?
Oh Sophie, will you be here in the end?
Yo, el otoño
Yo, el vespero
He sido un eco
Seré una ola
Seré la luna
He sido todo, soy yo
Yo, el verano
Yo, el ébano
Soy la Soñadora
Jag går i vinterskor på hösten
Alltid förberedd för storm
Jag kan tänka tills det knappt finns nått kvar
Jag har känslor utan uppehåll
Jag har förlorat en tävling 
Men vunnit ett val
Har bestämt att stå helt utanför det där som jag blir ledsen av
Jag saknar dig mindre och mindre 
Det kommer annat emellan och det är bra
Jag saknar dig mindre och mindre 
Jag har glömt dig en vacker dag
När jag träffat gamla vänner har jag ingenting att säga dem 
De ställer för många frågor och jag, jag bidrar inte med nån
Och jag kan ångra det lilla jag säger
Eller dra ett allvarligt skämt
Jag tycker mig höra vad dem tänker
"Är hon sådär jämt?"
Oh jag saknar dig mindre och mindre 
Det kommer annat emellan och det är bra
Jag saknar dig mindre och mindre 
Jag har glömt dig en vacker dag
Jag kan sitta själv i parken
Tills solen har ändrat färgen i mitt hår
Jag kan offra allt jag har för ingenting
Ja, jag sträcker mig så långt det går
Men jag behöver dig kom hit och rör om
Jag behöver nått att skriva om
Jag saknar dig mindre och mindre
Det kommer annat emellan och det är bra
Jag saknar dig mindre och mindre
Jag har glömt dig en vacker dag
Jag saknar dig mindre och mindre
Det kommer annat emellan och det är bra
Jag saknar dig mindre och mindre
Jag har glömt dig en vacker dag
Now the rain comes down the windows and it,
Drops onto the forehead of the waiting boy,
He surveys his rental kingdom and he,
Wonders if he's really lost his one joy.
Another fool would go down to the,
Only place she ever went to lose herself,
She's gone to the movies now and she,
Don't need your help.
Now the rain turns into snowfall as the,
City sky reflects the silver street below,
And it covers up the cars,
And the Wall-flowers CD ended half an hour ago.
Another fool would dig the broken car out from the snow,
And drive to find the show,
She's gone to the movies now and she's,
Not coming home,
She's gone to the movies now and she's,
Not coming home.
Now he looks around his place and anyways,
There's nowhere she could sit besides the bed,
And he wonders if the car will start tomorrow,
Or he'll have to take the bus instead.
Any other fool would be out on the roadway,
Trying to spot her rusted Pontiac,
She's gone to the movies now and she's,
Not coming back,
She's gone to the movies now and she's,
Not coming back.
How long, how long, how long,
Will we take to come undone?
If you know the answer tell me now,
And I'll write up a calendar for our countdown.
'Cause what if what we see is all,
Is all we've got?
Say you've kept some fire aside,
To set light to me some surprising night.
And say you've locked some fire away,
To set light to me some surprising day.
Any day now.
How come, how come, how come,
I'm now on a road holding out my thumb?
If you know my destination please,
Well buy me the fastest car and throw me the keys.
'Cause what if what we see is all,
Is all we've got?
Say you've kept some fire aside,
To set light to me some surprising night.
Say you've locked some fire away,
To set light to me some surprising day.
'Cause finger by finger we're losing grasp,
And I'm questioning the reasons why nothing beautiful does last.
And say you've kept some fire aside,
To set light to me some surprising night.
And say you've locked some fire away,
To set light to me surprising day,
To me some surprising day.
Any day now.
Motor cars, handlebars
Bicycles for two
Broken-hearted jubilee
Parachutes, Army boots
Sleeping bags for two
Sentimental jamboree
Buy, buy
Says the sign in the shop window
Why, why
Says the junk in the yard
Candlesticks, building bricks
Something old and new
Memories for you and me
Buy, buy
Says the sign in the shop window
Why, why
Says the junk in the yard
I know I'm not perfect
I know I got issues
I know that I've got a sordid past
And, yeah, some mad tattoos
I'm not a model
I'm not a saint
I'm sorry but I am
Just not sorry
'Cause I swear and
'Cause I drink
Maybe it's about the time
To let all of the love
Back in the light
Maybe it's about the perfect place
To let go and forget
About the hate
Love into the light
I know we're all different
Baby, that's life
But all of these differences
They make me feel alive
And I've got this question, yeah
Been burning through my head
Can't we all get over ourselves
And just stop talkin' shit?
Maybe it's about the time
To let all of the love
Back in the light
Maybe it's about the perfect place
To let go and forget
About the hate
Love into the light
All of the shit talk
Yeah, all the chatter
Cuts like a knife
Yeah, kills like a dagger
Love into the light
All that I am, yeah
All that I'm after
Love in this life
It's all really matters
Love into the light
Maybe it's about the time
To let all of the love
Back in the light
Maybe it's about the perfect place
To let go and forget
About the hate
Love into the light
All of the shit talk
Yeah, all the chatter
Cuts like a knife
Yeah, kills like a dagger
Love into the light
All that I am, yeah
All that I'm after
Love in this life
It's all really matters
Love into the light
Love into the light
Love into the light
Love into the light
There she goes again (there she goes)
She's out on the street again (there she goes)
She's down on her knees my friend (there she goes)
Won't have to ask her please again (there she goes)
Look a little closer there's no tears in her eyes
You know she won't make it with just any guy
What can you do (there she goes)
See her walking down the street (there she goes)
With all your friends she's gonna meet (there she goes)
You'd better hit her
There she goes again (there she goes)
She's out on the street again (there she goes)
She's down on her knees my friend (there she goes)
Won't have to ask her please again (there she goes)
Look a little closer there's no tears in her eyes
You know she won't make it with just any guy
What can you do (there she goes)
See her walking down the street (there she goes)
With all your friends she's gonna meet (there she goes)
You'd better hit her
Look a little closer there's no tears in her eyes
You know she won't make it with just any guy
What can you do (there she goes)
See her walking down the street (there she goes)
With all your friends she's gonna meet (there she goes)
You'd better hit her
This boy I know, he has a heart of glass
It is gold inside but it has crystallized
It is beautiful but in it's tragedy
It is hard to hold without shattering
He calls himself at night, in soft overchords
Keeps coming back to it his voice in echo chorus
Till the sound's so thick it turns the sky to smoke
And the grayest days the predictions told
But this boy I know, he is pure of soul
Just gets lost sometimes in his chemicals
Under a coat of night, it's oh-so-comforting
And that first breaking light becomes his enemy
He calls so late tonight, it is 4 a.m.
He is drunk, he can't find his apartment
I don't like how it feels when I think of him
All hooded in black, lost and stumbling
The days start to fade out of the frame
Like their blurring into to someone else's name
You try your hardest to rewind the tapes
But you're prepared everyday to make the same mistakes
Step out of that life, it's nowhere near your time
Just remember you called it all bullshit
Well, it is and if you stop giving into it
You can walk away the freest man
This boy I know lives in a bell jar
It is balancing upon it's pedestal
He tries not to upset the weight of conscience
Afraid it's so far to fall if no one catches him
But I've been there too, and I swear to god
If I can help you, please, you've got to tell me how
I know you've been away, and it can break you down
And I don't want you gone
All the cracks you see can be repaired
And if you start to fall, we will be there
Don't drown yourself in all your old regrets
Because that heaviness will steal away your breath
Step out of that life, it's nowhere near your time
And don't forget that you called it all bullshit
Well it still is and if you stop giving into it
You will walk away the freest man
Shake your head
Loosen that grip
Raise up your fist
You are the freest man
Open your mouth
Scream it out loud
Forget all your doubts
You are the freest man
Not long ago
When the astronauts discovered
That us down below
Are living on a little rock with no place to go
So much that they'll never know
Oh boy
They just want to be back at home
The elephant sees
The dangers of the jungle
The birds and the bees
Are home and they know
Which way they fly
If only I knew how to fly
The moment they got me to try
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah...
The fish in the see
Have many things to tell me
Well what could they be?
I\'ll never know I had to go
Because I don\'t associate with fish
So I continue to roam
Oh boy
Looking to find me a home
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah...
Into the desert
Weathered forever
Desperate clouds
Follow them out
Seeing the future
Cautiously answer
It's only the plains
Sideways rain
The days whispered and shouted
And everything counted
The signs were around
We looked, so we found
Been seeking a pattern
None of it mattered
Watching the sky
Cycling by
Through windows of our past lives
We are seeing the same thing
But they are not laughing
The smoke from the engine
The bones of the plane
I notice this vaguely
But it couldn't contain me
And so I've been tamed
And so it remains
And I am ashamed
And [hiding] in the strangest pathway
Try to remember
Pen to the paper
Caution: 'get out!'
What's it about?
The pictures are empty
Voices have left me
It's only the plains
Sideways rain
And I am ashamed
And I am ashamed
And every day is just the same
Star crossed lovers
They say we're not meant to be
'Cause the stars in the sky, and the fashion that they are aligned.
I say if the futures been drawn out there's no point in living.
I won't give up my love so that fate can have its way.
If the stars say that you couldn't love me,
Are you telling me that you would listen?
If the words make their way from your mouth,
Don't ask my permission,
All is forgiven.
Star crossed lovers, we do what we want to.
Some learn the hard way,
We all learn through consequence.
I say if the futures been drawn out then nobody's living.
I won't give you up love, so fate can have its way.
Its way.
If the stars say that you couldn't love me,
Are you telling me that you would listen?
If the words make their way from your mouth,
Don't ask my permission,
All is forgiven.
Is it over? (over)
(The stars keep this fire from burning out)
Is it over? (over)
(Are you saying that you'd really listen?)
Is it over?
(The stars keep this fire)
Is it over?
(The stars keep this fire)
If the stars say that you couldn't love me,
Are you telling me that you would listen?
If the words make their way from your mouth,
Don't ask my permission,
All is forgiven.
If the stars say that you can not love.
(The stars keep this fire from burning out)
If the stars say that you can not love me.
I walk barefoot where the water drowns the sand
With you no longer here to hold my hand
I let go
I let go
The ocean makes my swelling heart feel small
With the sounds it makes you won't hear it if I call
I let go
I let go
There's a breeze in the air
There's a boat anchored out here
There's a calm under the waves so I choose to sink
Your skin protected me from sunbeams
Your hands made sure I'd stay intact
I let go
I let go
You were always there to walk me home
With you not here, the streets I roam
I let go
I let go
There's a breeze in the air
There's a boat anchored out here
There's a calm under the waves as I choose to sink
With your voice in my head
I would float here instead
But there's a calm under the waves
So I choose to sink
I'm tired now
I'll see you when I wake up
I've heard it's pretty where you are
I let go
I let go
There's a breeze
Are you changing, are you changing, are you changing.
Do you know it, do you feel it, do you know it.
But you're waiting, why're you waiting, why're you waiting.
Just do it, whatever it is.
There are secrets, there are secrets, there are secrets.
There are places, there are places, you can go to
They might tell you, yeah they'll tell you, that you shouldn't
Just do it, whatever it is, whatever it is,
Just do it, whatever it is, whatever it is,
Go do it, whatever it is, whatever it is,
Just do it, whatever it is.
And you're dancing, and you're looking kinda crazy
And your arms, are making little circles
There are reasons, there are reasons, you can find out
So do it, whatever it is, whatever it is,
Just do it, whatever it is, whatever it is,
Go do it, whatever it is, whatever it is,
Whatever it is, whatever it is.
It's so quiet, it's so quiet, it's so quiet
And you're dreaming, and you're dreaming, and you're dreaming
I turn to you and say - awake is the new sleep, awake is the new sleep
So wake up. And do it, whatever it is. Just do it, whatever it is.
'Cause awake is the new sleep, awake is the new sleep
So wake up
Wake up.
And do it. Whatever it is, whatever it is,
Just do it, whatever it is, whatever it is,
Go do it, whatever it is, whatever it is
Just do it, whatever it is, whatever it is.
(One, two, three, four)
As I gave in to temptation
I've straighten across the line
Keep it under wraps in the cold store
Put it to the back of your mind
Put it to the back of your mind
But by some miracle
I've just got away with it
I've clawed it back again
By some miracle
I've just got away with it
I've clawed it back
I'm crawling back again
As a black dog down in the basement
Is barking out my name
Snapping at my heels when I falter
Kick it but it won't go away
Kick it but it won't go away
But by some miracle
I've just got away with it
I've clawed it back again
But by some miracle
I've just got away with it
I've clawed it back
I'm crawling back again
I used to know this woman who had the most beautiful tattoos
On the top sides of both of her hands
She was forty three years old and as far as I know
Had never yet been with a man
It's not that she wasn't attractive, she was beautiful
But its the way that she interacted
She was aggressively passive to the point where she
would have intimidated any mitt that ever tried to catch her
On the right hand she had a tattoo of a nude girl
She claimed it is what God resembled
But on the left she had a mirrored image of the same female
And this one she explained looked like the devil
I remember once watching her touch her own breasts
It's how the tattoos smiled as they stared down her stomach,
As if anticipating when they'd be allowed to caress
The sweet flower that they both seemed to hunger (sweet flower)
Now maybe I was high but it felt so right
Heaven and hell both take to this woman's womb
It didn't make sense how she could commence
Touching herself with me wide awake in the same room
Now if I've learned anything in my years (my years)
I learned I no longer believe in surprised (in surprise)
But what happened next damn near stole my tears
The tattoos came alive right in front of my eyes
They both slowly stood up and climbed off her hands
And showed me why she never took some time with a man
They climbed deep inside of this woman's garden
She closed her eyes and she gently bit her bottom lip
I stepped, I left and I don't regret leaving
And I'll never forget all the things I saw that evening
A glimpse of religion, a piece of coming closer
To understanding more about what intrigues me most
I didn't get turned on, I just got turned
I wasn't as aroused as I was concerned
For each one of 'em I've hurt and every time I've been burned
I've got a lot to teach but even more to learn
So now I keep my eyes open hoping to take in all I can
About Woman taking in all she can
And for as long as I breathe I'll save a seat in my memory
For that woman with the tattooed hands
There's good and evil in each individual fire
Identifies needs and feeds our desires
As long as we keep our spirit inspired
She can bite her bottom lip all she wants
There's good and evil in each individual fire
Identifies needs and feeds our desires
As long as we keep our spirit inspired
She can bite her bottom lip all she wants
There's good and evil in each individual fire
Identifies needs and feeds our desires
As long as we keep our spirit inspired
She can bite her bottom lip all she wants
There's good and evil in each individual fire
Identifies needs and feeds our desires
As long as we keep our spirit inspired
She can bite her bottom lip all she wants
There's good and evil in each individual fire
Identifies needs and feeds our desires
As long as we keep our spirit inspired
She can bite her bottom lip all she wants
Within half an hour you
Will be gone and I won't see you anymore
You left my love on the line
And said that you were leaving
And you won't come home again
And you won't come home again
And I'll miss you like you're dead
But I never got to grieve you
'Cause I saw you
In the arms of someone else
So your phantom follows me
Like a child would his mother
Or a lover who never said goodbye
It's only saying goodbye
And I cry myself to sleep
And you thought I was happy
I was lonely
Had nowhere to go
And I heard that you moved on
Found a brand new family
And changed your married name
And everything has changed
And I'll miss you like you're dead
And find a way to grieve you
'Cause I need to
Try and start again
And your ghost will have to leave
Like a child would his mother
Or a lover
Who has to say goodbye
So this is goodbye
So this is goodbye
So this is goodbye
Goodbye
So this is goodbye
So this is goodbye
So this is goodbye
So this is good good good
Bless you wherever you are
Windswept child on a shooting star
Restless Spirits depart
Still we're deep in each other's hearts 
Some people say it's over
Now that we spread our wings
But we know better darling
The hollow ring is only last year's echo 
Bless you whoever you are
Holding her now
Be warm and kind hearted
And remember though love is strange
Now and forever our love will remain
I dig my hole, you build a wall
I dig my hole, you build a wall
One day that wall is gonna fall
Gon' build that city on a hill
Gon' build that city on a hill
Someday those tears are gonna spill
So build that wall and build it strong
'Cause we'll be there before too long
Gon' build that wall up to the sky
Gon' build that wall up to the sky
Someday your bird is gonna fly
Gon' build that wall until it's done
Gon' build that wall until it's done
But now you've got nowhere to run
So build that wall and build it strong
'Cause we'll be there before too long
She ran until her face was numb with cold and
Wore a cotton gown that blazed the night untold.
She ran until her feet refused to hold
So heavy a heart for someone merely ten years old.
And when she reached the river her knees began to shiver,
Her head with pounding voices from home.
Behind her was a vision, a painful apparition
Of a darker world that no one should know.
Somebody's bed will never be warm again,
The river will keep this friend.
Yeah somebody's bed will never be warm again,
No never again.
She dived beneath the water's icy skin,
Hoping the cold would kill the smell of angry gin,
And her eyes grew wider than they'd ever been
Just wishing the numbness to cut deeper with its pins.
And as her body lay there she decided to stay there
Till darkness came to pull her away.
And beautifully she sank as up river was the bank
Where some bodiless troubles would stay.
Somebody's bed will never be warm again,
The river will keep this friend.
Yeah somebody's bed will never be warm again,
No never again.
Somebody's bed will never be warm again,
The river will keep this friend.
Yeah somebody's bed will never be warm again,
No never again.
Flying
And you know I'm not coming down
You're trying
But you know you must soon go down
All my colours

Hey I've flown away

All my colours
I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
I keep my eyes wide open all the time
I keep the ends out for the tie that binds
Because you're mine, I walk the line
I find it very, very easy to be true
I find myself alone when each day is through
Yes, I'll admit that I'm a fool for you
Because you're mine, I walk the line
Because you're mine, I walk the line
You've got a way to keep me on your side
You give me cause for love that I can't hide
For you I know I'd even try to turn the tide
Because you're mine, I walk the line
Because you're mine, I walk the line
Because you're mine, I walk the line
Because you're mine, I walk the line
Because you're mine, I walk the line
Instrumental
Too many fucked up years
And I can't hold her
Too many fucked up times
Have come my way
Too many teardrops yeah
I don't get it
Life moves on
If you want it to
Too many times I've felt
My heart was broken
Wasting time on someone
I don't get
But I've found someone
Who makes me better
Yeah I've found someone
Who makes me go
I wanna ride with her
In uncertain times
I wanna go where my thoughts
Can take a nap
And if the atom bomb should end us both
I'll be happy to go to the stars with you
I was young, I was surviving the times
Waiting for my moment, I was destined to shine
Little Ray had an NSX, I was hoping I'm next
Wanting bracelets, never had a rope on my neck
Unless I was holding Taiyeh chain--Rest In Peace
Even though that night you flipped on us
You warned us If you came back and we still on the corners,
We goners, moving on to...
Move your arm in your watch To another time on the block
'Cause this 40 Side Where they say Shorty rhyme
Tragedy he used to come through all the time
I'm talking Juice Crew, not what the word define
He had a sister named Erin, for sure was fine
That was my first crush; I bought my first mic
I wrote my first verse, I was about nine
I was about mine, fantasize house-buying
Met Paul, he wore some big glasses
Him and Melquan took me where G Rap lived
I was happy, just getting some answers
I ain't even know what a record advance was
I'm seeing hoes sex in the studio bathroom
With rap dudes, thinking wow she moved me
Same girl then, right now's a groupie
Back then, she was like the star in the movie
Large jewelry and expensive Gucci
Next stop, Paid In Full posse recruits me
Knew they were some millionaires, their ropes were dookie
Eric B man looking like touch-it-he-shoot-me
You see, every time Ra didn't show
I get to record demos at attempts to blow
I wonder could they tell, how did they know
Sixteen years later, here I go
Can it be we've run out of time?
You're alive, Oh-O
In these streets we live in and die, when it's your time
You will know, cause it ain't hard to tell...
I'm with Akinyele in the street, trying to get us a deal
G Rap tried to get us to sign to Cold Chill
But Fly Ty didn't have the contract we wanted
Clark Kent just signed Das, he didn't want us
Russell said I sounded like G, the nigga fronted
Reef and Matty C offered me a little money
Shit a little funny, feel a little laughter
Rebel of Hip-Hop coming through a white rapper
My boy MC Serch nevertheless
Took me to Columbia, back then CBS
Chris Schwartz, RuffHouse, he was the best man
Now bugging because the label had just dropped Def Jam
Could you picture Russell needing a check, man
But he smart, he plotted a plan for Polygram
Life is ill, again life's a movie
Then, the roster's: Cypress Hill, Nas, and Fugees
Before I sold records, no promotion
The rap world like, what's all this commotion
Went plat', mad bottles I'm toasting
20/20 hindsight, but how did they know then
Invincible, lyrical, miracle man, huh
But back to the matter at hand
'Cause ten years ago we all strived to be twenty-five
Some cats didn't make it alive
Dated some stars but respect their privacy
Copped mad cars, laying back in the driver's seat
Held myself down, just steering the wheel
Here I am, completed my whole record deal
My love, wherever you are
Whatever you are
Don't lose faith
I know it's gonna happen someday
To you
Please wait
Please wait
Oh, wait
Don't lose faith
You say that the day
Just never arrives
And it's never seemed so far away
Still I know it's gonna happen someday
To you
Please wait
Don't lose faith
Seen fortune in my lifetime
Gave it all to the man instead
Still tomorrow comes, I'm still standing on my own two feet
Got a woman at home
She treats me well
Anger, I seen it rise
From a careless word that I said
Well guilt is wasteful, pride is childish
Got a woman at home
She told me that
Got a woman at home
She treats me well
Found sorrow in my mind most times
Gave it all back to the life I led
Well it seems times change, it all just rolls away
Now I've got a woman at home
She treats me well
She's all right when everyone is wrong
She's all right, let's me waste another song
Stumble through the years, I'll make it heaven, make it hell
One day to the next for now it serves me very well
Now I've got a woman at home
She treats me well
Mourning, I've done my time here
Stood here watching my own death
Well a few things going my way this time
Got a woman at home
She treats me well
Slumber, not in my lifetime
Won't spend my days in my bed
Make the whole scene gather round come see it my way
Now I've got a woman at home
She treats me well
She's all right when everyone is wrong
She's all right, let's me waste another song
Stumble through the years, I'll make it heaven, make it hell
One day to the next for now it serves me very well
Now I've got a woman at home
She treats me well
She?�s got her life living in her heart
She?�s got these eyes well where do I start?
Like looking at the deep night sky
So many worlds inside her eyes
She?�s a spectacular girl
Part of the job of being a man
Is knowing when to let go of her hand
A kind of power, it can?�t be reined in
To hold her back would be a sin
She?�s a spectacular girl
She sees the beauty in things we all miss
All good things are defined by the kiss
If you feeling like you can?�t believe
Well then how do you explain the miracle I see
She?�s a spectacular girl
Spectacular girl
Not a desire and not a need
Some things just happen because they have to be
I?�m gonna get there, I?�m telling you sir
I?�m a man on a mission and I?�m all about her
She?�s a spectacular girl
Spectacular girl
Oh yeah
My love
I write mostly on hotel paper
Knowing that my thoughts will never leave this room
I'd be out of line telling you, "leave her"
So I lie lonely surrounded by you (by you)
Lately I can't be happy for no one
They think I need some time to myself
I try to smile but I can't remember
I know tomorrow there'll be nothing else
And I, I wanted to be
Giving you everything she's not giving
And I, I wanted to see
'Cause I didn't believe what I'd been hearing
You turned out to be more than I bargined for
And I can tell that you need to get away
Forgive me if I admit that I'd love to love you
We both realized it was way too late
And I, I wanted to be
Giving you everything she's not giving
And I, I wanted to see
'Cause I didn't believe what I've been hearing
Maybe this wind blowing in just came from the ocean
I write mostly on hotel paper
I wanna buy you roses
'Cause the words are dead,
Follow in the blindness
On the arrow head
'Cause the words are dead
And you know it
Yeah the words are dead
Lower them down
Didn't know if you could
Deny the dead,
Leaving them in silence
On their mouldy bed
Oh I am numb
And over
Their kingdom come
Lower me down
They are dead, they are dead
Oh, don't cry for me,
Oh, don't cry for me,
Oh, don't cry for me,
Oh, don't you cry for me
Lower them down in the ground
Lower them down in the ground
Now that your leave is over
Let's down our drinks and say goodnight
To this illusion
Bell-bottom Casanova
The silhouettes that pass us by
Are ships in the night
Ships in the night,
In the night, in the night
When you alight, mein Lieber
Whether its Hamburg or New york
I'll still be sleeping
Look in your wallet all you'll find
A little note I've left behind
Oh, I hope you don't mind
We're Ships in the night
Ships in the night
Ships in the night,
In the night.
You're honest
Even when you lie
Well I wish you were closer than near
I must be blind
'Cause you didn't
Intend to live
You just merely got it all wrong
I'm better off dead
'Cause I must remember to forget you
And I must remember you can't seem to
You're honest
Even when you lie
And in all of the kitchens in the world
Full of broken live
'Cause it doesn't
Happen when you're asleep
To the unspoken question I say
'Will you have me?'
'Cause I must remember to reject you
And I must remember you can't seem to
'Cause I must remember to forget you
And I must remember you don't seem to
I wish I had an evil twin
Running 'round doing people in
I wish I had a very bad
And evil twin to do my will
To cull and conquer, cut and kill
Just like I would
If I weren't good
And if I knew where to begin
Down and down we go
How low no one would know
Sometimes the good life wears thin
I wish I had an evil twin
My evil twin would lie and steal
And he would stink of sex appeal
All men would writhe
Beneath his scythe
He'd send the pretty ones to me
And they would think that I was he
I'd hurt them and I'd go scot free
I'd get no blame 
And feel no shame
'Cause evil's not my cup of tea
Down and down we go
How low one would not need to know
All my life there should have been
An evil twin
I had a friend named Victor
The two of us used to hang every single day
And it seemed like overnight
That his whole life just changed
I know when his mom and dad broke up
It didn't make sense
But I know that his dad was a drunk
And he gambled away the rent
Pretty soon Vic was seeing red
Pissed off, but instead
He'd drink every night 'til he passed out
And then he'd do it all again
The whole time
Smiling on the outside to cover the pain
But on the inside
All he was trying to do was get away
Dying to get away
Let the pain of yesterday
Go slipping through the cracks
Yo, funny how things change color
Then fade to another shade
When you had it made, it was all good
But now look, just another day
It was so fresh, it was so clean
Now it's all gone, one, two, three
Lights out, which way to turn
Can't get a grip, all alone in a big white house
Every day gets worse
And you just curse 'til your head bursts
And it hurts so bad, she left, now you suffer
Should've thought of that one first
No family, no kids
Can't accept what you did
Now you wanna run away but you can't
'Cause the past comes back again
Slippin' through the cracks, sip a little Jack
Go to bed half dead, what about rent?
Why does every cent gotta be a bet
When's it gonna end
Oh, my God, we don't got a penny left
My mom's gotta find a way to get a job
Outta debt, outta dodge, out of breath
Out of this big problem
My pop's wanna get away from the pain
In a better place in his brain
But the medication he takes
Makes him wasted
So sick if he's gonna think
The Good Lord would come take him
I'm shaking him, wake up
You son of a bitch
He's dying to get away
Let the pain of yesterday
Go slipping through the cracks
Hiding himself away
Watching all the memories fade
Away from red to black
He's dying to get away
Let the pain of yesterday
Go slipping through the cracks
Hiding himself away
Watching all the memories fade
Away from red to black
Slipping through the cracks
Slipping through the cracks
Slipping through the cracks
Waiting on my angel to come
I was waiting on my angel to come
I had nothing to lose but time
Little fella wanted to know
Little fella wanted to know
He said, "Boy, are you ready to die?"
I told him I would have to say no
Cause in my life
I only wanted things to go right
Oh my god
Can't believe the mess I've caused
I want to go back again
Please let me go back again
Now I got to wait on my girl
How long I got to wait on my girl
I bet she's down there having fun
I never was a jealous guy
You know I never was a jealous type
But I saw the way he looked at you
He always was a son of a bitch
In my life
I only wanted things to go right
Oh my god
Look at all the mess I've caused
I want to go back again
Please let me go back again
High, high, high
On the loneliest cloud in the sky
Clean, clean, clean
Everything is so boring and clean
In my life
I only wanted things to go right
Oh my god
I can'r believe the mess I've caused
I want to go back again
Please let me go back again
Again
Please let me go back again
I want to go back again
Feel the pain teaching us how much more we can take
Reminding us how far we've come
Let the pain burn away from our hearts
We have time to start all over again
Feel the pain teaching us how much more we can take
Reminding us how far we've come
Let the pain burn away from our heart
We have time to start all over again
Feel the pain teaching us how much more we can take
Reminding us how far we've come
Let the pain burn away from our hearts
We have time to start all over again
But if you would shine your love down here
And make our hearts as perfect as new
If you would shine your love down here
I promise I'll reflect it right back at you
I promise I'll reflect it right back at you
I promise we'll reflect it right back at you
Bjartar vonir rætast
Er við göngum bæinn
Brosum og hlæjum glaðir
Vinátta og þreyta mætast
Höldum upp á daginn
Og fögnum tveggja ára bið
Fjarlægur draumur fæðist*
Borðum og drekkum saddir
Og borgum fyrir okkur
Með því sem við eigum í dag
Setjumst niður spenntir
Hlustum á sjálfa okkur slá
Í takt við tónlistina
Það virðist engin hlusta
Þetta er allt öðruvísi
Við lifðum í öðrum heimi
Þar sem við vorum aldrei ósýnileg
Nokkrum dögum síðar
Við tölum saman á ný
En hljóðið var ekki gott
Við vorum sammála um það
Sammála um flesta hluti
Við munum gera betur næst
Þetta er ágætis byrjun
(hopelandic)
*Heim acoustic version: Fjarlægur draumur rættist
I won't ask you where you're goin'.
I won't ask you where you been.
I know after a million times you get sick of all my lines,
But I just wanna see you safe again.
Hopefully it occurs to me that there's one thing I can't stand.
That's the thought of a single day, without your head in my hand.
I know that just now I ain't been showin,
The kind of love you know that I can.
So gimmie a little time and you'll be knowin' your good lovin'
Baby is back on top again.
I always hoped you'd be showin,
And now you've shown as much as you can.
But after each time I'm still glowin'
With a good lovin' smile that's yours until the end.
Sunshine, won't you be my mother
Sunshine, come and help me sing
My heart is darker than these oceans
My heart is frozen underneath
We are crooked souls trying to stay up straight,
Dry eyes in the pouring rain, well
The shadow proves the sunshine
The shadow proves the sunshine
Two scared little runaways
Hold fast to the break of day light where
The shadow proves the sunshine
The shadow proves the sunshine
Oh Lord, why did you forsake me?
Oh Lord, don't be far away away
Storm clouds gathering beside me
Please Lord, don't look the other way
I'm a crooked soul trying to stay up straight
Dry eyes in the pouring rain, well
The shadow proves the sunshine
The shadow proves the sunshine
Two scared little runaways
Hold fast to the break of day light where
The shadow proves the sunshine
The shadow proves the sunshine
Yeah Yeah, shine on me
Yeah Yeah, shine on me
Yeah Yeah, shine on me
Yeah Yeah, shine on me
Crooked souls trying to stay up straight
Dry eyes in the pouring rain, well
The shadow proves the sunshine
The shadow proves the sunshine
Two scared little runaways
Hold fast to the break of day light where
The shadow proves the sunshine
The shadow proves the sunshine
Yeah Yeah, shine on me
Yeah Yeah, shine on me
Yeah Yeah, shine on me
Shine on me,
Let my shadows prove the sunshine
Stuff was started, things had ends
Stuff regarding all my friends
Some were married, all were fine
These are good friends, these are mine
I got deep warm drunk
And I lost my words
And it does not hurt
And that moon is absurd
Stuff was started, things had ends
Stuff regarding all my friends
Some were married, all were fine
These are good friends, these are mine
I got deep warm drunk
And I lost my words
And it does not hurt
And that moon is absurd
I got deep warm drunk
And I lost my words
And it does not hurt
And that moon is
Lying down I notice what you see below us.
Your arms are like the trees.
I know I haven't said enough.
I know we haven't said enough.
How I will protect, and how each day matters.
Spying shows your limbs caught in the rails.
These simple games will soon be growing tales.
And I know we haven't said enough.
I know I haven't said too much.
How I will protect and how each day matters to me.
Since the wreck, I know more what you need.
You need me to put you in the trees.
I know we haven't said enough but I know I've never loved this much.

Clue me in
To all the people underground
Listening to the sound
Of the living people walking up and down the graves
Well one of them is mine
I visited my Fraulein
She's only one step away
To all the people underground
Listening to the sound
Of the living people breathing the air today
Well one of them is mine
I'm visiting my Fraulein
She's only one breath away
And I say...
Too all the people underground
Listening to a sound
Of the living people living their lives away
Well one of them is mine
I visited my Fraulein
She's only one life away
She's only one life away
Digging deeper in my mind
Can't get you out of my head
There's no way to describe
Just how you make me feel
I don't know
Is it love
I have lost control
Even when I'm gone
I can't get away
I can't Focus when I'm near you
Do you notice me at all
I can't Focus when I hear you
Do you notice I can't focus
Like the moth flies to the light 
He's captured at first sight
I can't deny I'm taken by
The beauty in your eyes
I don't know
Is it love
I have lost control
Even when I'm gone
I can't get away
I can't Focus when I'm near you
Do you notice me at all
I can't Focus when I hear you
Do you notice I can't focus
I can't Focus when I'm near you
Do you notice me at all
I can't Focus when I hear you
Do you notice (Do you notice)
I can't Focus when I'm near you
Do you notice me at all
I can't Focus when I hear you
Do you notice I can't focus
Is your heart singing out of tune?
Are your eyes just singing the blues?
Dirty records from another time
Some bloodstains on your shoes
No one really knows about your soul
And I barely really know your name
Burning rhythms and posting lies
And a bunch of fools drown in shame
Amy, don't you go
I want you around
Singing whoa, please don't go
Do you want to be a friend of mine?
Do you want to be a friend of mine?
Did you tattoo a lucky charm
To keep you out of harm's way
Warding off all evil signs
But never really kept you safe
Now you're too young for the golden age
'Cause the record bin's been replaced
27 gone without a trace
And you walked away from your drink
Amy, don't you go
I want you around
Singing whoa, please don't go
Do you want to be a friend of mine?
Do you want to be a friend of
Amy, please don't go
Amy, please don't go
Is your heart singing out of tune?
Are you eyes just singing the blues?
Dirty records from another time
Some blood stains on your shoes
May I have this last dance
By chance if we should meet
Can you write me a lullaby?
So we can sing you to sleep
Amy, don't you go
I want you around
Singing whoa, please don't go
Do you want to be a friend of mine?
Do you want to be a friend of mine?
The secrets that we keep say them in our sleep
And wrestle down our souls if they would speak
I watched you board a train in the London rain
And waved bye-bye as you slipped out of view
Diane 
Diane
We'll make it out together
We'll make it out
We'll make it out
In your dreams when the smile now comes
You're mumbling words with a lazy tongue
We lie together when we say it's love
Who were you just thinking of, Diane?
Diane
Diane I don't say it but I know you know
The theme returns so deep
And visits us in sleep
To define the you and I as we
So we pass the time and occupy our minds
And close our eyes and hope that we'll be fine
Diane
Diane
We'll make it out together
We'll make it out together
We'll make it out
We'll make it out
And I may leave in time you'll see
I'll come right back for you
And I may leave in time you'll see
I'll come right back for you, for you
Watch me waiting, take my hand
I won't you hear you sinking down
and we know how endangered we do
When nature is formal to you
So is the comfort there
What you can be in there
Say put your faith in me
And we can be free
Free
Free
Free
Loo-li, loo-li, loo-li, lai-lay
Loo-li, loo-li, loo-li, lai-lay
Lay down your head and I'll sing you a lullaby
Back to the years of loo-li lai-lay
And I'll sing you to sleep and I'll sing you tomorrow
Bless you with love for the road that you go
May you sail fair to the far fields of fortune
With diamonds and pearls at your head and your feet
And may you need never to banish misfortune
May you find kindness in all that you meet
May there always be angels to watch over you
To guide you each step of the way
To guard you and keep you safe from all harm
Loo-li, loo-li, lai-lay
May you bring love and may you bring happiness
Be loved in return to the end of your days
Now fall off to sleep, I'm not meaning to keep you
I'll just sit for a while and sing loo-li, lai-lay
May there always be angels to watch over you
To guide you each step of the way
To guard you and keep you safe from all harm
Loo-li, loo-li, lai-lay
Loo-li, loo-li, lai-lay
(Loo-li, loo-li, loo-li, lai-lay)
(Loo-li, loo-li, loo-li, lai-lay)
(Loo-li, loo-li, loo-li, lai-lay)
Loo-li, lai-lay...
It rained because I took the dust of
Your bones crushed and seeded all the clouds.
It rained for days a blaze of Hail and stones
The size of men around your house.
Rusty spring uncoils in a baby bottle.
Toddler screams over power the infant death rattle.
Push the little baby down the
Push the little baby down the
Push the little baby down the spiral stairs...
Push the little baby down the
Push the little baby down the
Push the little baby down the spiral stairs...
It's lame because it fell above the needs of this
Pretend life and his wishes.
So now it limps and counts the hours.
Watches the clock by pounding doves and dishes.
Delta Force plays on your old gray monitor.
Power Team breaks flaming blocks of cinder.
Sick of sickness. You're unkind and a liar.
Get your kicks a witness to feeble slaughter.
In your castle all your candles drip on the pavement,
From what I've heard.
And the cattle that you laid down drip on the pavement,
From what I've heard.
Cold wet floor.
Push the little baby down the
Push the little baby down the
Push the little baby down the spiral stairs...
Push the little baby down the
Push the little baby down the
Push the little baby down the spiral stairs...
Push the little baby down the
Push the little baby down the
Push the little baby down the spiral stairs...
Push the little baby down the
Push the little baby down the
Push the little baby down the spiral stairs...
Push
I was wandering through the streets of the city
Rambling through the the avenues of time
When from nowhere my eyes fell onto a girl
And by chance her eyes fell onto mine
Ah...
So I sat and I acted all nonchalant
She smoked her lavender cigarette
Reading the future that lay in my hands
My shadow played a bass clarinet
Where are you going with this, Bret?
We waltzed down a moonlit boulevard
Just two silhouettes in the mist
Ah. yes?
Days went by and years went by
Moments went by when we kissed
When was this?
She said, "Your beard is woven of heartache
And we'll drink for the lonely tonight."
And the moon is a horny old drunkard
Ah, Bret. Could you please move over to your right?
We drank dandelion wine and we reminisced
About the moment when we first met that day
I'm trying to watch TV
Then we reminisced about how we first reminisced
Ah yeah. Sounds a bit gay
She handed me a broken memory
A keepsake to forevermore say
That a brief taste of love is as sweet as any
And with that, she made her way
Oh yeah. What was her name?
She said her name was a secret
Then she said her name was Cherie
Is her middle name Cherie, so It's a Secret Cherie, maybe?
Mm ... Maybe What did she look like?
She looked like a Parisian river
What? dirty?
She looked like a chocolate eclair
That's rare
Her eyes were reflections of eyes
Oh, nice
And the rainbows danced in her hair
Oh yeah...
She reminded me of a winter's morning
What, frigid?
Her perfume was eau de toilette
What's that mean?
She was comparable to Cleopatra
Quite old?
She was like Shakespeare's Juliet
Thirteen?!
The bohemians of Soho did pirouettes
As we waltzed through the streets of Manhattan
On rivers of ribbon and sailboats of song
Bret, did any of this actually happen?
The girl I described, she's as real as the wind
It's true I saw her today
The other details are inventions
Because I prefer her that way
If I ever hurt you it will be in self defense
And if I ever hurt you it will be in self defense
Cause the podium's as high as the gallows are low
Swing low, swing low, swing low
You are a beast and I am serving up your supper oh
You are a beast and I am serving up your supper Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
What will you do when the drink is all gone?
Will you slam your fist down on the table
'Cause I'm not that kind of whore
No, I'm not that kind of whore
No, I'm not that kind of whore but I am a little Lord
No, I'm not that kind of whore but I am a little Lord
No, I'm not that kind of whore but I am a little Lord
Lord grant me patience, I am burning up inside
There are snakes out in the night
All these kids have gone astray
There are women with no meaning to their names when we say them
There are wars to win for now leftover sinful days
So, if I ever hurt you it will be in self defense
And if I ever hurt you it will be in self defense
And if you ever come at me I will hurt you
Oh, if you ever come at me I will hurt you
Oh, if you ever come at me you snake
You snake
You snake
You snake
You snake
I wish you the best, you snake
You are self professed, you snake
My heart's in my chest, you snake
You can have the rest, you snake
I wish you the best, you snake
You are self professed, you snake
My heart's in my chest, you snake
You can have the rest, you snake
I'm far away
And I'm feeling alone.
I've got one week behind me,
Just six more to go.
If I could see you I'd take off your clothes,
And we'd lie in the garden and watch the weeds grow.
And the grass is so high.
I can't see over.
And the moon is so full.
It's setting the stars all on fire.
If they build the dam
Any higher
They're gonna back up
The creek
And set this whole place under water.
The city is a million miles away.
The city is a million miles away.
I lie awake and think of you.
The floods and fires might be coming through,
But you know just what to do.
Yeah, you know what just to do.
I lie awake and think of you.
The floods and fires might be coming through,
But you know just what to do.
Yeah, you know what just to do.
Always looking for attention
Always needs to be mentioned
Who does she think she should be?
The shrill cry through darkening air
Doesn't she know he's had such a busy day?
Tell her ... sshhh
Somebody tell her ... sshhh
(Oh, no way, no way, there's no movement
Oh, oh, hooray
Slowest...)
It was only a test
But she swam too far
Against the tide
She deserves all she gets
The sky became mad with stars
As an out-stretched arm slowly disappears
Hooray... oh hooray!
(No, oh, there's no movement
No, oh hooray
Oh, hooray)
Please don't worry
There'll be no fuss
She was... nobody's nothing
(What's your name...?)
When he awoke
The sea was calm
And another day passes like a dream
(What's your name...?)
One of these days I'll make some money
And buy myself those things that I want:
Acrylic paints, acoustic guitar strings, a new bicycle seat
For my ride over to your house each night
And one of these days I'll get a real job
One that actually pays
Like my dad had
You know my father, the bartender
Used to wear a suit to work
Before he hit the drink,
The old man used to do a lot of things
One of these days I'll give up
And give in to the man
I stretched over to reach you
I tried to meet you
I've been wrong
Now the fireworks in me are all gone
It's time you realized
My girl you make all the smart moves
And you see through all my wrongs
When the fireworks in me are all wrong
Well then I realized
And I don't need convincing
I've seen enough to want to try and change things
You fell in love I fell in line
I thought I'd found my place
Before I knew how much it cost to play it safe
Have I let you-I'll never let you down
I work all day and I wanna fight
When it feels right and it's wrong
When the fireworks in me are all gone
Well then I realized
And I won't need convincing
I've seen enough to want to try and change things
You fell in love I fell in line
I thought I'd found my place
Before I knew how much it cost to play it safe
Could I leave you? I'll never let you down
I belong with your arms wrapped around my neck
Your lips glistening in the light
I've seen headlights passing by
Hold the thought
I hold the thought
Walking back towards your house
Rain drops bouncing off the leaves
Down to our September kiss
Flying over bus stops and playgrounds
I'm here soaked right to the core
I'll stay here forever
I'm safe with you
If all the words I ever wrote
On the back of envelopes
I could fold into paper planes
I could fly them through your veins
Helicopters overhead
Wide awake at 3am
Now the ink runs to your heart
And you know just how I feel
Flying over bus stops and playgrounds
I'm here soaked right to the core
I'll stay here forever
I'm safe with you
Flying over bus stops and playgrounds
I'm here soaked right to the core
I'll stay here forever
I'm safe with you
And it's gotta be here...
And it's gotta be here...
And it's gotta be here...
And it's gotta be here...
And it's gotta be here...
And it's gotta be here...
And it's gotta be here...
And it's gotta be here...
And it's gotta be here...
You don't know me, but I know you.
In times of trouble, your words have helped pull me through.
Sun is in your vision, possibilities emerge from the dark.
Start off with just a spark and suddenly the room's ablaze with new ideas and sunny days.
Ah You, you got a beautiful reason.
Ah You, you got a beautiful reason.
Too many programs open at once.
A heart gets caught inside ones thoughts.
Tangled emotions between pause and rewind.
Try to find a way to make more time, but things are the way they are.
Ah You, you got a beautiful reason
Ah You, you got a beautiful reason.
Gonna try to get caught up in a momentary lapse- oh (repeat several times)
I opened my eyes
And watched the sunshine
It had been out all night
To relax and unwind
There will come a time gigantic
Waves will crush the junk that I have saved
When the moon explodes or floats away
I'll lose the souvenirs I made
La la la
I lay down on the grass
And let the insects do their thing
She covered me with wings and
Held my head and said 'poor thing'
There will come a time gigantic
Waves will crush the junk that I have saved
When the moon explodes or floats away
I'll lose the souvenirs I saved
La la la
Sure that star can twinkle
And you're watching it do
Boy so hard, boy so hard
But I know a girl twice as hard
And I'm sure, said I'm sure
She's watching it too
Said no matter what tie she's got
In her right dresser tied
I know she's watching that star
Going to twinkle
Gonna twinkle
Gonna twinkle
And last time I knew
She worked at an Abbey in Iona
And she said, "I killed a man, T.
I've got to stay hidden in this Abbey"
But I can see that star
When she twinkles
And she twinkles
'Cause I sure can
That means I sure can
That means I sure can
So hard
So hard
Blue light is flickering
Through the city streets
One billion tv sets
Glowing off concrete
One day closer to death
I know that I don't have too long
Whatever happened to Soy Bomb?
Lunch box collector loves
All the pussycats
But when he goes to bed
He wonders where he's at
Thrift store shirts and old haircuts
Living in an old sitcom
Whatever happened to Soy Bomb?
The day is coming
When you'll have to think of it
Was it really worth it
All that shit
Blue light is flickering
Though the cloudy sky
One billion lonely hearts
Beat until they die
One day closer to death
I know that I don't have too long
Whatever happened to Soy Bomb?
I know we'll make it
I know we'll make it through
One thing is for certain I'll BE HERE for you
Don't know you're thinking
Don't wasting what we do,
One thing is constant that I'll BE HERE for you
We all go through changes, run to different places,
That doesn't mean that we have to part
And when you feel like nobody's on your side
Please believe I'm never too far
Never too far
Never too far
Never too far
Never too far
Never too far
Never too far
Never too far
Never too far
I, I I will be here for you
I will be here for you
I, I I will be here for you
I will be here for you
Where do we sunshine, where the heavy rain
Who's on the pressure I had reason ...
We all go through changes, run to different places,
That doesn't mean that we have to part
And when you feel like nobody's on your side
Please believe I'm never too far
Never too far
Never too far
Never too far
Never too far
Never too far
Never too far
Never too far
Never too far
I, I I will be here for you
I will be here for you
I, I I will be here for you
I will be here for you
I will be here for YOU 
I, I I will be here for you
I will be here for YOU
I, I I will be here for you
I will be here for YOU
I'll BE HERE for you
I will be here for YOU
And when you cast away and you feel like home,
I'll try to find you
I'll try to catch you!
I, I I will be here for you
I will be here for you
I, I I will be here for you
I will be here for you
I, I I will be here for you
I will be here for you
I, I I will be here for you
I will be here for you
I will be here for you
Sinking through dark black holes
It's never going to end
Open gash in my ribcage
Is never going to mend
Take another picture off the wall
Sinking deeper every time I fall
Each day ends quicker
And my mind gets slower too
As my life just fades away
I wouldn't have a clue
Take another drawer out from the shelf
I'm too weak to do it by myself
Though you had the world at your feet
You could see it, I was blind
Had the perfect job called life
You didn't like it, you resigned
Brain's a square of grass
Growing on petrol and chlorine
With petrol and chlorine
You could see it, I was blind
Had the perfect job called life
You didn't like it, you resigned
With petrol and chlorine
You know just what I mean
With petrol and chlorine
You know just what I mean
If you didn't care what happened to me
And I didn't care for you
We would zig zag our way through the boredom and pain
Occasionally glancing up through the rain
Wondering which of the buggers to blame
And watching for pigs on the wing
Everyone, when she was young, 
They said she was the pretty one 
She's lovely now, just watch her as she goes 
Waiting for the birds to come 
She holds the hands of someone young 
Whose mother comes and she sees her and she smiles 
Thank you Louise 
Thank you Louise 
Mother of three 
Waiting in the check-out line 
The supermarket, Christmas time 
She eyes someone who doesn't have the change 
Takes a dollar from her purse 
She pays and doesn't say a word 
She winks and grins and 'Merry Christmas, friend!' 
Thank you Louise 
Thank you Louise 
Mother of three 
In Baltimore, the freezing cold, 
That chills her darling to the bone 
She leaves her work and quits her job
Her brother lay upon the bed 
With broken teeth and busted head 
He hears the phone and he knows his brother's dead 
Thank you Louise 
Thank you Louise 
Mother of two
I've seen the world, done it all
Had my cake now
Diamonds, brilliant
And Bel Air now
Hot summer nights, mid-July
When you and I were forever wild
The crazy days, city lights
The way you'd play with me like a child
Will you still love me
When I'm no longer young and beautiful?
Will you still love me
When I've got nothing but my achin' soul?
I know you will
I know you will
I know that you will
Will you still love me
When I'm no longer beautiful?
I've seen the world, lit it up
As my stage now
Channeling angels in
The new age now
Hot summer days, rock and roll
The way you'd play for me at your show
And all the ways I got to know
Your pretty face and electric soul
Will you still love me
When I'm no longer young and beautiful?
Will you still love me
When I've got nothing but my achin' soul?
I know you will
I know you will
I know that you will
Will you still love me
When I'm no longer beautiful?
Dear Lord, when I get to Heaven
Please let me bring my man
When he comes, tell me that you'll let him in
Father, tell me if you can
All that grace, all that body
All that face, makes me wanna party
He's my sun, he makes me shine
Like diamonds
Will you still love me
When I'm no longer young and beautiful?
Will you still love me
When I've got nothing but my achin' soul?
I know you will
I know you will
I know that you will
Will you still love me
When I'm no longer beautiful?
Will you still love me
When I'm no longer beautiful?
Will you still love me
When I'm not young and beautiful?
It was written that I would love you
From the moment I opened my eyes
And the morning when I first saw you
Gave me life under calico skies
I will hold you
For as long as you like
I'll hold you
For the rest of my life
Always looking for ways to love you
Never failing to fight at your side
While the angels of love protect us
From the innermost secrets we hide
I'll hold you
For as long as you like
I'll hold you
For the rest of my life
Long before us crazy soldiers
Who were born under calico skies
May we never be called to handle
All the weapons of war we despise
I'll hold you
For as long as you like
I'll hold you
For the rest of my life
I'll hold you
For as long as you like
I'll love you
For the rest of my, for the rest of my life
So quiet
It's neither heaven nor space, it's just high
And the ring around the moon
Looks like light and love
Neither of which I get enough of
Down there
Where alot of people lie, In a deep sleep
And months on end go by, in a single week
Down there
But much too slow
Can't you see I'm trying so hard to plug up this hole
The air is running out we're sinking much too low
And if you sit long enough
You can hear ghost trains
As if the city speed
Is just in our brains
And coke's close as we get to sugar cane
Down there
But much too slow
Can't you see I'm trying so hard to plug up this hole,
The air is running out we're sinking much too low
So quiet, So quiet
It's neither heaven nor space, It's just high
And the ring around the moon
Looks like light and love
Neither of which I get enough of
Neither of which I get enough of
When you wake up
Turn your radio on
And you'll hear this simple song
That I made up
That I made up for you
When you're driving
Turn your radio up
'Cause I can't sing loud enough
All these days
To get my message through
If time is all I had
I'd waste it all on you
Each day I'll turn it back
It's what the broken hearted-do
I'm tired of talking to an empty space
Of silences keeping me awake
When you marry and you look around
I'll be somewhere in that crowd
Torn up that it isn't me
When we're older and the memories fade
I know I'll still feel the same, yeah
For as long as I live
And if time is all I had
I'd waste it all on you
Each day I'll turn it back
It's what the broken hearted-do
I'm tired of talking to an empty space
Of silences keeping me awake
Won't you say my name one time
Please, just say my name
And if time is all I had
I'd waste it all on you
Each day I'll turn it back
It's what the broken hearted-do
I'm tired of talking to an empty space
Of silences keeping me awake
If time is all I had
I'd waste it all on you
Each day I'll turn it back
It's what the broken hearted-do
I'm tired of talking to an empty space
Of silences keeping me awake
Won't you say my name
When the song is over?
No hostage has been held like I've
Been holding mine but I'm just fine
Since I've been without you
No prisoner could climb the walls
That I've built up in my mind
Since I've been without you
But I'm holding down and out
I'm desperate without you
Look at the shape I'm in
Talking to the walls again
Just look at the state I'm in
Bent and broken is all I've been
No universal truth this time
No other universe but mine
Could ever feel as unaligned
Since I've been without you
No instances from time to time
Feel like things will turn out right
Since I've been without you
But I'm holding down and out
I'm desperate without you
Look at the shape I'm in
Talking to the walls again
Just look at the state I'm in
Bent and broken is all I've been
No universal truth this time
There's no universe for you and I
There's no one to make me realize
Look at the shape I'm in
Talking to the walls again
Just look at the state I'm in
Bent and broken is all I've been
Look at the shape I'm in
Talking to the walls again
Just look at the state I'm in
Bent and broken is all I've been
No universal truth this time
Look at the shape I'm in
Talking to the walls again
Look at the state I'm in
Bent and broken is all I've been
No universal truth this time
You've come a long way from the runny-nosed and scruffy kid I knew
You had such good ways
I can remember the little things that always made you smile
They made you happy
Now you think you're wiser because you're older
And you think
That money buys everything
And you think
That you need no one to guide you
But you're still a long way from home.
You've come a long way, you're self-assured and dressed in funny clothes
But you don't know me.
I hope you find what you are looking for
With your car and your handmade overcoats
But your wealth will never make you stronger
'Cause you're still a long way from home
Yeah, you're still a long way from home
I'm going to miss the way I missed you
But I'm okay if you're okay
I've been lonely when I'm with you
But now I'm lonely all the same
If you need to find yourself
In the arms of someone else
I wish you on your way
But my love
I've never been too good a change
I've never been too good a change
I'm gonna miss the way I kissed you
But I'll be brave if you'll be brave
And this is only the beginning
Although it feels just like the end
If you need to take some time
I'd surrender all of mine
I wouldn't make you stay
But my love
I've never been too good a change
I've never been too good a change
I've never been too good a change
I've never been too good a change
I've never been too good a change
I've never been too good a change
I've never been too good a change
I've never been too good a change
Close comes the winter, summer is no longer
And things, they seem much bleaker
We'll see a Catherine Deneuve double feature
And our lives will fade as in darkness we will bathe
Close comes the winter, summer is no longer
And things, they seem much bleaker
We'll see a Catherine Deneuve double feature
(Double feature, you will survive last forever so rest your eyes)
And our lives will fade as in darkness we will bathe
(Play with words when we cannot sing, this bouble feature means everything)
(Double feature, you will survive last forever so rest your eyes)
And our lives will fade as in darkness we will bathe

Tonight I won't say tonight it's ok
Always had a feeling it would pass
Never ever thought it'd be this way
Still I keep in mind that snow is safe
Safer than it was two years ago
Tonight I won't say tonight it's ok
Always had a feeling it would pass
Never ever thought it'd be this way
Still I keep in mind that snow is safe
Safer than it was
Always had a choice but I cannot be mislead like that
Tonight I won't say tonight it's ok
Thank you, forever,
For the things you've done.
Nothing could be better
Than to say it.
Thank you, forever,
For the things we are.
Nothing is so easy
As they say it is.
So thank you, my brother,
For the things you've done,
Knowing you'll never walk away
Like I did, you know.
Thank you, forever,
For the things we are.
No one can see inside of me
Like you do.
Thank you for the hours
In the orange sky.
Brother, you will always be
A part of me.
And thank you for the courage
When I go too far,
Knowing you'll never walk away
Like I did, you know.
Thank you, forever,
For the things we are.
No one can see inside of me
Like you do.
So thank you for the hours
In the orange sky.
Brother, you will always be
A part of me.
And thank you for the courage
When I go too far,
Knowing you'll never walk away
Like I did, you know.
Went from cities to touch the suburbs
On the highway, but I'm barefoot
I need a map but not the destination
Need a compass but not a conversation
I want to run far from this grey town
You're on every street, marked on the ground
Not the meant and not the paint
Want the price but not the raise
I want the jump but not the height
Let me fall but catch me mid flight
I swam with sharks and beasts of the sea
Only went down for the company
Went down for the company
I forgot to mention:
That you would come back home when I call
Left no sign, nothing at all
Sorry you won't fit inside my heart
I wanted love without the build up
I need the rules but not the regulations
Want the wisdom but not the information
Need the light but not the heat of the day
Need your hands to show me how to pray
I lost the plot underneath the fire
Of all the dots and lines that took me higher
Away from traffic and smiles of tire
I like the nights but not the tangled wires
Need the pulse to feel alive
All the world's just made it seem all quiet
This has all become far too loud
I like you more when you don't make a sound
You will come back home when I call
Left no sign, nothing at all
Sorry you won't fit inside my heart
Won't you come light the way and wash this away
I wanted love without the build up
Ah, I have swum those raging seas
Washed up by an ocean who had tired of me
How I survived I will never know
This wreck's got a home and a whole lot of hope
I'm out on a beach, sat on a rock
Thinking of you and the love I got
Saw the devil's servant, sent her home
Said bring me your master, I don't want his dog
I'm on fire, I'm full of love and new desire
I'm on fire, I'm full of love and new desire
Full of love and new desire
I lit my fire blew my conch, nobody comes
I built my boat from bamboo but it sunk
I looked at the sky for vapor trails nobody comes
I wrote your name on a tree along with the days
This is taking you away from me
I'm out on a beach, eating my heart
Thinking of you and the love I got
Saw the devil's servant, sent her home
Said bring me your master, I don't want his dog
I'm on fire, I'm full of love and new desire
I'm on fire (I need somebody like you), I ain't afraid to die
I ain't afraid to die, I ain't afraid to die
I'm out on a beach, eating my heart
Thinking of you and the love I got
Saw the devil's servant, sent her home
Said bring me your master, I don't want his dog
I'm out on a beach, sat on a rock
Thinking of you and the love I got
Saw the devil's servant, sent her home
Said bring me your master, I don't want his dog
I'm out on a beach, sat on a rock
Thinking of you and the love I got (I need somebody like you)
Saw the devil's servant, sent her home
Said bring me your master, I don't want his dog
I lit my fire, saw my coach (I'm full of love)
Thinking of you and the love I got
Saw the devil's servant, sent her home (and new desire)
Said bring me your master, I don't want his dog
I'm out on a beach, sat on a rock (I'm full of love)
Thinking of you and the love I got
Saw the devil's servant, sent her home (and new desire)
Said bring me your master, I don't want his dog
I love you one, a two, a three shoobeedoo.
I love you four, that's more then I can afford
And I can tell someday that I'm gonna say the truth.
I love you 5
I've been walkin' around tryin' to figure out
Why I've been feelin' all these feelings that I'm feeling now
And I've got more on my mind then I have on my plate.
I love you one, a two, a three shoobeedoo.
I love you four, that's more then I can afford
And I can tell someday that I'm gonna say the truth.
I love five times more then any boy from before,
Because all they cared about was whether you put out.
And I truly believe,
That this love could be
And I can count five times off the top off my head where I sucked it in
'Cause you were hangin' with him and I got something to say, I love you all the same
I love you one, a two, a three shoobeedoo.
I love you four, that's more then I can afford
And I can tell someday I'm gonna say the truth.
I love you one, a two, a three shoobeedoo.
I love you four, that's more then I can afford
And I can tell someday I'm gonna say the truth.
I love you 5
I love you 5
I love you 5
Winter comes and snow
I can't marry you, you know
Without children to grow
I can't marry you, you know
Love me the way I love you
Love me the way I love you
Take a year in your hands
You can find another man
Let your unloved parts get loved
I will be your man
Love me the way I love you
Love me the way I love you
Places you should be afraid
Into the river we will wade
Love me the way I love you
Love me the way I love you
Instrumental
You were going on.
Are you still with me. 
You were going on. 
When you tumbled down. 
Things kept coming close. 
So close. 
You can shut your eyes. 
Will you remember. 
So close. 
Will you remember. 
Me.
Battered and torn
Still I can see the light
Tattered and worn
But I must kneel to fight
Friend of mine
What can't you spare
I know some times
It gets cold in there
When my legs no longer carry
And the warm wind chills my bones
I reach for Mother Mary
And I shall not walk alone
Hope is alive
While we're apart
Only tears
Speak from my heart
Break the chains
That hold us down
And we shall be
Forever bound
When I'm tired and weary
And a long way from home
I reach for Mother Mary
And I shall not walk alone
Beauty that
We left behind
How shall we
Tomorrow find
Set aside
Our weight in sin
So that we
Can live again
When my legs no longer carry
And the warm wind chills my bones
I reach for Mother Mary
And I shall not walk alone
Don't you know I love you more than life itself
Don't you know that you're my pride
And I would not have you walking through this world
Without me by your side
Go to sleep my little man
Don't you weep my little man
I'd like to keep you with me all your life
But I know I can't do that
So I must try teaching you the wrong from right
To keep the vultures from your back
Go to sleep my little man
Don't you weep my little man
And when you're dreaming
You can talk to angels
So wipe the tears from your eyes
And if there's demons
That try to steal your breath away
You can't believe them
Know my spirit will be standing by your side
You saved me
You gave me
The greatest gift of all
Believe me
Believe me
There ain't no mountain that's too tall
I will gladly carry your cross for you
To take your pain away
But what I can't carry is my love for you
Beyond my dying day
So be strong my little man
When I'm gone my little man
You got to be my little man
So don't you weep my little man
Go to sleep my little man
Don't you weep my little man
You got to be my little man
So don't you weep my little man
My Eveline
Say you'll be mine
Won't you come and let me whisper in your ear
Way down yonder in the old corn field
For you I pine
Sweeter than the honey
To the honey bee
I love you say you love me
Meet me in the shade
Of the old apple tree
Eva-Iva-Ova-Avaline
I already caused, apparently normal
When you smiled and slowed
But I have work to carry (so to speak)
I rarely ever hold a job, I never finish my work
I'm an affable bomb in this swamp
When hiding is organized, pose, both mellow jerk
You were like an angel
When I first met you
Made me feel so good inside
Showed me what I can do
It was all so beautiful then
We were as one
But now I feel, baby
Like something's gone
Why don't I love you like I used to do
Oh, baby
Baby
It's been so long now
Between you and me
I thought I wanted to be part of you
Now I want to be free
Why don't you love me like I want you to
Oh, baby
Oh, baby
A cab combs the snake tryin'
To rake in that last night's fare
And a solitary sailor
Who spends the facts of his life like small change on strangers
Paws his inside Pea coat pocket for a welcome twenty-five cents
And the last bent butt from a package of Kents
As he dreams of a waitress with Maxwell House eyes
And marmalade thighs with scrambled yellow hair
Her rhinestone-studded moniker says, "Irene"
As she wipes the wisps of dishwater blonde from her eyes
And the Texaco beacon burns on
The steel-belted attendant with a 'Ring and Valve Special'
Cryin' "Fill'er up and check that oil"
"You know it could be the distributor and it could be your coil."
The early mornin' final edition's on the stands
And the town cryer's cryin' there with nickels in his hands
Pigs in a blanket, sixty-nine cents
Eggs-roll 'em over and a package of Kents
Adam and Eve on a log, you can sink 'em damn straight
Hash browns, hash browns, you know I can't be late
And the early dawn cracks out a carpet of diamonds
Across a cash crop car lot filled with twilight Coupe DeVilles
Leaving the town in a-keeping
Of the one who is sweeping
Up the ghosts of Saturday night
I've known mornings white as diamonds
Silent from a night so cold
Such a stillness; calm as the owl glides
Our lives are buried in snow
I was sifting through the piles
In my hand a tangled thread
Each patient tug upon the snarl
Is a glimpse of what has been
Burdened bands gain strong hands
Gaping holes where diamonds should be
Must have been morning that stole them
A glint of white in the pocket of winter
Some hearts are ghosts
Settling down in dark waters
Just as silt grows heavy
And drowns with the stones
I've known mornings white as diamonds
Silent from a night so cold
Such a stillness; calm as the owl glides
Our lives are buried in snow
It seems it's been such a long time
Since I've been asking for
What did you say? Was this your downtime?
Or can I trace it to go home?
It's been, it's been such a long time
There's no words for this, I see
My time has come and you will rescue me
Some new place I said, not this place I've been
He's a gambler, spinning wheels
A poison victim, look of steel
The coldest heart you've ever felt
The coldest hands you've ever held
Take him down, all his way
A million miles, still no headway
Has his love truly blown?
In his mind I'm proud to roam
He's elusive and I'm awake
Defiantly real, there's nothing fake
A mystery now to me and you
Open my eyes and I'm next to you
He says my destiny
Lies in the hands that set me free
A reckless night, he hears me breathe
Cursing the skies of this company
You've lost the wisdom deep inside
His bitterness shows it's side
If it's true I'll doom
What more is there to hold onto?
Strength of head is all I own
If to me this sorry's whole
He's elusive and I'm awake
Defiantly real, there's nothing fake
A mystery now to me and you
Open my eyes and I'm next to you
He says my destiny
Lies in the hands that set me free
Ooh ooh, oh oh, oh oh oh
Ooh ooh, oh oh, oh oh oh
Ooh ooh, oh oh, oh oh oh
Ooh ooh, oh oh, oh oh oh
(That set me free)
He's elusive and I'm awake
Defiantly real, there's nothing fake
A mystery now to me and you
Open my eyes and I'm next to you
He says my destiny
Lies in the hands that set me, that set me free
Ooh
Mystery now to me and you
Open my eyes and I'm next to you
He says my destiny
Lies in the hands that set me
Lies in the hands that set me free
We roll in every summer when there's strength in our numbers
And your breath's hot and gross, but I kiss you like a lover
Like stick to the seats of the cars of mongerito
I forget the mallets from the lessons that I went to
And Jamie picks fights but the weekend's short lived
Because no one can be bothered when it's humid like this
And we roll in every summer like it's shameful to be underneath
The ceiling or a roof truck, come out and steal our thunder
Now the days are getting colder and the burning of our limbs
Doesn't happen quite as bad and the burnings dry skin
Deep in the fantasies and dreams of the wits
To like the movies that we watch to pretend it wasn't winter
And everywhere we go, I can feel the subtle taste
Of the D-talk groan and the locker room where we stayed
And you're no better at swimming than you were in the beginning
But you come over at night and we practice all the breathing
Go all the way, have your fun, have it all
This will take you down
Get through the days, do your thing, do it well
This will take you down
Go all the way, have your fun, have it all
This will take you down
Get through the days, do your thing, do it well
This will take you down
I'll pull the trick if I want to
I'll pull the trick and it comes true
I'm chewing gum and it's killing me
We're getting dead and it's the right way to do it
I see you happy in the front seat
I see you with all of your front teeth
You're allergic but you never said
We're getting dead and it's the right way
Go all the way, have your fun, have it all
This will take you down
Get through the days, do your thing, do it well
This will take you down
Go all the way, have your fun, have it all
This will take you down
Get through the days, do your thing, do it well
This will take you down
Whatever it is you think you are,
You aren't.
A good friend, unique, well-read, good-looking or smart.
Well, now you know.
Well I hate to be the one to bear such bad news.
I know it hurts to hear but it's true.
You don't mean anything to anyone but me,
And even I think that you're blinded by conceit.
So now you know.
Free beer and basement shows
Don't mean you've made it.
It's what you do
Not who you were
Or what you wear
Or where you've been,
So do something.
Whoever you think is watching you dance
From across the room,
They aren't.
If anything, they feel sorry for you
'Cause you try so hard.
I know it hurts to hear,
But it's the truth so you might as well hear it
From a friend.
You're a has-been
That never was.
I know it's mean to say
But it's something I've been meaning to say to you
For a while.
You're a has-been
That never was,
Or will be.
Hunted down, I came upon
A place of ferns and grass
Gathered to a redbud tree
And now their footsteps pass
Where I crouch in dread
Discovery my certain death
Her leaves reaching for my head
As I suspend my breath
Redbud tree, shelter me, shelter me
Redbud tree, shelter me, shelter me
Those days of fear are gone
Yet I am pledged to her
As to my only one
My lovely protector
Redbud tree, shelter me, shelter me
Redbud tree, shelter me, shelter me
Redbud tree, shelter me, shelter me
Redbud tree, shelter me, shelter me
Instrumental
Fever I know you've come to take my love
Go away
Fever I know your face just like a dove
Fly away
Fever turn the lights out
Take a different road
Let us be
Fever I know you've come to take my love
Go away
Fever I know in god I shouldn't trust
He's so far away
Fever turn the lights out
Take a different road
Let us be
Fever take a different route
Travel a different road
Let us be
Fever I know you've come to take my love
Go away fly away go away
Instrumental

Oh my one, I'm so happy
That you've got so far
I know the good, the great
Is working you like a charm
Oh my one, rushing away
With a bag full of bones
I know the place you left
Still won't leave you alone
The crow, the cat, the bird and the bee
I'm sure they would agree
That my one is falling for tricks
Smoke and mirrors playing your wit
A hue and cry waiting to blow
Under your skin, wherever you go
Still I wish that I knew
The taste of something that good
They never tell you truth is subjective
They only tell you not to lie
They never tell you there's strength in vulnerability
They only tell you not to cry
But I've been living underground,
Sleeping on the way
And finding something else to say,
Is like walking on the freeway
They never tell you you don't need to be ashamed
They only tell you to deny
So is it true that only good girls go to heaven?
They only sell you what you buy
And I've been living underground,
Sleeping on the way
And finding something else to say,
Is like walking on the freeway
I've been living underground,
Trying not to burn
And finding something else to learn,
At Hollywood and Western
I want to weave a musical spell
That leaves you unwell and thinking of me everyday
I want to play you a tune that leaves you marooned and troubled
Each time I'm away
Is there a melody - that could lead you to me - like a lullabied child lead to sleep?
So for one moment in time, you'd find that you're mine
And softly I'd kiss you and weep
I want to write a simple song that's so frequently sung
That you call me to have the thing banned
Who's charm so endears that whole nations cheer and sigh
When you take my hand
Is there a melody - that could lead you to me - like a lullabied child lead to sleep?
So for one moment in time you'd find that you're mine
And softly I'd kiss you and weep
'Cause I'm a gambler that just wants to lose and be allowed to leave
I'm a traveller - with one last mile my journey is complete
I'm like a swallow that wants one long last look, before flying east
Last on my list - and then I quit - to kiss your lips and weep
I want to play a silver note that fills you with hope
And tames you to feed from my hand
A turquoise chord that invites you to soar
And fly... to a faraway land
A symphony that gently leads you to sit and be still with me
And grief doesn't frighten me
As its worst it delights me
'Cause I want to kiss you and weep
For I'm a gambler that just wants to lose and be allowed to leave
I'm a traveler - with one last mile my journey is complete
I'm like a swallow that wants one long last look before flying east
Last on my list - and then I quit - to kiss your lips and weep
Is there a melody - that could lead you to me - like a lullubied child to sleep?
So for one moment in time you'd find that you're mine
And softly I'd kiss you and weep
So for one moment in time you'd find that you're mine
And softly I'd kiss you and weep
Butterflies
Gravity pulls me into
Anticipate our first touch
Sweet and so new
Let's figure out how to make this forever
Oh this is making me crazy
Hey love I am at the point of no restraint
Let's just make a move and feel the earth quake
It's just you and me
And no one else
It's just you and me
You and me
Slowly now
We shouldn't let this go too fast
Bring me out of this shell
Take off my mask
This is us intertwined and on fire
I cannot stop
I'm consumed with desire
Te ver e não te querer
É improvável, é impossível
Te ter e ter que esquecer
É insuportável, é dor incrível
É como mergulhar num rio e não se molhar
É como não morrer de frio no gelo polar
É ter o estômago vazio e não almoçar
É ver o céu se abrir no estilo e não se animar
Te ver e não te querer
É improvável, é impossível
Te ter e ter que esquecer
É insuportável, é dor incrível
É como esperar o prato e não salivar
Sentir apertar o sapato e não descalçar
É ver alguém feliz de fato sem alguém pra amar
É como procurar no mato estrela do mar
Te ver e não te querer
É improvável, é impossível
Te ter e ter que esquecer
É insuportável, é dor incrível
É como não sentir calor em Cuiabá
Ou como ir ao Arpoador não ver o mar
É como não morrer de raiva com a política
Ignorar que a tarde vai vadia e mítica
É como ver televisão e não dormir
Ver um bichano pelo chão e não sorrir
É como não provar o nectar de um lindo amor
Depois que o coração detecta a mais fina flor
Te ver e não te querer
É improvável, é impossível
Te ter e ter que esquecer
É insuportável, é dor incrível
And I called you back to a place beside me
And I called you back to a place beside me
Love found us easily
And if that's all we have you will find we need nothing more
And I called you back to a place beside me
And I called you back to a place beside me
And every time we kiss
We find ourselves in love again
And the older that we get
We know that nothing else for us is possible
And I called you back to a place beside me
And I called you back to a place beside me
Mm, when I was quiet
Well, I heard your voice in everything
And I called you back to a place beside me
And I called you back to a place beside me
And I called you back to a place beside me
If you let your feelings go, dear
It's scary what you'll find
I find I'm on your street, dear
And you're always on my mind
And no one needs to know
That you let me in tonight
That you let me see the world
Behind your eyes
Behind your eyes
I want to see us work, dear
To reach the other side
Our treachery is love, dear
We're on both ends of the fight
We're fighting for ourselves
We're fighting for our lives
Won't you let me see the world
Behind your eyes
Behind your eyes
Behind your eyes
And no one needs to know
How scared we are tonight
Won't you let me see the world 
Won't you let me see the world 
Behind your eyes
Won't you let me see the world 
Behind your eyes
Behind your eyes
Oh misty eye of the mountain below
Keep careful watch of my brothers' souls
And should the sky be filled with fire and smoke
Keep watching over Durin's sons
If this is to end in fire then we shall all burn together
Watch the flames climb high into the night
Calling out father oh, stand by and we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountainside
And if we should die tonight, we should all die together
Raise a glass of wine for the last time
Calling out father oh, prepare as we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountainside
Desolation comes upon the sky
Now I see fire
Inside the mountain, I see fire
Burning the trees
And I see fire
Hollowing soul
I see fire
Blood in the breeze
And I hope that you remember me
Oh should my people fall then surely I'll do the same
Confined in mountain halls, we got too close to the flame
Calling out father oh, hold fast and we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountainside
Desolation comes upon the sky
Now I see fire
Inside the mountain
I see fire
Burning the trees
And I see fire
Hollowing soul
I see fire
Blood in the breeze
And I hope that you remember me
And if the night is burning I will cover my eyes
For if the dark returns then my brothers will die
And as this sky is falling down, it crashed into this lonely town
And with that shadow upon the ground I hear my people screaming out
And I see fire
Inside the mountains
I see fire
Burning the trees
I see fire
Hollowing souls
I see fire
Blood in the breeze
I see fire
Oh you know I saw a city burning (Fire)
And I see fire
Feel the heat upon my skin (Fire)
And I see fire
Oh (Fire)
And I see fire burn auburn on the mountainside
Stuck to a growing black balloon
My neighbors are slowly glowing maroon
Don't throw away my broken telescopes
Who has dragged you away? Who's that carrying the rope?
Stuck to a growing black balloon
My neighbors are slowly glowing maroon
Don't throw away my broken telescopes
Who has dragged you away? Who's that carrying the rope?
We were giving up time
We were giving on back on all that's left to do
Sometimes you'll have to do
Sometimes there's nothing left to say
We were giving up time
We were giving up ties and everyone knew it too
Rope busted and disgusted
And all we knew we cared
But it always, comes back to this
Yes it always, comes back to this again
We were kicking around
We were broken up bound and everything fell to fear
Sometimes you can relate
Sometimes there's nothing left to say
We were giving up time
We were giving up ties and everyone knew it too
Tongue tied and divided
The wounds just couldn't be found
It always, comes back to this
Yes it always
Six feet below, a world flooded free
How should I know, so far from me
(i) Could try for more, I could settle up for less
I'm not keeping score, (i) don't expect you to confess
One side is made, the other side too soon
I flip a coin, there's more sides than two
Trouble ahead, but there's just no going back
I pray for rain, while the water's rising fast
And it always
Oh it always, comes back to this
You know what you are to me
Don't make me say it over and over again
It's way too late
Or much too early
You know how I get
When I'm left alone to my vices
Like the grown-ups did when I was a kid
I said: I'm a bird in your hand so take me as I am
You know what you are to me
Don't make me say it over and over again
My left hand, a part of me
It stays late to clean up my mess
When I'm sick of all my choices
Like the grown-ups I grew up with
Angels and addicts
When I put my arms around you
I mean it
When I'm too drunk to stay up with you
I mean it
When I slam doors 'cause I'm pissed at you
I mean it
When I put on a suit and say "I do"
I mean it
You know what you are to me
Don't make me say it over and over again
Over and over again (12x)

I was flying into Chicago at night 
Watching the lake turn the sky into blue-green smoke 
The sun was setting to the left of the plane 
And the cabin was filled with an unearthly glow 
In 27D, I was behind the wing 
Watching landscape roll out 
Like credits on a screen
The earth looked like it was lit from within 
Like a poorly assembled electrical ball
As we moved out of the farmlands, into the grid 
The plan of a city was all that you saw 
And all of these people sitting totally still 
As the ground raced beneath them thirty thousand feet down 
It took an hour
Maybe a day 
But once I really listened
The noise just went away 
And I was pretending that I was in a Galaxie 500 video 
The stewardess came back and checked on my drink 
In the last strings of sunlight, a Brigitte Bardot
'Cause I had on my headphones 
Along with those eyes
That you get when your circumstance is movie-size 
It took an hour
Maybe a day 
But once I really listened
The noise just went away 
It took an hour
Maybe a day 
But once I really listened
The noise just went away
But once I really listened
The noise just fell away
I thought I'd found a reason to live
Just like before when I was a child
Only to find dreams made of sand
Would just fall apart and slip through my hands
But the spirit of life keeps us strong
And the spirit of life is the will to carry on
Adversity
What have I done to you
To cause this reclusive silence
That has come between me and you?
And the spirit of life remains in light
And the spirit of life remains inside, inside
I never thought it would be quite like this
Living outside of mutual bliss
But as long as the veins in our arm still stand up
The spirit of life will keep living on

I'm trolling food court for girls 
Yeah, it's the best job in the world 
They know they're safe with me 
They love my little mustache 
They love a man in uniform 
Ooh 
With my sunglasses they can't 
See what I'm really looking at 
And as they're walking by 
I whisper through my doughnut 
Hey baby, baby light that ass on fire 
Yeah
How long must this day go on? 
I got to stand here two more hours till I 
Punch the clock 
All alone in this great big mall 
Ooh  
No kid, they don't give me a gun 
I don't get paid enough to run 
So you can call me what you want 
I'll be hanging at the check out 
Checking out your girlfriend 
Figure out how she's going to fit all of that 
Butt into that underwear - yeah 
Yeah 
Hey girl if you can't recall 
Where you parked your daddy's car 
Then I could help you out 
All alone in this great big mall 
Oh 
How long must this day go on? 
I got to stand here two more hours 
Till it's Miller Time 
All alone in this great big mall 
Whoa  
I'm trolling food court for girls 
I whisper through my doughnut 
I whisper through my doughnut 
I whisper through my doughnut 
Hey baby baby, hey baby baby baby 
Light that 
Light that ass on fire 
Alright, that's good
Spider and I
Sit watching the sky
On our world without sound
We knit a web
To catch one tiny fly
For our world without sound
We sleep in the mornings
We dream of a ship that sails away
A thousand miles away
We sleep in the mornings
We dream of a ship that sails away
A thousand miles away
It wasn't really sad the way they said good-bye 
Or maybe it just hurt so bad she couldn't cry 
He packed his things, walked out the door and drove away 
And she became the girl from yesterday 
He took a plane across the sea 
To some foreign land 
She stayed at home and tried so hard to understand 
How someone who had been so close could be so far away 
And she became the girl from yesterday 
She doesn't know what's right 
She doesn't know what's wrong 
She only knows the pain that comes from waiting for so long 
And she doesn't count the teardrops 
That she's cried while he's away 
Because she knows deep in her heart 
That he'll be back someday 
The light's on in the window; she's waiting by the phone 
Talking to a memory that's never coming home 
She dreams of his returning and the things that he might say 
But she'll always be the girl from yesterday 
Yeah, she'll always be the girl from yesterday
My heart is a flower
That blooms every hour
I believe in the power
Of love
Well in this lonesome meadow
Well it's soft as a pillow
Oh I pray that we'll go back
To Love
I'm going to reach on up over that fear
I'm never alone won't you please be near
I know that darkness before the dawn
Tomorrow's coming and yesterday's gone
I'm going to get my baby,
Get up stream
Fall asleep in her arms
And drift away in a dream
Gonna go out walking in the morning light
Well I know that my tomorrow's gonna be alright
Gonna be alright
Well I never shall wither
Well of course I, I forgive her
Oh please Lord deliver me
To love
I'm going to reach on up over that fear
I'm never alone won't you please be near
I know that darkness before the dawn
Tomorrow's coming and yesterday's gone
I'm going to get my baby,
Get up stream
Fall asleep in her arms
And drift away in a dream
Gonna go out walking in the morning light
Well I know that my tomorrow's gonna be alright
Gonna be alright
Gonna be alright
Gonna be alright
Yeah
My heart is a flower
That blooms every hour
I believe in the power
I believe in the power
Of love, love... of love
I wish I'd seen you as a little girl
Without your armor to fend off the world
I would have kept you underneath my wing
I would protect you from everything
Make way for the lemon parade
Make way for my girl
Make way for the lemon parade
Make way for my girl
Did the boys all tease you
When they had the chance
Always left standing
When it came time to dance
Did you hide behind your books girl
Did you find your secret friends
Always I'll want you
Always till the end
Make way for the lemon parade
Make way for my girl
Make way for the lemon parade
Make way for my girl
Make way for the lemon parade
Make way for my girl
Make way for the lemon parade
Make way for my girl
Make way for my girl
Spend your nights here
We'll always be up late
Keep eachother on
Chemicals can make us stay
I meant you're outta line
With your friends and all your jokes
Moving out tonight
Making phones that hard to hold
-
And you really didn't know
And you really didn't know
-
Spend your days here
And never give up now
You keep the children down
You're down for one more hour
Imagine I would feel
If your friends were all your dates
I'm moving out with her
Do your shake, you'll be ok
-
And if you really didn't know
I swear I really didn't know
So I'm sorry, so sorry
I'm sorry, oh no
And I'm sorry, so sorry
I'm sorry
-
Spend your nights here
We'll always be up late
Keep eachother up
Chemicals can make us stay
I meant you're outta line
With your friends and all your jokes
Moving out tonight
Making phones that hard to hold
-
And if you really didn't know
I swear I really didn't know
So I'm sorry, so sorry
I'm sorry, oh no
And I'm sorry, so sorry
I'm sorry
Well the songs you sung spiraled
And hung 'round like echoes
Or ripples on a pond
So you circled the globe
Spent a year on the road
Without ever going home
More than a couple of days,
Then you'd leave right away
Run to a girl you barely know
But you like how she sings
And you can't help but think
That there's something that she knows and could teach you
While you're sleeping in that southern state
Where the bars are filled with people
You can't hate
But try as you try
You still can't relate to them
And you drink that whiskey down
As they ask you, "Are you who you say you are?"
Are you who you say that you are?
Are you who you say that you are, you
Are you who you say that you are?
Are you who you say you are?
The fact that you can't tell
Makes us like you even more
So now you're trying again
Or just visiting friends
One that just had his heart broke
For the first time in his life
He realized there are times
When you can't make it alone
But now you're giving advice
As if you had the right
To use a word like "love"
No no, it's a negotiable term
What gets said's not what's heard
So it's different then for everyone
But you been hanging 'round
That college town
With your new life your new lover you've found
And you're keeping her up at night
Bringing her down
She'll watch you drink yourself to death
But won't ask you, "is this really what you want?"
Is this really what you want?
Is this really what you is this what...
Is this really what you want?
Is this really what you want?
Are you just sticking with it now because it's all you've got?
Are you just sticking with it now because it's all you've got?
Yeah that's it, I think you're sticking with me now
Because I'm all you've got
Because that's all you've got
It's getting late
I think my time is running out
No-one special
Nothing lasting within inside
How should I stay calm
When panic lies just ahead
Everyone can see my youth
Hanging by a thread
No subtle men
Came to my town
No subtle men
Begging for my hand
I'm one of few who's left
When everyone has gone
The train is leaving
And it's too late to get on
So much for running
When no-one stays to wait
For another broken promise
To slip my mind by mistake
Who would take my word
On anything these days
I failed so many times
Saying I'm gonna change
No subtle men
Came to my town
No subtle men
No lifelong friend
Lives in my town
No subtle men
Begging for my hand
She homed with thieves
Kicked up dirty leaves
She was a maniac
No one's heart attack
She got around
Slept on the bad side of town
She was cooler than you
Way cooler than me
She was true
All blinded and bruised
She didn't give a fuck
No she had given up
She was alive
She was caught on fire
She was everything
She was all of this
She opened up and laid it all right there
She said, "i don't mind, no, no I don't care
I'll help you shovel out my shallow hole
And I know I know they're threatening
But at least we're not the ones carrying
Such heavy heavy heavy stoning stones
And yeah I know they'll get you down
They'll do you in and they'll drag it out
'Cause me and you, we are one of a kind"
She liked to lose
Never wore Sunday shoes
She found her luck in wells and corner stores and jails
She was crazy
A downtown kind of baby
Always dangerous, she got me down on my knees
She made it rain
She called the wind and then it came
Oh with the wave of her hand
She brought the sunshine right in
She was the sky
Beyond steeple and the choir
Oh, the preacher's amen
His hallelujah child
She opened up and laid it all right there
She said, "i don't mind
No, no I don't care
I'll help you shovel out my shallow hole
And I know I know they are threatening
But at least we're not the ones carrying
Such heavy heavy heavy stoning stones
So when your bones are broke and you're all alone
And the fog's so thick you can't see up close
Just know that I will end up strangled too
And when the floods they come all rushing in
And the boat is full and you can't get in
Oh, it's okay if you don't want to swim
And when you're swallowed up, oh, don't you cry
Just give right in, don't try to fight
'Cause baby I wouldn't pay no mind
There's nothing you can do"
They'll have you coughing up your colors
They'll have you coughing up your colors
She sang the blues
Out of time and out of tune
Spoke no silver spoon
Only simple truths
She was a friend, stabbed backs and broke plans
She would give you her coat
Or put nails through her hand
She was wise, full of magic and life
Oh you could see it in her eyes
Oh yeah I saw it in her eyes
She was more than this
Oh way more than this
She was everything
She was all of this
What do you wanna do now baby?
Should we take the day...
...Maybe go to the beach?
What do you want me to say now baby,
I may be gone... but never out of reach.
Ooh, baby blue.
Ooh...
Why?
Sleep tight tiger
Sleep tight tiger - sweet dreams till tomorrow
Sleep tight tiger
I love you love you first thing in the morning
The day time the night time when the angels are calling
They whisper in the top of my tongue
A tiny little worlds that tickles your ear drum
Sleep tight tiger
Sleep tight tiger - sweet dreams till tomorrow
Sleep tight tiger
Sleep tight tiger sweet dreams till tomorrow
I'll be teardrop in your pillow the beautiful sorrow
I love you like I do in the noon
I am the shadow on your skin and I'll be gone very soon
Stand and move and walk across the water.
Peel the cover from the city.
Watch its insides twitch and smoke and rotate endlessly.
Sinking. Moving deep beneath the water.
Lots of other worlds exist.
Soon enough we'll tear them open.
Soon enough we'll break them too.
Swimming. Watching concrete eat the ocean.
Metal fingers scrape the skies.
The windows look like Christmas lights from out here.
Floating. Counting clouds. They're slowly fading.
Blending in with cardboard skies.
Soon we'll manufacture replicas.
It's all replaceable.
From the sky, the train tracks look like stitches.
Like they're holding the world together; like it'll blow any minute.
And I've got another thought I'll keep to myself.
Until the skeletons walk free. Until the make-up all comes off.
There's nothing new to discover, there's nothing new to invent.
There's nothing new to think that hasn't been thought of before.
And there's nothing to believe we haven't already forgotten.
There's nothing left, there's nothing new, there's nothing
No, no, no, no.
And I've got another dream I'll keep to myself.
Until the tyrants are dead and the patriots are swallowed whole.
And I've got a bottle I can aim at the center,
Full of letters, as a kid, I'd always meant to send.
We'd speak our minds and change the world.
We'd fix the past and pave the way.
But now we're fresh out of heroes; now we've run dry on hope.
There are no saviors in technology: just quick fixes.
And holes, within holes, within holes, within you.
And a place to hang my head, and convince myself there is no difference.
Living for only one
When will it stop?
Caught in the undertow
When will it stop?
Trying to fight the cold
When will it stop?
Why does the night win me always?
All the wind's at your eyes, at your eyes
All the wind's at your eyes, at your eyes, at your eyes, at your eyes
All the wind's at your eyes, at your eyes, at your eyes, at your eyes
When will it stop?
No one forever young
When will it stop?
I'm caught in the undertow
When will it stop?
The brittle and bitter bones
When will it stop?
Forgot to know how to grow
All the wind's at your eyes, at your eyes
All the wind's at your eyes, at your eyes, at your eyes, at your eyes
All the wind's at your eyes, at your eyes, at your eyes, at your eyes
All the wind's at your eyes, at your eyes, at your eyes, at your eyes
You pick the storm or you pick the shore
Both take you to the floor, to the floor, to the floor, to the floor
When will it stop? When will it stop? When will it stop?
Melodic stanzas
Are symphonizing their way
Through your weary head
To feed your distrust
And fill it's mouth with the desire
To soulfully be one with your creation
Not a subject to control
You call upon a higher power
For help and inspiration
The crowd waits
And turns their faces
Towards you expectantly
You give them what they need
But their useless criticism
Makes you die
A bit more inside
Not a subject to control
You call upon a higher power
For help and inspiration
Oh, I swoon
While loudspeakers play soft music
Leaning
Over your fourtieth masterpiece
You must have loved
The colour of these violins
I wish I knew you
Your fit of insanity makes me sad
I wish you knew
Your music was to stay forever
And I hope...
I have no clue
If you know how much it matters
And I hope...
Baby I'm sitting on fire
There's an old flame still burns in my heart
When we're together the fire burns bright
But the old flame ignites when we part
Baby you know that I love you
But a memory still haunts at my door
When we're together we stand so tall
But a part of me still falls to the floor
Sets me free
I do believe
Burn up in me
For the rest of my life
Baby I'm sitting on fire
But the flames put a hole in my heart
When we're together the fire burns bright
But the old flame ignites when we part
So hard to fight when you're losing
And I got a little fear in my soul
And in my own time I am losing fast
I can even hold what I own
Sets me free
I do believe
Burn up in me
For the rest of my life
Instrumental
So hard to fight when you're losing
And I got a little fear in my soul
In my own time I am dying
Can't even hold what I own
Your body may be gone, I'm gonna carry you in.
In my head, in my heart, in my soul.
And maybe we'll get lucky and we'll both live again.
Well I don't know. I don't know. I Don't think so.
Well that is that and this is this.
You tell me what you want and I'll tell you what you get.
You get away from me.
Collected my belongings and I left the jail.
Well thanks for the time, I had to think a spell.
I had to think awhile.
And the ocean breathes salty, won't you carry it in?
In your head, in your mouth, in your soul.
And maybe we'll get lucky and we'll both grow old.
Well I don't know. I don't know. I hope so.
Well that is that and this is this.
Will you tell me what you saw and I'll tell you what you missed,
When the ocean met the sky.
You missed when time and life shook hands and said goodbye.
When the earth folded on itself.
And said "Good luck, I hope heaven and hell
Are really there, but I wouldn't hold my breath."
You wasted life, why wouldn't you waste death? (x4)
And the ocean breathes salty, won't you carry it in?
In your head, in your mouth, in your soul.
And the more we move ahead the more we're stuck in rewind.
Well I don't mind. I don't mind. How could I mind?
Well that is that and this is this.
You tell me what you want I'll tell you what you get.
You get away from me.
Well that is that and this is this.
You tell me what you saw and I'll tell you what you missed,
When the ocean met the sky.
You missed when time and life shook hands and said goodbye.
When the earth folded on itself.
And said "Good luck, I hope heaven and hell
Are really there, but I wouldn't hold my breath."
You wasted life, why wouldn't you waste death? (x4)

So much stays unknown till the time has come.
Did you imagine you could ever be so strong,
Then watch your fear just turn into relief?
Your sea of doubt become your own belief?
Though tears don't come to cry some grief away,
The tears will help to keep your need at bay.
So come on now, come on now, child.
You're here just a while.
Come on now, come on now, child.
You're here just a while.
A mother told me just before she died
My mother told me just before she died,
"Oh darling, darling, don't you be like me.
You will fall in love with the very first man you meet."
But mother, mother, some will never know;
The love that you have is still holding my soul.
(Beth Orton and Terry Callier)
So come on now, come on now, child.
You're here just a little while.
Come on now, come on now, child.
You're here just a while.

Here just a while...

So much stays unknown till the time you are strong.
Did you imagine you could ever feel so strong,
And all your pain just turns into relief?
All your doubt becomes your own belief?
Though tears don't come to cry some grief away,
The years will help to keep your need at bay.
(Beth Orton and Terry Callier)
So come on now, come on now, child.
You're here just a while.
Come on now, come on now, child.
You're here just a while.
So come on now, come on now, child.

Come on now, come on now, child.
You're here just a while.

Here just a while...
(Beth Orton)
You're here just a while
You might as well smile,
You might as well smile,
'Cause tomorrow, you just don't know.
It will pass. It's gonna pass.
(Beth Orton and Terry Callier)
It will pass in time.
It will pass in time.
It will pass.

Out in the harbor
The ships come in, it's Christmastime
The kids all holler carols 'cross the water
Stars that shine
All that I want, all that I want
Above the rooftops
The full moon dips its golden spoon
I wait on clip-clops, deer might fly
Why not? I met you
All that I want, all that I want
And when the night is falling
Down the sky at midnight
Another year is stalling
Far away a good bye, good night
All that I want., all that I want, all that I want
So small a turning
The world grows older every day
An ache, a yearning
Soften when I hear you say
All that I want, all that I want
And when the cold wind's blowing
Snow drifts through the pine trees
In houses lights are glowing
Likewise in your eyes that find me here
With all that I want.
Out in the harbor
The ships come in, it's Christmastime
It's Christmastime
It's Christmastime.
I look high, I look low
I'm looking everywhere I go.
Looking for a home in the heart of the country.
A-gong go, a-gong gong
I'm gonna tell everyone I know
I'm looking for a home in the heart of the country.
Heart of the country, where the holy people grow
Heart of the country, smell the grass in the meadow.
Wowowoo!
I want a horse, I want a sheep
I wanna give me a good night sleep 
Living in a home in the heart of the country.
A-gong go, a-gong gong
I'm gonna tell everyone I know
I'm living in a home in the heart of the country.
Heart of the country, where the holy people grow
Heart of the country, smell the grass in the meadow.
Wowowoo!
I want a horse, I got a sheep
I'm gonna give me a good night sleep.
Living in a home in the heart of the country.
A-gong go, a-gong gong
I'm gonna tell everyone I know
In the heart of the country.
Heart of the country, where the holy people grow
Heart of the country, smell the grass in the meadow.
Wowowoo!

Gold teeth and a curse for this town
Were all in my mouth
Only I don't know how they got out, dear
Turn me back into the pet
I was when we met
I was happier then with no mindset
And if you took to me like
A gull takes to the wind
Oh, I'd have jumped from my trees
And I'd have danced
Like the king of the eyesores
And the rest of our lives would've fared well
New slang when you notice the stripes
The dirt in your fries
Hope it's right when you die, old and bony
Dawn breaks like a bull through the hall
I wish it had called
But the head's to the wall and I'm lonely
And if you took to me like
A gull takes to the wind
I'd have jumped from my trees
And I'd have danced
Like the king of the eyesores
And the rest of our lives would've fared well
Godspeed, all the bakers at dawn
May they all cut their thumbs
And bleed into their buns till they melt away
I'm looking in on the good life
I might be doomed never to find
Without a trust or flaming fields
Am I too dumb to refine
And if you took to me like a
I'd have danced like the queen of the eyesores
And the rest of our lives would've fared well
Ooh ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh, ooh-ooh
As I fall
And you turn away
You walk down corridors
Miles away from my heart
As I breathe
As I surrender
I hear the sound of whispering
Replace these veins
With these stomach aches
And butterflies that long to tear away
Screaming "I'll tear out
I'll tear out
I'll tear out your heart"
With the lights out
I hope you never leave my side
I promise to leave
My weapons left by the bedside
With the lights out
I hope you never leave my side
I promise to leave
My weapons left by the bedside, I
As you stand
Pressed up on the wall
They march in outfit
With lullabies that long to hurt us all
And now I'm your escape route
I could be
I could be so much more
With the lights out
I hope you never leave my side
I promise to leave
My weapons left by the bedside
With the lights out
I hope you never leave my side
I promise to leave
My weapons left by the bedside, I
This time I won't bleed
If you've forsaken me
I'll tear out, I'll tear out, I'll tear out
I'll tear out, I'll tear out, I'll tear out
You were there and I was was with you
Longing for you
You broke the locks, I grabbed on to you
Lost in these rooms
What did I see?
What did I see?
What did I see?
(You were there and I was was with you
Longing for you)
What did I see?
Shut up and go to bed.
Put the pillow under your head.
I'm sick and tired of all of your worries.
Shut up and say goodnight.
Say your prayers and turn out the lights.
I'm sick and tired of all of your sob stories.
Shut up and shut your eyes.
No more histrionics, no more college tries.
Stop pushing. Stop shoving. Stop straining.
Shut your mouth and button your lip.
You're a late night faucet that's got a drip.
All your doing is mearly complaining.
The excuse that you're crazy is useless.
You're not biting, you're barking. 
You're toothless.
But you're ruthless.
Shut up and count some sheep.
Do me a favor and don't bitch in your sleep.
No more agony. 
Please, no more sorrow.
Shut up and catch some ZZZs. 
Ice cream with a cherry plus a big pretty please.
I promise we'll resume tomorrow. 
Good night.
Silently I fall asleep
With you kneeling beside me holding me
Secretly this feels right to me
You're my wonderful heaven sent down to me
We turn our backs to end of time
So we can let the moment stay
Hold my hand through the thick and thin
As we remember to hold the faith
Offer me a love so deep
Show me the beauty in all you see
Secretly this feels right to me
You're my wonderful heaven sent down to me
There's nobody here now beauty above all.
We pried open my window
And let the summer rush in
And we laughed with the new air
Now I lay and watch the green leaves
Dance and whisper sweet breath
A promise of a new year
Ooh
On this day
Ooh
On this day
We were born into the new year
And after the winter broke
We held hands and we ran
And we agreed that it had been a long one
Ooh
On this day
Ooh
On this day
We were born into the new year
I climbed this hill watching so still
I took to the fears of all I held dear
But up on this height, a majestic sight
Flooded the skies
And how I could feel you near
Oh I could sail the world
Search through the darkest waters but
I'd never find
These golden eyes
I held the stars to light where you are
When your unfeigned heart called to me through the dark
Soaked in the sound that rose from the ground
There I could feel
I felt, I felt you near
Oh I could sail the world
Search through the darkest waters but
I'd never find
These golden eyes
Oh I'd wait for the seas to part
To be with you
Oh I could sail the world
Search through the darkest waters
Oh I could sail the world
Search through the darkest waters but
I'd never find
These golden eyes

Jackie é uma menina tão bonita que enjoa
Enjoa de vertigem, viagem de avião
Hálito de virgem, dois olhos de amêndoa
Vaca, cadela, macaca, gazela...
Listen to the rain fallin' day by day
Listen to the rain fallin' day by day by day
I hear you callin'
Voices are here again
I hear you whisper
Taken control of me
Watch the dancing shadows run away
All alone once again
Afraid!
(Small Instrumental Break)
All these faces (faces)
Changing their shapes on me
Isolated in my own world
Will I ever be free?
Haunting figures around me
I want them to stay
They're always there to protect me
This is one thing you can't take away
Listen to the rain fallin' day by day
Listen to the rain fallin' day by day by day
Yeah!
I hear you callin'
Voices are here again
I hear you whisper
In my own mind
Will it ever change?
(Will it ever change?)
Voices
Voices
Voices
Voices
I hear you callin'
Is there a God?
Is he watching?
Is she watching?
Are they watching now?
If not, what are we doing?
Where are we going?
What are we doing now?
Look at all these people
Searching for a reason,
Searching for a piece of mind. Hey!
They say we're all created equal,
That's what they teach us,
But that ain't how we treat each other
Nah that ain't how we treat each other
Shit, The truth is that we need each other, yeah.
Diamond in the back,
Babies on crack,
Kickin' the door,
Wavin the four four
White collar war crime, money gets spent
Candles in the sun, blowin' in the wind
Sun goes down,
Heroes often get shot
Peace is long been forgot
Oh, will it be too late when we found out?
That we're all that we got
Take a look around now, yeah
Just take a look around, here
Business and governments just, watch as the innocent fade.
Mindless bureaucracy fails, hindering government aid.
Aren't you appalled?
What are we doing?
Where are we going?
What are we doing?
Diamond in the back,
Babies on crack,
Kickin' the door,
Wavin' the four four
Candles in the sun, blowin' in the wind
Sun goes down,
Heroes often get shot
Peace is long been forgot
Oh will it be too late when we found out? Yeah
That we're all that we got
Look around
Just Take a look around, yeah
Look around
We're all that we got
(Ooh)
May we all live long
And may we all be brave
And the bridges we burn, only light our way
May we all be strong
And we all be brave
And the bridges we burn, only light our way
May we all live long
May we all be brave
And the bridges we burn, only light our way
May we all live long
And we all be brave
And the bridges we burn, will be the bridges we burn
We're all that we got
(Ooh)
We're all that we got
(Ooh)
We're all that we got
(Nah)
Look around now
That we're all that we got
(Yeah Yeah)
Is there a God?
Is he watching?
Is she watching?
Are they watching now?
Is there a God?
I'm sure he's watching
What are we doing?
Where are we going, nah?
Take a look around now
We're all that we got
If I started my own country
For the flag, what colours would I use?
Such a myriad to choose from
I would pick red, yellow & blue
Red, for the blood I'd spill to own it
Yellow, for the sun which shines my way
& although I am leader of this country
Blue, because I'd still have sad days
When I'm sampling from your bosom
Sometimes I suffer from distractions like
Why does God cause things like tornadoes and train wrecks?
When I'm swimming in
When I'm swimming in your ocean
Floating aloft on creams
And scented lotions
I can get pretty side-tracked
I hope you'll understand
When I kneel before your bounty
Sometimes I wonder if there could be really
UFO's that come from other planets
And when you let me taste your fingers
I take them like fruit and as I linger
I wonder if my seed will find purchase in your soil...
I told y'all, here they come now, you see them 
Yup, both of the crews, I told y'all 
They look like they gonna fight
Now that I
Face the world with pain inside
Strange but I
Can't understand the reasons why.
Forever is
A world that I cannot describe
That Died the time we said goodnight.
It makes no difference, wrong or right
The time has come to say goodnight.
And how could I
Be so sure but be so wrong?
And how could I?
Have a will so weak with a mind so strong?
And Only I
Can tell the difference right or wrong.
It makes no difference, wrong or right
I guess it's best we say goodnight
She'll go out on the yard,
Holding her small daughter in her arms
Above the line of the tress,
Above the end of the street,
She will see it rising
Gold ball, large as a giant
Planet starting to lift up over ours.
She will go out in the yard holding her daughter
Looking at it rise
And grow and blossom and rise
Stell dich vor meine Mitte.
Leg dich in jede Figur.
Werf dich in jeden meiner Schritte.
Ich tanz' für dich, wohin du willst.
Ich geh' rüber ans Fenster
um zu sehen, ob die Sonne noch scheint.
Hab' so oft, bei schwerem Gewitter in deine Hände geweint.
Wie soll ein Mensch das ertragen?
Dich alle Tage zu sehen
ohne es einmal zu wagen
dir in die Augen zu sehen.
Stell dich vor meine Mitte.
Leg dich in jede Figur.
Werf dich in jeden meiner Schritte.
Ich führe dich, wohin du willst.
Wie soll ein Mensch das ertragen?
Dich alle Tage zu sehen
ohne es einmal zu wagen
dir in die Augen zu sehen.
Zu sehen...
Zu sehen...
Zu sehen...
Zu sehen...
Zu sehen...
Könnt ich einen einzigen Tag nur
in meinem Leben dir gefallen
um dann ein einziges Mal nur
in deine Arme zu fallen.
Wie soll ein Mensch das ertragen?
Dich alle Tage zu sehen
ohne es einmal zu wagen
dir in die Augen zu sehen.
Zu sehen...
Zu sehen...
Zu sehen...
Zu sehen...
Zu sehen...
Mhh...
Instrumental
Ashes to ashes
And dust to dust
That's what has become
Of our love and trust
Love has no direction
Cause love has no aim
Love can leave you
As fast as she came
Meeting is such sweet sorrow
Cause someday we may have to part
Hush don't you make a sound
You're gonna let me down
Good things come
To those who wait
But good things are gone
From those who are late
All that I am
Is all I can give
But with or without you
My life I must live
Meeting is such sweet sorrow
Cause someday we may have to part
Hush don't you make a sound
You're gonna let me down
Living ain't easy
Since you've been gone
No one else can please me
Or make me feel home
Forgetting ain't easy
You stay on my mind
Thoughts of us haunt me
Can't leave them behind
Hard to believe how people move
Falling out of love with you
Tearing down all the walls and love, the chaos
Thought again, of driving by, the place we meet
You and I, where it started, how we lived, together always
My heart, still beats, for you
My heart, still beats, for you
After all, it's always you
You came down, hard that summer
I started to dance, remember
Everything, not a thought of you
And I lied alot too
Maybe to forget you
My heart, still beats, for you
My heart, still beats, for you
My heart, still beats, for you
My heart, still beats, for you
After all, it's always you
I come back too 
I come back too you
I come back too you
I come back too you
Are you back in my life to stay
Or is it just for today
That you need me?
If it's a thrill you're looking for
Well, Honey, I'm flexible. Oh, yeah.
Just be for real oh, Baby
Be for real oh, Baby
You see I don't want to be hurt by love again.
Now you see I'm not naive.
But I would like to believe
What you tell me.
So don't give me the world today
And tomorrow take it away, oh no.
Just be for real oh, Baby...
Thanks for the song Mr. Knight.
Don't come to me with forevers
I love you more with each new day
But there is nothing everlasting
And Death blows promises away
Don't tell me I don't have no secrets
There's still a place I wanta be
There's still a path I haven't wandered
But I'm afraid of where it leads
Let me hold your hands
Your arms, your sides
The small of your back
Your shoulders and
Your wrists, your thighs
Your ankles and I'll
Find my way inside
You say I don't deserve emotions
That my devotion isn't true
You say I gotta find my place
Well my place is inside of you
So don't be hasty in your judgment
Don't pull the bag over my head 
For there are many here who hunger
And there are many who despair
Lay down your arms 
Your hair, your gown
The scroll of your spine
Hand me your head 
Your waist, your breath
Your nipples and I'll
Find my way inside
Well, the river is deep and the river is wide
And the girl that I love is on the other side
She wants to move to Kansas City
Move to Kansas City
Move, pretty baby, where the sky is so blue
Now, she's walking down Ellum, turning down Main
Trying to find someone to sell her cocaine
She wants to move to Kansas City
Move to Kansas City
Move, pretty baby, where the sky is so blue
With a dayful of promises dead on her lips
Mark 15:34 tucked next to her hip
She wants to move to Kansas City
Move to Kansas City
Move, pretty baby, where the sky is so blue
Well, I jumped in the water, started to drown
Thought of her walking, turned back around
I want to move to Kansas City
Move to Kansas
I want, pretty baby, where the sky is so blue
With her pair of old wings that opened just once
She can walk on two feet now, she can go where she wants
She can even move to Kansas City
Move to Kansas City
Move, pretty baby, where the sky is so blue
And I'll tell you one thing that you should never do
Never let no woman tell you she loves you
Sure she'll call you "baby", she'll look in your eye
Gonna get on that airplane and wave bye bye bye bye bye bye
Bye bye baby, baby bye bye
Bye Bye baby, so long next time
So long next time
And if I could believe what I want to believe
I'd hold you all close and take you with me
All of you to Kansas City
You to Kansas City
And me, yeah, where the sky is so blue
I'm going from strange to stranger every year
I take it back you're panicking
I just don't know
I really thought I wanted to go
But when we're close
You look through me just like a ghost
I like sleeping
I'm only safe when i'm dreaming
I need a new heart
This one's hollow
Always scheming
You wait for summer
And then you wait for winter
But there's a total lack of splendor
Zen brain throw away your crushes
All your childhood crutches
Super brain never scared of nothing
Violence or loving my way
Today
Today I said goodbye
To my conflicted goddess
Her lush eyes show surprise
At how we could gather knowledge
The painting has a dream where shadow
Breaks the scene and the colors run off
Blue is bashful, green is my goal
Yellow girls are running backwards
Until the nextime with six hits of sunshine
The lights will blind up with blues in haiku
The shadow has a dream where
Painters look to sea, the colors burn out
Now I know where I once saw you
Stepping into muddy water
John's reflection, decried perfection
Now you walk him through the gardren
Waiting in the wings, painters shade
Their dreams with falling colors
See me wave good, bye forever
Happiness the goddess lover
Hurry back reember last time
The hits of sunshine, the hits of goldmine
I'll see you back tonight where painters
Love the light and yellow shadow girls
Today I said goodbye
To my conflicted goddess
Her lush eyes show surprise
And how we captured knowledge
I'll see you back tonight where
Shadows dream of light, let's slip on outside
Everybody's on the same page
No new chapters
We'll never change
Everybody wants to be cool
Yes they do
I'm just like them
But I won't be no fool
I guess I could waste all my time and my money
Just trying to look right
But it doesn't change who I am in my heart if I look like a dime
So I want you to close your eyes
Sing to the world tonight
And show them what's beautiful
I don't care what they think
Know I'm not listening
'Cause I know I'm beautiful
So close your eyes
Show them what's beautiful
Show them what's beautiful
Gonna' show them...
Show them what's beautiful
Show them what's beautiful
Everybody's born to be different
That's the one thing that makes us the same
So don't you let them hurts try to change you
Don't let them make you into something you ain't
So I want you to close your eyes
Sing to the world tonight
And show them what's beautiful
I don't care what they think
Know I'm not listening
'Cause I know I'm beautiful
So close your eyes
Show them what's beautiful
Show the world the you inside
Raise your voice and close your eyes
'Cause you're beautiful
Come on and show the world the you inside
Raise your voice and close your eyes
'Cause you're beautiful
So I want you to close your eyes
Sing to the world tonight
And show them what's beautiful
I don't care what they think
Know I'm not listening
'Cause I know I'm beautiful
So close your eyes
Guilt reflects
And then leaves the rest to me
It started with a flash of light
Off his grip was loose and just a bit
There's a constant slip out of the positive
And you waste more perfect time than you tend to give
All the fear and all the cares of the world
Never forced themselves into my arms
It was your fear that helped me
Your fear that got me to move
Straight from your heart into their sight
Grace and hope
I share along the way
It ended with a twist of fate
And now the hearts are breaking just a bit
And the consequence was a negative
So you killed more precious lives then you had let live
All the fear and all the cares of the world
Never forced themselves into my arms
It was your fear that helped me
Your fear that got me to move
Straight from your heart into their sight
For shame on you
Who cares about me anyway
I don't mind you
It'd mean so much if you'd just save me
Save me
All the fear and all the cares of the world
Never forced themselves into my arms
It was your fear that helped me
Your fear that got me to move
Straight from your heart into their sight
Don't forget, don't forget
Mhmm
That I believe in you
Should you forget
Should you forget
Let me remind
That I am behind you
You were a secret, waiting to be found out
Soon be what everyone is talking about
May you spread your love like laughter
Find whatever you're after
Open all your windows and let the music spill out
Don't forget, don't forget
That I believe in you
Should you forget
Should you forget
Let me remind you
That I am behind
May you dance like rain upon a still lake
You make this world a beautiful place
No more crying, don't shun your light, keep shining
Wipe your tears from your sweet face
Don't forget, don't forget
That I believe in you
Should you forget
Should you forget
Let me remind you
That I am behind
Don't be afraid should things happen to change
'Cause change can be a beautiful thing
Should things fall apart
Be patient like a rainbow
Life is loving and letting go
She holds a key to the room down there
And I, I will follow, but I'll never fall in
Yeah, we'll suffer for nothing and we'll never forgive
God said to no one to do what he did
One second in your presence is a miracle of love
One second denied is a miracle of love
The young man is weak now in a lover's disguise
The woman is strong in her warm, bed of lies
How will they hold what they can never perceive?
And how do they love what they fail to deceive?
One second in your memory is a miracle of lies
One heartbeat in your body is a miracle of love
White light on a black sky is a miracle from above
One lonely moment in your arms is the miracle of love
My verses stand gawping a bit
I never get used to this
They lived here long enough
Enough!
I send them out of the house
I don't wanna wait
Until their toes are cold
Enough!
I wanna hear the humming of the sun
Or that of my heart,
Hardening
Enough!
They don't screw classically
They babble commonly
And bluster nobly
Enough! Enough!
In winter their lips leap
In spring they lie flat at the first warmth
They ruin my summer
And in autumn it's girls and a broken heart
For another twelve lines on this sheet
I'll hold my hand over their head
And then I'll kick them out
Enough!
Go and pester elsewhere, one-cent rhymes
Find somebody who cares
Enough!
Go now on your high feet
This is where the graves laugh
When they see their guests
Enough!
One corpse on top of the other
Go now and stagger to her
Whom I do not know
Enough! Enough!
In winter their lips leap
In spring they lie flat at the first warmth
They ruin my summer
And in autumn it's girls and a broken heart
Sometimes I watch my life
And it slowly goes
From black then into white
I know if you
Watch the time
Leaves you standing poring over moments in life
I know I've been through black and white
I know I'll put up a fierce fight
I know I lost my soul
I know that I lost my soul
So I wait to sieze the day
The clouded mind
The hell I've a lot to pay
I find that if you know
Your way you get out of this mess
I know I've been through black and white
I know I'll put up a fierce fight
I know I lost my soul
I know that I lost my soul
I know there comes a time
To believe in yourself
And grow in confidence
Stop hiding behind the door
Like everyone else
Just get out and do your best
I know I've been through black and white
I know I'll put up a fierce fight
I know I lost my soul
I know that I lost my soul
I know that I'll find my soul
Each step is moving, it's moving me up
Moving, it's moving me up
Every step is moving me up
Moving me up, moving, moving me up
Every step is
Moving me up
One tiny, tiny,
Tiny move
It's all I need
And I jump over
Every step is moving me up
This is how we walk on the moon
This is how we walk on the moon
Every step is moving me up
I'm so far away
One moment there
Moving me up
Every step is moving me up
One moment there
One tiny, tiny move
It's all I need and I jump over
Down in the bardo
There was nothing to hold so we let it go
We were empty, we were hollow
Shined with everything we were living for
And you see your soul
Like some picture show
Across idaho
We were running through the autumn leaves
A couple kids just wearing out our jeans, running
Mary she's our autumn queen
Watch her smoking cigarettes in the street
And down she goes
Cold she blows
Across idaho
And there's lights up in the north
And I ain't wondering where you are
Yeah just lights up in the north
Now it's white as snow
Watch the evening glow
Across idaho
Flying around
The houses at night
Flying alone
A teenage spaceship
I was a teenage spaceship
Landing at night
I was beautiful with all my lights
Loomed so large on the horizon
So large, people thought my windows
Were stars
So large on the horizon
People thought my windows
Were stars
A teenage spaceship
A teenage spaceship
And I swore I'd never lay like a log
Bark like a dog
I was a teenage smog
Sewn to the sky
All things change
Never rest, never sure
What is worth
Fighting on for
All things change
Never rest, never sure
What is worth
Fighting on for
All things change
Around
All is faith
Unwound
I found a lead
A single furtive reason
My senses reeled
In seeking youthful madness
I trust belief belongs to me
Someone will come
To spit the seed
A single weed gets respect
I'll change my quills to break the will
Forever must hold
All things strain
Be they changed
Be they fair
Be they hope
Masked as care
All things change
Never rest, never sure
What is worth
Fighting on for
All things change
Never rest, never sure
What is worth
Hangin' on for
You might
Be there
God knows
Skies stare
Taste dirt
You hurt
Swallow
Shallow
Forgive
This day
Summon
Courage
No light
Comes in
Shadows
Laughin'
All things change
Never rest, never sure
What is worth
Fighting on for
Pictures blurred in her head
Won't let them win
Smash a fist or two
Right back and let it in
For the one that you love
Is more than them fuck them
Think about her now
She's yours anyway
-
And everything else doesn't matter
Really 'cause that girl that you want
She's never going away
And if you want her you can't have her
Break yourself into
A million pieces
Everything else can wait for you
So everything else can wait for you to do
This...
-
They will all just go away
All of the demons
Enjoy this life right now
You know what you're to do
And letters
Yes they matter write her quite a few
And she might love you for it
But you can't count on it
And everything else doesn't matter
Really 'cause that girl that you want
She's never going away
And if you want her you can't have her
Break yourself into
A million pieces
Everything else can wait for you
So everything else can wait for you to do
This...
-
And I'm screaming for the breath
That makes you alive
You want that girl
For all that you can try
Once you have her
I know she'll be so great for you
I know she'll try something
Inside you are everything else
And everything else doesn't matter
Really 'cause that girl that you want
She's never going away
And if you want her you can't have her
Break yourself into
A million pieces
Everything else can wait for you
So everything else can wait for you to do
This...
You've been biting bullets all these years, I know
There beside yourself, choking on tears
And you aced avoiding possibility
When you placed your bets upon the bittersweet
Now don't you worry
No need to be sorry
Time to step lightly
'Cause the love you used to feel is still in there, inside
It may be the faded photograph, but I know you care, don't hide
If you're scared, I'm here beside you,
If you get lost I'm here to guide you
And I give you peace when peace is fragile
Love is all the good in you
Love is peace when peace is fragile
You've been going out of way to agree
Like you've been rubbing yourself all wrong just to be somebody else's genie
Catering to your disasters every need
Waiting to finally be set free
I said baby don't worry
Life will carry
Just take it slowly
'Cause the love...
Save my money
For that plane ride 
Horn of plenty
Heavy sunlight 
Autumn's bounty
Bread and red wine
In a hurry
But there's so much time 
I will wait for you 
Flowing love but like water 
Time will always slip through 
I will wait for you 
But please come soon 
Wind sounds angry
But my coat's kind 
Wrapped in blankets
In the daylight 
Winner's longing
Summer close behind 
In a hurry
But there's so much time 
I will wait for you 
Growing love but like water 
Time will always slip through 
I will wait for you 
Is it in a plan
Written in your hand?
Can't believe or understand 
Something other than
Fear is blinding lights
Squeeze my eyes so tight 
Could you make a flower grow
Would you let me know?
I will wait for you 
Flowing love but like water 
Time will always slip through 
I will wait for you 
But please come soon
The angel rides with hunch-backed children, poison oozing from his engine
Wieldin' love as a lethal weapon, on his way to hubcap heaven
Baseball cards poked in his spokes, his boots in oil he's patiently soaked
The roadside attendant nervously jokes as the angel's tires strokes his precious pavement
The interstate's choked with nomadic hordes
In Volkswagen vans with full running boards dragging great anchors
Followin' dead-end signs into the sores
The angel rides by humpin' his hunk metal whore
Madison Avenue's claim to fame in a trainer bra with eyes like rain
She rubs against the weather-beaten frame and asks the angel for his name
Off in the distance the marble dome
Reflects across the flatlands with a naked feel off into parts unknown
The woman strokes his polished chrome and lies beside the angel's bones.
It's easier to say it's over,
It's easier but I might still be pretending.
Not a single one will believe.
I can't say I wouldn't agree.
I don't know if I know myself at all anymore.
I gave up on what I couldn't give in.
I gave up on what I couldn't give in. 
I gave up, I gave in.
Little one, how long I've waited here
Waited for so many lonely years
Nobody ever could make me smile
'Til you came 'round with your pretty style
And I will love you so
And I will love you so
'Cause I was made for you
And you were made for me
And that is all I know
You're all that I can see
'Cause I was made for loving you
And all the little things you do
Remind me who I am inside
Happiness is such a fickle thing
Nothing compares to what you can bring
You can bring meaning to what I do
That is why I want to be with you
And I will love you so
And I will love you so
'Cause I was made for you
And you were made for me
And that is all I know
You're all that I can see
'Cause I was made for loving you
And all the little things you do
Remind me who I am inside
My darling, I need you
I'd give myself to please you
My darling, I need you
I want you to be mine
'Cause I was made for you
And you were made for me
And that is all I know
You're all that I can see
'Cause I was made for you
And you were made for me
And that is all I know
You're all that I can see
'Cause I was made for loving you
And all the little things you do
Remind me who I am inside
Remind me who I am inside
Remind me who I am inside
You've got me all tied up to the whipping tree
But, oh, my friend
I'm just glad to be in love again
My dear, it's queer
I know low and I know fear
If it's real, I feel
I'm not man enough to handle it still, oh
Cold morning, I was looking out it was a cold day
Songbird was drinking from a table but songbird you just flew away
Everybody's gotta feel the weight of death sometime
And find out what it's like to be left behind
Sometimes you don't get a chance to ask where or why
So let it break the magic beauty of your fragile mind
And let it break the magic beauty of your fragile mind
It's not a sign of weakness when you're searching
For the places where the memories flow
There may come a time when you rearrange
And may leave those memories you've gotta let them go
Everybody's gotta feel the weight of death sometime
And find out what it's like to be left behind
Sometimes you don't get a chance to ask where or why
Let it break the magic beauty of your fragile mind
Let it break the magic beauty of your fragile mind
Let it break the magic beauty of your fragile mind
Let it break the magic beauty of your fragile mind
Everybody's gotta feel the weight of death sometime
And find out what it's like to be left behind
Sometimes you don't get a chance to ask where or why
Let it break the magic beauty of your fragile mind
Let it break the magic beauty of your fragile mind
Let it break the magic beauty of your fragile mind
Let it break the magic beauty of your fragile mind
Stay strong, move on, keep on
Stay strong, move on, keep on
A vida sem freio me leva, me arrasta, me cega 
No momento em que eu queria ver 
O segundo que antecede o beijo 
A palavra que destrói o amor 
Quando tudo ainda estava inteiro 
No instante em que desmoronou 
Palavras duras em voz de veludo 
E tudo muda, adeus velho mundo 
A um segundo tudo estava em paz 
Cuide bem do seu amor 
Seja quem for (2x) 
E cada segundo, cada momento, cada instante 
É quase eterno, passa devagar 
Se o seu mundo for o mundo inteiro 
Sua vida, seu amor, seu lar 
Depois de tudo que for verdadeiro 
Depois de tudo que não for passar 
Palavras duras em voz de veludo 
E tudo muda, adeus velho mundo 
A um segundo tudo estava em paz 
Cuide bem do seu amor 
Seja quem for (2x) 
Palavras duras em voz de veludo 
E tudo muda, adeus velho mundo 
A um segundo tudo estava em paz 
Cuide bem do seu amor 
Seja quem for (2x)
Father time
I'm running late
I'm winding down
I'm growing tired
Seconds drift
Into the night
The clock just ticks
Till my time expires
You were once my friend
Now I know I can't tie your hands
The days I saved
I couldn't spend
They fell like sand
Through the hourglass
No time to lose
No time to choose
Time taking time
It's taken mine
Scenes of my life
Seem so unkind
Time chasing time
Creeps up behind
I can't run forever
And time waits for no one
Not even me
An enemy
I can't defend
My final place
A deadly end
Life is just
A speck in space
Dreams of
An eternal resting place
I can't get any younger
Time has brutal hunger
Time taking time
It's taken mine
Scenes of my life
Seem so unkind
Time chasing time
Creeps up behind
I can't run forever
And time waits for no one
Waits for no one
Not even me
As I walk up a street
I lift my head up and I face you
You look good, and you smell sweet,
Which makes it harder to embrace you
If I was back in primary
In a playground I would chase you
But I'm not, I'm just me
And though you might be what I'm looking for
But my head won't function properly
And my feet don't move in time
And next week I'll forget probably
But today you blow my mind
And as we talk, I go all red
And I'm feeling like a schoolkid
All these thoughts that fill my head
I bet I say something stupid
Just play it cool and keep it calm
And remember what your mother said:
Now boy, just use your charm,
But all that good advice gets lost somewhere
Cause my mouth just won't work right today,
All my head is full with lines
If only I could find the words to say,
We could spend a lifetime
Spend a lifetime, spend a lifetime
Lalalalalalalaaaaa, lalalalalalalaaaaa
Spend a lifetime, spend a lifetime
It wasn't open
But somehow you let yourself in
Closed off and broken
I never wanted to go there again.
I wasn't waiting
But you came at just the right time
Weary and wasted
I never knew I could feel so alive.
Darling believe
You're closer than anyone has even been
Oh baby don't leave me alone
I'm yours for eternity
You hold the seven keys to my soul.
Feel so connected
Like I've know you all along
I never expected
To fall into loving so deep
So deep and so strong.
Darling believe
You're closer than anyone has even been
Oh baby don't leave me alone
I'm yours for eternity
You hold the seven keys to my soul.
Closer than anyone
This is where we belong.
Closer than anyone
This is where we belong.
Closer than anyone
This is where we belong.
Closer than anyone
This is where we belong.
Darling believe
You're closer than anyone has even been
So baby don't leave me alone
I'm yours for eternity
You hold the seven keys to my... soul.
I awake in the future,
I had turned to stone with fear,
Laid on petrified trees
In a high school massacre I'm fossilized and clear,
The teenage terrorists freeze
We began dismantling the stadia and schools,
Singing save our simian souls!
Polished up warm bullets hanging static in the air,
Droplets glittering home
NASA knows, how the pheromones, cascade!
Down the walls, you can't help the way you feel
You're the crudest oil, let your vision boil,
Yeah they're gonna dig a coal-face! out of you,
Isambard I'm all steel!
Chasing homeless cheerleaders,
Through the sewers lit by burning polythene bags
Pushing flame scorched limos to the oil rig tonight,
For the promenade dance
Fill your locker with an arsenal,
Hieroglyphic every particle,
Mother all about the coal
And the lava and the gas that we are,
Lovers on the landfill,
Digging me up to fuel rockets and risk
Look across now honey the horizon,
I can see a shuttle birth,
Is it a boy? Or a girl? Or a gun?
I know it's ludicrous to be lost,
There's never been a time like this
Everyone, is gonna end, up there,
You're overcome,
But NASA is on your side
It's happening, the sky is shattering,
And they're gonna make a Death Star,
Out of you, but NASA is on your side
NASA is on your side
NASA is on your side
Everyone, is gonna end, up there,
You're overcome, but NASA is on your side
It's happening, yeah, it's happening,
And they're gonna make a Death Star,
Out of you, but NASA is on your side
There were children climbing over fridges
In a rush to see the death of the sun
And we laughed all night when they said
"Treasure in the sky" and we had nothing but fun
Instrumental
And I wanted that heat so bad
I could taste the fire on your breath
And I wanted in your storm so bad
I could taste the lightning on your breath
I watched you hold the son in your arms while he bled to death
He grew so pale next to you
The world is so pale next to you
Your hair is coxcomb red, your eyes are viper black
Your hair is coxcomb red, your eyes are viper black
You said every road is a good road
Between the next road and your last road
Every love is your best love and every love is your last love
And every kiss is a goodbye
Every kiss is a goodbye
I watched you hold the son in your arms while he bled to death
He grew so pale next to you
The world is so pale next to you
Your hair is coxcomb red, your eyes are viper black
Your hair is coxcomb red, your eyes are viper black
Your hair is coxcomb red, your eyes are viper black
Hear the lonesome whippoorwill
His song's too blue to fly
The midnight train is a-winding low
I'm so lonesome I could cry
I've never seen a night so long
When time keeps crawling by
The moon is gone behind the clouds
To hide his face and cry
Have you ever seen a robin weep
When leaves have turned to brown?
Like me he's lost his will to live
I'm so lonesome I could cry
The silence of a falling star
Lights up a purple haze
And as I wonder where you are
I'm so lonesome I could cry
I tend to be
Stuck in minor key
Then pale monotony
Holds me down
But luckily
You are so dear to me
In your charity
I go home
I'm so sorry
This melancholy
Holds me down
But luckily
You are so dear to me
In your charity
I go home
Bee
Sippin' sweet
From each part to unfurl
The wax and the wane and the throw
Best of the bunch
And it's down to the bar
The song of the fly and the rush
You'll never calm down
You'll never calm down
You'll never calm down
You'll never calm down
Tall
From the stream
And the weight of the breath
Back to the start and the scrap
Hand bleeding out
It is pinching the flame
We repeat forever, forever, yeah
You'll never calm down
You'll never calm down
You'll never calm down
You'll never calm down
Hope
Is the time before each new word
Hope
Is the time of the blink
Hope
Is the time before action occurs
Hope feels so unfounded
You'll never calm down
Never, never
You'll never calm down
Never, never
You'll never calm down
Never, never calm down
You'll never calm down
Never, never
Calm down
Never, never
Calm down
Calm down
Always shine
Always shine bright down on me
Mother earth
Mother earth take the pain away
All we are
All we are we'll never be
Mother earth
Mother earth take the pain away
Away...
And even though I'm right behind you
Shadows haunt and taunt your hand
I cannot be your everything
But I'll be your candyman
You move a sudden grace, a child upon the Earth
You wanted love to find you but you found it first
We look through antiques on a fuzzy, fuzzy day
But you always know just what you want
Want right away
And though you cry at night
It's to be expected
But know you're mine tonight
So when the sun has died you dive into your mind
But your soul is never lost until the deal is signed
Don't drink me I'm like turpentine
Make you blind, burn your insides
If I don't know me then I don't know you
Can't figure out what I'm supposed to do
I ain't running away from my mind this time
I ain't running away from my mind this time
There's a killer in me and a killer in you
A little talent but a lot would do
If I don't know me then I don't know you
I don't know why I do the things I do
I ain't running away from my mind this time
I ain't running away from my mind this time
I ain't running away from my mind this time
I ain't running away from my mind this time
Too stressed to eat, too tired to sleep, alien to all you meet
It's the season of the witch, it's the season of the spin
And nobody knows what state we're in
It's the season of the witch, it's the season of the spin
And nobody knows the trouble we're in
It's the season of the witch, it's the season of the spin
Gave all the vampires back to God that day
No one got raped here but the pain's still inside
Well I'll never love you but I've got words to say
No one betrayed here but the memories lie
I said don't go away
Turned off the lights and then you
Said please don't follow me
And you cared
You stole my passion, burned my everything
They're all the same here
Locked up change deep inside
Well I'll never love you but I've got words to say
You killed the feeling but the pain's still alive
I said don't go away
Turned off the lights and then you
Said please don't follow me
And you cared
You kept your feelings hidden like a psycho
Burned it all down, take me with you
Won't you let me go
I said don't go away
Turned off the lights and then you
Said please don't follow me
And you cared
Well I'm so sick
We're just so sick
Sweet little kitten on the porch sleeps in the sun
The sunbeams climb up on the wall
Climbing until they find the rooftop don't stop until the icepicks
Melt in to the floor
Go slowly don't wake me don't shake me up
Easy don't wake up don't shake me up
Small girls with sun warm hands cuddle bring him milk
Then run after make castles in the snow
Jokers juggle in the air rainbow colored fountains of sugar waters flow
Go slowly don't wake me don't shake me up
Easy don't wake up don't shake me up
Roger:
I should tell you, I'm disaster
I forget how to begin it
Mimi:
Let's just make this part go faster
I have yet to be in it
I should tell you
Roger:
I should tell you
Mimi:
I should tell you
Roger:
I should tell you
Mimi:
I should tell I blew the candle out
Just to get back in
Roger:
I'd fogotten how to smile
Until your candle burned my skin
Mimi:
I should tell you
Roger:
I should tell you
Mimi:
I should tell you
Both:
I should tell...
Well, here we go
Now we...
Mimi:
Oh no
Roger:
I know this something is... here goes
Mimi:
Here goes
Roger:
Guess so, it's starting to, who knows?
Mimi:
Who knows?
Both:
Who knows where?
Who goes there?
Who knows?
Here goes...
Trusting desire, starting to learn
Walking through fire without a burn
Clinging a shoulder a leap begins
Stinging and older, asleep on pins
So here we go
Now we...
Roger:
Oh no
Mimi:
I know
Roger:
Oh no
Both:
Who knows where?
Who goes there?
Here goes, here goes
Here goes, here goes
Here goes, here goes
Flowers cut and brought inside
Black cars in a single line
Your family in suits and ties
And you're free
The ache I feel inside
Is where the life has left your eyes
I'm alone for our last goodbye
But you're free
I remember you like yesterday
Yesterday
I still can't believe you're gone
Oh I remember you like yesterday
Yesterday
And until I'm with you, I'll carry on
Adrift on your ocean floor
I feel weightless numb and sore
A part of you and me is torn
You're free
I woke from a dream last night
I dreamt that you were by my side
Reminding me I still had life
In me
I remember you like yesterday
Yesterday
I still can't believe you're gone
Oh I remember you like yesterday
Yesterday
And until I'm with you, I'll carry on
I'll carry on, I'll carry on
Every lament is a love song
Yesterday, yesterday
I still can't believe you're gone
Every lament is a love song
Yesterday, yesterday
So long my friend, so long
Into pattern
Flowing blood
Giving form
In every part
The whole you see
Into pattern
Flowing blood
Giving form
From the moment of commitment, nature conspires to help you
From the moment of commitment, nature conspires to help you
From the moment of commitment, nature conspires to help you
Nature conspires to help you

Harlem River talk to me
Tell me what you think about
Harlem river I'm in love love love love
Harlem River talk to me
Where' we headed now
Harlem River I'm in love love love love
All because of you
In my pearl and my diamond shoe
I climbed a cloud
Now I stole the moon
Harlem River
All because of you
And Harlem River swallow me
Put your hands around my neck
And Harlem River I can't breathe
They've got the lights down now
And Harlem River give me wings
Put my head up in the clouds
And Harlem River all because
Oh I'm nowhere now
Harlem River
The music's true
And in my pearl and diamond shoes
I climbed a cloud
And now I stole the moon
Harlem River
All because of you
And I don't know
I don't know
Just where I'm going
'Cause I've never been
And I don't know
I don't know
Just where I'm going
Or where I've been
Oh Harlem River
Like a diamond
Rattle
That easy rattle
Flow like that Harlem River
Rattle
That easy rattle
Flow like that Harlem River
I ran for you
I ran for you
I ran for you
I ran for you
Hope for me, I hope for you,
We're snowdrops falling through the night.
We'll melt away before we land,
Two teardrops for somebody's hand.
Follow me into just one more Spring.
Copenhagen, you're the end,
Gone and made me a child again.
Warmed my feet beneath cold sheets,
Dyed my hair with your sunny streets.
Children aren't afraid to love
And laugh when life amuses them.
And our love is an antique song
For children's carousels
Instrumental
Escutei alguém abrir os portões
Encontrei no coração multidões
Meu desejo e meu destino brigaram como irmãos
E a manhã semeará outros grãos
Você estava longe, então
Por que voltou
Com olhos de verão
Que não vão entender?
E quanto a mim, te quero sim
Vem dizer que você não sabe
E quanto a mim, não é o fim
Nem há razão pra que um dia acabe
Cada um terá razões ou arpões
Dediquei-me às suas contradições, fissões, confusões
Meu desejo, seu bom senso, raivosos feito cães
E a manhã nos proverá outros pães
Os deuses vendem quando dão
Melhor saber
Seus olhos de verão
Que não vão nem lembrar
E quanto a mim, te quero, sim
Vem dizer que você não sabe
E quanto a mim, não é o fim
Nem há razão pra que um dia acabe
Somos dois contra a parede e tudo tem três lados
E a noite arremessará outros dados
Os deuses vendem quando dão
Melhor saber
Seus olhos de verão
Que não vão nem lembrar
E quanto a mim, te quero, sim
Vem dizer que você não sabe
E quanto a mim, não é o fim
Nem há razão pra que um dia acabe
A million times, my private gang
I faced a star, my heart and hands
Alive
Inside
A move, a glare
A way you move and hold your hands
The dragon fly, and lions dance
A million fates turn up, turn down
Unbutton minds yet unbeknown
And words between your head and mine
We build our private rooms divine
(x2)
A million fates turn up, turn down
Ich steh weit oben am Balkon 
Und seh die Zukunft weit und breit 
Nur Licht, Stahl und Beton 
Die Stadt ist ne WG ohne Gemeinschaftsgeist 
gestapelt wie in Kartons lebt man modern 
Egal wohin man reist
Und schon wieder lieg ich wach 
und so vieles rauscht vorbei 
Warum ist jede stadt auch ein bisschen wie daheim
Wirkt sicher wie eingelebt 
All der Kleinkram neben meinem Bett 
Ich hol mir mein Kaffee und meine Post 
Kommt übers Internet 
Ich schreib allen mir geht es gut 
und wie gut es tut 
mal allein zu sein 
alle meinten "Mensch, du hast Mut" 
Und wie gern würden sie auch mal woanders sein
Und schon wieder lieg ich wach 
und so vieles rauscht vorbei 
Darum ist jede stadt auch ein bisschen wie daheim
Dear unlock the door
You're acting like a child
When you've said it yourself
We are at war
How dare you turn on me now
Right when I need you most
I wish I could have seen their faces when they heard the news
Now that's the sort of smack that leaves a bruise
The victory is ours at last
I beat them at their own dirty game
They pervert the words of god and man
For their own selfish gain
I took their wrong and I took their lies
And I made them right, I made them right
Oh, look who it is
It's my supportive wife
And she thinks she's going to squeal
Hey where do you think you're going?
Don't you walk away from me
You put down that telephone
You're not calling anyone
Ce qui est n'est pas clos
Du point de vue le plus essentiel
Ce qui est ouvert, est à être
Dans une action sans fin
Sans trophée et sans gloire
Une création sans fond
Sans profit ni victoire
Looting the destroyed
Vessels of the sea
I wondered if the waves
Had taken all of me
All of me back
Down to the black
Down to the where the worms reign silent and green
Silent
We can do some wrecking here
Till a little color
Comes into your face
We can do some wrecking here
And find something to love
In this broken place
This broken place
And the king is a hand
And slaps you like a wave
And shackles you down
Bound like an anchored chain in the sand
Sends your ships to the rocks
Sends the keys to the lock of the chain
On your heart
To the mouth of a serpent
And his scaly glass shards
He's holding all the cards
And waiting in the waves
With the poker face
And no trail to trace
No trail to trace
We can do some wrecking here
Till a little color comes into your face
We can do some wrecking here
And find something to love
In this broken place
This broken place
I see you, I see you waiting
I saw you, I saw you standing there
You want it to be over that stone wall
Over that first floor, over that old hotel room
Tell 'em what you're here for, you don't know
Tell 'em what you're here for, you don't know
Oh, you go there, you go there
But you go there, you go there
Yeah, you do
I saw them, I saw them waiting
Why was I, why was I peeking
You want it to be over that stone wall
Over that first floor, over that old hotel room
Tell 'em what you're here for, you don't know
Tell 'em what you're here for, you don't know
Oh, you go there, you go there
But you go there, you go there
Yeah, you do
Bobby stands behind me, feels my pulse
Until the horses run like from the stalls
I know you can win this
You've got too much in this
You're just standing, watch me fall!
I bet you wanted to be over that stone wall
Over that first floor, over that old hotel room
Tell 'em what you're here for, you don't know
Tell 'em what you're here for, you don't know
Oh, you go there, you go there
But you go there, you go there
Yeah, you do
They can say anything they want to say 
Try to bring me down
But I will not allow anyone to succeed
Hanging clouds over me
And they can try hard to make me feel that I 
Don't matter at all
But I refuse to falter in what I believe
Or lose faith in my dreams
'Cause there, there's a light in me
That shines brightly
They can try but they can't take that away from me
Oh, they, they can do 
Anything they want to you
If you let them in
But they won't ever win
If you cling to your pride
And just push them aside
See I, I have learned
There's an inner peace I own 
Something in my soul that they cannot possess
So I won't be afraid and the darkness will fade
'Cause there, there's a light in me 
That shines brightly, yes
They can try but they can't take that away from me
No, they can't take this precious love I'll always have inside me
Certainly the Lord will guide me
Where I need to go
Oh, they can say anything they want to say 
Try to bring me down 
But I won't face the ground
I will rise steadily sailing out of their reach
Oh, Lord, they do try
Hard to make me feel that I don't matter at all
But I refuse to falter in what I believe or lose faith in my dreams
'Cause there's a light in me 
That shines brightly, yes 
They can try but they can't take that away from me
He's in love with tragedy, in love with tragedy
She was a wreck, but he loved her
She was a wreck, but so was he
And the last time he saw Dorie, he didn't know what to say but
"Thank you because you loved me and so, ami
'Cause I didn't want to stay, I didn't want to stay..."
Live, live, live because you love, love, love
And love'll make you give, give, give
And give and when you break, break, break
But you just want to fix yourself
Just to break again...
Cool breeze and autumn leaves
Slow motion daylight
A lone pair of watchful eyes
Oversee the living
Feel the presence all around
A tortured soul
A wound unhealing
No regrets or promises
The past is gone
But you can still be free...
If time will set you free...
Time now to spread your wings
To take to flight
The life endeavor
Aim for the burning sun
You're trapped inside
But you can still be free...
If time will set you free...
But it's a long long way to go
Keep moving way up high
You see the light
It shines forever
Sail through the crimson skies
The purest light
The light that sets you free...
If time will set you free...
Sail through the wind and rain tonight
You're free to fly tonight
And you can still be free...
If time will set you free...
And go high like the mountain tops
And go high like the wind don't stop
And go high
Hoo
Free to fly tonight
Free to fly tonight
Komm, es ist ein schöner Tag.
Setz dich zu uns ins Gras
im Silberweidenpark!
Hier ham wir nicht viel zu tun.
Wir riechen an den Blumen
im Silberweidenpark!
Hör, die Vögel singen ein Lied
als wären sie verliebt.
Im Silberweidenpark!
Fühl die Welt um dich herum
so intensiv und bunt.
Versuch sie zu umarmen!
Oh, dawn broke
Heavy rains made it hard to load
Is it time for the road?
I don't know, don't know
Father has gone
So let's go hold your baby's head
And I won't let go
Of your hand, child of mine
(Child of mine)
When it's time to let go
Then we'll be up in heaven's ground
Every dream that I dream
Let you have more than mine
Spirits will climb
Into a time of your design
All that I know
Never will be told, oh, child of mine
After the flight
Dead of the night, oh, we'll be peaceful
Sweet laughter calls
All of a sudden, no time for waiting
So I'm off on the road
That I see might be coming
And those dreams that I hold
All for this child of mine
All that I know
Never will it show, sweet child of mine
All that I know
Never will be told, oh, child of mine
Sweet child of mine
Oh, child
My blueberry eyes full of love for life
Can't set his feet through starry skies
Dreams are sweet when they turn real
Dreams are sweet when they turn real
Oh, beautiful son, smiling light, good morning son
Sleep so deep, you wake up with a smile
Chase floating fish through space and time
Open your eyes, belly laugh, fill up my heart
Open your eyes, belly laugh, fill up my heart
Oh, beautiful son, smiling light, good morning son, sunshine
Instrumental
I'm standing in the dark
With my innocent hand on my heart
I've changed my plea
I've changed my plea to guilty
Because freedom is wasted on me
See how you're all spoiled again
Outside there is a pain
Emotional air raids exhaust in my heart
And it's safer to be inside
So, I'm changing my plea
And no one can dissuade me
Because freedom is wasted on me
See how you're all spoiled again
Something I have learned
If there is one thing in life I've observed
It's that everybody's got somebody
Oh no, not me
So I've changed my plea to guilty
And reason and freedom is a waste
It's a lot like life
Instrumental
Love and other moments are just chemical reactions in your brain
And feelings of aggression are the absence of the love drug in
Your veins
In your veins
Love come quickly
Because I feel my self-esteem is caving in
It's on the brim
Love come quickly
'Cause I don't think I can keep this monster in
It's in my skin
Love and other socially acceptable emotions are morphine
They're morphine
Cleverly concealing primal urges often felt but rarely seen
Rarely seen
Love I beg you
Lift me up into that privileged point of view
The world of two
Love don't leave me
Because I console myself that Hallmark cards are true
I really do
(2x) I'm gunning down romance
It never did a thing for me
But heartache and misery
Ain't nothing but a tragedy
Love don't leave me
Take these broken wings
I'm going to take these broken wings
And learn to fly
And learn to fly away
And learn to fly away
And learn to fly away
I'm gunning down romance
Dreaming comes so easily
'Cause it's all that I've known
True love is a fairy tale
I'm damaged, so how would I know
I'm scared and I'm alone
I'm ashamed, and I need for you to know
I didn't say all the things that I wanted to say
And you can't take back what you've taken away
'Cause I feel you, I feel you near me
I didn't say all the things that I wanted to say
And you can't take back what you've taken away
'Cause I feel you, I feel you near me
Healing comes so painfully
And it chills to the bone
Will anyone get close to me?
I'm damaged, as I'm sure you know
I'm scared and I'm alone
I'm ashamed and I need for you to know
I didn't say all the things that I wanted to say
And you can't take back what you've taken away
'Cause I feel you, I feel you near me
I didn't say all the things that I wanted to say
And you can't take back what you've taken away
'Cause I feel you, I feel you near me
There's mending for my soul
An ending to this fear
Forgiveness for a man who was stronger
I was just a little girl, but I can't go back
I didn't say all the things that I wanted to say
And you can't take back what you've taken away
'Cause I feel you, I feel you near me
I didn't say all the things that I wanted to say
And you can't take back what you've taken away
'Cause I feel you, oh, I feel you near me
Can't go back
Can't go back
Can't go back
Can't go back
Can't go back
I can't go back
I can't go back
I must go on
I must go on
I must go on
I must go on
I must go on
I must go on
I must go on
Honey, lovin' you is the greatest thing
I get to be myself and I get to sing
I get to play at being irresponsible
I come home late and I love your soul
But I never forget you in my prayers
I never have a bad thing to report
You're my picture on the wall,
You're my vision in the hall
You're the one I'm talking to,
When I get in from my work
You're my guy,
And you don't even know it
You're the funny little frog in my throat
My eyesight's fading, my hearing's dim
I can't get insured for the state I'm in
I'm a danger to myself
I've been starting fights
At the party at the club
On a Saturday night
But I don't get disapproving
From my boy
He gets the all highlights
Wrapped in joy...
You're my picture on the wall,
You're my vision in the hall
You're the one I'm talking to,
When I get in from my work
You're my guy,
And you don't even know it
I am livin' out the life of a poet
I am the jester in the ancient court
You're the funny little frog in my throat
I had a conversation
With you last night
It's a little one sided
But that's all right
I tell you in the kitchen about my day
You sit on the bed
In the dark changing place
With the ghost that was there
Before you came
You've come to save my life again
I don't dare to touch your hand
I don't dare to think of you
In a physical way
And I don't know how you smell
You're the cover of my magazine
You're a fashion tip, a living museum
I'd pay to visit you on rainy sundays
I'll maybe tell you all about it someday
You say my love for you's not real
But you don't know how real it feels
All I want to do is to spend some time with you
So I can hold you, hold you
Your sister says that I'm no good
I'd reassure her if I could
All I want to do is to spend some time with you
So I can hold you, hold you
Plans fail every day
I'd want to hear you say
Your love won't be leaving
Your eyes aren't deceiving
Fears will soon fade away
Smile now, don't be afraid
All I want to do is to spend some time with you
So I can hold you, hold you
So let me whisper in your ear
Don't you worry they can't hear
All I want to do is to spend some time with you
So I can hold you, hold you
Narrator:
A lovestruck Romeo sings the streets a serenade
Laying everybody low with a love song that he made
Finds a street light, steps out of the shade
Says something like, "You and me babe, how about it?"
Juliet says, "Hey it's Romeo, you nearly gave me a heart attack"
He's underneath the window, she's singing, "Hey la, my boyfriend's back
You shouldn't come around here, singing up at people like that"
Anyway, what you gonna do about it?
Romeo:
Juliet, the dice was loaded from the start
And I bet, then you exploded in my heart
And I forget, I forget, the movie song
When you gonna realize, it was just that the time was wrong, Juliet?
Come up on different streets, they both were streets of shame
Both dirty, both mean, yes and the dream was just the same
And I dreamed your dream for you, and now your dream is real
How can you look at me as if I was just another one of your deals?
Well you can fall for chains of silver, you can fall for chains of gold
You can fall for pretty strangers and the promises they hold
You promised me everything, you promised me thick and thin yeah
Now you just say, "Oh Romeo, yeah, you know I used to have a scene with him"
Juliet, when we made love you used to cry
You said "I love you like the stars above, I'll love you till I die"
There's a place for us, you know the movie song
When you gonna realize, it was just that the time was wrong, Juliet?
I can't do the talk like the talk on the TV
And I can't do a love song, like the way it's meant to be
I can't do everything, but I'll do anything for you
I can't do anything 'cept be in love with you
And all I do is miss you, and the way we used to be
All I do is keep the beat, the bad company
And all I do is kiss you, through the bars of a rhyme
Julie, I'd do the stars with you, anytime
Ah Juliet, when we made love you used to cry
You said I love you like the stars above, I'll love you till I die
There's a place for us, you know the movie song
When you gonna realize, it was just that the time was wrong, Juliet?
Narrator:
And a lovestruck Romeo he sings the streets a serenade
Laying everybody low, with a love song that he made
Find a convenient streetlight, steps out of the shade
And says something like, "You and me babe, how 'bout it?"
Romeo:
"You and me babe, how about it?"
As I exhale I think of questions to ask myself
What's your plan do you think you're a man
Has your small amount of success gone to your head yet
I wanna be an astronaut and get high
Break the barrier of sound into the sky
Just wanna be free
From the confines of gravity
As I take it all in the altitude has an effect on my skin
I grow a space suit in the blink of an eye
And shortly after, the atmosphere comes to life
Follow me down to the laughing city,
With people changing all their minds; it's crazy
I want this ma'am, that ma'am, no sir, yes ma'am, that sir;
Well, I'll tell you one thing, if you're keeping something...
Then hold on, hold on the to the ones you love
Hold on, hold on to the ones you love
Let's not fight, (that's not nice) that is where you'll find me
Let's not be sore, (that's not right) that is where you'll find me
Come home late,
I know you're sick of working,
You're feeling down because your head is hurting,
So you don't talk
Then hold on, hold on to the ones you love
Hold on, hold on to the ones you love
Let's not fight, (that's not nice) that is where you'll find me
Let's not be sore, (that's not right) that is where you'll find me
Wander along together by the edge of the river
Hush little baby, don't you cry? Cross over to the other side of the water
You and I, we could live in peace like this, in peace like this
Gaze up at the moon hanging low in the sky, onlookers appear around us
Gaze up at the moon hanging low in the sky as we slip away into the darkness
You and I, we could live in peace like this, in peace like this
You and I belong in dreams like this
You and I, we could live in peace like this, in peace like this
When all the numbers swim together and all the shadows settle
When doors forced open shut again a flytrap and a petal
My eyes burn and claws rush in to fill them
And in the morning after the night I fall in love with the light
It is so clear I realize and here at last I have my eyes
When all the figures sound retreat the soft skin starts to shrivel
When dreams made real become less sweet the orchid and the metal
My sex turns and claws rush in to spill them
And in the morning after the night I fall in love with the light
It is so pure I can arrive without the fear of seeing my eyes
When all the characters full size and every moon is level
When all the spirits burn in lies as center grief by steel
My eyes burn and claws rush in to fill them
But in the morning after the night I fall in love with the light
It is so clear I realize and now at last I have my eyes
I called you, she answered.
Got strangled on the way.
She gave you the phone, said it was for you.
Didn't know, didn't know, didn't know,
Didn't know you got yourself a new friend.
If you need a friend
You can call me again
I won't call you cause of your new friend
It's harder than I thought
Being on my own
Remember you said you needed me there
It's too late, it's too late, too late, too late
And you got yourself a new friend
If you need a friend
You can call me again
I won't call you cause of your new friend
As a young boy daddy used to tell me stories
Do your thing my son the world is yours
The winds of fury will lead to paths of glory
Take it in your stride my son the world is yours
You can only find the gold by digging in the dirt
If your gonna play with fire, then you're gonna get burnt
You can never reach the heighst and avoid the hurt yeah
The world is yours
As a young boy daddy used to tell me stories
Do your thing and sing the world is yours
The winds of fury pave the way to paths of glory
Keep your self onside ny son and the world is yours
Yeah you might have it all but you'll still want more
There's a law for the rich and another for the poor
There's a golden key unlock all the doors
And the world is yours
The world is yours
The world is yours, the world is yours
There, s a time and a place for everything
Not a man alive you owe a thing
From the stars in the sky to the ocean floor the world is yours
The world is yours
The world is yours, the world is yours
People say they're never gonna turn away
And then wnen it comes on top
They'll be firs to turn their backs away
First whose heads are gonna drop
First to slowly fade away
So remember all your days the world is yours and all the world contains
Well you might have it all but you'll still want more
There's a law for the rich and another for the poor
There's a golden key unlocks all the doors
And the world is yours, the world is yours
The world is yours, the world is yours
Never had an easy love
Never had an easy love
Like the one I'm dreaming of
Find the hand that fits the glove
Of love
Of love
Talking to a friend yesterday
It was good to hear him say
That although 2 years had past
Still felt like she could ask my time
My time
Seems I did something right
Something right
Looking for another pearl
Trouble loves me
Trouble needs me
Two things
More than you do
Or would attempt to
So, console me
Otherwise, hold me
Just when it seems like
Everything's evened out
And the balance
Seems serene
Trouble loves me
Walks beside me
To chide me
Not to guide me
It's still much more
Than you'll do
So, console me
Otherwise, hold me
Just when it seems like
Everything's evened out
And the balance seems serene
See the fool I'll be
Still running 'round
On the flesh rampage
Still running 'round
Ready with ready-wit
Still running 'round
On the flesh rampage - At your age!
Go to Soho, oh
Go to waste in
The wrong arms
Still running 'round
Trouble loves me
Seeks and finds me
To charlatanize me
Which is only
As it should be
Oh, please fulfill me
Otherwise, kill me
Show me a barrel and watch me scrape it
Faced with the music, as always I'll face it
In the half-light
So English, frowning
Then at midnight I
Can't get you out of my head
A disenchanted taste
Still running 'round
A disenchanted taste
Still running 'round
In this garden full of good
Lies a garden full of evil
Awaits strange, bizarre,
Unusual people
Here is where
Tripping and nobody cares
Here is where
The setting sun is never feared
It goes on and on and on
Oh, it never ends
It goes on and on and on
Welcome My Friends...
Beneath The Tree of heaven
Lies The Horror Of The Clay
Beneath The Tree of heaven
Come as you please, do as you may
Crooked minds
Like a crooked tree
Never caring where one's branches have been
Or where they're gonna be
People so seedy
People so greedy
But in the end,
Ain't we all a little needy?
The sidewalks are dirty
The gutters are dry
The summer is over
My bones are inside
This dance is difficult
This dance is hard
This makes me wanna spin
'Round in the yard
Asleep in my bedroom
My eyes open wide
I hope I get out soon
Get lost in the tide
This dance is difficult
This dance is hard
This makes me wanna spin
'Round in the yard
And when I get thirsty
From drinking the ocean
And my blood is burning
From all the commotion
This dance is difficult
This dance is hard
This makes me wanna spin
'Round in the yard
Love is an arrow
Shot through the sky
The streets are all narrow
The rivers are wide
This dance is difficult
This dance is hard
This makes me wanna spin
'Round in the yard
This dance is difficult
This dance is hard
This makes me wanna spin
'Round in the yard
This dance is difficult
This dance is hard
This makes me wanna spin
'Round in the yard
Driving in my Saab
On my way to Ireland
It's been a long time
It's been a long time
Driving with my friends
On my way to Ireland
It's been a long time
It's been a long time
So when I was out in the desert
And a cowboy tried to lasso me
He said you're red and made of clay, a virgin portrait
I let him wake me but decided not to stay
Driving in my Saab
On my way to Ireland
It's been a long time
It's been a long time
Driving with my friends
On my way to Ireland
It's been a long time
It's been a long time
Next in New York I fell out with a dragon
Of the white collar kind but just as ferocious
I remembered Macha running faster than the horses
Then an encounter with a voice that caressed me
Driving in my Saab
On my way to Ireland
It's been a long time
A long time
Driving with my friends
On my way to Ireland
It's been a long time
A long time
Wasn't it you who held off a surrender
To one spoiled nun who taught you the names
Of the mountains on the moon and then a Jesuit
Proceeded to arrange your soul while I prayed on my knees
Driving in my Saab
On my way to Ireland
It's been a long time
A long time
Driving with my friends, yes
On my way to Ireland
It's been a long time
A long time
Such a long, long time
It's been a long time
A long time
Good good timin'
Good good timin'
Ah Ah
You need good timin'
Good good timin'
All us people
Now we're just livin'
The world keeps turnin'
And we're all learnin'
About
Good good timin'
Good good timin'
Ah Ah
You need good timin'
It takes good timin'
You need good timin'
Good good timin'
We're all goin' places
Sharin' each other
A celebration
Of being together
I love
Good good timin'
Good good timin'
Ah Ah
You need good timin'
It takes good timin'
You need good timin'
Yeah
Good good timin'
Dow dow
Dow dow dow
Dow dow
Dow dow dow dow
You need good timin'
It takes good timin'
You need good timin'
Yeah
Good good timin'
There's a man in the street
Who tells me that he loves me
God is everywhere
He says he lives above me
I know more about this man
Than I know about you
Further than we go
In what we go through
We are small
We are small people (x4)
There's a day in a month
When I know why we're here
And no one drags us down
When you flip my gear
My mother doesn't love you
Even though she tries
I told her so many things
I forget the lies
We are small
We are small people (x4)
You will take the whole of me (x8)
The whole of me
Instrumental
You spread your rusty fingers across the ledge.
You get your grip and peer down over the edge.
You watch the city move and breathe and migrate.
You're not apart of it. You're broken now, like us.
I turn and brush the birds from off my shoulders.
And cross side-walks with an earful of white noise.
You sit up on your perch for the rest of the night.
You watch the moon and hope the damn thing crumbles.
You count the stars reflecting in the windows.
And then you realize just how minimal you are.
I stop and watch the airplanes leave the city.
And I silently wish I was on one.
You sit down slow and watch yourself in the glass.
You reach inside and tear out all your cables.
Snakes of smoke are dripping from your fingers.
You have no body, just a cage to hold your parts.
I have no answers; I'm rambling.
I was never one to solve whatever has gone wrong.
You lie down on the roof and watch the sun rise.
Its burning fingers rummage through your insides.
And for a moment you feel like you're alive.
And then it's gone, so you get up.
Up, up, baby. There's blood on the sidewalks of this town.
They've got us on the ropes. But we don't have to take it lying down anymore.
Our hands aren't tied now.
Down, down, baby. Down in the in the center of this town.
They've got 'em buried deep.
Under layers of concrete are the bones of our past.
(Oh no, no)
We'll leave on the evening train.
It won't be long, but it feels that way.
But home never meant very much to us anyway.
So we convince ourselves that we're better off gone.
And maybe we're right.
And we collapse on a road.
On an old dirt road, where the sun doesn't look like such a waste.
And we fall asleep, under leaves of a couple of them nearby tress.
And we never wake again.
If your wandering ever leads you
To a place where you don't know which road to choose
Leave your worries behind
Take the road that leads to mine
And I'll be waiting there for you
If your dreaming ever wakes you
And you find your dreaming wasn't true
Wipe the sleep from your eyes
Leave the nightmares behind
And I'll dream a better dream for you
If your fortune ever fails you
And you're down without a dime to see you through
There's still luck that you can find
You have a piece of mine
Yeah, I'll make a wish for you
If your lover ever leaves you
And you find yourself with no one left to lose
You don't have to be alone
Take the road that leads you home
And I'll be waiting there for you...
...I'll be waiting there for you
Esta tarde de sol me puse a mirar
tu postal bajo un haz de luz
(radiante luz)
una frase duró hasta el anochecer
recordarte es un hermoso lugar
Amo tu lucidez
leo tu desnudez
cuando pensás el mar
así te pienso igual
Si el lenguaje es otra piel
toquémonos más
con mensajes de deseo
si el lenguaje es otra piel
toquémonos más
con mensajes de deseo
(deseo)
No voy a endurecer
letras que dan placer
me contengo de amarte más
hasta volverte a ver
Si el lenguaje es otra piel
toquémonos más
con mensajes de deseo
si el lenguaje es otra piel
toquémonos más
con mensajes de deseo
deseo
Kan du mer enn ditt Fader Vår
Kaster du ingen skygge
Ja, da har du lovet bort din sjel
og vil til bestandighet
Ha en med prillahorn
Som ser på deg fra skyggen
English translation:
Can you more than your Lord's Prayer
Do you not cast a shadow
Yes, then you have given your soul away
and will to persistence
Have with you a prillahorn
That looks at you from the shadow
You'll walk unscathed through musket fire
No ploughman's blade will cut thee down
No cutlass wound will mar thy face
And you will be my ain true love
And you will be my ain true love
And as you walk through death's dark veil
The cannons' thunder can't prevail
And those who hunt thee down will fail
And you will be my ain true love
And you will be my ain true love
Asleep inside the cannon's mouth
The captain cries "Here comes the rout!"
They'll seek to bind me North and South
I've gone to find my ain true love
The field is cut and bleeds to red
The cannonballs fly 'round my head
The infirmary man may count me dead
When I've gone to find my ain true love
I've gone to find my ain true love
A Young girl give me a good luck charm
Put a snake on my neck and a bird on my arm
Got one good leg 'cause the other went south
Got a brand new crutch and a brand new mile
Ouch
I got a sheriff's name branded where I should of kept clean
If you get to close your gonna know what I mean
And I know when I'm older the only running gonna come
Away from my lips and the fork of my tonuge
Huh-uuh
It only gets to me, in times like these
And times like these are getting to me
He-eee
Put your hand in the oven there's A heaven in side
And it burns straight through but the devil don't mind
'Cause it takes what it wants and it find what's you hide
And it'll buy you a place on the lowery side
Child
I rolled a number last night and walked in my sleep
And I can feel all the nerves in the tips of my teeth
As they crumbled into dust and washed into the sea
I finally shut my mouth so I can here my self think
Sing
It only gets to me, in times like these
It only gets to me, in times like these
It only gets to me, in times like these
And times like these are getting to me
He-ee
All of us are falling
It's in everything
Hold on to nothing
Don't count on anything
The earth is falling too
It doesn't stop at night
See this glass is falling
And no I'm not alright 
Even the low are falling
Even the lying
All of us are going down
It's not just the flying 
You're tall and you are skinny
Stunning when you sleep
Ecstasy and sadness
I almost couldn't wash the sheets
Even you are falling
When you're turning out the lights
Strange and lovely facts for us
Who cannot sleep at night 
Even the brave are falling
Even the boring
All of us are going down so
Just try to ignore it 
Even the streets are falling
Look at the houses
All of us are going down and
It's not alright, no 
The cars and the trucks are falling
The buses are kneeling
You're shot and you're going down so
Get used to the feeling
The river is deep and the road is long
Daylight comes and I want to go home
Awoke this morning
To find my people's tongues were tied
And in my dreams
They were given books to poison their minds
The river is deep and the mountain high
How long before the other side?
We are their mortar
Their building bricks and their clay
Their gold teeth mirror
Both our joys and our pain
The river is deep and the ocean wide
Who will show us how to read the signs?
The earth is our mother
She taught us to embrace the light
Now the lord is master
She suffers an eternal night
You blocked up my ears
You plucked out my eyes
You cut out my tongue
You fed me with lies
Oh lord
Oh lord
Oh lord
Oh lord
I care about you baby, baby
More than you'll ever know
More than you'll ever know
Please do not drive me crazy, crazy
Unless you're gonna go
With me
No pressure
No pressure, I know you're real
The pressure
The pressure will make you feel
Up till the sun rises
There's no compromising
I know, I know, I know
You are such a liar
I never denied you
I was for sure
But it's really out of my control
The way you feel is not my problem
I don't wanna see you go
But I don't have time to solve this
And you don't have the right
After all you put me through
I'm starting to realise
Pressure
The pressure I know you feel
Pressure
The pressure just keep it real
Major weed smoke in the air
Pass it like you just don't care
Have you seen my fucks to give?
I have none, I cannot live with
The pressure
The pressure you know I feel
The pressure
The pressure to keep it real
Pay attention to the signs
Stay and listen, you will find
Everything, ain't rocket science
Every gem is not a diamond
But the pressure
The pressure will make you feel
The pressure
The pressure
The pressure
The pressure will make you feel...
Real
Got me going on again
Around my smile
And I've got a thoughtless feeling inside
I've got it going X4
On...
Got you going on again
Around my smile
And I've got a thoughtless feeling inside
Why don't you take a friend
In the shade
Somewhere all the minutes stay around
I've got it going on X4
On...
Got you going on again
Around my smile
And I've got a thoughtless feeling inside
I've got it going... X14
Some bed of roses I have given you
Some bed of roses I have given you
You're gonna stand up
Some bed of nails I have given you
Everybody's been there, I just live there too
You don't stand up
It's completely normal
Well, I guess I guess I guess
Wanna be on the right end
Will I know if I stay here tomorrow?
Will I know I won't be just fine?
Will I know if I stay here tomorrow?
Will I know I won't be just fine?
It's completely morbid
I'm a guest a guest a guest
Wanna be on the right end
Ooh, answer my dying wish
Ooh, answer my dying wish
If there's a scream inside of you just let it go
You're beating yourself up baby don't you know
You've got to get through and lift the roof off your soul
It's like a pain locked in a part of your heart
It's never gonna leave it unless you start
To warm it up, be wise and be smart
Out on the ocean
There's no one around
No one to hear a sound
It's just us out here
Out on the ocean
Speaking freely
Away from the city
Away from the ears that
Bug us and judge us
It's so liberating
To be free
And my heart slows down
Nice and easy
And your breathing will be pleasing
Just speak easy
And say what's on your mind
I search for something to compare you to
Thought long and hard for a simile true
Now I'm suddenly aware
End the quest you're beyond compare
So speak easy
If there's a shadow in your life then there's sunshine
Things turning inside out all the time
Just rewind, it's all in your mind
Ooh so speak easy
Out here we're floating
Late in the night
And the only light to guide us
Is a full moon that's glowing
On the sea
Nice and easy
And your breathing will be pleasing
Just speak easy
And say what's on your mind
I search for something to compare you to
Thought long and hard for a simile true
Now I'm suddenly aware
End the quest you're beyond compare
So speak easy
Speak easy
Speak easy
Speak easy
Saving all the waitresses
'Cause they've all got longing in their eyes
Little acorn becomes the mighty oak
The oak throws its seeds to the sky
Drive your car up to the pole
That's as far as you can go
Take your coat off when you know
To warm you bones in the northern snow
Drop a feather in the water
What the ocean gives the sky will take
Killing swans with twenty-one guns
Just to see them fall into the lake
When driving up the coast
To your left is a black mass
Drive your car until you see
To wet your tongue with the salty sea
Float your paper boat up the creek
And watch the waves from its wake
Killing swans with twenty-one guns
Just to see them fall to see them break
Drive your car up to the pole
That's as far as you can go
Take your coat off when you know
To warm you bones in the northern snow
In the northern snow
In the northern snow
In the northern snow
In the northern snow
Morpha too small you're going to hurt yourself
I might call and I might need some help
I'm and old show and I don't know what to do
I'm in love with you.
Kitty asked me to read her stars
I had liked her from afar
Going to play with your heart
I knew not to start
But there you are.
Ich kletter hoch
es rollen Steine
und sie fallen auf Dich drauf
Du siehst sie kommen
gehst nicht zur Seite
Du dachtest Du fängst sie auf
Du greifst nach meiner Hand
wir sinken in den Sand
ich halt Dich fest so gut ich kann
doch wir kommen nicht voran
Du siehst mir ins Gesicht
ich seh alles
nur Dich nicht
zusammen allein
denn wir haben kein 
Alphabet das wir Beide teilen
die Spur hinter uns hält uns zusammen
doch auch sie zerfällt irgendwann
ich weiß dass unter uns beiden der Boden bricht
Ich kann nicht mit
und nicht ohne Dich
vielleicht besser ohne Dich
Du hast gekocht
es gab Steine
die liegen jetzt in meinem Bauch
sie sind schwer
ich bin alleine
bitte wer
schneidet mich auf
Das Spiel ist neu
Du bist kalt
und ich betäubt
mein Herz voll mein Kopf leer
gestern war es umgekehrt
Du bist
haushoch am Horizont
ich seh Dich an beim Näherkommen
seh wie Du bist und wie wir sind
dass wir nicht zufrieden sind
Wir gehn ein Stück weg
kommen zurück
und wir erkennen das perfekte Glück
war, ist und bleibt ein Fiebertraum
und wir sind echt
Ich kann nicht mit
und nicht ohne dich
aber vor allem nicht ohne dich
Long long way to the top
Long way down if you fall
It's a long way back
If you get lost
Long way out to the air
It's a long way to go
To lose your friends
It's a long way to haul
All the traps you've trawled
When you could just stop and let go
And you say not now, maybe later
But not now, maybe later
But not now, maybe later
(You're only in your way)
But not now, maybe later
(You're only in your way)
Maybe... wait...
'Cause love is tough
When enough is not enough
It's not enough...
Not enough...
It's not enough...
Not enough...
Not enough...
In her youth she made tons of pence
Ghost-penning songs for big haired aristocrats
Now she lies in a plush, velvet bed
Shaped like a coffin and filled with bats and
She's pale and 
I am smitten and
In the moonlight we both still like
The smell of anything
Night blooming
And she bites through necks like a Ginsu
My sweet sweet heartkiller
My sweet sweet heartkiller
My sweet sweet heartkiller
My sweet sweet heartkiller
Next to walls that jut from the earth
Like frozen trajectories of superheroes
We nibble and jest about things that drain and the taste of lust and
She is over here
And I am over there
And the unlucky dark cloud is in the middle
We like to time ourselves
We like to watch ourselves
And her winks cut through me like a Ginsu
My sweet sweet heartkiller
My sweet sweet heartkiller
My sweet sweet heartkiller
My sweet sweet heartkiller
And everything's good
And everything's fine
And everything's bitter like sweet things should be

My time is the right time,
And the feeling isn't even my time.
Why are there so many records of my life,
Why can't I just curl up onto the night,
Why can't I just curl up onto problems and get missed of my own life.
It's colder in house than you think,
It's colder in your bones,
And in your bones it is so cold,
And in your bones it is so cold and sick.
The brawling of a sparrow in the eaves,
The brilliant moon and all the milky sky,
And all that famous harmony of leaves,
Had blotted out man's image and his cry.
A girl arose that had red mournful lips
And seemed the greatness of the world in tears,
Doomed like Odysseus and the labouring ships
And proud as Priam murdered with his peers;
Arose, and on the instant clamorous eaves,
A climbing moon upon an empty sky,
And all that lamentation of the leaves,
Could but compose man's image and his cry.
(From the poem "The Sorrow of Love" by William Butler Yeats)
Last boat, stand in the river
Muddy river, high, eye-level
Hawk flying, is fooling his folly
Gas hurricanes spread over Heaven
Weeping willow
Is bawling goodbye
On fire
Humans running for cover
Wishing for life, gripping the light
House lift up, trees lift out
Cars intersect in the middle of the sky
All time fell
No pull, no gravity on the ground
Given up, it's over
The world's weight is over limit
Our bodies are exploding
As the sky spills through our mouths
All the blue blood is flowing
The cities, its contents have been ripped out
The world is gone
Did you know you could last this long?
You made it to the dark, now you're gone
You are gone
Great waves
Frozen in a secret space
Great big place
Dark, spilling universe
Last boat, stand in the river
Don't be a toy on the back of a magazine, don't, don't be a toy, on the back of a magazine, there's a caricature no one reads
I know you've got a lot of special things to do with me I'm through, I know, it's all right, sing along.
Practice everything you preach you nun,
I got none today, expecting none tomorrow, and tomorrow after that release the strings of nashville, and watch the songs expire.
And silence is danger, but it's not required here, so why you scared?
I know, you got alot of special things to do, with me I'm through, I know, its all right.
Sing a song, get you through the night.
The longest train I ever saw
Went down that Georgia line
The engine went by at six o'clock
And the cab went by at nine
In the pines
In the pines
The sun never shines
And we shiver
When the north wind blows
Well I asked the captain
For the time of day
He said he
Threw his watch away
A long steel rail
And a short cross tie
And I'm on my
Way back home
In the pines
In the pines
The sun never shines
And we shiver
When the north wind blows
Little girl
Little girl
What have I done
That makes you treat me this way
Well you have caused
Me to weep
You caused me to moan
You caused me to leave my home
In the pines
In the pines
The sun never shines
And we shiver
When the north wind blows
You're used the sound of a heart that's breaking
I know it don't phase you anymore
You're the king of the game that you played
I know you played it a 100 times before
You fill your bedroom up with trophies
Then you get a kick out of closing the door
Got all the words to keep on hoping,
I know you're said them a 100 times before
But then there's me, a fox for your gun
Then there's me, just love me for fun
Then there's me no use or pretend
Oh there's me, 101
I might as well stand in front of a bullet
Close my eyes and kick the chair to the floor
It's like a speeding train is coming,
I know you've crashed it 100 times before
Then there's me, a fox for your gun
Then there's me, just love me for fun
Uh there's me no, no use in pretending
Oh there's me, 101
Everybody says I gotta be crazy
That I deserve everything that I get
But I got a feeling that makes me wanna ignore all
That you've done 100 times before
'Cause then there's me, could I be the one
And baby there's me to make you undone
Uh darling there's me no, no use in pretending
Oh there's me, 101
Me, me, 101
So I gotta be, I gotta be, I gotta be 101
Maybe it's time, maybe it's me
Maybe I could be, let me pretend
I wanna be, I gotta be 101,
Yeah baby
I feel like I'm losing my mind with no concept of time,
I've got no space.
And I wake up everyday in the same place,
And it's you that keeps me sane,
And this lesson I've learned, I've learned it the hard way.
Just look into my eyes, they'll never lie.
And I'm only halfway sober,
And it's not getting me any closer.
When words got me down, you keep me up.
Me up, me up, you keep me up, me up, me up.
You keep me up at night when I'm worried sick about you,
And no one ever said it would be that easy without you.
And I can't keep my hands from shaking,
Baby, you're the only one that can save me.
Just look into my eyes, they'll never lie to you.
And I'm only halfway sober,
And it's not getting me any closer.
When words got me down, you keep me up
And I'm only halfway sober, and it's not getting me any closer,
And I'm only halfway sober, and it's not getting me any closer.
Just look into my eyes, they'll never lie.
And I'm only halfway sober,
And it's not getting me any closer.
And you and I can get through any weather,
And I'm only halfway sober.
When words got me down you keep me,
When words got me down, you keep me up
This damn machine, this damn machine, this broken head doesn't work. 
So they're selling it off again. 
These crooked legs, these twisted arms, these tired feet lost their worth. 
Soon they'll dismantle them. 
But we're all just part of some giant grand machine. 
Too big to really understand. 
But we'll do our jobs till we break down and fall. 
Now we just sleepwalk. We drift through the week. 
A dead procession always dragging its feet. Well, come on. 
Our hands are swollen. We all need to sleep. 
But there's no time, just stitch us up so we'll keep. 
We're all just part of someone's elaborate plan. 
Chess pieces in some grandiose scheme. 
But we'll do our jobs till we break down and fall
I met you through a common friend
In the attic of my parents house
And though I didn't know it then
I soon was finding out
You are the roots that sleep beneath my feet 
And hold the earth in place
Each time a faucet opens
Words are spoken
The water runs away 
And I hear your name
No, nothing has changed
There was this book I read and loved
The story of a ship
Who sailed around the world and found
That nothing else exists
Beyond his own two sails
And wooden shell 
And what is held within
All else is sure to pass
We clutch and grasp
And debate what's truly permanent
But when the wind starts to shift
There's no argument
I sing and drink and sleep on floors
And try hard not to be annoyed
By all these people worrying about me
So when I'm suffering through some awful drive
You occasionally cross my mind
It's my hidden hope that you are still among them
Well are you?
Oh, you are the roots that sleep beneath my feet 
And hold the earth in place
Each time a curtain opens
Sunlight pours in
A lifetime melts away
And we share a name
On some picturesque grave
If I could fly, I'd be coming right back home to you
I think I might give up everything, just ask me to
Pay attention, I hope that you listen 'cause I let my guard down
Right now I'm completely defenseless
For your eyes only, I show you my heart
For when you're lonely and forget who you are
I'm missing half of me when we're apart
Now you know me, for your eyes only
For your eyes only
I've got scars, even though they can't always be seen
And pain gets hard, but now you're here and I don't feel a thing
Pay attention, I hope that you listen 'cause I let my guard down
Right now I'm completely defenseless
For your eyes only, I show you my heart
For when you're lonely and forget who you are
I'm missing half of me when we're apart
Now you know me, for your eyes only
For your eyes only
I can feel your heart inside of mine
(I feel it, I feel it)
I've been going out of my mind
(I feel it I feel it)
Know that I'm just wasting time
And I hope that you don't run from me
For your eyes only, I show you my heart
For when you're lonely and forget who you are
I'm missing half of me when we're apart
Now you know me, for your eyes only
For your eyes only, I show you my heart
For when you're lonely and forget who you are
I'm missing half of me when we're apart
Now you know me, for your eyes only
For your eyes only
For your eyes only
When you come around, everything else disappears, my ears disappear
When you come around, everything else vanishes
The crowds slowly fade when you come around
Everything evaporates when you come around, around, around
On the news at night, they talk about the disappearances
They interview the people who were witnesses
Most are shocked, some don't care
When you come around, everything else disappears, my mouth disappears
When you come around, everything else vanishes
The birds have no heads when you come around
Everything loses its legs when you come around, around, around
On the news at night, they talk about the abnormalities
They interview the people who are authorities
Most are intrigued, some don't care when you come around
When you are near, I feel so far away from the person I am
Alone I feel like I'm jumping on a trampoline
When you come around, everything else disappears, my eyes disappear
When you come around, everything else vanishes
The sunlight swims away when you come around
And even darkness won't stay when you come around, around, around
Around, around, around
They say it takes a ring of gold
To fix the outer shell
So hold on until they return
Enslave the native tongue
To mine their freedom out
So hold on and don't give in
Our world is only what we're told
How do we know?
Life spans 1000 years have gone
But just a minute above
So hold on until they return
Sheltered thoughts and fears
If they claim what's theirs
So hold on and don't give in
Fading out, now we're fading out.
Somewhere down the road, you're gonna find a place
It seems so far, but it never is
And You won't need to stay, but you might lose your strength
On the way
Sometimes you may feel you're the only one
'Cause all the things you thought were safe, ooh now they're gone
But you won't be alone, I'll be here to carry you along
Watching you till all the work is done
And When you find your heart, you'd better run with it
'Cause when she comes along, she could be breaking it
No there's nothing wrong, you're learning to be strong
Don't look back
She may soon be gone, so don't look back
She's not the only one, remember that
If your heart is beating fast, then you know she's right
If you don't know what to say, well, that's all right
You don't know what to do?
Remember she is just as scared as you
Don't be shy, umm... when it hurts to say
Remember, you're gonna get hurt someday, anyway
Then you must lift your head, keep it there
Remember what I said
I'll always be with you don't forget
Just look over your shoulder I'll be there.
If you look behind you, I will be there.
I had a plan, was all made up
An angel was sent for keeping all troubles away
'Cause lady and I, we could not stop
As cool as a sigh, as volatile as something you say
I had a dream, a simple plot
I held out my hand as if she'd never pushed it away
The sun is still there, except it's not
Beside her I care to linger even though it's not safe
God-awful I adore you
Angels were there before you
Nothing can stop what we do
It's breaking us up in two
Hey, maybe should we ask it: could our friends be worthier?
Like things we trust for if we must, we must burn them
And burn them good, real friends they would be understanding if
It came to us and us, we must, we must turn to
The God of small things
The God of small things
I had a plan, was all made up
As good it was, then the magic hour seemed to be fading
'Cause lady and I, we could not stop
As cool as a sigh, as murderous as something you say
God-awful I adore you
Angels were there before you
Nothing can stop what we do
It's breaking us up in two
There is room if you can trust
For anyone like us
We were walking down the block when we thought the bomb went off
And our hearts nearly stopped at the sound
When we looked and we found that it hit some other crowd
I was glad it wasn't us, yeah I was proud
'Cause I fall and I break just as easy as an egg
Yeah, my shell isn't as hard as it seems
When my insides gush out there's no telling what it's about
When it'll stop, when it'll seed, when it'll bleed
Yeah, I just stay in my home, in my home, in my home
Yeah, I just stay in my home, in my home, in my home
Well, I take a look outside at the pretty girls outside
But I can't make myself say "Hi" because I'm scared
Because I spend all this time all locked up inside
It's the only place I know how to bare
Cause you can go out and meet some girl you can't defeat
And you think that she must be the one
Until you're walking down the isle and she takes away your smile
Boy you wish you hadn't dialed before you wrung
Oh you should stay in your home, in your home, in your home
Oh you should stay in your home, in your home, in your home
Well they talk of your past, yeah they said it wouldn't last
But they're running pretty fast back on their word
It was gone for a while but it's coming back in style
Better run back where you're from and join the mass
Yeah we'll just stay in our home, in our homes
Yeah we'll just stay in our home, in our homes
Instrumental
Sometimes I get so tired,
Just trying to find a place to lay my head.
I look up to the sky,
I feel the warmest light comfort me.
I've seen the great heights,
Reminding me that I'm alive.
I don't wanna die,
I don't wanna waste another day,
Or night,
I know there's something more
Than what we're living for,
I see it in the stars,
I feel it on the shore,
I know there's something,
I know there's something more.
I think we're all afraid,
That we might be alone,
Alone down here.
We all want to have some faith,
At least that's true in my case,
To just believe.
I've seen the great heights,
Reminding me that I'm alive.
I don't wanna die,
I don't wanna waste another day,
Or night,
I know there's something more
Than what we're living for,
I see it in the stars,
I feel it on the shore,
I know there's something...
This world may crumble into the ocean,
It could all end tonight.
I undermined you,
Then try to find you,
My only source of light.
I'm breathing,
I am breathing,
I am alive.
I don't wanna die,
I don't wanna waste another day or night.
I know there's something more
Than what we're living for.
I see it in the stars,
I feel it on the shore,
I know that I'm alive.
I don't wanna die.
I don't wanna waste another day or night.
I know there's something more
Than what we're living for.
I see it in the stars,
I feel it on the shore,
I know there's something more.
Have you, have you been keeping secrets from me?
Hoped I wouldn't find out
And you'd just go free
There's a whole world outside your window pane
And I've got scars to prove it
But you should have known,
You should have known,
You should have known,
You should have known
Run, you can run, you can run
We'll find you
Was is it everything you hoped it would be
What kept your world spinning
Left you diseased
Your apologies will never sooth the sting
Just keep scratching our eyes out
You should have known,
You should have known,
You should have known
Run, you can run, you can run
We'll find you
Run, you can run, you can run
We'll find you
We'll find you
When I'm riding home at night now
I get in so tired
To the saws and bows that spell out
E-M-P-T-Y
But driving west now, half past five
My skin is cut, my hands are knives
I could be anyone alive
But I just can't fit and it's too late to quit
When the night air comes to me
I wonder if the days I've lived through count
With the world strung like a rosary
Through faces moving in the crowd
What is the colour and the number
When the happiness begins?
When the knight waits in the laurels
Hesitating
I found a clarity I'd never known
In fag-end weeks before I left for school
The darkness in the pylons and the smoke and creosote
Canceling the faces that we knew
Did they forget the light inside your eyes?
Those simple words, those lover's sighs?
The hand is dealt, the cards are played
But I just can't fit and it's too late to acquit
I saw them and I knew them all
Inside a sheet of flame
I saw them and I knew them all
Inside a sheet of flame
When I'm riding home at night now
I get in so tired
To the saws and bows that spell out
E-M-P-T-Y
E-M-P-T-Y
E-M-P-T-Y
Instrumental

Did you hear them call you
Did you hear the wind of dream just passing by
There is another whole world hanging there... upside down
Did you see them dress you
Did you feel your elbows tied up side by side
Someone has brought me a new straight costume... in an asylum
In the mildness of the spring
You feel creepy like a worm
In your lost enchanted brain
You're proud to go
Did you hear them squeaking
Did you see your broken wings just flying by
They drop me in this fairground... abnormal
Could you hear them howling
Could you breathe inside your well-known plastic bag
It was a mean to get away from this... accident
In the mildness of the spring
You feel creepy like a worm
In your lost enchanted brain
Weeping willow
With the fairness of your skin
You feel funny in this world
In your lost enchanted dreams
You're proud to go... You're proud to go
All God's Children
Take their passage into night
It's a feeling
Best you hold on tight
All God's Children
Hold yourself up to the Light
It's a free fall
I know
Whispers, captured lies
Come now, make your move
Do the clothes make the man?
Does the soul understand? I do
Strange the way you seem
Suicidal
You don't live at all
So why you cryin?
Come and play with me
And feel desire
It's all in the dark
A walk through the fire
Baby, cast your eyes
To the soul you never knew
And maybe
You got no place to hide
So you turn in two, like I do
Strange the way you seem
Suicidal
You don't live at all
So why you cryin?
Come and play with me
And feel desire
It's all in the dark
A walk through the fire
Hanayo lives in Berlin 'cause she says the rent is cheap
Couldn't afford that lifestyle, Tokyo's too fast and steep
Juergen lives in Munich, that cozy comfy town
Got a nice BM that he drives all over town
Mimi lives in Hamburg, that fishy harbour breeze
She says it's the best place in the world
And then she starts to sneeze
Dean lives in London, does the music business thing
He likes to take girls to the park
And do that sweet, sweet thing
People and places, people in different towns
Erkki lives in tampere, now where the hell is that?
Works the web like no other, gotta put him on the map
Weasel she's in New York, she got it all set up
She drinks her frappuccio from a glass and not a cup
Jeremy moved to Rome, Italiano style
Gave up all that fashion jazz and says that with a smile
Russell lives in Cov, that a really brutal place
It's in the middle of England, right into your face
People and places and places and people
People and places, people in different towns
How low, how long?
Lower than the sea
Too long to go,
Too far to even try to reach
And don't you even try to let it go
While everything around me is breaking down so slow
Where will you go,
When we all fade away?
Where is your silver touch,
Above the sun next to us?
So when you walk outside to see the reasons fall
Do not forget the light that doesn't make you crawl
So I just stay at home, oh, just the saddest news,
There is no side to choose
And the numbers grow and push you down so low
Don't ever let it loose,
Don't ever let it loose
Oh, wasn't it a long way down,
They leave us behind
So stay where you are
Don't come around no more
But it has gone too far,
I've been asking for you
No, I won't see you call,
The way the others do
If these are your prayers,
I won't follow you through
When the flame turns blue,
Not even you will lead us through
That's why I never go,
If you see me, I move slow
My head runs off,
I spread the bad news where I go
You'll see the ones that lost their minds into their hole
Like all your loved ones played the best part of their role
I can't help you now,
When you ask me how
I see the trouble in your way
If you're out of time,
You just stay in line,
Don't ever let it loose,
Don't ever let it loose
Oh, wasn't it a long way down,
They leave us behind
So stay where you are
Don't come around no more
But it has gone too far,
I've been asking for you
No, I won't see you call,
The way the others do
If these are your prayers,
I won't follow you through
When the flame turns blue,
Not even you will lead us through
Don't ever let it loose
Don't ever let it loose
Oh, wasn't it a long way down,
Long way down
Not even you will lead us through,
When the flame turns blue
Ela disse adeus
(Now the deed is done
As you blink she is gone
Let her get on with life
Let her have some fun)
Ela disse adeus, e chorou
Ja sem nenhum sinal de amor
Ela se vestiu, e se olhou
Sem luxo mais se perfumou
Lagrimas por ninguem
So porque, é triste o fim
Outro amor se acabou
Ele quis lhe pedir pra ficar
De nada ia adiantar
Quis lhe prometer melhorar
E quem iria acreditar
Ela nao precisa mais de voce
Sempre o ultimo a saber
She don't know you but she swear she knows your type
Got a mouth full of opinions and most are wrong
But they all sound right
And the ring around her finger is only there for make you
Wish you were the one for her
So I'm praying to keep me from breaking
From being another loser helpless at her side
And it's crazy, it's like no one can save me this time
She's got me praying to the wrong god every night
Praying to the wrong god every night
There's a reason no one knows her name
If she don't tell you then she never has to change it
She's allergic to "I Love You"s and staying in one place
For too long
If you blink she's gone
So I'm praying to keep me from breaking
From being another loser helpless at her side
And it's crazy, it's like no one can save me this time
She's got me praying to the wrong god every night
Praying to the wrong god every night
Make her make me mean more
Or make her go away
Make her make me mean more
Or make her go away
I'm praying to keep me from breaking
From being another loser helpless at her side
(Woah)
And it's crazy, like no one can save me this time
She's got me praying to the wrong god every night
Praying to the wrong god every night
She's got me praying to the wrong god every night...
(Every night)
Today is gonna be the day
That they're gonna throw it back to you
By now you should've somehow
Realized what you gotta do
I don't believe that anybody
Feels the way I do about you now
Backbeat, the word was on the street
That the fire in your heart is out
I'm sure you've heard it all before
But you never really had a doubt
I don't believe that anybody
Feels the way I do about you now
And all the roads we have to walk are winding
And all the lights that lead us there are blinding
There are many things that I would like to say to you
But I don't know how
Because maybe
You're gonna be the one that saves me
And after all
You're my wonderwall
Today was gonna be the day
But they'll never throw it back to you
By now you should've somehow
Realized what you're not to do
I don't believe that anybody
Feels the way I do about you now
And all the roads that lead you there were winding
And all the lights that light the way are blinding
There are many things that I would like to say to you
But I don't know how
I said maybe
You're gonna be the one that saves me
And after all
You're my wonderwall
I said maybe
You're gonna be the one that saves me
And after all
You're my wonderwall
I said maybe
You're gonna be the one that saves me
You're gonna be the one that saves me
You're gonna be the one that saves me
Maybe we are the damaged ones
Endless need, like a burning sun
Burns like you, my damaged one
On my knees in a faceless crowd
We go blind when the stakes are high
I'm on my knees can you see me now
Whatever you do, don't leave me tonight
Maybe we are the damaged ones
Endless need, like a burning sun
Burns like you, my damaged one
You and I in a shameless state
I want you so badly you know, that it's a pain to wait
What keeps you from moving, are you afraid to be loved?
See how my hands shake, I was raised on it like a drug
Maybe we are the damaged ones
Endless need, like a burning sun
Burns like you, my damaged one
It's you or none, my damaged one
It's you or none, my damaged one.
If I should leave you
Try to remember all the good times
Warm days filled with sunshine
And just a little bit of rain
And if you should look back
Try to forget all the bad times
Lonely blue and sad times
And just a little bit of rain
If I should leave you
Try to remember all the good times
Long days filled with sunshine
Just a little bit of rain
Just a little bit of rain
Just a little bit of rain
Your black Lexus has
Two hundred thousand miles
Underneath the missing roads
You don't know where you're going
Almost anytime
Things lost just lighten up your load
Maybe you're headin' out
To LA
See if they'll put you in a show
First you'll check with the stars
Read both your sign and mine
In the back of the New York Post
You can't find her
You can't find her
In the mirror everything's reversed
And you can't find her
You can't find her
Everyday you feel a little curse
Now your car's been towed
You misread the sign
Something left to do
Must have slipped your mind
Got no money left
Guess you'll stick around
And anyway the stars
Said not to go right now
But you can't find her
You can't find her
In the mirror everything's reversed
And you can't find her
You can't find her
Everyday you look a little worse
You can't find her
You can't find her
In the mirror everything's reversed
You can't find her
You can't find her
Everyday you feel a little curse
You can't find her
You can't find her
In the mirror everything's reversed
You can't find her
You can't find her
Everyday you feel a little curse
You say you feel a chill in the season
Like something is falling apart
You say you can't hold it together much longer
And I should look after your heart
But I feel a change coming on
Rolling out of the blue like a storm
And it's bending your will like a willow tree twisting
Trying to regain its form
How does it make you feel
When you remember the times the two us lay here
In the arms of the world on the doorstep of heaven shining down
Do you feel a change coming on,
Rolling out of the blue like a storm,
And it's throwing your dollhouse world in disarray
So you can rebuild or conform
How I wish you'd only see
How your own choices make your dream
Come out shining true before it can leave you
I wish that you could see
How your own choices make your dream
Come out shining true all around you
My worth is the look in your eyes
My prize the smile playing tricks on your lips and I wonder again
Do you ever dream of the world like I do
I too fear the change coming on
Rolling out of the blue like a storm
Can you hear it scream at the hurt that I knew
How I wish you'd only see
How your own choices make your dream
Come out shining true before it can leave you
I wish that you could see
How your own choices make your dream
Come out shining true all around you
What is this chill at my heel
That makes the protections I've built around my pseudo world premiere
Tearing my utopian fiction apart as it happens to just pass along
I feel a change coming on
Rolling out of the blue like a storm
Crashing against my delirious thoughts where humanity's waiting alone
How I wish you'd only see
How your own choices make your dream
Come out shining true before it can leave you
I wish that you could see
How your own choices make your dream
Come out shining true all around you
This is the sound of our days
Burning the light of our nights
This is the sign of our times
From my mouth into your eyes
This is the beat of our praise
Setting the pace of our stride
This is the line that we cross
With my torch I light your way
When the time is right 
We raise our heads and look
When the bridges burn
We leave our homes in flames
This is the noise of our blood
Telling the age of our nerves
This is the price of our lies 
From my lips into your breath 
This is the voice of our past
Turning the tide of our lives
These are the tears that we cry
With my tongue I touch your mind
2x
When the time is right 
We raise our heads and look
When the bridges burn
We leave our homes in flames
Eat up your shame
You did not choose to be this way
These names live on your lips
But you can't help how bloodlines slip
I could never fall for an empty page anyway
I wouldn't like it
You can't haggle with your mother
You cannot choose her love, oh no
Come and fight your corner
There's no one doing it for you
There would be nobody if we all stayed all alone
I wouldn't like it
Saw your picture on accident
Your face has changed
The lines are sinking in
I pressed play, I should haven't
Congratulations
But do you ever wonder what we could have been
But your mind plays tricks with distance
Always makes things feel so unfinished
I miss you more than I loved you
I do
I miss you more than I loved you
(I wonder what we could have been)
I miss you more than I loved you
I do
I miss you more than I loved you
(I wonder what we could have been)
Saw a balloon floating away
I thought, did someone let go, or did they lose it
So strange, you know all my secrets
Please keep them safe
And darling, you know I'll do the same
Though we're no longer in existence
Baby, you'll always be in my orbit
I miss you more than I loved you
I do
I miss you more than I loved you
(I wonder what we could have been)
I miss you more than I loved you
I do
I miss you more than I loved you
(I wonder what we could have been)
We were a match, but not a fit
We were a dream, unrealistic
We didn't lose, we didn't win
(Sometimes I wonder what we could have been)
I miss you more than I loved you
I do
I miss you more than I loved you
(I wonder what we could have been)
I miss you more than I loved you
I do
I miss you more than I loved you
(I wonder what we could have been)
You'll always be in my orbit
You'll always be in my orbit
You'll always be in my orbit

Teach me the way
To be humble and good
To be quiet when I should
To be great
I am not what I was
Or what I will be
There is no one guessing for me
There's a draft like a well
And a warm wet smell
And there is no one to break the fall
It's so patient and meek
And your mouth never speaks
Of the times when our hopes die
There's a draft like a well
And a warm wet smell
And there's no one to break the fall
Teach me the way
To be humble and good
To be quiet when I should
To be great

I like being alone
I'm out here, spend plenty of time on your own
'Cause the city ain't kind
Other people who sign up for judgin' but can't take no
Complacent
This ain't a place to be making friends they all got agendas
These eyes on your back, hands in your neck
Thinkin' I've been fienin' for a taste of this shit
Seem so thirsty, smell fresh meat in the air
So the real test, after breakfast
We'll see who's to be here
This pressure ain't for everybody
Weighing so heavy on my body, body
Spine, shivers
Eyes, met
Head, in it
Heart, set
Cold, on my mind, yeah
Ice dripping, cold sweat
Ice, Ice dripping, cold sweat
Ice dripping, cold sweat
Ice, Ice dripping, cold sweat
Ice dripping, cold sweat
Can't choose the situation and friend
Always got to co-sign, everything's a ten
Damn I hate a yes man
I know while this buzzing gotta be ringing in your ear
Don't think I've forgotten, who was always here
Tell me where was you last year?
And I doubt you was last here
It's your last year
This pressure ain't for everybody
Weighing so heavy on my body, body
Spine, shivers
Eyes, met
Head, in it
Heart, set
Cold, on my mind, yeah
Ice dripping, cold sweat
Ice, Ice dripping, cold sweat
Ice dripping, cold sweat
Ice, Ice dripping, cold sweat
Ice dripping, cold sweat
No no no no
Wish it was goodbye
Time for me to accept defeat with my extra time
Like to handle with the lights on all night
Don't trip, everything will end up just fine
The summers they ain't the same
These lovers they ain't the game
These feeling, they don't mean nothing
These ceilings can keep the pain
Explanations you say I deserve it
Why after all this time I'm finally worth it
Ain't it funny, a power comes with money
And how now I'm out here poppin'
They come back like they're an option
Man this shit is hella scummy
They claiming that they love me
'Cause they realize that my time is finally coming
They know it
'Cause my night is young
Moon is high
The stars are all, aligned
Was a windless night 
When you left the ship 
You never were 
A steady bold one 
I gave my hand 
Ah but you did slip 
I'm a living man 
And you're a cold one 
So haul away 
Haul away from here 
My love's as fair 
As a girl can be 
My wedding ring 
Is a heavy gold one 
Now you lay alone 
In the deep dark sea 
I'm a living man 
And you're a cold one 
So haul away 
Haul away for home 
The morning brings 
Lord a fresh young breeze 
To fill our sails 
To end the doldrums 
Our lucky ship 
Speeds across the sea 
I'm a living man 
And you're a cold one 
So haul away 
Haul away for home
He stands with his head in his hands
In the corridor in A&E
He couldn't resuscitate her
And now he'll go home to his wife for tea
We sing as the sky falls down
We sing as the sky collapses
And make what we can of this
It's okay, we're all going to end up dead and gone
He crawls into her aorta
To pull him out of his reverie
And mentally puts her back together
With sticks and glue until she breathes
He crawls like a rat inside her spine
It's a passage to another world
He pulls on a coat of new born skin
And sends a secret message to that girl
Positions himself in space
And looks down on such slight a thing
Swears he'll make what he can of this
Because one day out there we will all be dead
So leave your imprint upon
All the atoms you press against
All the people you press against
Because one day out there we will all be
Leave your imprint upon
Every mouth that you press against
Every word that you press against
It's okay because one day we will be dead
All the little lights
Instrumental
Sometimes I find myself sittin' back and reminiscing
Especially when I have to watch other people kissing
And I remember when you started callin' me your Mrs
All the play fighting, all the flirtatious disses
I tell you sad stories about my childhood
I don't know why I trusted you but I knew that I could
We'd spend the whole weekend lying in our own dirt
I was just so happy in your boxers and your t-shirt
Dreams, dreams
Of when we had just started things
Dreams of you and me
And it seems, it seems
That I can't shake those memories
I wonder if you have the same dreams too
The littlest things that take me there
I know it sounds lame but it's so true
I know it's not right, but it seems unfair
That things are reminding me of you
Sometimes I wish we could just pretend
Even if only for one weekend
So come on, tell me, is this the end?
Drinkin' tea in bed, watching DVDs
When I discovered all your dirty grotty magazines
You take me out shopping and all we'd buy is trainers
As if we ever needed anything to entertain us
The first time that you introduced me to your friends
And you could tell that I was nervous so you held my hand
When I was feeling down, you made that face you do
There's no one in the world who could replace you
Dreams, dreams
Of when we had just started things
Dreams of me and you
And it seems, it seems
That I can't shake those memories
I wonder if you feel the same way too
The littlest things that take me there
I know it sounds lame but it's so true
I know it's not right, but it seems unfair
That things are reminding me of you
Sometimes I wish we could just pretend
Even if only for one weekend
So come on, tell me, is this the end?
You walk on by
Clueless and so high
Following your aimless path away from us
You're so far away
And what can I say
'Cause I can't be the one you wanted me to be
So tell me how do you feel
It's so confusing
If you let it all go, it'll fall apart
Do you want me to stay and say I still want you
You want me too, don't you?
So what are we saying
Our eden's a failure
A made-up story to fit the picture-perfect world
The one with "I do"
And "I love you"
And we are made for each other
Is forever over now?
And tell me how do you feel
It's so confusing
If you let it all go, it'll fall apart
Do you want me to stay and say I still want you
You want me too, don't you?
I hope there's forgiveness
In the distance between us
Can we make what lies ahead of us a better place to be?
So tell me, how do you feel
It's so confusing
If you let it all go, it'll fall ---
Do you want me to stay and say I still want you
You want me too, don't you?
Touched by all of your grace
The only one to see my other face
Is it too much to ask of you
To stay inside with me?
Is it too much to ask of you
To keep me alive?
It's my jealousy
Creepin' up on me
Just my jealousy
Creepin' up on me
Fortunes could fall upon your kiss
Everyone a suitor I could miss
Is it too much to ask of you
To stay inside with me?
Is it too much to ask of you
To keep me alive?
It's my jealousy
Creepin' up on me
Just my jealousy
Creepin' up on me
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah
No, this jealousy
Won't get to me
Nom this jealousy
Won't get to me
You set me free
Your love set me free
You put your armor on me
You put your armor on me
You put your armor on me
Don't you know baby I'm a leading man?
I dig down deep when I say "I love you."
And I can hold my own with the best of them,
I guarantee you, you will never see nothing like this again.
California, I hope that it wakes you
From all the darkness that I couldn't break through.
'Cause I'm going to miss you,
I'm gonna miss you,
I'm gonna miss you,
I'm gonna miss you.
Don't you know that I did the things I could?
I rubbed your back when you were sleeping.
And all along baby it was understood
That you were leaving, absolutely, since the very first day we met.
California, I hope that it wakes you
From all the darkness that I couldn't break through.
'Cause I'm going to miss you,
I'm gonna miss you,
I'm gonna miss you,
I'm gonna miss you
Like I miss the ocean when I go to sleep, 
Man... it's gonna break my heart.
Don't you know baby I'm a leading man?

From all the darkness that I couldn't break through.
'Cause I'm going to miss you,
I'm gonna miss you,
I'm gonna miss you,
I'm gonna miss you,
I'm gonna miss you
Like I miss the ocean when I go to sleep; 
Like I miss the ocean when I go to sleep.
Man... it's gonna break my heart.
Bleeding thoughts
Cracking boulder
Don't fall over
Fake your laughter
Burn the tear
Sing it louder
Twist and shout
Way up here
We stand on shoulders
Growing colder
Laugh or cry
I won't mind
Sing it louder
Twist and shout
Immovable shadows
The concrete girl
They'll rock your world
To nothing
And they're swimming around again, again
And they're swimming around
The concrete girl
Catch your breath
Like four-leaf clover
Hand it over
Scream to no one
Take your time
Sing it louder
Twist and shout
Nothing to run from
Is worse than something
And all your fears
Of nothing
And they're swimming around again, again
And they're swimming around again, again
And they're swimming around
The concrete girl
Concrete girl, don't fall down
In this broken world around you
Concrete girl, don't fall down
Don't fall down my concrete girl
Ah, ah, concrete girl
Don't stop thinking
Don't stop feeling now
One step away
From where we were
And one step back
To nothing
And we're standing on top of our hopes and fears
And we're fighting for words now concrete girl
And we're swimming around again, again
And we're swimming around now
Concrete girl
Concrete girl, don't fall down
In this broken world around you
Concrete girl, don't fall down
Don't fall down my concrete girl
Concrete girl, don't fall down
In this concrete world around you
Concrete girl, don't fall down
Don't break down my concrete girl
It's only human to wonder why
It's only animal to do it
It's only animal to run along the rocks
And move along instead of talk
It's only human to wonder how
And how I wish I could talk to you now
And the words tumble out of your mouth
Like apples from a wild tree
And mine they spy out cautiously
Like a creature from its cave
Our able bodies and able minds
Are animals and things on vines
Greening fields and windy mines
In our sounds and movements
And the waves like lessons
Thrashing over me in waves
Of self-doubt and illusion
Like night's intrusion
On the daylight of the strings
They gently let me play
I've got points of icicles
Piercing into me and I miss your warmth
And the sound of your voice
Like apples tumbling from a wild and windy tree
My body aches for you, and shakes for you
And sways for you
And dances with your little woman body
Long into the evening
I thought I would know what to do when the time came
I thought I would know when to leave when the time came
I thought I could recognize the sign
I thought I would know when the planets had aligned
I was wrong, I didn't know anything at all
I was wrong, I didn't know anything at all
Saving all the letters you wrote
And I'm all alone for the first time
And I can't help
Help but wonder
What's gone wrong
Then fell asleep under a tree
Got woken up by birds and bees
They're hard at work, but they're hardly workin'
There might be rain, but not for certain
Followed the trail to the wild flowers
I cut as many as I could handle
I was workin' hard, but hardly workin'
I heard the train, but not for certain
Oh, we're living in the wild life
We're living in the wild life
Fell asleep under a tree,
Got woken up by birds and bees,
They're hard at work, but they're hardly workin',
There might be rain, but not for certain
What is in this wine?
The more I drink the more I wander off
Into a stranger's eyes
I like the way that they reflect my thoughts
What is in this air?
It feels like feathery dust everywhere
And as I breathe it in
I breathe the masculine scent of his skin
And I feel homeless
Your comfortable caress
Has triggered unfamiliar restlessness
You and I are we
I feel I've lost my individuality
You're watching me rebel
Believing stories only hearts can tell
But when is it enough?
When do I call my feelings on their bluff
And I feel homeless
And I remember us now
But I forgot what we felt like
Somewhere along the way
Nighttime at the boulevard
And I'm walkin' home with you
The heat is just delicious
And you know just what to do
Mornin' is so perfect
But the noontime makes me tired
Parkin' in the park now
And I'm so glad that you were fired
Goin' to the movies
I found a shelter from the sun
Heard a gruesome story
About a couple on the run
Until it comes again
Until it comes again
It used to be it was all I want, my only care
Nothing else had a single part to play in my head
But now times led my mind astray, something was changed along the way
And no amount of tears can bring it back round till it comes again
So maybe we should pretend we're who we want to be
And forget who we really are and where we really be
'Cause I've no time to start again but I won't to a bitter end
Can we keep it down till its back round till it comes
Again
Until it comes again, until it comes again
One more time to take the test to make it real
Or one more nail in this relationship make it
Impossible to heal
On the good ship hope we sail but the stars above say
The wind will fail
Can we keep afloat until its back round until it comes again
Until it comes again, until it comes again
Until it comes again, until it comes again
A long time ago I left my home
For a job in the fruit trees
But I missed those hills with the windy pines
For their song seemed to suit me
So I sent my wages to my home
Said we'd soon be together
For the next good crop would pay my way
And I would come home forever
One more dime to show for my day
One more dollar and I'm on my way
When I reach those hills, boys
I'll never roam
One more dollar and I'm going home
No work said the boss at the bunk house door
There's a freeze on the branches
So when the dice came out at the bar downtown
I rolled and I took my chances
One more dime to show for my day
One more dollar and I'm on my way
When I reach those hills, boys
I'll never roam
One more dollar and I'm going home
A long time ago I left my home
Just a boy passing twenty
Could you spare a coin and a Christian prayer
For my luck has turned against me
One more dime to show for my day
One more dollar and I'm on my way
When I reach those hills, boys
I'll never roam
One more dollar and I'm going home
One more dollar
Boys I'm going home
I'm saving all I'm not giving
But it's overflowing evaporating in the air
As I'm walking and no I'm not breathing
I'm not breathing only air
'Cause it's filled with words once spoken
By people everywhere
And I can hear all the whispers
That have lived a thousand years
It just took me being open
For them to reach my eager ears
Now they've reached my eager ears
And I hope I'll be ready when my life
When my life divides
When my life divides
I eat with these crooked teeth
Tomato soup and grilled cheese
But you already know that because you used to dine with me
Do you remember?
I listen to my same old CD's
New order and Morissey
But you already know that because you used to ride with me
I thought I'd be singing a different tune by now
But this song about you keeps coming out
I sleep in these dirty sheets
A blanket between my boney knees
But you already know that because you used to crawl in bed with me in the morning before work
Put your hands on my back
Kiss the back of my neck
I thought I'd be singing a different tune by now
But this song about you keeps coming out
I hoped to be singing to someone new by now
But the songs about you keep coming out
My heart is aching for love
I'll never let you be sure
My bones are aching for you
You rode me on your bicycle down Main Street
You were all that remained
Everything else slowly fades away
You are the one who forgets
You rode me on your bicycle down Main Street
Whatever happened to those lights?
Whatever happened to those lights?
Whatever happened to those lights we found?
Whatever happened to those lights?
Painted us kissing in blue
I wrote another song for you
Help me so I never leave
You rode me on your bicycle down Main Street
Whatever happened to those lights?
Whatever happened to those lights?
Whatever happened to those lights we found?
Whatever happened to those lights?
Ghosts stand waiting
Ghosts stand waiting
Ghosts stand waiting in the dark
Ghosts stand waiting
Ghosts stand waiting
Ghosts stand waiting in the dark
Whatever happened to those lights?
Whatever happened to those lights?
Whatever happened to those lights we found?
Whatever happened to those lights?
I wanna be rich, and I want lots of money
I don't care about clever, I don't care about funny
I want loads of clothes and fuckloads of diamonds
I heard people die while they're trying to find them
And I'll take my clothes off, and it will be shameless
'Cause everyone knows that's how you get famous
I'll look at The Sun, and I'll look in The Mirror
I'm on the right track, yeah I'm onto a winner
I don't know what's right and what's real anymore
And I don't know how I'm meant to feel anymore
And when do you think it will all become clear?
'Cause I'm being taken over by the fear
Life's about film stars and less about mothers
It's all about fast cars and cussing each other
But it doesn't matter 'cause I'm packing plastic
And that's what makes my life so fucking fantastic
And I am a weapon of massive consumption 
And it's not my fault, it's how I'm programmed to function
I'll look at The Sun, and I'll look in The Mirror
I'm on the right track, yeah we're onto a winner
I don't know what's right and what's real anymore
And I don't know how I'm meant to feel anymore
And when do you think it will all become clear?
'Cause I'm being taken over by the fear
Forget about guns and forget ammunition
'Cause I'm killing them all on my own little mission
Now I'm not a saint, but I'm not a sinner 
And everything's cool as long as I'm getting thinner
I don't know what's right and what's real anymore
And I don't know how I'm meant to feel anymore
And when do you think it will all become clear?
'Cause I'm being taken over by the fear
It's late afternoon
Smoke fills the room
The actor sighs
Dogs barking outside
The night seems the same
It sleeps in the day
The actress cries
For their last goodbyes
It's always this way
Everytime
You're passing me by
On days like these
Walk to the sea
It's too hard to find
Mirrors collide
The end of the street
The place where we meet
With tears in our eyes
Stay for a while
It's always the same
Everytime
You're passing me by
It's late afternoon
You enter the room
The music dies
And leaves us behind
It's all just a game
Everytime
It was the rocks you liked 
So much you'd throw them 
Down into the river's darkness 
Down from where the trains go flying 
Your legs hung out 
Into the air - we'll keep on kicking 
We're moving but it's never going 
When we go it's like we're faking 
Two palms, no sound 
Closer and closer 
The beam's width that's between us 
Gets just a little leaner 
We ought to fail to see it 
And if I go to the left 
And if you move to the right 
So that we've hit and spilled 
We've turned it off in the night 
Between the banks that roll 
The glass hidden motion 
Above we go on without knowing 
The pines control the wild sarcasm 
To hold us up 
And time was held 
Well worth the holding 
Waste when you try to save 
Save it and it ends up wasted 
You know these words 
Answer we entered 
The trains won't ride beside us 
But water moves beneath us 
And takes away the sense of hearing it all
Breached in straight lines
Asked to stop
Tunnel vision
Wasted up
We got lost
We found ourselves
Surrounded by things
Getting closer
All around us
Blinding lights began to set fire to our minds
Long directions mixing up
Points of reference bound and stuck
Talks to nothing falls apart
Constant questions from the start
We got lost
We found ourselves
Surrounded by things
Getting closer
All around us
Blinding lights began to set fire to our minds
I don't want to be myself
What's done is done
What's done is done to me
What's done is done
What's done is done because
We got lost
We found ourselves
Surrounded by things
Getting closer
All around us
Blinding lights began to set fire to our minds
I'm walking through the desert
And I am not frightened although it's hot
I have all that I requested
And I do not want what I haven't got
I have learned this from my mother
See how happy she has made me
I will take this road much further
Though I know not where it takes me
I have water for my journey
I have bread and I have wine
No longer will I be hungry
For the bread of life is mine
I saw a navy blue bird
Flying way above the sea
I walked on and I learned later
That this navy blue bird was me
I returned a paler blue bird
And this is the advice they gave me
"You must not try to be too pure
You must fly closer to the sea"
So I'm walking through the desert
And I am not frightened although it's hot
I have all that I requested
And I do not want what I haven't got
Sometimes the girl is here
With her indigo eyes
And her brand new gear
She won't stay for long
And she has to walk straight home
Patience, time comes, she says
Kiss me but don't you tell
This is over as soon as this fire burns through
She's on the ocean
He's in the sand
She's stuck in motion
He is sliding gently off her hand
Springtime and turnoil
She pours white wine
And gets herself lost
She falls over
And disappears into the meadows
Wayward and highstrung
She is lovesick and ever so strong
Then it's over like none of it ever was real
She's on the ocean
He's in the sand
She's stuck in motion
He slides so gently off her hand
When you dove drunk with sleep in your eyes
You stole what was left of the sky
I remember how you freed your hair
Hung your head in a forgotten stare
And I thought, And I thought
When will the water stop? Will it pour all day?
When will the water stop? I know that you can't say
When will the water stop? Will it pour all day?
When will the water stop? I know that you can't say
Turning to fall, I owed all my life
Spinning pictures, blue screens, and red kisses
You sank into yourself and I got lost somewhere in between
And I thought, And I thought
When will the water stop? Will it pour all day?
When will the water stop? I know that you can't say
When will the water stop? Will it pour all day?
When will the water stop? I know that you can't say
Well, she's washed up on his shore, there's no time to get into his life
She's washed up on his shore, there's no time to get into his life
No, no, no, no, yeah
No, no, no, no, no, no, yeah
When you dove drunk with sleep in your eyes
You stole what was left of the sky
I remember how you freed your hair
Hung your head in a forgotten stare
And I thought, And I thought
When will the water stop? Will it pour all day?
When will the water stop? I know that you can't say
When will the water stop? Will it pour all day?
When will the water stop? I know that you can't say
Well, she's washed up on his shore, there's no time to get into his life
She's washed up on his shore, there's no time to get into his life
She's washed up on his shore, there's no time to get into his life
No, no, no, no, yeah
No, no, no, no, no, no, yeah
Kom, kom atombomb
Om vi nån gång, nånsin blir som dom
Känns som om alla är äldre nu och ser efter varann
Dom har gått för att leva sina liv
Och gud vet att jag måste leva mitt
Jag står i vasaparken
Ser pojkar och flickor gå igenom kärlekslunden
Jag skulle byta plats med vem som helst på sekunden, om jag kunde...
Alla är äldre nu och ser efter varann
Dom har molnen i famnen
Men du skriver ord som mord i handen
Ahh, kom, kom armageddon
Om vi nån gång, nånsin blir som dom...
Instrumental
It feels like summer is on it's way
But it's mid November
I'll hang this dream up on display
But I won't remember anything at all
And you haven't told me anything at all
But you know I'll chase you down
Complacency is lost for now
But I'll never doubt you
'Cause all I do is wonder how
I could be without you anywhere at all
And I'd run to find you anywhere at all
But don't you run too far away
I'm racing time for you
You know I need this now
'Cause I've been burning all my aspirations down
But I've been feeling closer day by day
You know I'll chase you down
It feels like summer is on it's way
Will it ever get here
These sheltered hearts can't make me stay
No I won't forget we're everything I know
And I hope you take this everything I know
And you make it worth this ride to me
Chorus (extended)
I remember playin' my guitar in the projects

You did it so, uh, cheap like

Don't you know it was better than sex, now, now, now

Hands where you wanna go
Study at the dock where the schoolgirls flirt
Not sure what you're losing, though
Right through the crest on the breast of your school shirt
And now that you wanna know
Why it hurts worse than it did first hurt
'Cause it never lets you go
It's through the crest on the breast of your school shirt
Another humdrum grey day
I wonder if this rain passed toledo
And if so I hope it left a sunny day through your window
I can't make shape or form
Of this new emotion
I need a drive up san francisco bay
I'd write this song on the way
I'm not sure I belong here anyway
She thinks that I've already gone away
Another hum drum grey day
Maybe I'll head out for a movie
The day is always so bright
After a matinee
Wouldn't you say?
I need a drive up san francisco bay
I'd write this song on the way
I'm not sure I belong here anyway
She thinks that I've already gone away
Yeah I figure one day I'll snap out of this
Yeah one day soon I'll pull my head down out of outer-space
Yeah I figure one day I'll snap out of this
Yeah one day soon I'll take that drive out
Scared my love, you'll go
Spend my love, heart broke
So my love don't show
Scared my love, you'll go
Too good to be good for me
Too bad that that's all I need
Too good to be good for me
Too bad that that's all I need
All I need
Fingers walk your thigh
Breathe my love, get high
And oh, I'm so scared
Oh I'm so scared
It's just for tonight
So I take a sip, wait 'til it hits
That liquid guilt is on my lips
I'm wasted on you
Too good to be good for me
Too bad that that's all I need
Too good to be good for me
Too bad that that's all I need
Too good to be good for me
Too bad that that's all I need
Too good to be good for me
Too bad that that's all I need
All I need
So I take a sip, wait 'til it hits
That liquid guilt is on my lips
I'm wasted on you
Wasted on you
Too good to be good for me
Too bad that that's all I need
Too good to be good for me
Too bad that that's all I need
Too good to be good for me
Too bad that that's all I need
Too good to be good for me
Too bad that that's all I need
All I need
Se as meninas do Leblon
Nao olham mais pra mim
Eu uso óculos
E volta e meia Eu entro com meu carro pela contramão
Eu to sem óculos
Se eu to alegre Eu ponho os óculos e vejo tudo bem
Mas se eu to triste eu tiro os óculos
Eu não vejo ninguém
Porque você não olha pra mim?
Me diz o que é que eu tenho de mal
Porque você nao olha pra mim
Por trás dessa lente tem um cara legal
Oi Oi Oi
Eu decidir dizer que eu nunca fui o tal
Era mais fácil se eu tentasse fazer charme de intelectual
Se eu te disser Periga você não acreditar em mim
Eu não nasci de óculos Eu não era assim
Porque você não olha pra mim?
Me diz o que e que eu tenho de mal
Porque você não olha pra mim?
Por trás dessa lente tem um cara legal
Por que você não olha pra mim?
Por que você diz sempre que não
Por que você não olha pra mim
Por trás dessa lente também bate um coração
You looked at me and saw what I never could see
You made me feel more than I thought I could ever be
And when I needed a friend you were always there to lift me up
To make me strong
You're not gone
You're still here
With me all the time
You're still here
When I close my eyes
I still see you
I still feel you
And we'll never be apart
You're still here
Still here in my heart
In my heart
Because of you I knew how it felt to be loved
You made me feel beautiful 'cause you believed I was
And I will never forget how you touched my life
You made me feel like I belong
You live on
You're still here
With me all the time
You're still here
When I close my eyes
I still see you
I still feel you
And we'll never be apart
You're still here
Still here in my heart
In my heart
All my life
You'll be in my life
You'll be part of me
I'll just think of you and you'll still be
You'll still be here
Still here
You're with me all the time
You'll still be here
Still here
When I close my eyes
I still see you
I still feel you
And we'll never be apart
You're still here in my heart
You're still...
I still feel you
And we'll never be apart
You're still here in my heart
In my heart
In my heart
In my heart
Still here
I was standing on the edge
I'd long for a new beginning
But I couldn't look down, but I couldn't look down
I went cold
A million voices scream in my head
And I felt sure that I would give in
So why couldn't I now? Why couldn't I now?
Your voice was louder
By design, God gave me feelings
And by the design they shalt not kill
But when the noises overwhelm me
I feel sure that they will
Oh revelation, comes in whatever form to save me
I hear voices, and then the whisper comes
Your whisper in the breeze
Your whisper's what I'm needing
Quiet bursts, so to hurt the whisperer
And though I struggle through the days now
It helps to know that you are listening
So I just wait it out
I'll wait this out, by the hour
By design, God gave me feelings
And by the design they shalt not kill
But when the noises overwhelm me
I feel sure that they will
Oh revelation, comes in whatever form to save me
I hear voices, and then the whisper comes
Your whisper in the breeze
Your whisper's what I'm needing
Quiet bursts, so to hurt the whisperer
I'd catch some stars for you
And just for you
I'd paint the grey sky blue
And just for you
So don't tell me you want the rain
From a cloudy sky
To wash away the pain
That I've given you again
I've always tried to find
What satisfies your mind
But I will never know
Where you are to go
But I want you to know
Do you want a golden ring
I would buy you anything.
I'd read some poems for you
Just for you
I hope they won't make you blue
Like they used to do
So please tell me they're like the rain
From this cloudy sky
What's the use in dying, dying
If I don't know when?
What's the use in trying, dying
If I don't know when?
There are only pieces, pieces
Pieces of me
What's the use in dying, dying
If I can not see?
There are only pieces, pieces
Pieces of me
What's the use in dying, dying
If I can not see?
There are only pieces, pieces
Pieces of me
What's the use in dying, dying
If I can not see?
It sheltered me, from nothing but the weather
I called it home, for a moment of my life
This place I see, just doesn't look familiar
I wonder if, it looks the same inside
So there's the corner that I sat on
The road I walked home in the rain
And there's the star I used to wish on
It all just seems like yesterday
Days go by, nothing's getting clearer
Can't change my mind, my troubles are the same
Faces change, the names they are familiar
And the streets I see, will stand the test of time
So there's the corner that I sat on
The road I walked home in the rain
And there's the star I used to wish on
It all just seems like yesterday
And those stars (Those stars)
Stars still shine (stars still shine)
Shine down through the rain (Down through the rain)
And there's the corner that I sat on (The corner that I sat on)
The road I walked home in the rain (Walked home in the rain)
And there's the star I used to wish on (Star I used to wish on)
It all just seems like yesterday (Seems like yesterday)
And I stare out this dirty window (Stare out this dirty window)
As this world goes slowly by (World goes slowly by)
And somewhere out there is the future (Out there is the future)
That I once thought had passed me by (Thought had passed me by)
Sheltered me, from nothing but the weather
You talk in your sleep
I hear you say
Beautiful things
I love you, I do
You know that I do.
The world is awake
But you don't hear
A sound that it makes
Asleep in dreams so deep.
Peace in your heart
Peace in your soul
Peace in your head
Good goodnight.
You're far from me now
But you'd be here
In the blink of an eye
If I spoke your name.
The morning will come
For you and I
Life will go on
But keep at least from now till then...
Peace in your heart
Peace in your soul
Peace in your head
Good goodnight.
Peace in your head
Good, Good, Good, goodnight.
You talk in your sleep.
You talk in your sleep.
Everything is perfect now
I don't want to make a movement
I'm too scared to breathe; I might do something wrong
As you're sleeping silently
Perfect beauty laid before me
I feel every second is a life time long
Here's a place I've been before
A place some say I should go more
But every journey just leads me so far away
When I just wanted to stay
I just wanted to stay
So that's why I won't wake you where you lie
If I could now I'd freeze time
I can't find forever in your eyes
I should leave you while they're dry
Living underneath this guilt
I can't leave a house that I have built
Though I feel it sinking further every time
And th weight of my mistakes
Means that everything I touch breaks
I don't want to see you as the next in line
So that's why I won't wake you where you lie
If I could now I'd freeze time
I can't find forever in your eyes
I should leave you while they're dry
My true love did breathe 
By the Sally Ann so softly
That while walkin' through town
Only my heart did hear him
In views of the city
There ain't many folks
By the Sally Ann so pretty
That while walkin' through town
Many a twisted feature
Made a terrible beauty
Beauty
And then I knew
And then I knew
I'd been there before
One thing you must know
By the Sally Ann directly
Is that the pockets don't hold
Any more sunken treasures
After baptism by whiskey
But when leavin' the bar
By the Sally Ann just barely 
That old angel may allow
Light from above the mountain
And red brick walls blooming
You may see 
And then you'll know
And then you'll know
You've been there before
And then you'll know
And then you'll know
You've been there before
First touch and listen
I light the light
She'll come in blushes
So I must hide
Make sure on pages
We never die
(In blue) There's changes that never stray
False starts that draw the shine of rage
I touch the face of my own age
Cause nothing yet has blessed me yet from
Sorrow
Sorrow
Sorrow
Come what may
It's here I must wait
To keep the dogs at bay
Ok? ok
Sorrow
Sorrow
Under a moment your eyes turned blue
I choose to love you and never lose
Stay true and sign the cross in you
(Slain by Cain)
Dear love, come what may
Let fear charge the gates
I'm here, I'm here, I'm here
Here to stay
Ok, ok
Sorrow
Sorrow
Put your faith in me my friends
That one day ill find a way
To give all the things that you've given to me back
Well put your foot down my brother
That's no way to live
Putting the needs of others ahead of yours
You deserve more than nothing
It's the little things that we do that mean anything
It's the little things that we do that mean anything
Put your hands on me, my love
While the world wakes up early
And wastes the day working
For money they don't need
To buy things they don't need
Well, we'll sleep in, we'll do it again
It's the little things that we do that mean anything
It's the little things that we do that mean anything
Mojique sees his village from a nearby hill
Mojique thinks of days before Americans came
He sees (serves) the foreigners in growing numbers
He sees the foreigners in fancy houses
He dreams of days that he can still remember... now.
Mojique holds a package in his quivering hands
Mojique sends the package to the American man
Softly he glides along the streets and alleys
Up comes the wind that makes them run for cover
He feels the time is surely now or never... more.
The wind in my heart
The wind in my heart
The dust in my head
The dust in my head
The wind in my heart
Tu sei sgangheraaa... AT THIS POINT
(Come to) Drive them away
Drive them away.
Mojique buys equipment in the market place
Mojique plants devices through the free trade zone
He feels the wind is lifting up his people
He calls the wind to guide him on his mission
He knows his friend the wind is always standing... by.
Mojique smells the wind that comes from far away
Mojique waits for news in a quiet place
He feels the presence of the wind beside (around) him
He feels the power of the past behind him
He has the knowledge of the wind to guide him... on.
Settle up you're calling up the pain
Sitting dead the sinker and the string
You came, you saw, you sawed her brain
Cut out all the parts that held your stain
Sitting clad you're feeling wild to blame
She's crying as you're climbing down your claim
Sitting up you're counting up your names
Seen enough to bend him off the frame
You came you saw you sawed her brain
Cut out all the parts that held your stain
You clipped you clawed to no applause
You lost the will and bought the lying off
So try to be somebody
So try to feel somebody
So try to leave somebody
So hard to be somebody
(Where can you run) 
So try to be somebody
So try to feel somebody
So try to leave somebody
So try to be somebody
So leave your taxi waiting
And turn and close my door
And sit back down where you were sitting
A little closer than before
When you look that serious
It just makes me want you more
And I've been needing to tell you
The closer you get, the better I feel
The closer you are, the more I see
Why everyone says that I look happier
When you're around
The closer you get, the better I feel
And yes I know you're nervous
Never seen you so unsure
You haven't touched your food tonight
And you're drinking more and more
And there's no need to hurry
Taking time I'll still be here
And I've been needing to tell you
The closer you get, the better I feel
The closer you are, the more I see
Why everyone says that I look happier
When you're around
Better I feel
The closer you get, better you see
The closer you are, more I see
Why everyone says that I look happier
When you're around
The closer you get, better I feel
Better I feel
We've been circling for time baby
We're coming down to land tonight
The wait is over and now it's easy
Everything is fine
The closer you get, better I feel
The closer you are, more I see
Why everyone says that I look happier
When you're around, better I feel
The closer you get, better you see
The closer you are, more I see
Why everyone says that I look happier
When you're around
The closer you get
Better I feel
I slowly open my eyes.
They're empty enough to pour in the skies.
Circling down to the grass on the ground,
A dragonfly is seeing it's helped
Lying on our backs in summer grass,
So fast the day go past.
A smoke ring rises up into the sky.
It's blown apart by the wind blowing by.
Feel like I'm blowing the glow of the sun.
As soon as the afternoon has begun,
The sun goes down.
Sunny skies sleeps in the morning
He doesn't know when to rise
He closes his weary eyes upon the day
Look at him yawning
Throwing his morning hours away
He knows how to ease down slowly
Everything is fine in the end
And you will be pleased to know 
That Sunny Skies hasn't a friend
Sunny skies weeps in the evening
It doesn't much matter why
I guess he just has to cry from time to time
Everyone's leaving
And Sunny skies has to stay behind
Still he knows how to ease down slow
Everything is fine in the end
And you will be pleased to know
That Sunny Skies hasn't a friend
Sunny skies sleeps in the morning
He doesn't know when to rise
He closes his weary eyes upon the day
And throws it all away
Looking at the snow and trees that grow
Outside my window
Looking at the things that passed me by
Wondering if where I've been is worth
The things I've been through
Ending with a friend named Sunny Skies
Eh Morena
Este e um sonho estranho
Passando por la
Vem me encontrar
Pela janela aberta
Beijo luar
Eh Morena
Este e um sonho estranho
Passando por la
Vem me encontrar
Pela janela aberta
Beijo luar
Eh Morena
You've got such a pretty smile
It's a shame the things you hide behind it
Let 'em go, give it up, for a while
Let 'em free and we will both go find it
I know that there's nowhere you can hide it
I know the feeling of alone
I know that you do not feel invited
But come back, come back in from the cold
Step away then from the edge
Your best friend in life is not your mirror
Back away, come back away, come back away
Come back away, come back away, come back away
I am here and I will be forever and ever
I know that there's nowhere you can hide it
I know the feeling of alone
Trust me and don't keep that on the inside
Soon you'll, you'll be locked out on your own
You're not alone, you're not alone
And don't say you've never been told
I'll be with you till we grow old
Till I'm in the ground and I'm cold
I'm not sitting up here on some throne
I'll be with you till we're both gone
Like a dog you can always come home
Dig up a bone
Look around
I'm sorry now
Did you ever have to make up your mind?
And pick up on one and leave the other behind
It's not often easy, and not often kind
Did you ever have to make up your mind?
Did you ever have to fin'lly decide?
And say yes to one and let the other one ride
There's so many changes, and tears you must hide
Did you ever have to fin'lly decide?
Sometimes there's one with big blue eyes, cute as a bunny
With hair down to here, and plenty of money
And just when you think she's that one in the world
Your heart gets stolen by some mousy little girl
And then you know you better make up your mind
And pick up on one and leave the other behind
It's not often easy, and not often kind
Did you ever have to make up your mind?
Sometimes you really dig a girl the moment you kiss her
And then you get distracted by her older sister
When in walks her father and takes you in line
And says "Better go home son, and make up your mind"
Then you bet you'd better fin'lly decide
And say yes to one and let the other one ride
There's so many changes, and tears you must hide
Did you ever have to fin'lly decide?
Tracy died soon after a long fought civil war,
Just after I'd wiped away his last tear
I guess he's better off than he was before,
A whole lot better off than the fools he left here
I used to cry for Tracy because he was my only friend
Those kind of cars don't pass you every day
I used to cry for Tracy because I wanted to see him again,
But sometimes sometimes life ain't always the way...
Sometimes it snows in April
Sometimes I feel so bad, so bad
Sometimes I wish life was never ending,
And all good things, they say, never last
Springtime was always my favorite time of year,
A time for lovers holding hands in the rain
Now springtime only reminds me of Tracy's tears
Always cry for love, never cry for pain
He used to say so strong unafraid to die
Unafraid of the death that left me hypnotized
No, staring at his picture I realized
No one could cry the way my Tracy cried
Sometimes it snows in April
Sometimes I feel so bad
Sometimes, sometimes I wish that life was never ending,
And all good things, they say, never last
I often dream of heaven and I know that Tracy's there
I know that he has found another friend
Maybe he's found the answer to all the April snow
Maybe one day I'll see my Tracy again
Sometimes it snows in April
Sometimes I feel so bad, so bad
Sometimes I wish that life was never ending,
But all good things, they say, never last
All good things they say, never last
And love, it isn't love until it's past
We exchanged words
Through smoke-filled mouths.
And then we found our bodies
Speaking loud
And our hearts rest against the flesh
Trading stories of loves
Pain, doubt, and rivaling insecurities
When did we learn to speak without works
And in tongues
Maybe we should just stop here
Even if we don't succeed
No worries for you and me
Even if we don't agree
No worries for you and me
The pain and the sorrow that you felt
Will be washed away
Like droplets of doubt from yesterday
Everything you need to be
Don't worry, you will be
Everything you need to see
Don't worry, safe in here
The pain and the sorrow that you felt
Will be washed away
Like droplets of doubt from yesterday
The pain and the sorrow that you felt
Will be washed away
Like remnants and doubt from yesterday
You lift up my spirits, you shine on my soul
Whenever I'm empty, you make me feel whole
I can rely on you to guide me through any situation
You hold up a sign that reads "Follow me"
You give me direction, you show me the way
You give me a reason to face every day
I can depend on you to send me to any destination
You hold up a sign that reads "Follow me", follow me
Down the track of loneliness, down the path of love
Through the words of heartache to the end
On the shores of sorrow where the waves of hope crash in
The perfect place for me to find a friend
You lead me to places that I've never been
Uncovering secrets that I've never seen
I can rely on you to guide me through any situation
You hold up a sign that reads "Follow me", follow me
Follow me, follow me
Follow me, follow me
Follow me, follow me
Para amarte necesito una razón 
y es dificil creer que no exista
una más que este amor.
Sobra tanto dentro de este corazón 
que a pesar de que dicen
que los años son sabios
todavía se siente el dolor. 
Porque todo el tiempo
que pasé junto a ti 
dejé tejido su hilo dentro de mí. 
Y aprendí a quitarle al tiempo los segundos. 
Tú me hiciste ver el cielo aún más profundo. 
Junto a ti creo que aumenté más de tres kilos 
con tus tantos dulces besos repartidos. 
Desarrollaste mi sentido del olfato 
y fue por ti que aprendí a querer los gatos. 
Despegaste del cemento mis zapatos 
para escapar los dos volando un rato. 
Pero olvidaste una final instrucción...
porque aun no sé cómo vivir sin tu amor. 
Y descubrí lo que significa una rosa. 
Me enseñaste a decir mentiras piadosas 
para poder verte a horas no adecuadas 
y a remplazar palabras por miradas 
y fue por ti que escribí más de cien canciones 
y hasta perdoné tus equivocaciones 
y conocí más de mil formas de besar... 
y fue por ti que descubrí lo que es amar... 
lo que es amar... 
lo que es amar...
Although I didn't mention
I prayed for you that day
You left Glasgow and your shadow
And sailed back to the bay
And though it was predicted
Old times always sound so bad
The calendar was the saddest thing
That I ever read
I hope you know you'll always be
The life of the party
I hope you know you'll always be
The life of the party
Though I wouldn't mention
I still say hi to you
Know you wonder if the timing's off
How I want you, too
Though we asked directions
Bad times always seemed so sweet
You pushed the rhythm but kept on hitting
Your heart was made of steel
I hope you know you'll always be
The life of the party
I hope you know you'll always be
The life of the party
Who knows?
I know
It's our last show
And I hope you know you'll always be
Always be
One heart in space racing on
Come on, friend
There's poison in your veins
Come on, friend
You know I feel the same
I hope you know you'll always be
The life of the party
I hope you know you'll always be
The life of the party
Who knows? 
I know
It's our last show
And I hope you know there never was
A party at all
Words mean more at night
Like a song
And did you ever notice
The way light means more than it did all day long?
Words mean more at night
Light means more
Like your hair and your face and your smile
And our bed and the dress that you wore
So I'll send you my words
From the corners of my room
And though I write them by the light of day
Please read them by the light of the moon
And I wish I could leave my bones and my skin
And float over the tired tired sea
So that I could see you again
Maybe you would leave too
And we'd blindly pass each other
Floating over the ocean blue
Just to find the warm bed of our lover
And I'll send you my words
From the corners of my room
And though I write them by the light of day
Please read them by the light of the moon
Today I may not have a thing at all
Except for just a dream or two
But I've got lots of plans for tomorrow
And all my tomorrows belong to you
Right now it may not seem like spring at all
We are drifting and the laughs are few
But I've got rainbows planned for tomorrow
And all my tomorrows belong to you
No one knows better than i
That luck keeps passing me by ... that's fate
But with you there at my side
I'll soon be turrning the tide ... just wait
As long as I've got arms that cling at all
Its you that I'll be clinging to
And all the dreams I dream, beg, or borrow
On some bright tomorrow they'll all come true
And all my bright tomorrows belong to you
And I set down onto love
When you tell me that she stayed out, all alone
You tell me that she stayed out, all alone
Everyone's around, you stayed in tonight
It was right on time, he was just an old friend
I wasn't around, you stayed in tonight
It was just right time
He was just an old friend
And I set down onto love
When you tell me that she stayed out, all alone
You tell me that she stayed out, all alone
Everyone's around, you stayed in tonight
It was right on time, he was just an old friend
I wasn't around, you stayed in tonight
It was just right time
He was just an old friend
You gotta a bad old habit of making people sad
You got a bad old habit of making people dead
Did you think you were cool
I don't really understand it
Did you think you were cool?
I don't even understand it
So cool
Hey makes it alright
You keep on taking your chances
You killer of mine
Look at yourself
Just look what you've done
Just take a look
Did have some fun?
Did you think you were cool?
I don't even understand it
Did you think you were cool?
I don't really understand it
So cool

I watch you growing
Sometimes I see myself in you
It can be scary but kinda funny too
I hear you talking a lot of similarities
Your choice of words and all the fantasies
Just the way we are I guess you've seen it now
A mirror of ourselves
Sure makes us weird falling down
From a mountain of frights
What's there to hold on to?
The way you make us all smile
And the despair when you just won't go to sleep
You could have me walking a mile
To make you smile
Still it's not really a weep
I know you fooled me a million times
I just can't help it don't know why
Just the way we are I guess you've seen it now
A mirror of ourselves
Sure makes us weird falling down
From a mountain of frights
What's there to hold on to?
I know you hate it
But they really have to do what they do
You're crying out your wishes I understand
Yet they don't have a clue
Just the way we are I guess you've seen it now
A mirror of ourselves
Sure makes us weird falling down
From a mountain of frights
What's there to hold on to?
Falling down from a mountain of frights
What's there to hold on to?
One dark day the trees began a trumpet sound,
Trumpet sound
We sat listening patiently, the sky was near
And I felt the trembling motion
We ran out to see the future, from the ground
From the ground
From the ground
From the ground
People died and people risen everywhere
We held hands and made a circle
Quietly from the ground
Quietly from the ground
We returned and set the table, by the door
Wind a spire survey the hours I'm secrets, secrets
Spillin' on the floor
Find a love a just because I need you, so much
Beggin' till I'm poor
Wanting so much more this hurts kid
Strangers find the eyes, just the same
Every time I start
Reachin' out to find you
Loneliness abounds
Pretty, pretty star
Only you remind me
That only you can find me, in you
In all I choose
Wait remind my life is mine so many travelers
Carry past the word
Flowers jake the sun afraid I'm blinkin' softly
Wishin' on your name
Wonderin' who to blame next, low this
Crawlin' towards the door, just the same
Every time I start
Reachin' out to find you
Loneliness abounds
Pretty, pretty star
Only you remind me
That only love can blind
Every time I start
Emptiness confounds me
Loneliness astounds me
Pretty, pretty star
It's me and you
In all I choose
Show me
There's no other
Tell me
I'm your lover
Make me
Wonder who you are to stay
Finish
What you started
Vanquish
Your departed
Others
Wiltin' in the shade
Can I ask where you are tonight?
Do you know where I am right now?
Pretty, pretty star
Emptiness surrounds me
Loneliness confounds
Pretty, pretty star
Only you remind me
That only love can find
Me
Tell all my friends
I have gone to the moon
Tell all my friends
I will write them soon
And tell them
If you see them
That I am better left alone
'Cause I'm living up here where the air is thin
Where gravity don't bring you down
I'm living up here and I'm watching your 
Universe cooling down
I spend my days beneath a perspex dome
I think that I have finally come home
So tell them
If you see them
That I am better left alone
'Cause I'm living up here where the air is thin
And where gravity don't bring you down
I'm living up here and I'm watching your 
Universe cooling down
Yeah, I'm living up here where the air is thin
And where gravity don't bring you down
I'm living up here and I'm watching your 
Universe cooling down
Yih'yu l'ratzon imrei fi V'hegyon libi l'fanecha, adonai tzuri
Yih'yu l'ratzon imrei fi V'hegyon libi l'fanecha, adonai tzuri*
I will crush my fantasy,
Bring me olive oil crushed for his majesty
To shine a warmth into eternity, this is an eternal decree,
We'll dance like flames for there's no gravity,
For now I'm just a candle trying to stay lit in this windy night.
Got to crush my fantasies of how this life is supposed to be
Bring my broken heart to an invisible king with a hope one day you might answer me, so I pray don't you abandon me.
Your silence kills me;
I wouldn't have it any other way.
Is it wrong to think you might speak to me?
You might speak, would it be words and what would you say?
It's so heavy a heavy price to pay
Your silence.
*(Translation: Let it be your will that my words of my mouth and the meditations of my heart come before you, God my rock my redeemer)
When I see you alone
I see what's in your mind
You love me yes you do
You don't need to tell me
I know you love me most
No one else take my place
You love me, yes you do
Forever, and ever
When we kiss
I see what's in your heart
You love me yes you do
You don't need to tell me
I know you love me most
No one else take my place
Believe me, you do
Forever, and ever
We are in love
Baby love child
I take you so high
Groovy love child
Give me a kiss
Baby love child
Do it again
Attention adults
Attention adults
Attention adults
Attention adults
We are in bed at night
I can see what you want
You want me yes you do
Aishiteimasu (*)
I know how you feel
You have all of my heart
I give you myself
Forever and ever
We are in love
Baby love child
I take you so high
Groovy love child
Give me a kiss
Baby love child
Do it again
Attention adults (x12)
Coming back from Paris on the train
I really didn't care if the journey took all day
Trying to turn the pages of my magazine
While trying to keep a hold of your hand
And ordering an coffee that I wouldn't ever drink
Just to keep you and Paris on my mind
Just to keep you and Paris on my mind
I didn't know it would be the last time
The last time I saw you
At Waterloo we went our separate ways
When I got in my cab I didn't turn and wave
Didn't go to work just went to bed
Trying to keep you and Paris on my mind
Trying to keep you and Paris on my mind
I didn't know it would be the last time
The last time I saw you
I phoned your office this afternoon
They said they hadn't heard anything from you
It's been seven days without a word
I have to keep you and Paris on my mind
I have to keep you and Paris on my mind
I didn't know it would be the last time
The last time I saw you
Going back to Paris on the train
Raining and without you it's not the same
I have to do this journey one more time
Just to keep you and Paris on my mind
Just to keep you and Paris on my mind
I didn't know it would be the last time
The last time I saw you
The last time I saw you
The last time I saw you
The last time I saw you
This is gonna hurt, kid
You better hold on tight, you know
All those drugs you take
Cannot help to save your soul
Smile someday, smile, kid
You're fragile as a scene, ya know
All those things you have
Will not make you come undone
Tell me tell me you'll be all right
When you're in the shade
Tell me tell me you'll be all right
When you start to fade
Who's your only friend, kid?
There's no one else, you know
All those girls you love,
Doesn't mean you feel a thing
Tell me tell me you'll be all right
When you're in the shade
Tell me tell me you'll be all right
When you start to fade
Softly sway, or have you lost your way?
Well I could give you a map
But you know you'd have to stay
You could quit the fight or you can say goodnight
Well if you think it's a joke
Then why do you always cry?
Tell me tell me you'll be all right
When you're in the shade
Tell me tell me you'll be all right
When you start to fade
Have you heard?
The days are getting shorter
And what will you do when your suntan is fading and the summer's gone?
Do you feel afraid
(x3)
The days are getting shorter
And what will you do when your suntan is fading and the summer's gone?
Will you fade away? (x4)
I've been walking around all day thinking
I think I have a problem, I think I think too much
I've been taught to hold back my tears and avoid them
But you've made pain into something I could touch
I've been walking around all day laughing
Think I'd be better off without you here
And I bet you're sweet and hard to get over
So I'll cry and people will stop and stare
Now that's ok, let them stop and stare
'Cause I am fragile
I am hopeless
I'm not perfect
But I am free
I've been walking around all day waiting
And waiting is all I seem to do
'Cause I never get it unless I'm fed it
But this time I'll just have to
Yeah, this time I'll just have to
And I'm fragile
I am hopeless
I'm not perfect
But I am free
Say you're not around, am I finished?
If you're not around that's too bad
Hope you're safe and sound, not alone now
Cause you know I believe in you
I'm still fragile
I'm still hopeless
I'm not perfect
But I am free
And I'm fragile
I am hopeless
I'm not perfect
But I am free
'Cause I'm fragile
I am hopeless
I'm not perfect
But I am free
Drivin' on the lawn
Sleepin' on the roof
Drinkin' all the alcohol
All the kids from school
Will be naked in the pool
While our parents are on Fire Island
Crankin' up the tunes
Till the windows break
Feedin' chocolate to the dog
Jumpin' on the couch
Till the feathers all come out
While our parents are on Fire Island
We're old enough by now
To take care of each other
We don't no baby-sitter
We don't need no father or mother
We're old enough by now
Don't worry 'bout a thing
Don't you remember
Last December
When you went to Steamboat Springs
We're old enough by now
To take care of each other
We don't no baby-sitter
We don't need no father or mother
We're old enough by now
Don't worry 'bout a thing
Don't you remember
Last December
When you went to Steamboat Springs
Drivin' on the lawn
Sleepin' on the roof
Drinkin' all the alcohol
All the kids from school
Will be naked in the pool
While our parents are on Fire Island
Mil acasos me levam a você
O sábado, o signo, o carnaval
Mil acasos me tomam pela mão
A feira, o feriado nacional
Mil acasos me levam a perder
O senso, o ritmo habitual
Mil acasos me levam a você
No início, no meio ou no final
Me levam a você
De um jeito desigual
Mil acasos apontam a direção
Desvios de rota é tão normal
Mil acasos me levam a você
No mundo concreto ou virtual
Me levam a você
De um jeito desigual
Quem sabe, então, por um acaso
Perdido no tempo ou no espaço
Seus passos queiram se juntar aos meus
Seus braços queiram se juntar aos meus
MIl acasos me levam a você
No ínicio no meio ou no final
Mil acasos me levam por aí
Na espuma do tempo, no temporal
Mil acasos me dizem o que sou
Ateu praticante, ocidental
Me levam a você
De um jeito desigual
Quem sabe, então, por um acaso
Perdido no tempo ou no espaço
Seus passos queiram se juntar aos meus
Seus braços queiram se juntar aos meus
It's okay, to think about ending
And it's okay, to not even start
Put it away, wait 'til tomorrow
Put it away, and take care of your heart
Of your heart
It's okay, to stay here forever
And it's okay to read in the dark
Put it away, wait 'til tomorrow
Put it away, and take care of your heart
Of your heart
Just for a while, I'd seen you smile
Sometimes I grow so cold, my breath is an arctic wind
I am a mountain out of reach
Oh why? But sometimes I'm the night
I get tangled in the dark
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh but when we dance
Ooh ooh but when you take my hand
Oh when you take my hand
If I belong to somewhere, it's to your arms, Kery
The love I hold is older than the sky we lay under
The reason why is hidden in our eyes
If I lose track of it, help me find my way back
When I was younger, sometimes when I look back
I see that aching heart, but I was fly, I was so tall
I wouldn't stop 'til I broke your heart
Ooh ooh I'm just like you
But you're a song I wanna sing all night long
If I belong to somewhere, it's to your arms, Kery
The love I hold is older than the sky we lay under
The reason why is hidden in our eyes
If I lose track of it, help me find my way back
And you're the evening star
You want summer and I'm a Winterheart
I'm the night now but I will shelter you
Oh the wind dies, the thunder of the storm is coming
(The storm is coming, the storm is coming)
Oh
If I belong to somewhere, it's to your arms, Kery (Kery oh)
The love I hold is older than the sky we (lay under)
Is older than the sky we lay under (eyes)
If I lose track of it, help me find my way back
Say a prayer for me
Remember I breathe, I breathe
Grown up twisted in
A place you can't see, can't see
The planet poisoned me
Is a sick place to be, to be
I've got a taste for it
Now I've gotta leave
Goin' away
Sun's comin' down
Sun's comin' down
On me, on me, on me, oh
The world
Is fakin' every deal that it makes
Every handshake
Sometimes crazy people
Come into my space
I got to handshake
The planet's more fucked up
Than I'll ever be, I'll ever be
I've got a taste for it
Now I've gotta leave
Goin' down
Sun's comin' down
Sun's comin' down
On me, on me, on me, oh
Shine on (Repeat)
Back into that falling night
The birches and the silhouettes
The haunted plain
Sweet Lord, here I am again
You flower through my nails and skin
Moving like the sunlight in the alleyways
But in this life
We won't meet again
You flower through my nails and skin
Moving like the sunlight in the alleyways
But in this life
We won't meet again
I've taken all my pills
But I'm still not sleepy
Tried to trick myself into thinking
That I'm not awake
That it's only a dream
Put that cigarette out
Don't ask me no questions
Salome dancing on my wall
And the shadows on the floor
Look so warm from here
I've seen it all before
Just one little lie
But the difference is this
It meant the world to me
Don't ask me no questions
"Take the wheel" she said "as I wander"
We could leave this town
I've got all I need: spirit, hope and joe
But no one knows me
I think I lost my pills
Guess I'll take my chances
I'm looking at the telephone
But nothing happens
I am well aware
That the morning is near
Put that radio down
Don't ask me no questions
Have you seen that moon-faced kid?
That burned out halo hangs right above his head
It's so hard not to be crushed
When you're praying for too much
And the stars refuse to shine for you
They do it just to spite
Well they know you're trying to hard
Hoping for a little more than just another kiss goodnight
Your face is full and paved with lines
Your hair's receding fast and so is your mind
And that lazy eye won't budg
'Cause you're praying way too much
And don't take that pill
Your head will swell
You'll only be king once
Just once,
You'll only be king
Smile, please smile
I just want you happy
Smile, please smile
I just want you happy
And the stars refuse to shine for you
They do it just to spite
Well they know you're trying to hard
Smile, please smile
I just want you happy
Smile, please smile
I just want you happy
I just want you happy
I just want you happy
Goodbye
The lion stares high
And all the universe cries
For your memory
I hate I
Oh, could you lead my lips to sigh
Somehow, I smothered rainbows
And all the universe crawls
Farthest ends of me
I'm in now
Homewards, he dealed with scarecrows
And all the universe knows
Wailing finally
I would roar
Oh, could you fail in me
Sin calls
Goodbye
I've wandered 'round isles
And all the universe cries
For your memory
I warned I
Oh, starry are your spheres, delight
They won't see the fire you have lit inside of me
They look up to the stars and wonder where You might be
They look up without realizing that they're standing right there in the palm of your hand
I can't explain or understand, I just love You.
It's common knowledge that you've been dead for a while
It's well known that the cross is only a burden with pains and trials
But then again how come my shoes are so light
How come I can walk for miles, and still just love You.
So I think I'll stay caught up in a silent prayer
'Cause I believe in silence, our hearts speak the same word.
So why don't we just walk along the shoreline with our silent song
'Cause I believe in silence, our hearts speak the same word, the same word.
We have to prove that our love is real over and over again
But let them think what they want 'cause I know it will never end
'Cause I know where it began, and my heart still pounds twice as fast
Whenever you walk by, 'cause I still love you.
So I think I'll stay caught up in a silent prayer
'Cause I believe in silence, our hearts speak the same word.
So why don't we just walk along the shoreline with our silent song
'Cause I believe in silence, our hearts speak the same word,
The same word. x4
So I think I'll stay caught up in a silent prayer
'Cause I believe in silence, our hearts speak the same word.
So why don't we just walk along the shoreline with our silent song
'Cause I believe in silence, x3
Our hearts speak the same word, the same word.

Venezuela, donde estás?
Não sei por que nessas esquinas vejo o seu olhar
Minha camisa estampada com o rosto de Elvis
A minha guitarra é minha razão 
Minha sorte anunciada 
Misteriosamente a lua sobre nada
Não sei por que nessas esquinas vejo seu olhar
Não sei por que nessas esquinas vejo seu olhar
Espalhe por aí boatos de que eu ficarei aqui 
Espalhe por aí boatos de que eu ficarei aqui
Vem, mamacita, doida e meiga 
Sempre o âmago dos fatos
Minha guerra e as flores do cactos
Poema, cinema, trincheira
Não sei por que nessas esquinas vejo o seu olhar
Um cego na fronteira, filósofo da zona 
Me disse que era um dervixe 
Eu disse pra ele, camarada
Acredito em tanta coisa que não vale nada
Não sei por que nessas esquinas vejo seu olhar
Não sei por que nessas esquinas vejo seu olhar
Espalhe por aí boatos de que eu ficarei aqui
Espalhe por aí boatos de que eu ficarei aqui
Não sei por que nessas esquinas vejo seu olhar
Não sei por que nessas esquinas vejo seu olhar
Velejando, viajando, sol quarando
Meu querer, meu dever, meu devir
E eu aqui a comer poeira
Que o sol deixará
Não sei por que nessas esquinas vejo seu olhar
Não sei por que nessas esquinas vejo seu olhar
Feels good
To be free...

Ayreon (arjen lucassen):
I can smell the grass, and touch the flowers.
Among the trees, I pass the hours and fantasize.
I let the dance of nature inspire me.
Now my mind is free from apparitions.
I switch off like a 'television', and close my eyes.
And I wish that I could see like everybody can...
How I wish that I could be like any other man...
I can't see the sun, but I sense its glow.
I hear the sound of water flowing down the stream.
And my heart cries out for a little bit o' love.
But I know that it was not meant to be.
So I fulfill my destiny and accept my fate.
Still I wish that I could see like everybody can... (Like everybody can...)
How I wish that I could be like any other man...
Picking up broken words
Snipping the tips off
Grinding down the long ones
That wind around your eardrums
Dangerous plastic words
For crowd dispersal
And dumb dumb words
That could blow your head off
This is a story 'bout the three of us
Down by the water and the tide is rising
This world is burning and I'm terrified
I need a little more time with you, oh
I just need a little more time with you
One fine day you'll sing
Your inevitable love song
Inevitable lie song
Inevitable cry song
Time bends broken bones
Time bends broken bones
'Til they wrap around your throat
And snap around your fingers
This is a story 'bout the three of us
Down by the water and the tide is rising
This world is burning and I'm terrified
I need a little more time with you, oh
Down by the water and the tide keeps rising
This world is burning and I'm terrified
I need a little more time with you
Oh, I just need a little more time with you
Oh please, just a little more time with you
Went to where the people were on a Saturday night
Seems like it always seems
Where I go I want to leave
I thought we were doing fine with our lives
There are people who will tell you
There is always something better
If you don't know or care you'll be all right
I heard it's modern to be stupid
You don't need to talk to look good
I surprised myself as my mouth started speaking
There is nothing left of my nerves
As I lean over to ask her
Pardon the intrusion
Could we leave before it gets bad
I might smash up all these windows
And set fire to the curtains
Until it goes on and eats it with its blue and red orange
Until the fire burns and eats it with its blue and red orange
If you don't know or care you'll be all right
I heard it's modern to be stupid
You don't need a thought to look good
Pardon the intrusion
Could we leave before it gets bad
I might smash up all the windows
And set fire to the curtains
Went to where the people were on a Saturday night
Seems like it always seems
Where I go I want to leave
I surprised myself as my mouth started speaking
There is nothing left of my nerves
As I lean over to ask her
Pardon the intrusion
Could we leave before it gets bad
I might smash up all the windows
And set fire to the curtains
Until it goes on and eats it with its blue and red orange
Until the fire burns and eats it with its blue and red orange
I look straight in the window, try not to look below
Pretend I'm not up here, I try counting sheep
But the sheep seem to shower off this office tower
It's 9.8 straight down, I can't stop my knees
I wish I could fly
From this building, from this wall
And if I should try
Would you catch me, if I fall?
My hands clench the squeegee, my secular rosary
Hang on to your wallet, hang on to your rings
Can't look below me, or something will throw me
I curse at the windstorms that October brings
I look straight in the boardroom, a modern Pharaoh's tomb
I'd gladly swap places, if they care to dive
They're lined up at the window, peer down into limbo
They're frightened of jumping, in case they survive
I wish I could step from this scaffold
Onto soft green pastures, shopping malls, or bed
With my family, and my pastor, and my grandfather who's dead
Look straight in the mirror, watch it come clearer
I look like a painter, behind all the grease
But painting's creating, and I'm just erasing
A crystal-clear canvas is my masterpiece
I wish I could fly
From this building, from this wall
And if I should try
Would you catch me, if I fall?
When I fall?
I just can't work it out
I want to be with you now
I've got to get it right
I never wanted to fight 
And it's hard to know what you want
And it's hard to say what you've got
And it's hard to know what you want
And it's hard to say what you've got
I just can't work it out
I want to be with you now
I've got to get it right
I never wanted to fight 
And it's hard to know what you want
'Cause it's hard to say what you've got
And it's hard to know what you want
'Cause it's hard to say what you've got
People can do the most amazing of things
This house is full of secrets that i
Have kept from her for far too long
I hope I make it through the day
My conduct should be suspect and my
Intentions should be checked buy I'm to
Involved in making plans for my soul
Her heart is full of kindness that she's
Given away and now she is tired
Of all the parts of life that she made
She tries to help out everyone
But I can only help myself
I question whether she knows she's safe
I hope you find it
'Cause I could not find it in me
I can't say when I'll leave you for good
My selfish heart hopes you don't go first
God knows I couldn't make it one day
I'll ask that you find someone to help
Like you treated me like you were myself
You broke your back to make it okay
These parts of life that I cannot hold
You carry me along with your load
You're more than I could ever repay
I hope you find it
'Cause I could not find it in me
How many years since you found yourself
Staring at an endless sky?
Unaware of yourself
Who you are and where you're going
Only living
Only breathing
Losing all sense of time
The most fragile of things
Captivates and embraces you
Surrender and be witness
To this rarest of moments
You live within the sense
Of the order of things
What is truth
What is important
What defines you
No need to fear
No need to worry
About years that passed
About time you lost
Live seconds as a lifetime
Time it does not matter
You live within the sense
Of the stillness of time
Voice of Regina Spektor: Jenny, um, I don't know if that's you, because that didn't sound like you, but you know, it's a funny world where machines could replace people. Whoever that was, tell Jenny that Regina called her. And P.S. I can't believe what he did
All the evidence points in one direction
Says I don't need you physically around
I've got your voice on tape
I've got your words in me
I don't want anything else
I don't want anyone else
Thing that I had but I dropped
All that I had but I dropped
I want you back and forth
I want you up and down
I want you inside out
Regina Spektor: I was hoping you could keep me company for the ride home, but it's okay if you're sleeping
I've got your voice on tape
I've got your words in me
I don't want anything else
I don't want anyone else
And you say that I don't have this down
I've been practicing out loud
Other Voice: [garbled] I just wanted to call to say hi, and um, I think I might bring Marissa and Tracy up to Topeka [garbled]
I want you back and forth
I want you up and down
I want you back and forth
(I've got your voice on tape)
I want you up and down
(I've got your words in me)
I want you back and forth
(Thing that I had but I dropped)
I don't want anyone
I don't need anyone else
(All that I had but I dropped)
I've got your voice on tape
I've got your words in me

I've got your voice on tape
(I've got your words in me)
I've got your words in me
(I've got your voice on tape
I don't want anything else
I don't need anyone else)
All the evidence points in one direction
Says I don't need you physically around
I wish I could go so far away
Where time moves too slow day after day
I'll wait and I'll sit and watch the clouds
As they go by.
I have a sensation where laziness,
Procrastination is what I do best
I'll wait and I'll sit and watch the clouds
As they go by.
Where has my ambition gone
I haven't seen it for so long
Am I a burden to someone?
I am so tired of everything
All my desire is vanishing.
Yeah, that's my shorty doowop
Yeah, that's my shorty doowop (I love the thangs she do)
Yeah, that's my shorty doowop (I love the thangs she do)
And I can't wait to be alone with you
I bet you ain't never seen a shorty so fly
Pushin catty plaint with the chrome choppin' by
Throwin' up player wave to my partners on the block
They all show love to my shorty doo-wop
In them juicy fruit jeans bumpin 315s
Livin' every fantasy and ghetto girl dreams
Watchin swinging bang and she bend another corner
Lookin' way cool comin' through with the doshure
Now after two honey blunts I discovered the buzz
I'm call her shorty she gonna call me love
And through the thick of it all
She excepted collect calls
When the daddy got caught up by the law
Yeah, that's my shorty doowop
Yeah, that's my shorty doowop (I love the thangs she do)
Yeah, that's my shorty doowop (I love the thangs she do)
And I can't wait to be alone with you
For real though, for real though, for real though
She the girl in the movie and I'm the hero
Stuck with me with the violated pero
And came up when she started with zero
Baby Bash Latino Robert DeNiro
She got with me 'cause her hubby was a weirdo
And yes sir she lookin' so mighty mighty
Love me 'cause I'm fresh and clean and so tighty
Tha missing piece to the puzzle, the grind, the hustle
Respect when I'm good and love me when I'm in trouble
And yes sir, oh no, and yes sir she lookin' so throw
Yeah, that's my shorty doowop
Yeah, that's my shorty doowop (I love the thangs she do)
Yeah, that's my shorty doowop (I love the thangs she do)
And I can't wait to be alone with you
I can't wait to be alone with you
'Cause you the only boo who do the freaky things you do
You keep me fellin high you keep my drama low
Yeah I'm your shorty boy but you already know
Yeah, that's my shorty doowop
Yeah, that's my shorty doowop (I love the thangs she do)
Yeah, that's my shorty doowop (I love the thangs she do)
And I can't wait to be alone with you
Here's my list of all the things I should have said and done
The boats I missed and all the fights I lost, I really should have won
And I'm not the only one
But I won't bow or take the world as you would hand it down
So leave me out of all your plans 'cause I don't need them now
I'll find my own way out
'Cause when you're left with nothing, there's nothing left to lose
That's when they'll come looking for me and you
Once we wanted nothing and everything was new
It was all laid out just for me and you now
Wave goodbye I know that I'll believe if you spell it out for me
Spell it out so everyone can see
All that really matters now to me is that I could set you free
My hands are tied and I can't find my feet
Sit by me for long enough and watch your enemies
Float downstream one by one until you realise you're free
There's no one left but me
'Cause when you're left with nothing, there's nothing left to lose
That's when they'll come looking for me and you
Once we wanted nothing and everything was new
It was all laid out just for me and you now
Wave goodbye 'cause I know I'll believe if you spell it out for me
Spell it out so everyone can see
All that really matters now to me is that I could set you free
My hands are tied and I can't find my feet
This sweet old world will give it out until it's time to leave
I won't hurt for you when all you want's a flawless victory
How wrong could anyone be?
'Cause when you're left with nothing, there's nothing left to lose
That's when they'll come looking for me and you
Once we wanted nothing and everything was new
It was all laid out just for me and you now
Wave goodbye, I know that I'll believe if you spell it out for me
Spell it out so everyone can see
All that really matters now to me is that I could set you free
My hands are tied and I can't find my feet
Rachel
When I was younger, I saw my daddy cry and curse at the wind
He broke his own heart as I watched as he tried to reassemble it
And my momma swore that she would never let herself forget
And that was the day that I promised I'd never sing of love if it does not exist
But darling...
You are the only exception, you are the only exception
You are the only exception, you are the only exception
Maybe I know somewhere deep in my soul that love never lasts
And we've got to find other ways to make it alone or keep a straight face
And I've always lived like this, keeping a comfortable distance
And up until now I have swore to myself that I'm content with loneliness
Because none of it was ever worth the risk
You are the only exception, you are the only exception
You are the only exception, you are the only exception
Ohhh, ohhh
Hey, ohhh
I've got a tight grip on reality
But I can't let go of what's in front of me here
I know you're leaving in the morning when you wake up
Leave me with some kind of proof it's not a dream
Ohhh
You are the only exception, you are the only exception
You are the only exception, you are the only exception
You are the only exception, you are the only exception
You are the only exception, you are the only exception
And I'm on my way to believing
Ohhh, and I'm on my way to believing
You can be redeemed boys, you can be redeemed
Life is but a dream boy, you can be redeemed
Nothing's as it seems, you can be redeemed
Everything's permitted, nothing's really true
Live outside the law boys doing what to do
Nothing's at it seems, you can be redeemed
Sometimes I feel so lonely, sometimes I feel so lonely
Sometimes I feel so lonely, sometimes I feel so lonely
You can be redeemed boys, you can be redeemed
Life is but a dream boy, you can be redeemed
Nothing's as it seems, you can be redeemed
Sometimes I feel so lonely, sometimes I feel so lonely
Sometimes I feel so lonely, sometimes I feel so lonely
Been the crawl of a mountain 
Been a link in a chain 
I've been scolded for stealing 
I've been told to behave 
I've been reading the forecast 
Something's coming this way 
But it's taking forever 
I'm too tired to maintain that 
I'm slow
Been a scratch on the surface 
Been a clog in the drain 
I've been melodramatic 
I've been sleeping for days 
I've been one in a million 
Been a million to one 
This is taking forever 
Always seems to return that 
I'm slow
All hands up, salute the Empire State
Faith be true, you know the way
Ten feet tall in this: an empty space
Fallen walls all around
Destroyed again
Destroyed again
Been digging to China 
Been a fish in the sea 
I've been talking to Jesus 
But he's not talking to me 
I've been reading the forecast 
Something's coming this way 
But it's taking forever 
And I'm too tired to maintain that 
I'm slow
All hands up, salute the Empire State 
Faith is true, she knows the way 
Ten miles tall in this: an empty space 
Fallen walls all around 
We'll build again 
Rebuild again 
Been the crawl of a mountain 
Been a link in a chain 
Been scolded for stealing
Been carted away
A bed of moss was granted,
She laid down with a sigh,
Embraced by the green blankets
She kissed the world goodbye.
Eine Liebe, ein Versprechen
Sagte: "Ich komm zurück zu dir"
Nun ich muss es leider brechen
Seine Kugel steckt in mir
Eine Liebe, zwei Pistolen
Eine zielt mir ins Gesicht
Er sagt, ich hätte dich gestohlen
Dass du mich liebst, weiß er nicht
Roter Sand und zwei Patronen
Eine stirbt im Pulverkuss
Die zweite soll ihr Ziel nicht schonen
Steckt jetzt tief in meiner Brust
Eine Liebe, ein Versprechen
Ach das Blut läuft aus dem Mund
Und keiner wird mich rächen
Sinnlos gehe ich zu Grund
Eine Liebe, zwei Pistolen
Einer konnte schneller ziehen
Nun ich bin es nicht gewesen
Jetzt gehörst du ihm
Roter Sand und zwei Patronen
Eine stirbt im Pulverkuss
Die zweite sollt ihr Ziel nicht schonen
Steckt jetzt tief in meiner Brust
Roter Sand und weiße Tauben
Laben sich an meinem Blut
Am Ende gibt es doch ein Ende
Bin ich doch zu etwas gut
Roter Sand und zwei Patronen
Eine stirbt im Pulverkuss
Die zweite sollt ihr Ziel nicht schonen
Steckt jetzt tief in meiner Brust
I'm caught in the flow of things
My memory's a broken machine
This is how my day begins
This is just one day unseen
Let's do it serpentine any time
Let's do it right here
Let's do it serpentine, I don't mind
Let's do it right here
Is it bad that you're good for me?
Did I love you just randomly?
I'm caught in the flow of sound
And you're just some melody
Let's do it serpentine any time
Let's do it right here
Let's do it serpentine, I don't mind
Let's do it right here
There's a cute little litany
Put it on my shoulder
Eight o'clock and we agree
It makes me look much older
Got my clockwork's company
I got my dark green trenchcoat on
I'm sure it will always be
Someone staying and someone gone
Let's do it serpentine any time
Let's do it right here
Let's do it serpentine, I don't mind
Let's do it right here
On the day of her arrival
No one is there to meet her
Something of a sad one
A girl with permanent tears
Born without a family
Born without a name
And all she ever wanted
Was to wipe her tears away
Wipe her tears away
Away... away
If someone came to love her
And if someone came to be
The one that will protect her
Be a family
Now we will see a smile again
And tears like dreams can be
Something we will never see
Lost in her memory
Wipe her tears away
Away... away
Wipe her tears away
Tears away... away... away
She's something of a tragedy
Stands in the shade of despair
I want to cast some light onto her world
A world of permanent tears
Born without a family
Born without a name
Free this weeping willow
From drowning in a flood of tears
Wipe her tears away
Tears away... away... away (REPEAT)
No solid ground
It's fake believe
All you can see
Is really there
Recall betrayals
So when I came in there,
A million lines tried to reach me;
And what I've seen out there,
Too many words misleading
Don't mute it
Be wilder
Control it
Conclude
(x2)
No solid ground to walk on
She's softly breathing next to me
A shining angel sent to me
From where she came it's hard to say
Tiny star she guides my way
When we were lovers
We both discovered
Stay, you can leave tomorrow
Stay wait until tomorrow
Please stay
Living here in shades of grey
Colour she light a reason to stay
From where she came it's hard to stay
Tiny star she guides my way
When we were lovers
We both discovered
Stay, you can leave tomorrow
Stay wait until tomorrow
Please stay
Please stay
Please stay
Please stay
Shore to shore, got some land between
Island life is living from a cup of broken queens
Hit the jackpot rolling through a pipe dream in a knot
And I'm missing what was pissing up the wall that I forgot
I forgot, I forgot
I am the masked rider, give me some grace
You've never seen me and you don't know my face
She was no ???, it was cold, it was blue
And it only happened despite me or you
Me or you, me or you
Smoking paper to the crimson flashing bars
Drinking cocktail wine or cottage cream and passing strangers' cars
Live in one-room housing, with a roof to meet the sky
Spelling Jesus won't you please us 'cause you seem a damn nice guy
Damn nice guy, damn nice guy
We listened to passengers stamping old songs
And we lose, what's to lose, when you haven't done wrong
Drums too slow for a funeral beat
No strumming of strings and no stamping of feet
Of feet, of feet
It's awfully considerate of you to think of me
And it's not so hard to see you smoking fags and drinking tea
It's the crummy lost at seasick with a floating on the waves
To join the other flotsam with the ripped up queens and knaves
Queens and knaves, queens and knaves
There lies a lady, she's gone and she's gone
She'll be a fine lady before too long
But I hit her head and she finished her walking
She shouldn't be dead, she was too busy talking
Busy talking, busy talking
They can fill a cup or two and still disturb the peace
It's never made it all the way from shore to shore, from west to east
I read that independence was a lightness in your step
You walked away, I felt so heavy at the start of every day
Every day, every day
I've been waiting an hour and the bus hasn't come
I've been cursing my god for the lack of the sun
I've been ruined by destiny, lowered by fate
And the upshot of this is I'm going to be late
To be late, to be late
If you think you're sinking, you probably are.
Only you can know, only you can know.
If you think you're falling, you probably will.
You've got to lose yourself, but not let go.
I think we'll be alright, I think we will survive,
Everybody gets a little scared like this sometimes.
I think we'll be alright, I think we will survive,
You've got to fall apart and put it back together again.
I never said I loved you quite enough.
I hope it's not too late, I hope it's not too late.
I've got this one fresh second, one fresh minute, one fresh hour of my day
To hope it's not too late, I hope it's not too late
I think we'll be alright, I think we will survive,
Everybody gets a little scared like this sometimes.
I think we'll be alright, I think we will survive,
You've got to fall apart and put it back together again.
You've got to fall apart and put it back together again.
I'm gonna tell you I love you one more time.
Again and again, again and again.
I've got this one fresh second, one fresh minute, one fresh hour of my day 
To pray it's not too late, I hope it's not too late.
I think we'll be alright, I think we will survive,
Everybody gets a little scared like this sometimes.
I think we'll be alright, I think we will survive,
You've got to fall apart and put it back together again.
You've got to fall apart and put it back together again.
I think about how it might have been
We'd spend out days travelin'
It's not that I don't understand you
It's not that I don't want to be with you
But you only wanted me
The way you wanted me
So, I will head out alone, hope for the best
And we hang our heads down
As we skip the goodbyes
And you can tell the world what you want them to hear
I've got nothing left to lose, my dear
So, I'm up for the little white lies
But you and I know the reason why
I'm gone, and you're still there
I'm gone, and you're still there
I'm gone, and you're still there
I'll buy a magazine searching for your face
From coast to coast, or where ever I find my place
I'll track you on the radio, and
I'll find your list in a different name
But as close as I get to you
It's not the same
So, I will head out alone, hope for the best
We can pat ourselves on the back
As say that we tried
And if one of us makes it big
We can spill our regrets
And talk about how the love never dies
But you and I know the reason why
I'm gone, you're still there
I'm gone, you're still there
I'm gone, and you're still there
So, steal the show, and do your best
To cover the tracks that I have left
I wish you well and hope you find
Whatever you're looking for
The way I might've changed my mind,
But you only showed me the door
So, I will head out alone, hope for the best
We can pat ourselves on the back
And say that we tried
And if one of us makes it big
We can spill our regrets
And talk about how the love never dies
But you and I, you and I, you and I know the reason why.
You pulled up and parked your El Dorado
We said "hi" and kissed with some bravado
I got out my camera and was laughing
Happy it was you I'm photographing
And we drove to the ferry
Like the cat and canary
I said, "Baby, it's scary
When it's so beautiful
Why does it hurt me
To feel so much tenderness?
Beautiful
You little wonder, you"
Maybe then I held your hand and kissed you
I know once I just hauled off and hit you
'Cause I can't even stand it
'Cause I don't want to end it
To be perfectly candid -
Baby, you're beautiful
Sometimes it hurts me
To feel so much tenderness
Beautiful
Wish you could see it, too
And all I have to do today
Is make you happy
The only thing you have to say
Is, "It's all lovely, baby"
Late that night, we checked into the Bellevue
Held you close, but, baby - couldn't tell you
And we stayed in our Calvins
And we swore we'd be best friends
And I looked through the zoom lens
And thought you were beautiful
Sometimes it hurts me
To feel so much tenderness
Beautiful
Baby, I'm dazzled
By the view
Beautiful
You don't need to tell me
I'm completely powerless
Beautiful
I wish you could see it, too
I wish you could see it, too
I wish you could see it, too
Baby, how I see you
Halley's waitress
Never comes around
She's hiding in the kitchen
She's nowhere to be found
I just want some coffee
Is that too much to ask?
Halley's waitress
Is not up to the task
And when she finally appears
It's like she's been away for years
It's been so long
So long
Darling don't you know
We miss you when you're gone
So long
So long
Darling don't you know
We miss you when you're gone
Ah
Halley's waitress
Has vanished once again
She's talking to her agent
She's calling all her friends
Forget about the coffee
I'll just take a check
Halley's waitress
You know you'll get yours yet
It's been so long
So long
Darling don't you know
We miss you when you're gone
So long
So long
Darling don't you know
We miss you when you're gone
Ah
2 O'Clock you're still sleeping
When you wake up you'll be in such pain
And I wait with the plate, piled high with my love
That you won't eat from
Love, you think you can contain me
But the future is already known
We give up our rest, and the best of us though
We'd be better off alone
There's no need to be so terrible
When you know I would do anything for you
This is so laughable, whatever happened to
Knowing that this was forever
File off the sharpness of feelings so
I'll be protected from all of your evil
When you come round my love, I'll be gone, finally done
Never to come to your rescue
It's way too late to think of
Someone I would call now
The neon signs got tired
Red eye flights help the stars out
I'm safe in a corner
Just hours before me
I'm waking with the roaches
The world has surrendered
I'm dating ancient ghosts
(The ones I made friends with)
The comfort of fireflies
Long gone before daylight
And if I had one wish fulfilled tonight
I'd ask for the sun to never rise
If God lent his voice to me to speak
I'd say:" go to bed, world"
I've always been too lame
To see what's before me
And I know nothing sweeter than
Champagne from last new year's
Sweet music in my ears
And a night full of no fear
But if I had one wish fulfilled tonight
I'd ask for the sun to never rise
If God passed the mic to me to speak
I'd say:" stay in the bed world... sleep in peace"
Take care not to hurt yourself
Beware of the need for help
You might need too much
And people are such
Take care, please, take care
Some people read idea books
And some people have pretty looks
But if your eyes are wide
And all words aside
Take care, please, take care
This sounds a bit like goodbye
In a way it is I guess
As I leave your side
I've taken the air
Take care, please, take care
Take care, please, take care
Bells will chime
Miles appear
I can't heed them all
Two eyes
Less than two eyes
Is more than enough to know
When to leave
Why to stay
How to keep away
Now feels like forever
Once it goes away
Bells will chime
Miles appear
I can't heed them all
Two eyes
Less than two eyes
Is more than enough to know
When to leave
Why to stay
How to keep away
Now feels like forever
Once it goes away
Can you say goodbye, without ever leaving?
That's some sad soul to keep
Amanda awakes in a moment believing
She's better off staying asleep
So she drives by the station 
Imagining somewhere
Sings a slow slow song
Now she's waiting at the stoplights
With no where to go
But in our town there's just one stoplight
Oh I wish she would know
There's a world outside her window
Anywhere the wind blows
Anywhere's Amanda's dream
She sits late at night by the light of a candle
Her wishes that never come true
Her hope gets so high they're too hard to handle
She stares as they fade out of view
And these song words have led her to nowhere
Cept a slow slow song
Now she's waiting at the stoplights
With no where to go
But in our town there's just one stoplight
Oh I wish she would know
There's a world outside her window
Anywhere the wind blows
Anywhere's Amanda's dream
Well she sleeps like a girl
But she wakes like a woman
She sleeps like a girl
But she wakes like a woman
Like a woman
Waitin at the stoplights with nowhere to go
But in our town there's just one stoplight
I wish she would know
There's a world outside her window
Anywhere the wind blows
Anywhere's Amanda's dream.
The last thought that you think today
Has already happened
The link between profound and pain
Covers you like sherwin williams
The smokey joe is broken
Drops into your lap
And the big red wasp
Makes a scan through
My black pages
Last night our boy was out there
Burning up his matches
I saw him in the afternoon
Sporting a black eye
The universal man
Holds a pistol or a bottle
Types with confidence
As we grow out of our
Bruises
Once I had a friend
Who had the knack of tossing
His mind around geography
Boy you think, you have problems
The hunter is asleep
At least that's what I call him
In the afternoon
Of the new cobweb
Summer
For I am an engine and I'm holding on
The world is all bending and breaking from me
But sweetness alone who flew out threw the window
And landed back home in a garden of green
You're riding alone in the back of a steamer
And steaming yourself in the warm shower spray
And water rolls on off the round captain's belly
Who's talking to tigers from his cafeteria tray
And sweet babies cry for the cool taste of milking
That milky delight that invited us all
And if there's a taste in this life more inviting
Then wake up your windows and watch
As the sweet babies crawl away
Instrumental
I got more I got no need
I got nothing I could leave
I got things that you should see
I went riding all around
Hit the pass
I built this sound
Try'd to picture it going dow_wow_n
Come on away from me is it done
Come on away from me is it done
Come on away from me is it done
Come on away from me is it done
Felt a pull I pulled away
We got nothing that ill say
Still I feel it's not this way
Waiting nothings goin' round
Can't seem to get it of the ground
Seeing if ill come around
Come on away from me is it done
Come on away from me is it done
Come on away from me is it done
Come on away from me is it done
Or is it you ooh ooh ooh ooh
Is it you ooh ooh ooh ooh
Is it you ooh ooh ooh ooh
Is it you ooh ooh ooh ooh
I know my soul is battered
And I know my mind is gone
I been waiting for an answer
But the question takes to long
I need guidance on the river
I need everything I've done
So familiars coming at me
Don't want to blow it all at once
Come on away from me is it done
Come on away from me is it done
Come on away from me is it done
Come on away from me is it done
Or is it you ooh ooh ooh ooh
Is it you ooh ooh ooh ooh
Is it you ooh ooh ooh ooh
Is it you ooh ooh ooh ooh
Is it you ooh ooh ooh ooh
Is it you ooh ooh ooh ooh
Is it you ooh ooh ooh ooh
Is it you ooh ooh ooh ooh
One more awful feeling
And fog rotate
Pelted on the second stair
Blood falls from your vision
Of an overdraw
Don't pant and we'll go unseen
Chirping birds
Passed off an open glare
Hung on a firework
Bodies at once we were
Torched by the burning sand
Touched by a folded hand
Ripped off in your marteau
And matching walk
Echoed in a crowded square
Dragged into submission
Only salt remains
Stranded with a crooked sore
Hiding pain
Into a pair of car
Crash into merchant shores
What you ask me for
Then he tries docks at ten
Dropped with his failing chore
Always not to exaggerated fights
Or to defy
Go away like you always do your entire life
You're saying bye
Fool in the night
Wake in the night
Oh let me go, old dinosaur
From the right to the wrong settle
For such a long time I didn't know if I'd find you
Say stop, made up, lying on the bathroom floor
For such a long time I didn't know if I'd find you
Say stop, made up, lying on the bathroom floor
Haunted all this time
Don't know how to fly
We know you're there
Flashlight as your guide
Sticky from your dye
Unfurling hair
Fool in the night
Stay in the night
Oh let me go, old dinosaur
From the right to the wrong settle, settle
Cover me with your long feathers
When I die
Circle me in your long feathers, feathers, feathers, feathers
For such a long time I didn't know if I'd find you
Say stop, made up, lying on the bathroom floor
For such a long time I didn't know if I'd find you
Say stop, made up, lying on the bathroom floor
So alive though our wolves might talk about it every day
Don't want to say no more now
'Cause we ain't gonna lie to you
We're writing cursive to
Our signs, our water slides
For such a long time I didn't know if I'd find you
Say stop, made up, lying on the bathroom floor
For such a long time I didn't know if I'd find you
Say stop, made up, lying on the bathroom floor
For such a long time I didn't know if I'd find you
Say stop, made up, lying on the bathroom floor
For such a long time I didn't know if I'd find you
Say stop, made up, lying on the bathroom floor
Don't, don't
For such a long time I didn't know if I'd find you
(Say stop, made up)
Lying on the bathroom floor
Water, so much water is under the bridge
Have not seen you since I was 21
And you know I was just a kid
And I have oh so many friends who talk you up like your someone new
Yeah but I've already gotten over you
Times, times where the lamps were lit so low
Well only a stranger would think its impossible to let them go
And I have oh so many flashback scenes that I can calmly walk straight through
And now my mind is free to walk the streets we used to walk so quietly
And laid the foundation for this handful of rhymes well I have left the frustration behind my eyes
"Wait! Don't let your dream just walk away!"
Exactly how many times have I heard that one today
Yeah we have oh so many friends who like to pretend we're still in high school
"Water, so much water is under the bridge"
Something has gone wrong.
Play me first as long as we open up our eyes.
Why do we justify these foolish who are burning?
If we don't wake up soon this burden will be long
If we don't wake up soon all we ever knew will be gone.
This comforts so deciving all common sense aside. This world wonders grieving but from the depths we hide. 
We question of this hatred as we sacrifice. 
It's comatose you see.
How much longer can we bleed before we come to our senses again?
If we don't wake up soon this burden will be long.
If we don't wake up soon all we ever knew will be gone
When I was young
The feeling was there
It is still there
Unweaving in me
As I recollect
Take me back to the stems of it
Through the eyes of my parents' tongues
How I listened to them
So I made up my mind
I'll be around for a while
You can bet on your life
I'll be around for a while
Call out my name, when you call I'll be there
I'm always running, chasing flames on a dare
Come back gimme light, come on darling shine
Call out my name, when you call I'll be there
So I made up my mind
I'll be around for a while
You can bet on your life
I'll be around for a while
Time after time
I'll be around
This love tonight
It will be around for a while
If wishes were horses then beggars would ride
Let your inner mystic unravel tonight
Harder than diamonds, we cut up the sky
Running like a river white hot with desire
So I made up my mind
I'll be around for a while
You can bet on your life
I'll be around for a while
Time after time
I'll be around
This love tonight
It will be around for a while
Really need to say, oh
Are you saying things have changed my ways again
Really need to say
(Really need to say)
Girl I've prayed, oh
Prayed I'd meet someone like you someday
That's all I need to say
(That's all I need, that's all I need)
So I made up my mind
I'll be around for a while
You can bet on your life
I'll be around for a while
Time after time
I'll be around
This love tonight
It will be around for a while
My friend
She tipped over
Out of childhood into sadness
She's always shining
But nevertheless
Her beautiful heart is drowned in grief
Sugar horse, lives inside
Like a friend
In need
Far and wide she'll gaze
Upon the flowers bloom
Jaded, her mind in a daze
From the medicine gloom
They leave her with her friend
A force of nature filled with strength
Sugar horse, lives inside
Like a friend
In need
(Anneke van Giersbergen)
I lay down beside him
He gives me kisses
Follow the tracks
From another dream
I follow the tracks
And spin the context
I follow the tracks
And spin
I follow the tracks
And spin the context
Into the open
I lay amongst the clouds
Dissolving falling down
Follow the tracks
I promise to send word
I enter the visible world
With a tongue of secrets
I breathe the neon
With a calm, calm, calm, calm fear.
I follow the tracks
And spin the context
I follow I follow
I follow the tracks
And spin
I follow I follow
I follow the tracks
And spin the context
I follow I follow
I breathe the neon
With a calm fear
I follow the tracks
And spin the context
I follow I follow
I follow the tracks
And spin
I follow I follow
I follow the tracks
And spin the context
I follow I follow
I Breath the neon
With a calm fear
I Breath the neon
With a calm fear
I Breath the neon
With a calm fear
When I found out that each and every one of you were dead
Wrote a letter to the universe instead
She said, I can put your mind at ease
I've got a planet on the line
I'd l-l-l-l-l-love to be a man
Paintin' pictures to discover foreign lands
You put the ache into make believe
Out of sight is out of mind
Your famous last words, thought they'd never be erased
We were swimming on the night before three days
With the waves crashing down on me
We're not running out of time
Run for cover, hide beneath an avalanche
Change our name before we even took a chance
And when the sky's done cavin' in
Would you take me for a ride?
The night had a number, number 37 babe
Now we're dancin' to the music that we made
Your delay means eternal leave
Look forever to remind
That I-I-I-I-I-I wanna be your man
But you won't let me recover who you am
Set me free on a gentle breeze
Let me carry you beside
Wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wanna comprehend
The reflection in the mirror in your hand
Or the weight of the seven seas
Really cut us down to size
Baby, don't you know that it is understood
That if you take away the sunshine
Then you take away the starlight
Baby, don't you know that it is understood
That if you take away the sunshine
Then you take away the starlight, ooh
Baby, don't you know that it is understood
That if you take away the sunshine
Then you take away the starlight, ooh
Baby, don't you know that it is understood
That if you take away the sunshine
Then you take away the starlight, ooh
Baby, don't you know that it is understood
That if you take away the sunshine
Then you take away the starlight, ooh
Baby, understood, sunshine, starlight
Baby, understood, sunshine, starlight
It's battleship grey outside
And we don't know what we'll be getting
All your sweet talking, raining over me
Till my name escapes and I'm set free
There's a word in your eye
But I don't know what is to say it
And when you call me from the other side
A sense of it starts breaking up, and its lies
I don't know, what I'm getting
But I'm getting something
I don't know, what I'm getting
But I'm getting something
It's battleship grey outside
Confusion, all this is for the gods
Uncertainty, I could be bathing under artificial light
Under twilight blue, starts to mesmerise
And I tell myself that you light up my life
But it's all in the mind when you cannot see in the eyes
'Cause I don't know, what I'm getting
But I'm getting something
I don't know, what I'm getting
But I'm getting something
It's battleship grey
All your sweet talking, raining over me
Till my name escapes and I'm set free
At nighttime I go out and see the people
Air goes cool and hurrying on my way
And dressing so sweet, all the people to see
They're looking at me, all the people to see.
And when I set my eyes on you
You look like a kitty
And when you're in the moon
Oh you look so pretty
Caught a glance in your eyes
And fell through the skies
Glance in your eyes
And fell through the skies
I'm walking down the freezing street
Scarf goes out behind
You said get them away
Please don't say a word
Get me out of here
Get me out of here
I hate it here
Get me out of here
At nighttime I go out and see the people
Air goes cool and hurrying on my way
Glanced in your eyes and fell through the skies
Dance in your eyes and fell through the skies
Take your time and back up a little bit
C'mon now, people, get yourselves out of it
No chains can hold me, no walls confine me
C'mon now, people, c'mon and slide with me
'Cause I'm blind but not as blind as you
I'm sick, there's not a thing I wanna do about it
I'm dumb but now I wanna mouth off about it
I'm tired of it all, I guess that I am through with it all
Yeah, I'm tired of it all, I guess that I am through with it all
Take your time and back up a little bit
C'mon now, people, get yourselves out of it
No chains can hold me, no walls confine me
C'mon now, people, c'mon and slide with me
'Cause I'm blind but not as blind as you
I'm sick, there's not a thing I wanna do about it
I'm dumb but now I wanna mouth off about it
I'm tired of it all, I guess that I am through with it all
Yeah, I'm tired of it all, I guess that I am through with it all
I'm tired of it all
Take good care of it, babe
You know it's going slow but it's coming your way
You know we keep talking 'bout a revolution
But the air's so thin and you're still polluting it
You know we keep talking but it's so frustrating
Hell, you know we keep talking but there's no mistaking it
Take good care of it, babe, take good care of it, babe
Take good care of it, babe, take good care of it, babe
It was a hot and sultry afternoon
Sometime at the end of June
We had collapsed ourselves in shade somewhere
To conclude our love affair
But it was too damn hot to speak that much
It felt easier to touch
So we forgot to fall apart that day
And the next day
It was a cold and angry sky above
When he decided he was through with love
The leaves were paths of skeletons
And he was only skin and bones
And then he went to the bridge so he could fall
And drop down far away from it all
But the water looked so black and deep
That he closed his eyes and he went to sleep
Till the next day
The snow fell hard from five to five
You had to drink to stay alive
But you were hoping it would kill you too
At least you'd have something changing you
Cause you were cold as the ice at your front door
You raised a trembling glass and shouted 'FUCK THE WAR!'
And then you fell into oblivion
Lying on your bed with your shoes on
Till the next day
Baby close your eyes until tomorrow
It could bring joy, it could bring sorrow
But it will come as sure as light
Try not to dream and dream tonight
Imagine that you're standing here
And suddenly you disappeared
A thread cut with a carving knife
That is what they call our life
Baby close your eyes until tomorrow
It could bring joy, it could bring sorrow
But it will come as sure as light
Try not to dream and dream tonight
Imagine that you're standing here
And suddenly you disappeared
A thread cut with a carving knife
That is what they call our life
Well it's you and it's me
Me with a drink in my hand
The ice is tinkling like a wind chime
And late afternoon settles over the land
And you're talking about things
Interesting just slightly
And things that matter too much
To say any way but lightly
Did you know you're so beautiful
On the edge of summer
That years from now
I'll cry to remember
How very close you were
Knowing this will I reach for you
Knowing this will I reach for you
The way you want me to
Well it's time to be wise
Wise in the ways of the heart
To come out from under the covers
This voluntary state of apart
From the faces
Oasis
In this Sahara of sorrow
These graces that hold me
It's from you that I borrow
Did you know you're so beautiful
On the edge of summer
That years from now
I'll cry to remember
How very close you were
Knowing this will I reach for you
Knowing this will I reach for you
The way you want me to
So your mouth tastes like sunshine, baby, but your eyes are all cool buried in my arms
And the breeze takes us deeper and further into the heart of a moment that is gone
And the scent of your heartache, baby, and the taste of your blood, run within me
And there are red flowers in your spit when you enter my mouth under the bed, down on the floor
So take me under the floorboards; I would love to feel like wood
Take me back to the retards; cause the world just make me sick
There are colors in the air when I fall to the ground
How we'd love to fall more often
There's a band in our cellar, baby, and they're playing a song of the drunks in the street
And I can hear when they're playing their love songs cause the kids in the yard stop playing with their toys
So take me under the schoolyard, there are kids there who got lost
Their mouths all shouting asphalt and their bodies torn apart
There are colors in the air when I fall to the ground
I can sense a world of heartache,
But I love the sound
Of your hair
When it falls down from the pillow late at night
On the brink of illusion, it's the devil in my eyes
Waiting for the moment to kill me inside
How we'd love to die more often
So take my hands, love, there's a burst inside our minds
Feel my hands, love, 'cause I'm numb from the neck down
And there is fire, love, on the balcony right here
I can see our bodies burn but sense no fear
And your mouth tastes like sunshine, baby, but your eyes are all cool buried in my arms
And everything matters for a second as we fall to the floor
The movement comes in slow
It's a tune we both should know
And the walls are thin
So we keep our voices low
You're a bird with a pretty mouth
You're a bird with songs to shout
And the same refrain continues
Singing out:
"If you love her let her go,
If you love her let her go"
She sings beautiful and slow
A tune that only caged birds know
So you're in Nashville on the phone
And I'm back here at home
And the words are new
But I recognize the tone
"If you love her let her go
If you love her let her go
If you love her let her go"
She's beautifully composed
A tune that only caged birds know
My love goes free...
My love goes free...
My love goes free...
My love goes free...

From the pain come the dream
From the dream come the vision
From the vision come the people
And from the people come the power
From this power come the change
We kiss goodnight with a firm handshake
And it's lights out for catholic computers.
This is fantastic for you.
I've been up at nights to paint the house ghost white.
This is fantastic.
Feel a wave of destiny wash over my helpless body
I can't seem to find my way
The air is thick and foggy
What do you say, do you say to fate
What do you say, do you say to fate
All these thoughts abound my mind
I wait for rescue and for a sign
I cannot kneel, I'm out of time
I'm face to face with my insides
I felt so bound by mindless ways
As life unfolds so does my faith
I've burned all paths that lead to peace
Now all of them feel sympathy
I'm singled out
My soul is pinned
I'm trapped in a state of question
I try to run away
But finding an answer beckons
How do you try, do you try to live
How do you try, do you try to live
How did I get here
Don't turn back
I'm feeling rage of a hurricane
I never thought it'd be this way
But now it is, and what to say
There's nothing so I must escape
Now where is peace and what is fair
Should we just march without a care
And go where we are told to go
Without a thought, without saying no
I hope that I find what I'm reaching for
The way that it is in my mind
I hope that I won't be that wrong anymore
And maybe to have learned this time
Someday I'll get over you
I'll live to see it all through
But I'll always miss
Dreaming my dreams with you
But I won't let it change me, not if I can
I'd rather believe in love
And give it away as much as I can
To those that I am fondest of
Someday I'll get over you
I'll live to see it all through
But I'll always miss
Dreaming my dreams with you
Someday I'll get over you
I'll miss dreaming with you
Someday I'll get over you
I'll miss dreaming with you
Someday
A cigarette that bears a lipsticks traces 
An airline ticket to romantic places 
And still my heart has wings 
These foolish things remind me of you 
A tinkling piano in the next apartment 
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant 
A fairgrounds painted swing 
These foolish things remind me of you 
You came, you saw and you conquered me 
When you did that to me, I knew somehow this had to be 
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer 
A telephone that rings, but who's to answer 
Or how the ghost of you clings 
These foolish things remind me of you 
The scent of smoldering leaves
The vail of steamers
Two lovers on their street
Who walk like dreamers
Or how the ghost of you clings 
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange, how sweet, to find you still 
These things are dear to me, they seem to bring you so near to me 
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations, 
Silk stockings thrown aside, dance invitations 
Or how the ghost of you clings 
These foolish things remind me of you
A chilly wind is blowing
And I'm all covered up
With despair and desperation
And it just won't let me up
It's come in time to face the truth
And somehow I got to find the strength to move
I gotta get up and get over you
Another dawn is breaking
And the people pass me by
And they don't know how hard I'm aching
And there ain't no place to hide
I've got to find some resistance
Forgetting your existence
I've got to get up and get over you
If I could have one more chance
With you by my side
You know I would take back that moment
When we said goodbye
Ooh, yeah
A chilly wind is still blowing
And the sun is going down
And the streets are all in tears
And there's not a soul around
It's coming time to face the truth
And it's so hard this thing I got to do
Somehow I got to get up and get over you
Ooh, man ooh, hey get over you, hey get over you
Hey, I gotta get over you
I gotta get over you, oh
Tell me and take your time 
Set free this soul of mine
Freeze frame this sedate moment
Lie me in your quiet ground
I understand your 
Tired eyes for these 
Tired homes and tired trees
I see the pain in those 
Brown eyes 
Fires burn in autumn skies
Everyday trying to make up for the one before
Climb three flights to tremble at the site of your already open door
The frustration I see when I tell you I'd like some company
Breaks my heart
How can you be so impartial?
And I even made myself the fool
Who's fallen for you
So let me down softly this time, and
I won't have to come back crying
I just made myself look bad
You're the one who should be feeling that
It'd be better to forget you
But I don't really want to
It'd be better to forget you
But I don't really want to
Energy spent trying to believe you're not worth it
You don't deserve it
But I wish you did 'cause I can't rid the thought of it
And I'll remember you as the second or two artists I knew who decided to screw me over
'Cause it's the bolder thing to do
And I even made myself the fool
Who's fallen for you
So let me down softly this time, and
I won't have to come back crying
I just made myself look bad
You're the one who should be feeling that
It'd be better to forget you
But I don't really want to
It'd be better to forget you
But I don't really want to
And I even myself the fool
Whose fallen for you
So let me down softly this time, and
I won't have to come back crying
And I even made myself the fool
Who's fallen for you
So let me down softly this time, and
I won't have to come back crying
Feeling my way through the darkness
Guided by a beating heart
I can't tell where the journey will end
But I know where to start
They tell me I'm too young to understand
They say I'm caught up in a dream
Well life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes
Well that's fine by me
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know I was lost
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know I was lost
I tried carrying the weight of the world
But I only have two hands
Hope I get the chance to travel the world
But I don't have any plans
Wish that I could stay forever this young
Not afraid to close my eyes
Life's a game made for everyone
And love is the prize
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know I was lost
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know I was lost
Didn't know I was lost
I didn't know I was lost
I didn't know I was lost
I didn't know (didn't know, didn't know)
So here's a question,
I'll hypnotize you,
But will you follow me,
Follow all these footsteps I left behind,
My hands are shaking,
Don't criticize me for being in demand
I could pay for your tears,
It's in my job description,
To tell you how to feel,
This is my ammunition,
I'll fire at will
Make make me make you want to sing along,
Whoa oh oh, whoa oh oh,
(You can have my heart)
Break break me until I write your favorite song
Whoa oh oh, whoa oh oh,
This is your anthem for tonight,
You're contemplating
What you want from me,
But it's not up to you,
Listen to me what I have to say,
Up against the wall,
With my guard down,
But can you conquer me,
A fighter in the corner with no fight
It's in my job description,
To tell you how to feel,
This is my ammunition,
I'll fire at will
Make make me make you want to sing along,
Whoa oh oh, whoa oh oh,
(You can have my heart)
Break break me until I write your favorite song
Whoa oh oh, whoa oh oh,
This is your anthem for tonight,
So here comes a breakdown,
Oh you wish you could,
So here comes a breakdown,
Let's see who can get down
So here comes a breakdown,
Let's see who gets down
Just tell me one more time,
What do you want from me
Make make me make you want to sing along,
Whoa oh oh, whoa oh oh,
(You can have my heart)
Break break me until I write your favorite song
Whoa oh oh, whoa oh oh,
This is your anthem for tonight
Maybe it's strange
I've barely made a sound for twenty-four hours
But what's to say
When all that's inside is poison to everyone
But I know one day I'll find a new light
And I will take the sickness and I'll bury it down
Cause every moment, every second
Should be precious, understand
That I don't know how to live
At all
At all
Maybe I'll change
Start a sick cult on mysterious islands
Or run away
And tell the whole world there's anger in all of us
But I know one day I'll find a new light
And I will take this sickness and bury it down
Cause every moment, every second
Should be precious, understand
That I don't know how to live
No I don't know how to live
But I don't know how to live
But I don't know how to live
Without you
Doll, I love you
But sometimes I need a day off
Don't get that face lift as a result
Don't you mind, you can take one, too
Don't you mind, don't you mind
All alone and bitter
All alone and mad
All alone with someone
And I should be so glad
All alone and twisted
All alone and bad
Won't you come and fix it
I really feel quite sad
A little piece of you
A little piece of me
A little piece of God
Is what you gave to me
And all my wishes
Have come true
I know without a doubt
When I look at you
When I trust in you
If you can trust in me
Maybe someday
We can all be free
A little piece of you
A little piece of me
A little piece I've Got
It's what you gave to me
Is what you gave to me
You're either dipping your toe
Or you're drowning
You're either dipping your toe
Or you're drowning
Is it better never to start
Than to bear the pain
Of having to stop
Of having to stop
Halfway to the bottom
Instantly forgotten
I never thought it would come
So easy
I never thought it would go
So quickly
Is it safer never to love
Than to risk your heart
Having to lose
Having to lose
Halfway to the bottom
Instantly forgotten
I don't know
Which way to go
Is it wiser never to speak
Than to raise your voice
And never be heard
Never be heard
Never be heard
Gefðu mér hönd þína
ég skal gera allt betra en það var.
Gefðu hugsun þína
ég skal leiðrétta allt.
Ekki horfa ekki hlusta
gleymdu öllu nema okkur.
Treystu mér
ég stýri þér
og bý drauma þína loks til.
Sólin mun skína fyrir okkur
grasið verður grænna fyrir okkur
blómin munu blómstra fyrir okkur
og ástin mun vara að eilífu.
Gleymdu því
sem áður var
því þetta lif
er betra.

It'll leave you with nothin' to say
Lost without a way
Ain't it funny, child?
Love sometimes leaves you
As dead as yesterday
Hoping to hold a handful of sunshine
Like a child told it cannot play, whoo
Never ever figured, Lord
Love would leave me feeling
As dead as yesterday, yeah
Whoo-whoo-whoo, whoo-hooo, whoo-hooo-ooh 
Whoo-whoo-whoo, whoo-hooo, whoo-hooo-ooh
Oh Lord, could you help me find some shelter?
Oh Lord, could you help me find some shelter?
Oh Lord, could you help me find some shelter?
Oh Lord, could you help me find some shelter? Yeah
Yeah, well, it'll leave you feeling hollow and helpless
And there is where you'll stay, he-heh
Ain't it funny child?
Love sometimes leaves you
As dead as yesterday
As dead as yesterday
As dead as yesterday
Whoo-whoo-whoo, ahh-haa, whoo-hooo-ooh
Yeah, ohh, whoo-hoo-hoo
Ahh-haa-haah-ahh-haa-whoo-hoooh

Well we've been building our trenches
Waiting alone
For some hint or suggestion
Of better things to come
So listen, listen please
I won't wait anymore
Let me run through the water
Let me drink in the sea
Let me run through the water
Just pick me up again
Taking hold of our senses
We can always be
Anything that you wanted
You know that I love you
But I can't let go
You know that I love you
But I can't let go
May you always be
May you always be
May you always be
May you always be
Loved
Loved
(If I don't make it out
Remember the love we had) x4
Always yours
Always yours
I'm always yours
I'm always yours

Are you dreaming me?
Is this feeling you?
Are you thinking similar things
Or must I think for two?
Are we on our side?
Has our case been tried?
Has the thought of leaving ever left you?
(Like a tide)
Should we carry on?
Or has it all been done now?
Is this what you heard?
Has the end occurred?
Is the last beat heard?
Goodnight Georgie, goodnight Grace
You know the sandman's on his way
Beating a path down the alleyway
Beginning to laugh in his favorite place
Here he comes as you're dreaming
Dreaming for us, darling
Goodnight Georgie, goodnight queen
Now you know what can come from dreams
All that you ask for comes from dreams
All that you ask for comes for free
Shh, now hush, as you're dreaming
Dreaming for us, darling
Come my liege just roll him over
Come on the lip only makes him bolder
Now we know what's good for us darling
Oh my darling, shall we dance?
So now hush, as you're dreaming
Dreaming for us, darling
Come my liege just roll him over
Come on the lip only makes him bolder
Come in and slit him, I've got tokens
Now we know what's good for us darling
Oh my darling, shall we dance?
Goodnight Georgie, goodnight queen
Now you know what can come from dreams
Goodnight, goodnight, goodnight
On the day that we met
I awoke from a total sleep
You said
Keep your eyes open wide
And keep your arms open wide
You brought me courage
You bring me courage
To keep my eyes open wide
And keep my arms open wide
You brought me courage
You show
A kind of delight
Dancing 'round
Like a dragonfly
Like a coverlet in the summer's air
In the summer's air
In the summer's air
On the day that we met
I awoke from a total sleep
You said
Keep your eyes open wide
And keep your arms open wide
You brought me courage
You bring me courage
To bring my eyes open wide
To keep my arms open wide
You bring me courage
You wrap your curve of delight
Round my cold cold neck
You're a coverlet
In the summer's air
In the summer's air
In the summer's air
Listen close
The monuments are whispering your name
I'm standing strong
Knowing that we'll never be the same
It's getting hard to fake
But as you go your own way
Remember, do not be afraid
Because you're right where you should be
In Capitol City
Yeah, I know
There's better things right now for you than me
You're growing up
Those squinty eyes are just starting to see
Everything you need
Say the word
It's all I'd need
To catch a plane
Make you believe
I'm wandering
I'm crawling
I'm two steps away from falling
I just can't seem to get around
I'm heavy
I'm weary
I'm not thinking clearly
I just can't seem to find solid ground
Since you've been around
I'm running
I'm hiding
I'm afraid you'll never find me
Because I've always felt lost in the crowd
I'm sinking
I'm drowning
I'm so afraid of losing
My head's been spinning round and round
Since you've been around.
I'm foolish and crazy
I just think that maybe
I've got a lot of things to figure out
I'm winning
I'm losing
I'm afraid of never choosing
This heart of mine was so beaten down
Before you came around
Time is driftin', this rock has got to roll
So I hit the road and made my getaway
Restless feeling, I really gotta hold
I started searching for a better way
And I kept on looking for a sign in the middle of the night
But I couldn't see the light, no I couldn't see the light
I kept on lookin' for a way to take me through the night
But I couldn't get it right, I couldn't get it right
LA fever, made me feel alright
But I must admit it got the best of me
Gettin' down, so deep I nearly drowned
I can't get back to where I used to be
And I kept on looking for a sign in the middle of the night
But I couldn't see the light, no I couldn't see the light
I kept on lookin' for a way to take me through the night
But I couldn't get it right, no I couldn't get it right
New York City, took me with the tide
I nearly died from hospitality
Left me stranded, and took away my pride
Just another know it all fatality
And I kept on looking for a sign in the middle of the night
But I couldn't see the light, no I couldn't see the light
I kept on lookin' for a way to take me through the night
But I couldn't get it right, no I couldn't get it right
Yeah I kept on looking for a sign in the middle of the night
But I couldn't see the light, no I couldn't see the light
I kept on lookin' for a way to take me through the night
But I couldn't get it right, no I couldn't get it right
And I kept on looking for a sign in the middle of the night
But I couldn't see the light, no I couldn't see the light
I kept on lookin' for a way to take me through the night
But I couldn't see the light, 'cause I couldn't get it right
And I kept on looking for a sign in the middle of the night
But I couldn't see the light, no I couldn't see the light
I kept on lookin' for a way to take me through the night

In the garden of love I saw
A moment of sun in her eye
And everything was quiet
In the garden of love I saw
Starlight sigh and shadow move
Faltering, no faltering
Faltering
Before you go, a few words for your heart
Before you turn, something to ponder in your heart
As you go
In our garden of love we grew
Roses so red our hearts were busted open
All feeding on the dream we made
The bright and beautiful parade
That bloom by bloom began to fade
And blow by blow, oh
Before you go, a few words for your heart
Before you turn, something to ponder in your heart
As you go
How we tried to make everything right
How we fought and we talked through the night
How we nearly
Made it
In the garden of love I saw
A moment of sun in her eye
And everything was quiet
Stepping out into the light
Other side of the window
Blinking and blind in the light
Other side of the window
Falter, no faltering now
Other side of the window
Falter, no faltering now
That journey is over
Over
Over
There's only so much that our heart can grow
Then everything else starts to overflow
And you're young and in love
Back then there was no way of knowing
So we pushed and we pulled with our nerves of steel
You had the pedals and I had the wheel
And the terrible misillusions
We never knew where we were going
There's only so much that our heart can grow
Then everything else starts to overflow
But you're young and in love
Back then there was no way of knowing
The light color in the room
The sunshine seeping in
Doesn't mix with the black of
Death's angel looming in
I've had enough of the
Brutal beatings and name callings
To lose me to this bed
Bruised internally
Eternally
Your praise little gifts you spent your money
And stuffed me with
Didn't amount to anything
The attention I need is much more serious
A kind of weight you couldn't lift
Even if your cheap career
Depended on it
I need someone much more
Mysterious
To be my miss
To be my mistress
Okay fine
When she starts to sway
The floor is blacker than the sea
She says oh well oh well you'll do just fine
Just spin and drift and try to stay in time with me
Pretend there's casters rolling on your feet
Boys are staring and they wait for dances
In lines as long as country miles
Good girls voices drift like anaesthesia
And the smiles can last for days and
On and on
When we go to sleep and wake to another brand new day
She says oh well oh well you do just fine
Just dream and wish and try to close your eyes
Think of me
Pretend that we're both older than we seem
Boys are staring and they wait for dances
In lines as long as country miles
Good girls voices drift like anaesthesia
And the smiles can last for days and days
The lost cause kids are okay
Now they wouldn't be long
Stare keep sweet and quite insane
So so insane
I met you on a midway at a fair last year
And you stood out like a ruby in a black man's ear
You were playing on the horses, you were playing on the guitar strings
You were playing like a devil wearing wings, wearing wings
You looked so grand wearing wings
Do you tape them to your shoulders just to sing
Can you fly
I heard you can! Can you fly
Like an eagle doin' your hunting from the sky
I followed with the sideshows to another town
And I found you in a trailer on the camping grounds
You were betting on some lover, you were shaking up the dice
And I thought I saw you cheating once or twice, once or twice
I heard your bid once or twice
Were you wondering was the gamble worth the price
Pack it in
I heard you did! Pack it in
Was it hard to fold a hand you knew could win
So lately you've been hiding - it was somewhere in the news
And I'm still at these races with my ticket stubs and my blues
And a voice calls out the numbers, and it sometimes mentions mine
And I feel like I've been working overtime, overtime
I've lost my fire overtime
Always playin' one more hand for one more dime
Slowin' down I'm gettin' tired!
Slowin' down
And I envy you the valley that you've found
'Cause I'm midway down the midway
Slowin' down, down, down, down
Talking about reaction, yeah yeah yeah
Talking about attraction, yeah yeah yeah
Said I'm rocking you, yeah yeah yeah
From shanty town, yeah yeah yeah
Rocking, rocking, rocking..., yeah yeah yeah
Shocking, shocking, shocking..., yeah yeah yeah
Moving, moving, moving..., yeah yeah yeah
Grooving, grooving, grooving..., yeah yeah yeah
Walking, walking, walking..., yeah yeah yeah
To every little action, yeah yeah yeah
There's a reaction, yeah yeah yeah
You don't give that soul, no no no
You don't give that soul, no no no
To every little action, yeah yeah yeah
There's a reaction, yeah yeah yeah
My hands 'round your throat 
If I kill you now, well, they will never know 
Wake me up if I'm sleeping 
By the look in your eyes I know the time's nearly come 
Wake me up 'cause I'm dreaming 
Well, they'll never believe what's been happening here 
But caught in my mind there's a way to get out 
Wake me up 'cause I'm dreaming 
Well they'll never believe it 
So hush now, my babe, please don't cry 
Everything's gonna be alright 
Hush now, darling, I can hear you're screaming 
Let me hold you until the morning comes 
So tell me this is what you want 
You can whisper it soft or you can scream it out loud 
'Cause there's still time to change your mind 
But do it now before tomorrow comes 
Wake me up 'cause I'm dreaming 
Well, they'll never believe it 
So hush now, my babe, please don't cry 
Everything's gonna be alright 
Hush now, darling, I can hear you're screaming 
Let me hold you until the morning comes 
Until the morning comes 
The light is fading 
But the stars are dancing bright 
My mind is racing like clouds across the sky 
How did you make me go... this far?
I could not lie
Skin untouched growing thicker for every step unwalked
And I don't know if it's the cold intention-slide
Taking me down
But what if You'd sing me alive
I'm ready to give up the fight
'Cause I'm just a stone
Right after You're gone
I could not lie
Even though dead skin like stone makes me ugly
It still pounds inside and it's red
And it's slipping through the grey cracks
And I know You know
But what if You'd sing me alive
I'm ready to give up the fight
'Cause I'm just a stone
Right after You're gone
The first thing that meets the eye
When I crossover into the light
I want it to be You
Right after I'm gone
So one of these nights and about twelve o'clock
This old world's going to reel and rock
Saints will tremble and cry for pain
For the Lord's gonna come in his heavenly airplane
If God had a name, what would it be?
And would you call it to his face
If you were faced with Him in all His glory?
What would you ask if you had just one question?
And yeah, yeah, God is great
Yeah, yeah, God is good
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
What if God was one of us?
Just a slob like one of us?
Just a stranger on the bus
Trying to make His way home?
If God had a face, what would it look like?
And would you want to see
If seeing meant that you would have to believe
In things like Heaven and in Jesus and the saints
And all the prophets? And...
Yeah, yeah, God is great
Yeah, yeah, God is good
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
What if God was one of us
Just a slob like one of us
Just a stranger on the bus
Trying to make His way home?
He's tryin' to make His way home
Back up to Heaven all alone
Nobody callin' on the phone
'Cept for the Pope, maybe, in Rome
Yeah, yeah, God is great
Yeah, yeah, God is good
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
What if God was one of us
Just a slob like one of us
Just a stranger on the bus
Trying to make His way home?
Just tryin' to make His way home
Like a holy rolling stone
Back up to Heaven all alone
Just tryin' to make His way home
Nobody callin' on the phone
'Cept for the Pope, maybe, in Rome
When I said you looked good baby
I was thinking possibly or maybe
We could head back to your crib
Not where I live you see
My situations quite sad
I'm still living with my mom and my dad
But really I'm going places
Even though I'm seeing three of your faces
Please, God, let's not resort to mini-mall parking spaces
Encounters with police, with my hands in the air
Encounters with police
Why ask if you don't care
I just had no idea that this would be lasting for just one single moment
I just have to say, you look so goddamn good
I give you crazy mad props, because I know I should
OK, I'm a bit intoxicated, but really I just graduated
And from where my hands are situated
Obviously, I'm growing more and more infatuated
Just wait, please wait
We could be like onions and peppers 
In a sleeping bag fajita
We could be anything you want
The way you're busting out of that wife-beater
And I know it's a bit uncomfortable here in this 2-door seater
But you're just the right size, 
And I will always feed you and feed you and feed you
If you were driving next to me
Say, on the LIE
My eyes would become so engaged
I'd float unconsciously
Into the HOV
Kill myself, the guy in front of me
His inflatable passengers of one, two, or three
Wishing that something would happen
A change in this place
'Cause I'm tearing off the fancy wrapping
Find an empty package
Take for a while, your trumpet from your lip
Loosen your hold, loosen your grip
On your old ways that have fallen out of step
In a changing time
Hoist a new flag
Hoist a new flag
Angry sun burn down
Judging us all
Guilty of neglect and disrespect
And thinking small
And death by boredom
And death by greed
If we can't stop taking
More than we need
Well across the fractured landscape
I find the same things
Tired ideas
Birds without wings
Birds without wings
Birds without wings
And these are just thoughts
On lack-luster times
I've no interest
In excuses you can find
Like you've had a hard day
Now you've too tired to care
Now you're too tired to care
You've had a hard day
Well across the fractured landscape
I see the same things
Tired ideas, broken values
Many with the notion that to share is to lose
A hollow people bound by a lack
Of imagination and too much looking back
Without the courage to give a new thing a chance
Grounded by this ignorance
(And the cat comes)
We're just
Birds without wings
Birds without wings
Birds without wings
Time, is like a dream,
Now, for a time,
You are mine.
Let's hold fast,
To the dream,
That tastes and sparkles like wine.
Who knows if it's real,
Or just something we're both dreaming of.
What seems like an interlude now,
Could be the beginning of love.
Loving you, is the world that's strange,
So much more than my heart can hold,
Loving you makes the whole world change.
Loving you, I could not grow old.
No-nobody knows,
When love will end,
So till then, sweet fiend.
Time, is like a dream
And, now, for a time,
You are mine.
Let's hold fast to the dream
That tastes and sparkles like
I could drive 
This road with my eyes closed 
Know every part home 
The three miles 
My place to yours 
I used to fly 
And be at your door in a matter of seconds 
You'd be outside waiting by the road 
And we wouldn't mind getting lost 
And at every light where the roads will cross 
Thinking in our heads 
Please turn red 
Another light is another minute 
Another kiss that you knew I meant 
Please turn red 
Grant me just another second 
One more chance to gaze into those innocent eyes 
Just another red light 
I'm sitting in this car 
And I'm dragging my feet 
Watching my speed 
And no hurry to tell you this 
Yeah I'm suppose 
To say over coffee 
Grounds for why I think we should end 
Oh what should I do? 
Oh and now I wouldn't mind getting lost 
Like every night since our roads have crossed 
Say a little prayer 
Please turn red 
Another light means another minute 
Another kiss that I thought I meant 
Yeah please turn red 
Grant me just another second 
One more chance before I see those innocent eyes 
Just another red light 
It felt so real but it was just a dream 
I hate what these lies have come to mean 
Well I try to carry the load 
Didn't want you to know 
I'm pulled to the side of the road 
Please turn red 
Another light means another minute 
Another kiss that I thought I meant 
Yeah please turn red 
Grant me just another second 
One more chance before I see those innocent eyes 
Just another red light (x4)
I'd like to buy a good
Used paperbacked living bible
And I've got some things
That I'd like to put on out there
Like a pony cart and an old bird bath
A kitchen sink and a rocking chair
You can turn me on
Almost any day at noon
Hey I'd like to put on
A four month old rat terrier pup
I think he's a male
And he's marked up pretty and
Everything
This woman's got some goats
But his feets never been on the ground
You can just buy one
Or you can have the whole herd
Yeah I'd like to find
A twenty seven inch color TV
Has to be non working
An RCA 'cause I need the parts
And daily there's an old drive shaft
And the same Berkeline recliner
It's green and it's cloth
And it's been used very little.
Then there's a Reba designs
Size eight, prom pageant dress
It's icy blue
With sequins worn just once
There are others that are strapless
But this one's slit above the knee
If you're looking for
Something perfect for that student
I have always thought
That hand guns were made for shooting people
Rather than for sport
Why not use a rifle in most other applications
You might find a rifle or a musket
But you'll never hear a pistol
There may always be
Someone looking for or finding some
Guess I'd like to sell
A good used paperback living bible
I glitrende solskin
Et landskap som våkner
Vi seiler inn mot havnen
Hjem til deg i dine armer
En historie å fortelle
Ankomst, ankomst, gi meg havn
Ankomst, ankomst, åpne din favn
La dine sorger hvile i havet
Et sted mellom nord og sør
Vinden synger de evige toner
En sage å fortelle
Ankomst, ankomst, gi meg havn
Ankomst, ankomst, åpne din favn
Ankomst, ankomst, gi meg havn
Ankomst, ankomst, åpne din favn
I live a life of the simple kind
A lie it only covers
Either way
You do it every other day
Giving love is essential
Whenever we come undone
So believe what you want to
Whenever you come undone
Someone to love me
Somebody to talk to
I wanna be like everybody else
Someone to love me
Somebody to talk to
I wanna be like everybody else
Nobody can hurt me
Unless I allow them
For it is I, for it is I that is in control
Even includes myself
Too much and I fall
Too much and I fall
That includes myself man
'Cause ya too idle
Someone to love me
Somebody to talk to
I wanna be like everybody else
Someone to love me
Somebody to talk to
I wanna be like everybody else
You won't survive just because you're idle
Come ride with me on a wave that's tidal
Forced to stand down and brave the winter
If you reveal the cracks
Then you will splinter
Someone to love me
Somebody to talk to
I wanna be like everybody else
Someone to love me
Somebody to talk to
I wanna be like everybody else
In the sharp gust of love
My memory stirred
When time wreathed a rose
A garland of shame
Its thorn my only delight
War torn, afraid to speak
We dare to breathe
Majestic, imperial
A bridge of sighs
Solitude sails on a wave of forgiveness
On angels' wings
Reach out your hands
Don't turn your back
Don't walk away
How in the world can I wish for this?
Never to be torn apart
Close to you
Till the last beat of my heart
At the close of day
The sunset cloaks
These words in shadowplay
Here and now, long and loud
My heart cries out
And the naked bone of an echo says
Don't walk away
Reach out your hands
I'm just a step away
How in the world can I wish for this?
Never to be torn apart
Close to you
Till the last beat of my heart
How in the world can I wish for this?
Never to be torn apart
Close to you
Till the last beat of my heart
Close to you
Till the last beat of my heart
'Til the last fleeting beat
Of my heart
Hey little one, think about our time
When all the pain we've overcome
Hey little one, think about a time
When all the boys are older.
All I'll ever think about is you
And you'll be there when we are through.
And all are drinking from our hearts
Of all the love that comes apart
Is all for you or all for 'I'?
I want to wait until we die
You're here afraid yet still you try,
As life for me is life through 'I'
If all for three is all for five
Then we'll have peace until we die
Close your eyes and go to sleep
Close your eyes and go to sleep
Peace to you...
Peace to you...
Peace to you.
Hey little one, think about a time
When all the waves and oceans rise
Hey little one, think about a time
And all the way, you loaded all your dolls and toys into the car,
...And we are here while you are far
And all I ever think about is you,
It's only father feathers.
It's only feathers.
They say heaven was in tune, your point of view,
I try to see your point of view
The door opens into your eyes
And I have wondered when we die
He won't have due this falling ride
As I'll have to already child
So all for you and all for I
Lets just forgive and let this child...
So all for you and all for I
So lets forgive and let this lie...
Close your eyes and go to sleep
Close your eyes and go to sleep
Peace to you...
Peace to you...
Peace to you.
Peace to you
Peace to you
Peace to all
Peace to you
Peace to all
Peace to all
Generally we are a lonely people
Generally we are alone
Generally we are alone in lonely worlds
Generally we are a lonely people
Generally we are alone, alone...
Generally we are alone in lonely worlds
Generally we are a lonely people
... Generally we are alone
Generally we are alone.
Peace to you
Instrumental
You couldn't feel the sunlight upon your face
Your little world, a little out of place
You couldn't hear the ocean, you couldn't hear the waves
I know you meant to come back, I know you meant to stay
An' all you touch
An' all you knew
An' all you love, yeah
Oh, I could see you smile, can you see my tears?
I reach to hold you but you ain't there
You left a hole so big, Lord, beyond repair
I try to find forgiveness, in takin' what we'll never share
An' all you touch
An' all you knew
An' all you love 
You just left 'em with nothing to say
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-ohh
You're just throwin' it all away
Oh-oh, no you didn't care to see the light of day
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-ohh
You're just throwin' it all away
Like the sand upon the shore
Your crashing waves came, took you away
An' all you touch
An' all you knew
An' all you love 
You just left 'em with nothing to say
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-ohh
You're just throwin' it all away
Oh-oh, no you didn't care to see the light of day
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-ohh
You're just throwin' it all away
Like the sand upon the shore
Your crashing waves came, took you away
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-ohh
You're just throwin' it all away
Oh-oh, no you didn't care, child, to see the light of day
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-ohh
You're just throwin' it all away
Like the sand upon the shore
Your crashing waves came, took you away
Call me up, and that's all I need,
Bring your loving, smiling, face over.
I feel like, getting it right,
Overnight, start over,
I thought playing that loving game would never be simple again
But you're staying overnight,
So maybe I'm doing something right.
You can feel it in the trees
I feel it by degrees
Feel it fresh and new
I'm getting myself in love with you
The sun will rise up, and you'll be in Freedom
So much freer than you were before
It's in the seed now
It's in the season
I'm so excited its knocking down your door.
And they say, it's such a funny story,
After a winter, of getting dull and blue like a tory
And getting all feared up,
As their up on their ties, lies, incites the tears to your eyes.
And the job will know I'm insane
To go running from love again
Into a lovers arms
Like a burgular running out on an alarm
It's a fucking swarm of bees
Or some waitress, it's a tease
Or some song that's full of lies
Coming round to you late at night.
The sun will rise up, and you'll be in Freedom
So much freer than you were before
It's in the seed now
It's in the season
I'm so excited its knocking down your door.
The sun will rise up, and I will wise up
So much freer than we were before
It's in your CD, its fucking teaming
Saw it around you taking you on a tour
And now now! Call the fuzz, it's such a buzz,
From the start
You press the memory, you press the memory to your heart
What you waiting for?
Fall in love is an idea for sure
What you waiting for?
Like there was any law
It's like a sonnet, she's so on it
From the start
You press the memory, you press the memory to your heart
What you waiting for?
Fall in love is an idea for sure
What you waiting for?
Like there was any law
From the start
You press the memory, you press the memory to your heart
What you waiting for?
Fall in love is an idea for sure
What you waiting for?
Like there was any law
It's like a sonnet, she's so on it
From the start
You press the memory, you press the memory to your heart
What you waiting for?
Fall in love is an idea for sure
What you waiting for?
Like there was any law
The sun will rise up, and you'll be in Freedom
So much freer than you were before
It's in the seed now
It's in the season
I'm so excited its knocking down your door.
You'll bring that blessing
We'll sing the rest in
Freedom, to prisoner, to freedom.
Good night
Baby
Sleep tight
Here with me
We can lay in the bed
You and me
And I won't go away
Or leave you alone
Sweetie pie
Baby
Sleep tight
Here with me
And in the morning
We'll open our eyes
And look at each other
And sunny skies
And when you think
Of getting high
I'll think of nice things
To make you smile
'Cause when you drink
It makes me cry
And when you get high
This house is cold and empty
Just a ghost of who I used to be
I stare at my own reflection
Wonder if you'd even recognize me
Last night I heard you whisper
"Everything is fine, I am here, I am here"
Last night I saw your shadow
But when I called your name you disappeared
Who's gonna say goodnight?
Who's gonna stop the word from turning?
Who's gonna numb my pain?
Who's gonna save me when the sky is crashing down?
I am broken
You don't have to cry yourself to sleep at night with wet pillows
Girl, I know you're hurt
Did you know that you can dry your pillows with your dreams and smile
It really works
Lay your head back in my arms, oh, I know your worth
So just reach inside your heart and pack your bags
And let's leave this earth
Let's aim high, oh girl
All you gotta do is close your eyes and - and visualize
Let's aim high
You work so hard for your boss, to him it's just work
Never considers your dreams, selfish and mean
Damn, that's gotta hurt
Just lay your head back in my arms, girl
I know you're worth
So allow me indulge your mind with these words
Open your eyes, you're now a bird
Let's aim high, girl
All you gotta do is close your eyes and - and visualize
You possess the power to do
If you concentrate, mountains will move
If you just believe that it's true
Please make no mistake I'll be there too
You possess the power to do
If you concentrate, mountains will move
If you just believe that it's true
Make no mistake I'll be there too
Let's aim high
Le mal blanc sur ma main noire
Et le rire jaune sur tes lèvres roses
Tu verses le sang sur mes vers blancs (non-pluricellulaires)
Et n'y voir que du bleu
Et pour tuer le ver tu bois l'armée rouge
My room has a big white bed
Pictures on the mirrors
Books that last a year
Everything but sleep
Don't you know
Nothing won't fit under there
The Dowmaker's ghost
A heavenly host
Everything but sleep
Don't you know
Everything but sleep
Where does it go
Everything but sleep
On it goes
If it weren't for you
I could be anywhere
I'd rather be here
Don't you know
Now that I know I'll never feel the same way
Everything but sleep
Don't you know
Everything but sleep
On it goes
On it goes
Il pleut, il pleut
Je pleure, je pleure,
Il pleut, il pleut
Je pleure, je pleure
J'ai peur que je vais roullier ce soir
Il pleut, il pleut,
Je pleure, je pleure
Il pleut, il pleut,
Je pleure, je pleure
J'ai peur que mon temps soit expiré,
J'espère que vous viendrez me sécher
J'espère que vous pouvez me réparer
J'ai peur que je vais roullier ce soir
Mon cœur
changera de l'acier à la poussière
Instrumental
Here I go again
Dreaming
Here I go again
(Can't do a thing to stop me now)
(Can't do a thing to stop me now)
Having a good time, baby
Wish you were here
Thinking about you, baby
It feels like you're near
And you can't do a thing to stop me
(Can't do a thing to stop me now)
No, you can't do a thing to stop me
(Can't do a thing to stop me now)
Days can be lonely
Nights dreams come true
Making love with somebody
Exactly like you
And you can't do a thing to stop me
(Can't do a thing to stop me now)
No, you can't do a thing to stop me
(Can't do a thing to stop me now)
Oh, try
(Can't do a thing to stop me now)
Can't do a thing to stop me
(Can't do a thing to stop me now) Oho
(Can't do a thing to stop me)
Couldn't stop myself if I tried
Because I got you too deep inside
You can't do a thing to stop me
(Can't do a thing to stop me now)
No, you can't do a thing to stop me
(Can't do a thing to stop me now)
Try
(Can't do a thing to stop me now)
(Can't do a thing to stop me) Dream, baby
(Can't do a thing to stop me now)
(Can't do a thing to stop me) Dream
(Can't do a thing to stop me now) Dreaming
(Can't do a thing to stop me) Dreaming
(Can't do a thing to stop me now)
(Can't do a thing to stop me) Dreaming
(Can't do a thing to stop me now)
(Can't do a thing to stop me) Dreaming
I'll make you mine.
I'll make you mine if you would have me.
With a silver ring that will hug you tight,
Our life begins.
Our life begins with this.
I'll prove my love.
I'll prove my love if you would let me.
Over and over and over again.
We'll bring a child.
We'll bring a child into this world
We'll say the one thing
Everyone should hear:
You were meant for amazing things.
Give me your hand.
Give me your hand, it's time.
It's time to show new eyes their home.
Oh, When fences divide,
Fences divide our land,
I would catch bullets with my bare hands.
'Cause you were meant for,
You were meant for,
You were meant for amazing things.
Over and over, you wanted it so fast
Head on my shoulder, I'll pour myself a glass
Wait 'til we're somewhere closer to a lake
Then make a sad face and tell me it's too late
Right now and right here
My love oh my dear
I'll try to be clear
My love oh my dear
Over and over, you wanted me play
Head on my shoulder, there's nothing left to say
Wait 'til we're somewhere closer to the sea
Then we can jump and pretend we disagree
Right now and right here
My love oh my dear
I'll try to be clear
Over and over, we're turning off the light
Even the warriors are always great at night
Wait 'til we're somewhere closer to the moon
Then you can kiss me and say that it's too soon
Right now and right here
My love oh my dear...
Faces under water
Look much closer when they appear
Your hand on my shoulder
We'll be older in a year
In the morning after
Should I laugh or disappear?
If all the world could take a moment
To cradle back into slow motion 'cause it's all moving too fast
You had your shot you took your chances
All through you'd battle for the answers you were brave till the very last
Just like a wave on the ocean
There's forces that run so deep
I'm falling into the temptation
To let it wash all over me
Come and wash me clea-ea ea- ea- ean
Come and wash me clean a nervous step into the future
While the present shatters all around you
It's all moving too fast
And now the footprints of your failures
Seep into the safety of the harbour
Leave it all in a dark past
Just like a wave on the ocean
There's forces that run so deep
I'm falling into the temptation
To let it wash all over me
Come and wash me clea-ea ea- ea- ean
Come and wash me clean
Come and wash me clean
It's all here
Today is the only day
The old times make way for the new
Some fruit punch
Spills on a tablecloth
But there ain't no mess to clean up
Garbage in a can sticks together
The tiniest of things are forever
Drop a couple coins and a feather
And watch them float away at the same time
Song is made with sugar and lemonade
Sing on the porch, swing along
Me and you having a barbecue
Sticking our thumbs in the air
Meeting of some notes on a pocket
Sitting in the sun with some chocolate
Drop a couple pens and some pencils
And watch it all fall right into place
When I fall in love
It will be forever
Or I'll never fall
In love
In a restless world like this is
Love is ended before it's begun
And too many moonlight kisses
Seem to cool in the warmth of the sun
When I give my heart
It will be completely
Or I'll never give
My heart
And the moment I can feel that
You feel that way too
Is when I fall in love with you
And the moment I can feel that
You feel that way too
Is when I fall in love with you
At last, my love has come along
My lonely days are over, and life is like a song
At last, the skies above are blue
My heart was wrapped in clover
The night I looked at you
I found a dream that I could speak to
A dream that I could call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill I'd never known
You smiled, and then the spell was cast
And here we are in Heaven, for you are mine at last.
I found a dream that I could speak to,
A dream that I could call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill that I had never known
You smiled, and then the spell was cast
And here we are in Heaven
For you are mine at last.
More panic than intent
More luck than good judgment
They're raising your body from the ground
The dreamer has woken
The spirit has spoken
They're raising your body from the ground
What you gonna do
When the rain comes
Through on your pretty head
Is it so easy to pretend
Like vision of Goya
The silent destroyer
They're raising your body from the ground
What you gonna do
When it all comes
Through on your weary head
Is it so easy to pretend
You want it, you need it
Break your back to feed it
They're raising your body from the ground
Ela entrou e eu estava ali
Ou será que fui eu que ali entrei
Sem sequer pedir
A menor licença?
Ela de batom caqui
Com os olhos olhava o que? Eu não sei 
Olhos de águas vindas
De outros oceanos
Ela me olhou - Quem?
Quem sabe com ela eu teria as tardes
Que sempre me passaram
Como imagens, como invenção! 
Se eu não posso ter
Fico imaginando
Virá com ela que entrega
Virá, sim, assim virá que eu vi
Virá ou ela me espera 
Virá, pois ela estava ali
Ela  amou o que estava ali
Ou será que foi dela o que eu já amei
Como os laços fixam 
Uma residência? 
Ela: Alô!? E eu não reagi
Com os olhos olhava o que eu lembrei
Quando andava indo 
Em outra direção
Ela me olhou - Vem!
Quem sabe com ela 
Eu veria as tardes
Que sempre me faltaram 
Como miragens, como ilusão!
Se eu não posso ver 
Fico imaginando 
Virá com ela que entrega
Virá, sim, assim virá que eu vi
Virá ou ela me espera 
Virá, pois ela estava ali
Ela andou e eu fiquei ali 
Ou será que fui eu que dali mudei 
Com uns passos mudos
De uma reticência? 
Ela me olhou bem
Quem sabe com ela eu teria achado
O que sempre me faltava
Cores, colagens, sons, emoção!
Se eu não posso ser 
Fico imaginando
Virá com ela que entrega 
Virá, sim, assim virá que eu vi
Virá ou ela me espera
Virá, pois ela estava ali
He made his way to the border
In the shadow, under the trees
Down by a stream, in a hollow
Turn your head, feel the breeze
And the Red Queen was waiting for the news
For the White King to move
And the balance hung upon the head of one who tried
To stay within the shadows
And keep his undercover secret tight
They let him in by a backway
Into a chamber reserved for the Queen
She took the note that he gave her
Opened it slowly and started to read
Run to the treasury and bring me back some gold
Give it to the pawn who came, she cried
He says the White King thinks the game of chess is wrong
And all the courtiers crowded her
And this is what she told the gathered round
Go to the store by the dungeon
Take all the red paint, take all the white
Make up a newborn colour
Cover your neighbor, we'll be all right
There will be no game today, she cried across the board
Every day will be a holiday
And all the pieces cheered as tidings spread abroad
And the Pink Queen sat
And smiled at the cat, who smiled back
You chase in the rat-race
And you always feel so hollow
You marry because it's expected of you
And it only makes you feel more lonely
But still you look down on the teenage dad on
On his estate
He's happy so leave him alone
With his baby
And his modest home
He's happy so leave him alone
With his Jensen Interceptor
It's just a runaround
You defer to the views of the television news
Let someone do your thinking for you
And you still buy a daily newspaper
And you find everything there but the news
And still you look down on the teenage dad on
On his estate
He's happy so leave him alone
With his baby
And his modest home
He's happy so leave him alone
With his Jensen Interceptor
It's just a runaround
You become your parents' parent
And you love them
But you can't help feeling used
And you hate the teenage dad on his estate
Because he's poor but he's happier than you
They're all laughing at you
You're a dipper, a slider, cart-horse provider
Nobody cares about you
Just as long as you're out there bringing it in
Despising the grin on the face of the boy
With the methadone
With his methadone
He's happy so leave him alone
With his methadone
He's happy so leave him alone
I know you've read, so many books
You keep abreast of all the things you think you should
You've got your own homegrown philosophy
It works for you but please 
Don't try to make it work for me
 
You have nothing to prove
But you're trying much too hard
Stop trying to change me
(Stop trying to change me)
I am what I am
(I am what I am)
No I don't need you to save me
(I don't need you to save me)
I am what I am
(I am what I am)
I don't want you to show me
(I don't need you to show me)
Because I stand where I stand
(I stand where I stand)
I just need you to know me
(I just need you to know me)
Just know who I am
(Just know who I am)
Just know who I am
Just know who I am
I know you feel, you need to prove 
That you are good at simply everything you try to do
And people hang, on your every word
That you deliver, with conviction
Though they may just be absurd
Leave your armour behind
Free your vulnerable mind
 
Stop trying to change me
(Stop trying to change me)
I am what I am
(I am what I am)
No I don't need you to save me
(I don't need you to save me)
I am what I am
(I am what I am)
I don't want you to show me
(I don't need you to show me)
Because I stand where I stand
(I stand where I stand)
I just need you to know me
(I just need you to know me)
Just know who I am
(Just know who I am)
 
Just know who I am
Just know who I am
We are lost in the folds of one another's topcoats
And medicine makes us move inside a little slower
And in those hours nobody knows our ends or beginnings
The way I've come to ignore we keep colliding faces
Until we're strangers again
Are we strangers again
Of our German engineering
I confess I've overdressed the mess I've made of my life
But isn't is so unlike us, come now
Frankly, Jeremy
Until we're strangers again
Are we strangers again
Of our German engineering
Hell bent stomachs planning greater insurrection
Strange speech dirty human elements to question
The broken car parts in enemy desires
Until we're strangers again
Are we strangers again
Of our German engineering
Are we strangers again
Are we strangers again
Of our German engineering
Distance... of... the barrel
The joining... of... the tin man
Drinking... the man... in the box
Toiling... don't go... with conspiracy
Na Nah Na Na Na Naah,
Na Nah Na Na Na Naah, na na na x3
Woooooh
Go... up the top floor
Waiting... waiting to be comforted
Na Nah Na Na Na Naah, na na na x6
When other people say you're someone to misuse 
Shut in behind your young girl's face 
And helpless in your bed of thorns 
I'll remember who you are 
Yes, I'll remember who you are 
I'll remember who you are
A young girl, unchained 
Come back here now 
I know you're somewhere still alive 
Strong behind your young girl's tears 
I know you're somewhere, unchanged
Oh, I remember who you are
Yes, I remember who you are 
I remember who you are
A young girl, unchained 
There stands a young girl, naked 
In her innocence unused 
And she holds me in her small hand 
And she smiles down on me 
I am innocent in her dark eyes 
I will lose my heart in the sand 
You're cruel, but you're good for me 
And you hold me in your young girl's hand 
I remember who you are 
Yes, I remember who you are 
I remember who you are 
A young girl, unchained
"Follow your heart", he said. 
Your heart will take you there. 
"Swallow your pride", he said. 
For pride is anything but rare. 
So I walked into your eyes without a raincoat on 
And in the salty sea, I find you're all but gone. 
Take my hand, you're treading water 
I feel I am slipping away from underneath my toes 
Nobody knows 
Where is it she goes? 
Looked in the bathroom stall 
Your back against the wall. 
Cold tiles beneath your knees, 
Your body broke your fall. 
Spitting into your own reflection gazing back 
Inside your porcelain fists, your palms begin to crack. 
So take my hand your treading water 
And I feel sand slipping underneath my toes 
Nobody knows 
Where is it she goes? 
When those sad eyes start to close 
Nobody knows 
Where is it she goes? 
When those sad eyes close
If I could bottle up the sea breeze I would take it over to your house
And pour it loose through your garden
So the hinges on your windows would rust and colour
Like the boats pulled up on the sand for the summer
And your sweet clean clothes would go stiff on the line
And there'd be sand in your pockets and nothing on your mind
But every year it gets a little bit harder
To get back to the feeling of when we were fifteen
And we could jump in the river upstream
And let the current carry us to the beginning where
The river met the sea again
And all our days were a sun-drenched haze
While the salt spray crusted on the window panes
We should be living like we lived that summer
I wanna live like we live in the summer
And I'll remember that summer as the right one
The storms made the pavement steam like a kettle
And our first goodbye always seemed like hours
In the car park in between my house and yours
And if the summer holds a song we might sing forever
Then the winter holds a bite we'd never felt before
But time is like the ocean
You can only hold a little in your hands
So swim before we're broken
Before our bones become
Black coral on the sand
Mr. Nothing's got a lot
He's got a lot to say
He's good at being what he's not
Gives nothing away
Another day goes on by
And he never speaks his heart
He takes his chance with what he's got
It's too late now to stop
You push and you pull and struggle with the knot
It's tying you up while you're fadin'
You give and you take and take what you got
'Round and 'round till it breaks and
You push and you pull and struggle with the knot
It's tying you up while you're fadin' into your lie
Mr. Nothing is late
He's running out of time
He questions whether chance or fate will ever show a sign
Looks to the sky above
For a glimpse of what it means
And now or never, never made
Made more sense to him
You push and you pull and struggle with the knot
It's tying you up while you're fadin'
You give and you take and take what you got
'Round and 'round till it breaks and
You push and you pull and struggle with the knot
It's tying you up while you're fadin' into your lie
You push and you pull it
Waiting for the big fall
To take us all
Quiet nights and desperate love
We need it all
Spring came, rain fell
We ended up nowhere
Then June came, sun shone
Are we still nowhere?
Someone come and take me away
No need to stay
When life itself is making you old
Just take my soul
Spring came, rain fell
We ended up nowhere
Then June came, sun shone
Are we still nowhere?
If you want me now
You don't have to try so hard
If you want me now
You don't have to try at all
Spring came, rain fell
We ended up nowhere
Then June came, sun shone
Are we still nowhere?
There you go and baby, here am I.
Well, you left me here so I could sit and cry.
GOLLY gee, what have you done to me?
BUT I guess it doesn't matter any more
Do you remember baby, last September
How you held me tight, each and every night
Oh baby, how you drove me crazy
WELL I guess it doesn't matter any more
There AIN'T no use in me a-cryin'.
'CAUSE I've done everything and I'm sick of tryin'.
I've thrown away my nights,
Wasted all my days over you
Now you go your way, BABY, and I'll go mine
Now and forever till the end of time
AND I'll find somebody new and baby, we'll say we're through
And you won't matter anymore
There AIN'T no use in me a-cryin'.
'CAUSE I've done everything and now I'm sick of tryin'.
I've thrown away my nights,
Wasted all my days over you
Now you go your way, BABY, and I'll go mine
Now and forever till the end of time
AND I'll find somebody new and baby, we'll say we're through
You won't matter anymore
You won't matter anymore
You won't matter anymore.
And you won't matter anymore
Prestame tu piel
Tu munjdo sin vecinos
El mundo esta perdido amor
Dejame saber
La vida no explica el por que
No le importa is tan frio
Just to let you know
This is wrong
And I can't go on
Cubre tus llamas
Ya tus rosas de sangre hermosa
La eternidad quema
Eyes that look away in pain
Will never see the shame
Lies that cover up the sound
Have never screamed so loud
Tu cuerpo es una parte
Tan sierto es tu escape
Tu mente lla no sabe a donde ir
Y por que tan obscuro que te vistes
Complejos que resisten
Just to let this go
This is wrong and I can't go on
Cubre tus llamas
Ya tus rosas de sangre hermosa
La eternidad quema
Eyes that look away in pain
Will never see the shame
Lies that cover up the sound
Have never screamed so loud
Don't you just pity me
Light that has given way
When I see her face
And I can't stop this rain
As everything falls on me
Would you just sit here with me
This is the day to pay for all her pain
Eyes that look away in pain
Will never see the shame
Lies that cover up the sound
Have never screamed so loud
The lights that come in and out of my life,
I'll write I'll rerecord these times,
The grail and the meadow 
The excess disease
Some passing of family, frustration released
You have a home here
You have a place to hide
You're always welcome
And you're more than I can say
The night you showed me I could see,
I praised the Lord for drunken honesty,
A master of patience to put up with me
Some surrogate brother I wanted to be
You have a home here
You have a place to hide
You're always welcome
All this I know
You're more than I can show
May your days be golden
May it always surround you
Ain't it funny how we pretend we're still a child?
Softly stolen under blanket skies
And rescue me from me and all that I believe
I won't deny the pain
I won't deny the change
And should I fall from grace here with you
Will you leave me too?
Carve out your heart for keeps in an old oak tree
And hold me for goodbyes and whispered lullabyes
And tell me I am still the man I'm supposed to be
I won't deny the pain
I won't deny the change
And should I fall from grace here with you
Will you leave me too?
Will you leave me too?
Too late to turn back now, I'm running out of sound
And I am changing, changing
And if we died right now
This fool you love somehow is here with you
I won't deny the pain
I won't deny the change
And should I fall from grace here with you
Would you leave me too?
Would you leave me too?
This is a movement made [of] the youth, 
The young people of the day saying, 
'Guess what, mister? I've got no voice, no future, no leadership.'
This is what this is about, 
And if we don't take it serious, 
D'you know where it's gonna escalate?
This is the youths actually saying to themself, 
'Guess what? These people can get away with that. 
Then why can't we tell people how we feel?'
Look at what you're seeing today, 
You're not seeing it in one area, 
You're seeing it right over London.
I had to leave for certain
I like to come back now and then
Maybe I'm just returning
So I can leave again
The wind comes softly blowing
From the cold grey sea
She leans into my collar
Starts whispering to me
Go, love, if you're going
You keep looking down the track
Go, love, if you're going
I'll be here when you come back
Go, love, if you're going
Go, love, if you're going
So go, love, if you're going
Don't stay on account of me
Go, love, if you're going
If that's the way it's got to be
Go, love, if you're going
You keep looking down the track
Go, love, if you're going
I'll be here when you come back
Go, love, if you're going
Go, love, if you're going
The moon is a magnet
Everyone's at it
Everyone's had it
Love is a sadness
Love is a madness
We are the addicts
What are we if we're not in love?
What are we if we're not in love?
These are the cages
A kiss is contagious
It'll betray us all
A kiss'll betray us all
Somebody told me
That everyone's phony
Till somebody's lonely
I hope that you're lonely
I hope that you're only
Waiting to phone me
What are we if we're not alone?
What are we if we're not alone?
These are the cages
A kiss is contagious
It'll betray us all
A kiss'll betray us all
The moon is a magnet
Everyone's at it
Everyone's had it
The time is right, to begin
Let's get goin' once again
For once in your life just let go
I'm getting sick of everything
Tired of what the next day brings
What I need is for you to follow my lead
The sun is shining bright outside
I think I'll go for a ride 
I plan not to ever return
Lets run away from here for good
Forget this dusty neighborhood
The open road is calling and begging for us
Go roll down the window 
Go crank up that radio
Lets drive until we hit the sky
It's not about where we go
Let's start living life
Before we die
Before we die
If you want you can stay
But you'll regret the day
That you didn't follow your dreams
Imagine the wind in your hair
Blowing away all of your cares
So take my hand lets plan never to look back.
The sun is shining bright outside
I think I'll go for a ride 
I plan not to ever return
Let's run away from here for good 
Forget this dusty neighborhood
The open road is calling and begging for us
Go roll down the window 
Go crank up that radio
Lets drive until we hit the sky
It's not about where we go
Let's start living life 
Before we die
True, it's all in my dreams
Yeah 
You are all in my dreams
Yeah
What I need is a long holiday
What I need is a long holiday
What I need is a long holiday
What I need is to get away
From here for good tonight
Lets fly away tonight
On this bright spring morning
Send our spirits soaring
Now is the time
Go roll down the window 
Go crank up that radio
Lets drive until we hit the sky
It's not about where we go
Lets start living life before we die
All the time of finding ways to make things fall in line
I know how tricky things can be.
But I really do believe that
You are mine, and our stars are there before us.
Listen here, some things are meant to be.
Tried to take it slow
Tried to lose control
But I'll tell you what the trick is:
What you get is what you had to give away.
When I learned I found my eyes were open
Long ago I had a dream that quickly faded
Goes to show how tricky things can be
But wouldn't you agree that
Those who know whisper when they see us walking
"There's a love that's always meant to be."
This is how it always starts, all order falls apart
Okay, so who put this key in the mix?
Things were stable yesterday but now they're blown away
Oh shit, I can't let them see me like this
Nothing sweet, nothing nice, nothing kiss, only fights
Nothing clear, nothing bright, nothing I'll feel tonight
Nothing great, nothing good, nothing is as it should
Nothing rad, nothing right, nothing I'll feel tonight
This is how it always starts, dumb choices from the heart
Oh shit, I can't let them see me like this
Nothing sweet, nothing nice, nothing kiss, only fights
Nothing clear, nothing bright, nothing I'll feel tonight
Nothing great, nothing good, nothing is as it should
Nothing rad, nothing right, nothing I'll feel tonight
Young alumni
Dance the night to pieces
Wearing all your panic inside out
And then to have someone like you
Like you
Made of broken glass and famous haircuts
We see your heartbeat in a cup of tea
The morning scratched with static loud
We've worn our hesitations out
We're made of destinations now
But love is no big deal
It's falling you feel
Young alumni
Modern cocktail drinkers
Strappy shoes don't match the Thursday drunks
Phones will come alive
'Cause they are tired of being tied inside the night
And now the future's wired
But love is no big deal
The falling you feel
Love is no big deal
The falling you feel
You called me up this evening
Cause you wanted to know what's going on
You give me ultimatums
Cause you don't want to feel you are alone
And I tell you that some folks don't evolve
They're content with what they've got
They just sit back and they watch TV
I talked about September.
Fought about your taste you were on mine
What did you mean anyhow
When you said I'm lost, but there's still time
And I tell you that some folks don't evolve
They're content with what they've got
They just sit back and they watch TV
And I tell you that some folks don't evolve
They're content with what they've got
They just sit back and they watch TV
But that's not me.
One day, you come around to see the other side of things.
One day, you come around to see the other side of things
Yes you will.
You'll come around to see the other side of things
You'll come around to see the other side of things.
He said that it felt good to be alive.
He never did amount to much. He Never did try hard enough.
This time I won't be caught off guard, just like all of the times before.
It doesn't mean that much to me.
Loving never meant that much to me.
I never said that it felt good to know everything that you needed to know.
I guess you never really tried.
I would sure love believing,
In something that's never leaving,
Would like to let go the hurting,
When every things so uncertain.
You know I tried,
To show you what I have inside,
Will we laugh at how this all began,
When you're an old woman and I'm an old man.
Take me wherever you go,
Help me forget tomorrow,
Love me your best and I know,
All of the rest will follow,
Love me as well as you know,
And everything else will follow.
I wouldn't mind pretending,
It's something that's never-ending,
Would like to believe that someday,
We won't be living this way.
I know you tried,
To show me you were on my side,
Could it be that I've already found,
The thing that I've been searching,
The whole world round.
Take me wherever you go,
Help me forget tomorrow,
Love me your best and I know,
All of the rest will follow,
Love me your best and I know,
Everything else will follow.
Take me wherever you go,
Everything else will follow,
Help me forget tomorrow,
All of the rest will follow,
Love me as well as you know.
I don't think I let you down,
I see the doubt in your eyes,
I take you out by surprise,
There is no doubt in your eyes,
All you know,
Is what you see?
And what you do,
You do to me,
And all you say is over the edge,
And all you want in your eyes,
I feel the blood rush through my veins,
The love I stole from your lips,
I feel, I feel, I feel, I I I feel...
I know I know you speak in different tongues
But I don't care, I long for more,
I hear a difference in your voice,
But I don't mind,
From time to time
I see the doubt in your eyes,
I know I know you won't be mine,
And all I want is all you need
And all you need is what you see
All you want is what you hear
You never guess,
Guess for me
All I need is what you give
You won't be sad,
If you let it go.
Far out at sea
Bathed in breeze
Now only ghosts
We haunt living dreams
Out on the coast
The coast is the most
That we'll ever see
Out on the coast
We'll sit and boast
That "it's all we need"
Wade through the sand
And find the romance
That we know we need
Boys of Melody
And they'll follow me
And I'll sing harmony
And with our song
Marching along
Few feign a frown
Or forget their towns
We proceed in stained bed sheets
And hang on our sleeves
That "we're happy"
Sung with a chorus of tones
Backed by drums and drones
We march towards the sea
As we reach the edge
I sing a new lament
"The boys are here with me"
Boys of melody
And they'll follow me
And I'll sing harmony
And "it's all we need"
"The boys are here with me"
"We're happy"
Similar not the same
You will allow a low light
Will the sunlight heal the core of your body
And the sound I hold so dear
Who wouldn't sing for love
And who wouldn't do all of that
Looks like I've been the sole nobody
And now I couldn't follow this
I believe
I believe now
See you a lot near the site
And to you I throw a low light
And the sight of you is so in my body
And the sight I hold so dear
Who wouldn't sing for me now
And who wouldn't have done all of that
Looks like I've been a friend to nobody
And now I couldn't lead you home
I believe
I believe now
I believe
I believe now
And the sight of you is so in my body
And the sight I hold so dear
Looks like I've been a friend to nobody
And now I couldn't lead you home
I believe
I believe now
I believe
I believe now
The sunlight heal the core of your body
And the sound I hold so dear
I believe
I believe now
I believe
I believe now ...
How does the motion make me last
I shuffle forward and then back
I can be questioning my thoughts
But not looking for what I lack
What is it that has my mind so hypnotized
When shapes are for looking at
And their colors create my mood
I'm a vessel between two places I've never been
To seek a further or former design
Creation as a pathogen
What's more than subtle in these lines
I know you're looking forward to them
What is it that has my mind so hypnotized
Evolving on a thought that you've half realized
Life is real only when I am (well, I am) - I am surprised
That shapes are for looking at
And their colors create my mood
I'm a vessel between two places I've never been
My dress is torn, you have a black eye
You got from a giving kind
But your coat is big and I am warm
I'll ask if I can walk you home
Grey like the gravel under our shoes
The sky doesn't clarify
Simple is something of a mystery
No longer making sense to me
Got a gun and an eagles eye
But would like somewhere safe to hide
You've a reason and so have I, it's true
I'm gonna rescue you
So you can rescue me too
Make it a rendezvous
I got my best dress on
And you've a smile and a bruise
So come and rescue me,
And me you
I am the heat in an empty room
The cold coming through the walls
Your sofas' old, but I am new
And there is better on the brew
My breath is soft, your hands are unlocked
Un-manned and un-vertical
I feel strings without the black 'n' blues
A weekend in a weekdays shoes
Got a gun and an eagles eye
But would like somewhere safe to hide
You've a reason and so have I, it's true
I'm gonna rescue you
So you can rescue me too
Make it a rendezvous
I got my best dress on
And you've a smile and a bruise
So come and rescue me
And me you
Yeah, the summer count can come
Brings you sounds you thought were gone
And you can try to search around
And you can try to cut it down
I found it all but I lost my soul
Everything you hold can come
The words, they seem to roll as one
And you can try to search around
And you can try to cut it down
You never really knew for sure
That breeze can come before you fall
I found it all but I lost my soul
I found it all but I lost my soul
I found it all but I lost my soul
I found it all but I lost my soul
I found it all but I lost my soul
I found it all but I lost my soul
Your hand's upon a dead man's gun
And you're lookin' down the sights
Your heart is worn and the seams are torn
And they've given you a reason to fight
And you're not gonna take what they've got to give
And you're not gonna let 'em take your will to live
Because they've taken enough and you've given them all you can give
And luck won't save them tonight
They've given you a reason to fight
And all the storms you've been chasin'
About to rain down tonight
And all the pain you've been facin'
About to come into the light
Your hand's upon a dead man's gun
And you're lookin' down the sights
Your heart is worn and the seams are torn
And they've given you a reason to fight
And you're not gonna take what they've got to give
And you're not gonna let 'em take your will to live
Because they've taken enough and you've given them all you can give
And luck won't save them tonight
They've given you a reason to fight
And all the storms you've been chasin'
About to rain down tonight
And all the pain you've been facin'
About to come into the light
There is a house built out of stone
Wooden floors, walls and window sills
Tables and chairs worn by all of the dust
This is a place where I don't feel alone
This is a place where I feel at home
And I built a home
For you
For me
Until it disappeared
From me
From you
And now, it's time
To leave and turn to dust
Out in the garden where we planted the seeds
There is a tree as old as me
Branches were sewn by the color of green
Ground had arose and passed its knees
By the cracks of the skin I climbed to the top
I climbed the tree to see the world
When the gusts came around to blow me down
Held on as tightly as you held onto me
Held on as tightly as you held onto me
And I built a home
For you
For me
Until it disappeared
From me
From you
And now, it's time
To leave and turn to dust
Take me back to the home
Once I knew it's getting born
I've been in the world
With no air to sing
Still I could hear
Your voice calling in
Takes too long
To forget you
If I know you'll never stay
Too long
To forget you
I'm still waiting for a chance
All I see is your face
Same great heart, still away
I want you to know
I was so young then
Don't wanna feel
On my own again
Takes too long
To forget you
If I know you'll never stay
Too long
To forget you
I'm still waiting for a chance
No mountain can see
But sometimes a mountain can sing
Or hum at least I have heard one
Humming on the evening we ...
And no horizon can sleep
But sometimes horizons can close their eyes
And drift into one moment somewhere
Halfway between
The distance and a dream
And all my senses' honesty
And all my senses' honesty they belong to you
Alone I stand alone I fall
There is no option anymore
Alone with you
And though my point of view seems sad
I believe it's not so bad
Alone with you
And all my senses' honesty
And all my senses' honesty they belong to you
Alone I stand alone I fall
There is no option anymore
Alone with you
And though my point of view seems sad
I believe it's not so bad
Alone with you
Alone I stand alone I fall
There is no option anymore
Alone with you
And though my point of view seems sad
I believe it's not so bad
Alone with you
Pulled from the liquor cabinet
Choose your mood and then start to wreak havoc
With your exaggerated sadness
The sadness that ensues
This is when I start to lose
Interrupted by flickering candles
The darkness that softened the angles
Though I am the reason
I am the reason
That I'm filling in the empty spaces
Where you left your mark
Take two steps back from all of this
Remember what you started with
It was nothing at all
Back in Queens,
Where the stifling heat overpowers the air conditioning
You can keep on crawling away
But you're never gonna escape
No, no, not today
I'm filling in the empty spaces
Where you left your mark
In the soothing peace of car alarms and cats in heat
I can hear you breathe
Ba-ba-da-da-da
Keep on telling me that time is no enemy
A worthless struggle to step back
And reconceive
Clara como a luz do sol
Clareira luminosa nessa escuridão
Bela como a luz da lua
Estrela do oriente nesses mares do sul
Clareira azul no céu
Na paisagem
Será magia, miragem, milagre
Será mistério
Prateando horizontes
Brilham rios, fontes
Numa cascata de luz
No espelho dessas águas
Vejo a face luminosa do amor
As ondas vão e vem
E vão e são como o tempo
Luz do divinal querer 
Seria uma sereia
Ou seria só
Delírio tropical, fantasia
Ou será um sonho de criança 
Sob o sol da manhã
Well I come from Alabama with my banjo on my knee
And I'm bound for Louisiana, my own true love for to see
It did rain all night the day I left
The weather was bone dry
The sun was so hot I froze myself
Susanne, don't you go on and cry
I said, Oh, Susannah
Now, don't you cry for me
As I come from Alabama with this banjo on my knee
Well I had myself a dream the other night
When everything was still
I dreamed that I saw my girl Susanne
She was coming around the hill
Now, the buckwheat cake was in her mouth
A tear was in her eye
I said, that I come from Dixie land
Susanne, don't you break down and cry
I said, Oh, Susannah
Now, don't you cry for me
'Cause I come from Alabama with my banjo on my knee
I could see,
I could see your heart, through your eyes
On that night from the balcony
How could we ever
Make this leap?
You and I,
Caught up in wind like we were parachutes
Oh how we'd fly until we hit the ground
How could we ever
Make this leap?
We were young,
I used my paper telescope,
To show you the stars and then win your heart
How could we ever
Make believe?
I can see, I can see, I can see a sunrise
Call me out from the dark, 'cause I'm broken inside
I can see, I can see, I can see a sunrise
Call me out from the dark, 'cause I'm broken inside
Up above the static
Up above the racket
I hear your voice calling me out of the darkness
Up above the static
Up above the racket
I hear your voice calling me out of the darkness
Caught up like parachutes, Caught up like parachutes
Oh how we'd fly
Caught up like parachutes, Caught up like parachutes
Oh how we'd fly!
You called me out from the dark, and brought me into the light,
You called me out from the dark, and brought me into the light,
You called me out from the dark, and brought me into the light,
You called me out from the dark, and brought me into the light.

I am an outlaw, I was born an outlaw's son
The highway is my legacy
On the highway I will run
In one hand I've a Bible
In the other I've got a gun
Well, don' you know me
I'm the man who won
Woman don't try to love me
Don't try to understand
A life upon the road is the life of an outlaw man
First left my woman, it was down in Santa Fe
Headed for Oklahoma, I was ridin' night and day
All of my friends are strangers
They quickly come and go
And all my love's in danger
'Cause I steal hearts and souls
Woman, don't try to love me
Don't try to understand A life upon the road is the life of an outlaw man
Ooh...
Woman, don't try to love me
Don't try to understand
A life upon the road is the life of an outlaw man
Some me call me Abel
Some men call me Cain
Some men call me sinner, Lord
Some men call me saint
Some say there's a Jesus
Some men say there ain't
When you got no life to lose
Then there's nothin' left to gain
Outlaw man
Outlaw man
Winter bells in dark and silent dreams 
Help me while these thoughts are troubling me
I slept through the falling of the leaves 
I never thought that time could get so far 
Away from me
Hide in a place you know that no one ever goes
Keep in a sack in which it always stays closed
I need a knack for keepin' out of trouble
You know how it can go
I don't know what I'm like but everybody says
You're not the kind that gets out of your head
I keep talkin' all these crazy clumsy words
And I know that I've been heard
Everybody's talkin' 'bout the situation
You know they all have a lot to learn
Always diggin' up some information
You get what you deserve
Now I have some shoes and a big coat
Have a car and a nice girl too
Drive around and get my blood flowin'
Keepin' it in for a later tune
Too young to fall
For a light I think I see
Can't say for sure
The plants have died,
My hair has grown
From the thought of you
Coming home
'Cause it ain't easier
Waking up at dawn
To find I lost my crown
If I found you there
With flowers in your hair
I'd hold you in my arms
Till we came back down
A smile that explodes
I could never understand
My room too small
To get by without the help of alcohol
Pin my arm to the wall
Now I'm too gone to fight
Not afraid to fall
'Cause it ain't easier
Waking up at dawn
To find I lost my crown
If I found you there
With flowers in your hair
I' d hold you in my arms
Until we came back down
A smile that explodes
I could never understand
I write one more
Letter I won't send
Except for across the floor
Who has betrayed the deceased?
Such an infamous freedom, such a militant peace.
How dare they distrust.
Do they know who we are?
And your progony's brave, their tract house waiting, pre-plucked and pre-paved:
To the ends of the earth, wife, kids and a car.
But oh no, no I see them falling.
Let's all pray for rain. Let's all pray for rain.
And your children are reared by panic and fear.
But what when your fields are all rotten, your waves of grain, amber waves of grain?
And your word is yet done: inbreed us all till we're all the same.
Your collection of tongues you keep framed in parlor with your bibles and guns, the fetus of Christ with a fistful of scars.
And your vision is clear while you blind your own kind in a curtain of fear, your words twisted skywards distracted by stars.
But oh no, no the sky is falling.
Let's all pray for rain. Let's all pray for rain.
You pour out your prayers and weep 'cause you care.
But what when all your fields are rotten, your waves of grain, amber waves of grain?
And you hide the dead while my friends head to die in your name.
"This playground is yours," spoke god when you met behind closed doors, "Gesture your hands and the pawns shall subside."
And though you play alone, you never get lonely, you never get bored.
Who needs a friend when God's on your side?
But oh no, no I see them falling.
Let's all pray for rain. Let's all pray for rain.
And even I can't pretend we're not near the end.
But what when all your fields are rotten, your waves of grain, amber waves of grain? When your days are done, I hope you've had fun with your game.
And you accepted as fact: Behold a white horse with you on it's back, A bow in your hand, a crown through your hair.
And the oceans shall rise and slap of the shores of mountain sides.
Great waves of progress shall wet the air.
But oh no, no the sky is falling.
Let's all pray for rain. Let's all pray for rain.
And you fools in the back with your heads in your hat, what when all your fields are rotten, your waves of grain, amber waves of grain?
And my words won't be done, They'll never be done till the end.
Loving you is the best thing and the worst thing in my life
Loving you is entire.
And loving you is the one thing that I need right now...
Center the morning light when the world's so bright and high.
Where even the gods outside can wait a moment guy...
And loving you is entire.
Loving you is the best thing and the worst thing in my life.
Loving you is entire.
Loving you in the morning is a warning...
Say we will wallow away in a world so mild and high.
Stay till the morning and the world just might get by...
'Cause loving you is divine!
If only the morning would come and the world would be old and wise!
Love in the morning with this halo all one size.
'Cause even the Gods outside can wait a moment guy...
Loving you is divine!
You never ever leave my mind
My sweet, sweet Madeline
Every time I look into your eyes
I feel like I'm alive
And I can barely make a sound
Whenever you're around
You can find me hiding in the crowd
Each time you come to town
Every time I want to say hello
Every time I want to stay I go
I never find the words to let you know
Sometimes you plague my mind a million times
Every time I want to say hello
Every time I want to stay I go
I never find the words to let you know
Sometimes you plague my mind a million times
I try to somehow let you know
That all the way from here to Mexico
You're the one and only girl for me hehe
Tu es un, bonjour oui oui
And my tongue gets tied so quick
I get so nervous I'm feeling sick
I turn into the world's worst Romeo
Every time I try to say hello
YELL:
You're so fine
Been on my mind
Get nervous every time
I see you hop on by
Every time I want to say hello
Every time I want to stay I go
I never find the words to let you know
Sometimes you plague my mind a million times
Every time I want to say hello
Every time I want to stay I go
I never find the words to let you know
Sometimes you plague my mind a million times
Every time I want to say hello
Every time I want to stay I go
I never find the words to let you know
Sometimes you plague my mind a million times
Every time I want to say hello
Every time I want to stay I go
I never find the words to let you know
Sometimes you plague my mind a million times
Every time I want to say hello
Every time I want to stay I go
I never find the words to let you know
Sometimes you plague my mind a million times
Mr. Blue,
I told you that I love you
Please believe me
Mr. Blue,
I have to go now, darling
Don't be angry
I know that you're tired
Know that you're sore and sick and sad for some reason
So I leave you with a smile
Kiss you on the cheek
And you will call it treason
That's the way it goes some days
A fever comes at you without a warning
And I can see it in your face
You've been waiting to break since you woke up this morning
Mr. Blue,
Don't hold your head so low
That you can't see the sky
Mr. Blue,
It ain't so long since you were flying high
Mr. Blue,
I told you that I love you
Please believe me
When I die
Put my bones in an empty street
To remind me of how it used to be
Don't write my name on a stone
Bring a Coleman lantern and a radio
Cleveland game and two fishing poles
And watch with me from the shore
Ghostly steel and iron ore
Ships coming home
Where I am
Paralyzed by the emptiness
Paralyzed by the emptiness
Paralyzed by the emptiness
Paralyzed by the emptiness
Clearly iron age beasts
You can tell by the rust and the chains
And by the oil that they bleed
The crew of crows fly the skulls and bones
They fly the colors of their homes
I fly the cross of the blue factory flame
Stitched with heavy sulfur threat
They ain't proud colors but they're true
Colors of my home
Where I am
Paralyzed by the emptiness
Paralyzed by the emptiness
Paralyzed by the emptiness
Paralyzed by the emptiness
Every mile for ten thousand miles
Every year for a thousand years
Every night for a thousand more
I hear 'em call
I hear 'em call
I hear 'em call
They never say to come home
They never say to come home
Where I am
Paralyzed by the emptiness
Paralyzed by the emptiness
Paralyzed by the emptiness
Paralyzed by the emptiness
It's a silent murder
It's a grave that sings your song
It's a quiet failure
It's the one that makes you strong
We are heading down
A long empty road
We pass lost souls
Blinded by the cold
Watch the fire burn out
Watch the curtains slowly close
Waiting on the final word
Your heart already knows
We are heading down
A long empty road
We pass lost souls
Blinded by the cold
By the cold
It's a silent murder
It's a grave that sings your song
You with the sad eyes
Don't be discouraged
Though I realize
It's hard to take courage
In a world, full of people
You can lose sight of it
And the darkness, inside you makes you feel so small
But I see your true colors, shining through
I see your true colors, and that's why I love you
So don't be afraid, to let them show
Your true colors, true colors
Are beautiful, ooh like a rainbow
Show me a smile and
Don't be unhappy can't remember when
I last saw you laughing
If this world makes you crazy
And you've taken all you can bear
Just call me up, because you know I'll be there
And I see your true colors, shining through
I see your true colors, and that's why I love you
So don't be afraid, to let them show (Just show your)
True colors, true colors
Are beautiful, ooh like a rainbow
Such sad eyes
Take courage now, realize
When this world makes you crazy
And you've taken all you can bear
Just call me up, because you know I'll be there
And I see your true colors, shining through
I see your true colors, and that's why I love you
So don't be afraid, to let them show (Just show your)
True colors, true colors, true colors are shining through
To see your true colors, and that's why I love you
So don't be afraid, to let them show
Your true colors, true colors, true colors
Are beautiful, beautiful like a rainbow
Show me your colors
Show me your colors, show me your rainbow
Show me your rainbow
Show me your colors, show me your rainbow
That's why I love you
Show me your colors, show me your rainbow
That's why I love you
Bird in a tree
It is on its way
Oh, with no one to blame
Climbing a hill
It is me again
Oh, it's always
The same
But on the top
We will find love
But oh bird you flew away
On our way we will have hope
But oh bird you flew away
Our walks are now across
The field
But I feel that you're still near
But anyway
But anyway bird
But anyway
But anyway bird 
Bird likes to be
But it can't stay
Oh it's always the same
Flying the hills
It's you again
Oh with no one to blame
But on the top
We will find love
But oh bird you flew away
On our way we will have hope 
But oh bird you flew away
Our walks are now across
The field 
But I feel that you're still near
But anyway
But anyway bird
But anyway
But anyway bird
Didn't I warn you not to?
Didn't I warn you good?
Maybe we couldn't help it
Maybe we never should
Didn't I say it slowly?
Didn't I make it clear?
Is it unfair to ask you
Why it is you're still here?
You cut your teeth on the lack of answers, and you
Come back home and it don't feel the same
Well I bled words onto a page for you
And you never knew my name
Didn't I make it harder?
Didn't I leave you there?
Was it too much to ask you
Why it is you still care?
You cut your teeth on the lack of answers, and you
Come back home and it don't feel the same
Well I bled words onto a page for you
And you never knew my name
Come, go, break your bones
They cut you up and never let go
Swing low, play your show
Call your mother, say "take me home"
Lie, smile, don't say no
Another man down if you let them know
You cut your teeth on the lack of answers, and you
Come back home and it don't feel the same
Well I bled words onto a page for you
And you never knew my name
You cut your teeth on the lack of answers, and you
Come back home and it don't feel the same
Well I bled words onto a page for you
And you never knew my name
And you never knew my name
Yeah... mmmm
I've never written a love song
That didn't end in tears
Maybe you'll rewrite my love song
You can replace my fears
I need your patience and guidance
And all your lovin' and more
When thunder rolls through my life
Will you be able
To wither the storm?
There's so much I would give ya, baby
If I'd only let myself
There's this well of emotions
I feel I must protect
What's the point of this armor
If it keeps the love away too?
I'd rather bleed from cuts of love
Than live without any scars
Baby, can I trust this,
Or do all things end?
I need to hear that you'd die for me
Again, and again, and again
So tell me
When you look in my eyes
Can you share in the pain and the happy times?
'Cause I will love you for the rest of my life
This is my very first love song
That didn't end in tears
I think you rewrote my love song
For the rest of my years
I will love you for the rest of my life
I once adored a chemical reaction
Her eyes were made from pieces of the moon
But now I fight the angels for her halo
She feels that she has nothing left to prove
We once had dreams of being something useful
A sword someone would keep at their side
A friction that would spark a revolution
A radio in tune with the sky
Well, we tried
Now everyone can share what's left
We can share our breath
We can share the air pollution
We can all control the sun
That's what we'll become
You'll become a resolution
Oh, I adore a chemical reaction
Her features look just like my disguise
We see the world through identical lenses
So I never ask what's going through her mind
It's mine
Now everyone can share what's left
We can share our breath
We can share the air pollution
We can all control the sun
That's what we'll become
You'll become a resolution

Från Öckerö loge hörs dragspel och bas
Och fullmånen lyser som var den av glas.
Där dansar Fredrik Åkare kind emot kind
Med lilla fröken Cecilia Lind.
Hon dansar och blundar så nära intill,
Hon följer i dansen precis vart han vill.
Han för och hon följer så lätt som en vind,
Men säg varför rodnar Cecilia Lind?
Säg var det för det Fredrik Åkare sa:
Du doftar så gott och du dansar så bra.
Din midja är smal och barmen är trind.
Vad du är vacker, Cecilia Lind.
Men dansen tog slut och vart skulle dom gå?
Dom bodde så nära varandra ändå.
Till slut kom dom fram till Cecilias grind.
Nu vill jag bli kysst, sa Cecilia Lind.
Vet hut, Fredrik Åkare, skäms gamla karln!
Cecilia Lind är ju bara ett barn.
Ren som en blomma, skygg som en hind.
Jag fyller snart sjutton, sa Cecilia Lind.
Och stjärnorna vandra och timmarna fly
Och Fredrik är gammal men månen är ny.
Ja, Fredrik är gammal men kärlek är blind.
Åh, kyss mig igen, sa Cecilia Lind.
Officer
Please don't haul me in
Though I'm drunk again
I can explain
I swear to you
For a week I have
Been completely dry
Until tonight
He's been such a good example
Everything he's done for me
I couldn't bear to let him down
Monday night
Brother sat me down
Very graciously
And explained
"If I'm going to help you
I must make it very clear
Brother that I love you
But certainly I hate your sin"
So you see you can't arrest me
I swore I'd be careful not to
Further shame the family name
I love the way you talk
I love the way you stalk
Me with your mobile phone
I love the way you smile
The way you're juvenile
I love the way you moan
I can live with vanity and puns
And the morning temper runs
I can live with all your downsides
I can live with you (?)
All I want, all I need
All I want is you
I can live with all the stupid things you do.
I love the way you dress
The way you make a mess
And that you're always late
I love the way you smell
And I can always tell
When you exaggerate
I can live with vanity and puns
And the morning temper runs
I can live with all your downsides
I can live with you...
All I want, all I need
All I want, all I need
All I want, all I need
All I want is you
I can live with all the stupid things you do.
Let's take a drive through the old town
Back past the place where we met
Some things are hard to remember
Some things you'll never forget
Let's take a walk down your old street
Who lives in your house today?
Let's see if we can remember
All of the vows that we made
Kisses you gave me
The vows you made me
None of these things have changed...
Nothing's changed
Nothing's changed
Young lover's stand in the showroom
New lovers taking our place
And though you're gone I remember
And I can still see your face
Kisses you gave me
The vows you made me
None of these things have changed...
Nothing's changed
Nothing's changed
Ett desperat försök
Det krävs ett hjältemod
Vem av oss är modig nog
Att rädda storebror, storebror
Käre storebror
Han har ett öga för det där
Hans sinnen letar klöver
Härjar ute varje kväll
Med grabbar som han kallar bröder
Herregud, käre storebror
Har en massa fuffens för sig, jag vet inte vad det rör sig om
Härjar ute mitt i natten, vad han gör det vete katten
Kanske något illegalt eller så är han väldigt social
Bror
Bror min drömmer om det liv
De visar han på TV
Han vill alltid va som dem
Jag vill ha han som han är
Min bor, käre storebror
Bror, ska du ut i natten?
Kom, vi knyter vänskapsbanden
Kom, stanna här med mig
Jag vill va med dig
Storebror, käre storebror
Kom, stanna hemma här med mamma
Vi kan prata med varandra
Dricka te och äta kaka
Kom vi minns, minns tillbaka
Har du samma drömmar nu
Om att du ska bli kung-fu-
Mästare och president
Bror, säg mig vad som hänt
Min bror, käre storebror, han
Har en massa fuffens för sig, jag vet inte vad det rör sig om
Härjar ute mitt i natten, vad han gör det vete katten
Kanske något illegalt eller så är han väldigt social
Brosan skjutsa mig i morse
I sin nya fina Porsche
Käre bror han vägra svara om
Den var köpt med illegala pengar
Det kan tänkas men han
Körde mig till ett kontor
Det visa sig att storebror
Har startat litet företag
Allting enligt rätt och lag
Och nätterna han varit borta
Har han varit där och jobbat
Allting sluta väldigt bra
Men det var inte så det var
Men bror, käre storebror, han
Har en massa fuffens för sig, jag vet inte vad det rör sig om
Härjar ute mitt i natten, vad han gör det vete katten
Kanske något illegalt eller så är han väldigt social
Den som lever flott och gott han lämnar inga spår
Den som lever flott och gott han lämnar inga spår
Han flyger upp bland alla moln och glömmer alla år
Han flyger upp bland alla moln och glömmer alla år
Den som lämnat djupa spår i gyttjan varje dag
Har härdat sina dar som år, känt minsta andetag
Han lever inte för en framtid
Utan för idag
I don't know why 
You want to follow me tonight
When the rest of the world
With whom I've crossed and I've quarreled
Let's me down so
For a thousand reasons that I know
To share forever the unrest
With all the demons I possess
Beneath the silver moon
Maybe you were right
But baby I was lonely
I don't want to fight
I'm tired of being sorry
Chandler and Van Nuys
With all the vampires and their brides
We're all bloodless and blind 
And longing for a life 
Beyond the silver moon
Maybe you were right
But baby I was lonely
I don't want to fight
I'm tired of being sorry
I'm standing in the street 
Crying out for you
No one sees me
But the silver moon
So far away - so outer space 
I've trashed myself - I've lost my way
I've got to get to you
It's not here to stay
'Cause he is stopping you
But we are going home
To keep the stop in time
(x3)
Father once told me that the night is so ghastly
It was born to be beastly.
And did you ever think of yourself as a runaway?
Did you gaze upon the waves and did you consider yourself
A symphony of runaways?
Oh my body is lost on the pity of bosses,
Oh there's values and costs in the wondering if you should
Throw yourself up on runaways,
Skip the hills and cut yourself up on runaways
Mercer is a merchant, a policy merchant:
He calls himself urgent!
He gathers all of the urchins up in their [filthy] tearaways,
He gathers them into his palm and then he sings "Another day!"
Oh, the Vale-dic-dic-torian is about to pay,
He gutted 20 sturgeons up from the silver bay
She's gone 2000 miles, it's very far
The snow came down
Gets colder day by day, I miss her
I hear children singin'
It felt like Christmas time
In these frozen and silent nights
Sometimes in a dream you appear
Outside under the purple sky
Diamonds in the snow sparkle
And our hearts were singin'
It felt like Christmas time
2000 miles is very far through the snow
I think of you wherever you go
2000 miles is very far through the snow
I think of you wherever you go
She's gone 2000 miles, it's very far
The snow came falling now
Gets colder day by day, I miss you
I hear people singin'
It felt like Christmas time
I hear people singin'
It felt like Christmas time
I hear people singin'
It felt like Christmas time
I hear people singin'
It felt like Christmas time
I remember hours scraped away
Hospital blue paint off the wall,
Like it would take forever.
Lighting those swan matches to see
Just how long they'll take to burn out,
Like they could burn forever.
How we envied all those actors lives,
How that cricket talked all night,
Like he could talk forever.
Then I thought I'd heard you in the hall,
Turns out that it wasn't you at all,
I guess you had to be there.
And I remember how fast we ran
I remember how fast we ran
We flew over fences.
We dodged all the moving cars,
And the dry Arizona faces,
The dry Arizona faces.
And how we stayed awake all night long
How we stayed awake all night long
We flew over fences.
We dodged all the moving cars,
And the dry Arizona faces,
The dry Arizona faces.
I went swimming in a black and silent sea
While I was in between
Waking and dreaming
In my mind a knot was gathering
I am afraid of so many things
And I cannot control myself
The water moved around me
Like a cloud of ink
Till I came upon a lake
The sun has never seen
And I cannot control myself
The fish went wild
Their eyes aglow and seeking heat
Like shards of glass
Fitting on past me in the lake below
Life without a moon and stars
Is no life at all
I am afraid of so many things
I am afraid of so many things
But I do not fear the future
What lies ahead is between
Me and the universe.
The trouble with the straight and the narrow
Is it's so thin, I keep sliding off to the side
And the devil makes good use of these hands of mine
And if Jesus is the straight path that saves
Then I'm condemned to live my whole life on the curb
On the crossroad to the devil, I'll dwel and I'll count my years
You know that I got a little something I should say
I guess that I'm just so easily led astray
It's all right because I know my own way back home from here
And I don't fall of the wagon you know
I take a dive and go as deep as I can go
Don't hold your breath because I'm coming up slow, this time.
And The trouble with the straight and the narrow
Is it's so thin, I keep sliding off to the side
And the devil makes good use of these hands of mine
You know a little problem or two
I guess that I keep on taking a few
I've been told it's not the best thing that I can do, right now
And I don't go looking for my sins you know
They come out waiting, and I just get on and go
Don't hold your breath because I'm coming up slow this time
And The trouble with the straight and the narrow
Is it's so thin, I keep sliding off to the side
And the devil makes good use of these hands of mine
And if Jesus is the straight path that saves
Then I'm condemned to live my whole life on the curb
On the crossroad to the devil, I'll dwell and I'll count my years
And The trouble with the straight and the narrow
Is it's so thin, I keep sliding off to the side
And the devil makes, the devil makes, good use of these hands of mine
Freedom, you and me
We lost our world...
She lost them.
Freedom, you and me...
Kawaii...
Kawaii...
Arrival, new arrival
Kawaii...
Kawaii.
Freedom, you and me
We lost our world...
She lost them.
Freedom, you and me...
Kawaii...
Arrive safe.
Arrival, new arrival
Kawaii...

I met the joker
And I stole the moon
I raised the sunshine
And I have been the fool
And I have been laughed at
And I have been lied to
And I have been left alone, with no answers
I don't cry, I don't cry no more
Girl I know you want this
So I don't try, I don't try no more
Girl I know you want this
So I don't lie, I don't lie no more
Girl I know you want this
So I don't cry no more
I took the picture
And I faced the truth
I lived a lifetime, a lifetime with you
Now I watch you fall asleep smiling
And I lie awake
But there's only so much that one man can take
So I don't cry, I don't cry no more
Girl I know you want this
So I don't try, I don't try no more
Girl I know you want this
So I don't lie, I don't lie no more
Girl I know you want this
So I don't cry no more
And I am a hero
But I'm not made of steel
And I'm not the smartest man
But I know the deal
And I'll bleed for your lips
If you'll bleed for mine
And I can't escape it
'Cause I do love you
I don't cry, I don't cry no more
Girl I know you want this
So I don't try, I don't try no more
Girl I know you want this
So I don't lie, I don't lie no more
Girl I know you want this
So I don't cry no more
Girl I know you want this
So I don't cry, I don't cry no more
Girl I know you want this
So I don't cry no more

Come on you faker
Don't you turn your back on me
I'm not your gaoler
Fly away on your silver wings
With your golden key
Look out you loser
I can almost smell the defeat
All night manoeuvre
Trying to set this trouble and problem free
I can't believe you're giving it all up over me
So you can get back to where you should be
Back to what you really believe
What you really believe
Come on you joker
What you hiding up your sleeve?
So hard to please you
Lay your burden down on me
If it's what you need
I can't believe you're giving it all up over me
So you can get back to where you should be
Back to what you really believe
What you really believe
Life has a way that's unpredictable
But you can't stand and wait on a miracle
Life has a way that's unpredictable
Can't stand and wait on a miracle

Let the wind blow
Let the grass grow
But don't let her go
Don't take her out of my life
Don't take her out of my life
Let the moon glow
(Let the moon glow on the fallen snow)
On the fallen snow
(Let the moon glow on the fallen snow)
But I just got to know
(Let me please know, oh oh oh)
Know she'll be a part of my life
Know she'll be a part of my life
Forever
Let the bees make honey
Let the poor find money
Take away their sorrows
Give them sunshine tomorrow
But don't take her out of my life
Don't take her out of my life
What would I do without her, tell me now
Let the bird sing
With the coming spring
Let the church bells ring
Let the rain fall
Let the grass grow
Let the moon glow
On the fallen snow
But don't take her out of my life
Please keep her a part of my life

Já faz um tempo que
eu queria te escrever um som.
Passado o passado, acho que eu
mesma esqueci o tom. Mas sinto que
eu te devo sempre alguma
explicação. Parece inaceitável a
minha decisão. Eu sei. Da primeira
vez, quem sugeriu, eu sei, eu sei,
fui eu. Da segunda quem fingiu que
não estava lá, também fui eu. Mas
em toda a história, é nossa
obrigação saber seguir em frente,
seja lá qual direção. Eu sei.Tanta
afinidade assim, eu sei que só
pode ser bom. Mas se é contrário,
é ruim, pesado e eu não acho bom.
Eu fico esperando o dia que você
me aceite como amiga, ainda vou te
convencer. Eu sei. E te peço, me
perdoa, me desculpa que eu não fui
sua namorada, pois fiquei
atordoada, faltou o ar, faltou o
ar. Me despeço dessa história e
concluo: a gente segue a direção
que o nosso próprio coração
mandar, e foi pra lá, e foi pra lá.

Cut through the country, speed through the dark
A child in a train, tristessa departs
It's only the start
Filigree circles round her young wrist
Her mother is frowning at something she missed
She fixes her hair
At the failing of the day she heard her father always say
"Remember, it's only the start"
It's only the start
When she drifted off to sleep she had the whole world at her feet
Because it's only the start
It's only the start
Before they fell away it seemed to matter all the same
But it was only the start
It's only the start
It's only the start
What explodes like a fractal
Pops like a light bulb
Looks really awful
At four in the morning
Moves with a dead stare
Coils around your ankles
Fangs long as neckties
And strike without warning
What implodes like a Zeppelin
Cracks like pavement
Smokes in the basement
And knows when yer lying
Comes to a dead stop
Forgives you like Jesus
Cold as a windchill
With eyes like Abe Lincoln
What is dark like a birthmark
Pulls like a magnet
Male and female
And covets like a dragon
Grows to a shark length
Contracts to amoeba
Lives in your soul
And loves you like I do
What appears like an angel
Stabs like a dagger
Fills you with light
And bleeds you of matter
Comes to a dead stop
Forgives you like Jesus
Hands you a love only
Found in the Vedas
What explodes like a fractal
Pops like a light bulb
Strolls in like Joel Gray
At four in the morning
Armed with a big nose
Fragile like a sea horse
Lives in your soul
And loves you like I do
Won't you let me walk you home from school?
Won't you let me meet you by the pool?
Maybe Friday I can
Get some tickets for the dance
And I'll take you, ooh ooh
Won't you tell your dad to get off my back?
Tell him what we said about "Paint It Black"
Rock and roll is here to stay
Just come inside where it's okay
And I'll shake you, ooh ooh
Won't you tell me what you're thinking of?
Would you be an outlaw for my love?
If it's so, well let me know
It's over, then I can go
I won't make you, ooh ooh
Fish in the sea, you know how I feel
River runnin' free, you know how I feel
Blossom on the tree, you know how I feel
It's a new dawn
It's a new day
It's a new life for me
And I'm feeling good
Dragonfly in the sun, you know what I mean
Butterflies all havin' fun, you know what I mean
Sleepin' peace when day's done, that's what I mean
And this whole world
Is a new world
And a gold world for me
Stars when you shine, you know how I feel
Scent of the pine, you know how I feel
Yeah, freedom's mine and I know how I feel
It's a new dawn
It's a new day
It's a new life for me
And I'm feeling good
One day I will be
Back in our old street
Safe from the noise that
Falling around me
And we'll release this town from the people
Who are trying to knock it down
And then only city lights will brighten the night sky
And there will be no sound
Open the bars and
Open the markets
Open the banks and
Open the churches
And we'll release this town from the people
Who are trying to knock it down
And then only city lights will brighten the night sky
And there will be no sound
We've been cowering so long
Oh what I would give
To stand at the bus stop
Or browse in a bookshop
To sleep and always be still
And we'll release this town from the people
Who are trying to knock it down
And then only city lights will brighten the night sky
And I will be set free from the people
Who are trying to bury me
And then only fireworks will light the sky at night
For all the world can see
Instrumental
Beat like a rug, ashed out and clubbed
Well it's all for my betterment
I'll give you a rib with the marrow dried up
It's not much but a widow's gift
But in the right rays of the sun
If you squint hard enough
There can be only one like it
I'd write you a song
For all men to be one
But I'd sing it from a place of pride
I can sing over most and I'd gladly be the host
But most often I just hang my head and cry
There's a song beneath the earth
It resides within the dirt
Under the nails of a workin' man
Drug in by the reign, of the crooked ways I think
I wish I was in a mood to die
Well life, it is good, no matter how far you sink
Sometimes sitting still is better than to try
When you're down in a hole
And your heart's weighed down like gold
There is a hand that can reach you there
I see your eyes
Blue and wide open
Take your time
My divine creature
My arms will provide
Undivided attention
Sleep, child sleep
Rest your eyes
Until the sun comes up
And you'll awake
To light, everyone's day
Up again
Rest your head
In my lap, honey
The day I wept
Is when I had you my love
Sleep, child sleep
Rest your eyes
Until the sun comes up
And you'll awake
To light everyone's day
Up again
Now some of us are weak
And some endure
And some people live their life
In violence that's pure and clean
But I saw a man cry once
Down on his knees
In the corner of a darkened cell
And his pain meant nothing to me
But I was younger then
And young men never die
When I walked out in the sun
I was strong
Clear-minded and blind
I don't say prayer for anyone
It doesn't do any good
Please don't ask me questions
They'd just be misunderstood
And if you could step inside me
You'd feel what hatred brings
And if you saw with my eyes
You'd see what self-deception means
I was younger once
And I created a lie
And though my body was strong
I was self-deluded
Confident and blind
Now show some pity
For the weak of will
Because when we're drinking
We can never be filled
Show some understanding
For the lonely fool
Because when I am drinking
I am out of control
I was never young
Nothing has transpired
But when I look in the mirror
I feel dead
I feel cold
I am blind
I am blind
I am blind
I am blind
I don't think Santa's coming this year
'Cause I've been a bad, a bad girl
I've made my bed, now I'm lying in it
Without a care, a care in the world
And I took his heart
I tore it apart
I left him outside in the cold
I shot him down
In the middle of town
I left him outside in the snow
I won't have no presents this year
'Cause I've been a bad, a bad girl
I've made my bed, now I'm lying in it
Without a care, a care in the world
And he took me in
He made me sin
And I never wanna go back again
So I did him in
I made it all end
Oh I never wanna go back again
Maybe next year I'll be good
Maybe next year I'll be better
Maybe next year I'll be good
Maybe next year I'll be better
Maybe next year I'll be good
Maybe next year I'll be better
Maybe next year I'll be good
Maybe next year I'll be better
Doo doo doo doo
Maybe next year I'll be good
Maybe next year I'll be better
Maybe next year I'll be good
Maybe next year I'll be better
Heaven is of honey
And kisses

How do I know?
How could I forget?
Heaven is in the making
Remains unfinished
A possibility
If there's a glipse of it
In the little dance of tongues
As a reminder
As a reminder
Heaven is all remembered
As an ideal
For idiots 
Possessed by Gods
That just waste space
In case I wake up without a pen
I do not want to forget
That Heaven is of honey
And kisses
Royal jelly
For the Queenbee
In the centre
How do I know?
How could I forget?
Well, today a friend told me this sorry tale
As he stood there trembling and turning pale
He said each day's harder to get on the scale
Sort of like Jacob Marley's chain
But it's not like life's such a vale of tears
It's just full of thoughts that act as souvenirs
For those tiny blunders made in yesteryear
That comprise Jacob Marley's chain
Well, I had a little metaphor to state my case
It encompassed the condition of the human race
Nut to my dismay, it left without a trace
Except for the sound of Jacob Marley's chain
Now there is no story left to tell
So I think I'd rather just go on to hell
Where there's a snowball's chance that the personnel
Might help to carry Jacob Marley's chain
Help to carry Jacob Marley's chain...

I feel, I feel, I feel so scared
I feel, I feel so sad
I feel so sad
I feel, I feel so scared
I feel so scared
I left my friends on another continent
And proceeded to take my life apart
Till all the pieces scattered
And I couldn't put them back
Together
Isn't that what we should be?
Instead of sister and brother
Friends not lovers
Anymore
Isn't that what we were before?
I squandered my cash to pay the rent
And hardly ever left my home
And the thought of us together
Started crawling through my bones
Like a River
I know you're still thinking of me
We are like wild geese in Summer
The cold harsh Winter's
Melting snow
Hides the muddy grass no more
No matter how many mile away you are
You are my best family so far
No matter how many mile away you are
You are my best family so far
Are you waiting for a miracle?
Are you waiting for a lightning bolt?
Are you waiting like a paranoid little boy?
Are you ever gonna come back home?
Do you believe that the sky is falling?
How you ever gonna pick up the pieces?
Do you really think that anybody will listen?
Do you really think that anybody will notice?
No way, no way, no way, no way, no way
No way, no way, no way, no way, no way
No way, no way, no way, no way, no way
I used to dream about saving the world
Now I just dream about the holidays
I used to write so many songs for my girl
Now all I think about is floating away
I think I need a big vacation
I think I need a big vacation
I think I need a big vacation
Out of this place
Out of this place
Out of this place
Out of this place
Out of this place
Out of this place
Out of this place
I Pray that the sun shines in the windows
Like it did on Thursday
Wont sleep the night before I'll be up just wondering my life
I would call on my peeps
Early in the morning to come later for a party
Id spend the day with my angels at the beach
Listening to the shore
That would be the way theyd remember me
(Chrous)
If this was my last day here on earth (earth earth earth)
If this was my last day
If this was my last day here on earth (earth earth earth)
Ooh earth
Pray that it's a Saturday is a better day for me to go on
I can be free on the weekends
I use to live for the weekends (ooh)
Call you up and acknowledge you to come through
And we do things do things over and over and over again
Just when you blow me out (you blow me out)
That's when my heart would stop
If this was my last day here on earth (earth earth earth)
If it was my last day if it was my last day here
If this was my last day here on earth (earth earth earth)
If it was my last day here on earth
Ooh earth
Never really thought about it
So carefree
Young and just doing my own thing
Really I be on bended knee (really id be on bended knee)
Praying that he opens his gates for me
Spend the day with my angels at the beach
Listening to the shore
That would be the way theyd remember me
If this was my last day here on earth (earth earth earth)
Would you remember me? (ooh)
(If I was gone) if this was my last day on earth (earth earth earth)
Would you remember me
If it was my last day (2X) (ooh)
The hurt across your face
Your word against mine
The rhythm you repeat,
The beat a hair behind
Were you on my side?
You gave your all, but you gave it once
A lesson that you thought
You could teach it when you want
Subtract me from your heart
Little take-away girl
One step at a time
You made us angry
All your love could hide
But we knew you were afraid
We accept, but un-accept
We made up, we're breaking up
You thought you had enough
But maybe you didn't know
That this stage holds our show
One step at a time,
You showed us angry
All your love could hide,
But we knew you were afraid
Misery, I digress
No recourse, no remorse
Let it be, I confess
To every song that brought you back
Misery, I digress
No recourse, no remorse
Let it be, I confess
To every song that brought you back
Retrieve the past like a prayer, bringing it back into the light
What was yesterday will reform today to retrieve lost life
Lost loves (unconscious, made conscious out of the darkness)
Retrieve (unconscious, made conscious out of the darkness)
Lost words (unconscious, made conscious out of the darkness)
Ideas (unconscious, made conscious out of the darkness)
Overcome (unconscious, made conscious out of the darkness)
(Unconscious, made conscious out of the darkness)
Unconscious, made conscious out of the darkness into
Unconscious, made conscious out of the darkness into
Unconscious, made conscious out of the darkness into
Unconscious, made conscious out of the darkness into

There's anthrax in the envelope I opened in my dream
The sky is red, and little kids are running, screaming in the street
I tried to run and save them, but I had molasses feet
I keep having nightmares, and I'm scared to go to sleep
If you fall in, I'll jump down
And touch your face while we're both sinking, stinking, thinking
We won't drown
You are my friend
And what we're doing's too important
For our lives to end quite yet
In Montreal, I got so mad, someone broke into the van
Stole my guitar and Aaron's bag
Then we turned on CNN, watched the towers fall again
And realized that our lives aren't so bad
This is just a test, take it with love and you will pass
You will be rewarded if you do your very best
Nothing ever goes as planned, so don't take anything for granted
If you do, the world will kick your ass
The air is filled with computers and carpets
Skin and bones and telephones and file cabinets
Coke machines, firemen, landing gear and cement
They say that it's okay, but I say don't breathe in
The air is filled with computers and carpets
Skin and bones and telephones and file cabinets
Coke machines, firemen, landing gear and cement
They say that it's okay, but I say don't breathe that shit in
An angel named Gabriel is watching over you
He was a friend mistreated, now he's dead so say you're sorry to him
When you say your prayers tonight if you make amends
The gates to heaven here on earth will open up again
If you fall in I'll jump down
And touch your face while we're both sinking
We won't drown
You are my friend
And what we're doing's too important
For our lives to end quite yet
She's holding a secret that she'll never tell,
She's holding a secret that she'll never tell,
Because the myth is not supposed to retire
We'd rather it lit itself on fire,
Or overdosed in a 4-star hotel.
She's holding a truth that she'll never reveal,
She's holding a truth that she'll never reveal,
Because truth this time is an ugly child,
And mother and daughter may reconcile but their faces will never heal.
"Don't go," she says, but he's sleeping-
She says it to herself: "Don't go."
She sees herself rising,
Packing a suitcase with all of her shoes.
But something keeps you faithful
When all else in you turns and runs.
Love turns 40.
The morning comes.
She's holding a secret that she'll never tell,
She's holding a secret that she'll never tell,
Because we were once cinema gods in the night,
And now all we've got is lunch-hour light
Where nothing photographs well.
"Don't go," she says, but he's sleeping-
She says it to the dark: "Don't go."
She sees herself rising,
Dressing in silence for nothing to lose.
But something keeps you faithful
When all else in you turns and runs.
Love turns 40.
The morning comes.
So it goes
The ordinary people they do not know
Who we are
Or what we're doing here
I want you to pick up the phone
And hum the dial tone
You see we should start
From the top
And look at what we've got
Wild flowers growing in the park
Summertime when it melts into dark
Dancing together at night until two
You're cheering me up and I'm thanking you
Almost blue
Almost doing things we used to do
There's a girl here and she's almost you
Almost
All the things that your eyes once promised
I see in hers too
Now your eyes are red from crying
Almost blue
Flirting with this disaster became me
It named me as the fool who only aimed to be
Almost blue
It's almost touching, it will almost do
There is part of me that's always true
Always
Not all good things come to an end
Now it is only a chosen few
I have seen such an unhappy couple
Almost me
Almost you
Almost blue
There was an earthquake
In her dreams so she thinks her
Foundation is crumbling away
Fault lines in her words
Hoping to show a soul disturbed that
Has shaped her to what she is today
Getting through to her (x4)
Sometimes when I call
She tells me things that were not her fault
And her surface will start to break
Breakdown a hurting sound
I want to tell her that it's ok now
But I'm not too sure just what to say
Getting through to her (x4)
All she wants is some breathing room
If not tomorrow surely one day soon
All she wants is some breathing room
If not tomorrow surely one day soon
Excuse me did she say
She wished she went away
And not return to the shame
Brought to her those days
We'll take man's dirty deeds
And suck them out by cosmic means
Into the sun hurl them
Where they'll be happy burning
But life is not tv
Life is not tv
Life is not tv
She's on wounded knee
And well crazy horse that's me
Her hard parts I'm cradling
I feel refreshed when I watch her sleep
Sometimes that's all I need
It's all about the company we keep
Getting through to her (x4)
All she wants is some breathing room
If not tomorrow surely one day soon
All she wants is some breathing room
If not tomorrow surely one day soon
If not tomorrow surely one day soon

I'm doing this and I'm doing that
And I'm a-walking the floor
I drink a little of this and eat a little that
And poke my head out the door
I get thinking I'm wasting the night away
I wouldn't mind if I could get with you right away
Oh honey don't know how long it's been
But this feeling's building up inside again
I wash the dishes and I rinsed up the sink
Like a busy bee
I make up a song as I'm a-working along
No one's watching me
I wish that you were here to help me dry
When's the last time you baked me a pie
You had a way of making it come alive
It's not too late for you to take a drive
(Baah ba ba ba baah ba ba)
(Baah ba ba ba baah ba ba)
It's not too late
I'd love just once to see you
I'd love just once to see you
I'd love just once to see you
In the nude
You're a mirror with two faces
Two sides, simple as that
When aI look at my reflection
Do I see myself?
Don't you run away, don't you run away, don't you run away
You're a fish with two fins
Swimming in opposite directions
When I go in for a kiss
Do I kiss him?
Don't you run away, don't you run away, don't you run away
Some hearts, some times, leave blind
Don't you run away, don't you run away, don't you run away
Don't you run away, don't you run away, don't you run away
Don't you run away, don't you run away, don't you
Only someone running would run right into me
Unless that someone was someone free like me
There are things I will not do
I will even be mean and cruel
And I will not stay with you
Unless you give me all of yourself
When I was a sandy blue
And friendship dwelled in western true
Smokin' pill and lovely too
That was before you gave a view
We'll make a future dream be ours
Through your eyes I swallow flowers
And disdain the winter showers
Choosing then to bathe in you
And I sing evil, I sing good
I sing as a seagull should
And if you melted then I would
Melt myself all into you
Can you love the one that God does?
Can you love the lily of the field?
Can you tend the soil inside of her
Till all has been revealed?
And I sing evil, I sing good
I sing as a seagull should
And if you melted then I would
Melt myself all into you
Can you love the one that God does?
(Can you love the one that God does?)
Can you love the lily of the field?
(Can you love the lily of the field?)
Can you tend the soil inside of her
(Can you tend the soil inside her)
Till all has been revealed?
Every time you messed with my head (nanana)
All the things you did and you said (nanana)
See my scars spell out your name and, you're paralyzing me (nanana)
Every time you left me behind (nanana)
All these tears are no longer mine (nanana)
Because you took it all away and, you're paralyzing me
Memories, they fall apart, whenever you're inside my head
Take my tears, they say a lot, since you're the one who put them there
When I needed you the most you were, nowhere to be found
But, I still hung on, just hoping for, my love to come around
Every time you messed with my head (nanana)
All the things you did and you said (nanana)
See my scars spell out your name and, you're paralyzing me (nanana)
Every time you left me behind (nanana)
All these tears are no longer mine (nanana)
Because you took it all away and, you're paralyzing me
I miss those times when things were simple, and your heart was mine
I just don't understand how you could throw it all away
When I needed you the most you were, nowhere to be found
But I still hung on, just hoping for my love to come around
Every time you messed with my head (nanana)
All the things you did and you said (nanana)
See my scars spell out your name and, you're paralyzing me (nanana)
Every time you left me behind (nanana)
All these tears are no longer mine (nanana)
Because you took it all away and, you're paralyzing me
Look up in the sky.
It's a bird, it's a plane.
Naw it's just me again, cryin' in the rain.
I can't figure out why I feel so ashamed.
You pushed me so hard, that I feel so insane.
Every time I'd cry you would wipe my eyes.
When I got scared you were by my side.
The only thing it did was it made me wise.
So I guess it's all good cause it kept me alive.
When I needed you the most you were, nowhere to be found
But I still hung on, just hoping for my love to come around
Every time you messed with my head (nanana)
All the things you did and you said (nanana)
See my scars spell out your name and, you're paralyzing me (nanana)
Every time you left me behind (nanana)
All these tears are no longer mine (nanana)
Because you took it all away and, you're paralyzing me
Once upon a summertime, if you recall
We stopped beside a little flower stall
A bunch of bright forget-me-nots
Was all I'd ever let you buy me
Once upon a summertime just like today
We laughed the happy afternoon away
And stole a kiss at every street cafe
You were sweeter than the blossoms on the tree
I was as proud as any girl could be
As if the mayor had offered me the key
To Paris
Now another winter time has come and gone
The pigeons feeding in the square have flown
But I remember when the vespers chimed
You loved me once upon a summertime
Now another winter time has come and gone
The pigeons feeding in the square have flown
But I remember when the vespers chimed
You loved me once upon a summertime
We've been around forever
Look at us now together
Ordering drinks at the bar
Saying hello to men friends
Smiling across a friend's friends
Ordering drinks at the bar
To speak is a sin
You look first, then stare
And once in a while
A smile, if you dare
(Ta da da da da ah Ta da da da da)
We'll stand around forever
Regardless of time or weather
Ordering drinks at the bar
Looking for love, and getting
Nothing that's worth regretting
But wondering why we travel so far
To speak is a sin
You look first, then stare
And once in a while
A smile, if you dare
To speak is a sin
You'd better beware (ah)
But once in a while
A smile, if you dare (ah)
(Ah, Ah, Ah)
To speak is a sin
You look first, then stare
And once in a while
A smile, if you dare
To speak is a sin
You'd better beware (ah)
And once in a while
A smile, if you dare (ooh)
(Ah Ah Ooh)
(Ah)
