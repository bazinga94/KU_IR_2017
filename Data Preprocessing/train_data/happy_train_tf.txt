Shake it, sh shake shake it now
So you either start screaming or start singing
Smell the break of dawn
It's time to bring out the big, big, big, big, big, big balloons
Your tongue is twisted, your eyes are slit
Because
All I know is my steak tastes better when I take my steak tastes better pill
To lead into the life we want
Try to change your mind
I'm not looking for a fight now,
If you snap it like a twig, glue it back with little sticks
I'll love you more and more, I'll love you more
I say oh
I forget why I'm breathing out
Where were you when I needed you most
All of her boyfriends gonna make her feel fine
I dream about you often, my pretty girl, babe darlin' you're so fine
When I'm lonely, well, I know I'm gonna be
We will not let time erase us
Well you tell those motherfuckers
Whatever gets you to the light, it's alright, it's alright
The girls are screaming "Let us in
And tell the man in the black cloak
Eclectic electric, ladies of the evenin', drinkin' booze and minglin'
Under yellow moons
Down to the general store for nothing specific
When I put my hand between your legs 
Needs a real man, here's why
I said, "You're holding back"
It's long, wrong way to go
It looked like a wedding cake
I've got no energy
If you've got will and a little time
There are so many things I can do just like falling in love with you
Thank him for everything you know
Travelling at the speed of light
No way they said take it, take it and he said make it with your own two hands
Killing it As long as I got you 
But the ocean made me feel stupid
We should have done it then"
Steal that beat like he would, RRRobin Hood 
Now I wonder if I've been doing something wrong
Can't count the years on one hand that we've been together
And every night my mind is running around her
Hey beautiful day, hey beautiful day
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet
But where are you these days
When I wanted sunshine I got rain
And I love you love you
Because there ain't no party like the party going on in my house,
I tell you my reasons, you don't tell me your inside jokes
Falling through the door
I've just crossed the line
But the sun has gone away
I'm gonna stick him in the house of detention
There's always more left over,
Well do you wanna dance under the moonlight
Those who say the past is not dead
Anywhere your luck was
Who You baby, you Baby, yeah
'Cause the dirt feels good when you're underground
No sleep, no chance, no need forget about it
Let's stop the world You've seen the difference and it's getting better all the time
Every hello is goodbye
I gotta get away 
Your words are the only words
I know that we can't save this town alone
But now I live at the eye of the storm
We blow away
This is the best one yet OhOhWiOh
Every time
Till you swear to take me home
Just to feel like I'm a star, now I'm thanking the academy
A psychotropic segment so tasteless,
When you're walkin' out on the street
But I'm in pieces, pick me up, and put me together
So it's your job to dance and smile 
After a while you start to smile, now you feel cool
Fear's just in your head
Star pa scenen vill ha dig inte dealen
So forget your head
Did you stop to accept how pathetically dumb
I say soda soda, I'm a high rolla yo sir
Long live rock, long live rock, long live rock
I used to think maybe you love me
They've always been so kind
On and on and on and on and on and on yeah, yeah
Real sugar, gimme gimme real sugar
A little bit of Erica by my side
This is gonna be, this is gonna be, this is gotta be 
I was a lonely soul but that's the old me
Simple times now seem so far
They're breaking your heart
And now that we're walking around the world 
And all the drugs that I don't have the guts to take to soothe my mind
Well, stop and smell the smoke you keep saying
So you wind up next to me
 degrees, that's why they call me Mister Fahrenheit, hey
Keep them coming 'cause we're not done yet
A lovely singing voice
Well I've been out getting wrong
I'm so glad you have a onetrack mind like me
I'll come back for another
Love is what I got , it's within my reach
Everybody knows there's nothing doing
And everything was my fault
Momma's boy, momma's boy
Now when the sun come up
I'm still waiting for your heart
The world goes crashing by
All I'm askin' is for one little chance
Don't it feel so bad
In my new living room floor
I'll be there waiting right behind
So happy, yeah, we're so happy
We used to believe we were stars aligned
Time flew, cut through, all over town
Desmond takes a trolley to the jeweler's store
That I can't say
Autumn hanging down all the trees are draped like chandeliers
Take off your skinny jeans
Come and give me your hand 
Old walks in the park
You and me together
Always been hip to the Bboy style
Celebrate, infatuate, lock us up, yeah, incarcerate oh
And the walls are closing in
She'll say I'm not so tough
Neon black tanks grope the skyline
What turns water into wine
And I'm turning from all the lights tonight
You let me down lightly, 
Give it all you got
Oh, there are rocks
Still photos and noisy arcades noisy arcades
That was a hit before your mother was born
Keep fishin' if you feel it's true
Someone's taken my place
But wont you tell me that your loves from the heart
With fear and fascination on what was here
I could be but here in your arms
Boom shak the greedy men running
Don't you know that Rome wasn't built in a day, hey hey hey
But I don't mind
Bring a mirror to my face
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet
We all got along
Sees the ocean fall and rise
Susugar, shake it like a Polaroid picture
To race away
Rocking in the dance hall, moving with you
Who loves the sun
And the more I go inside 
"I wish I had hands 
And it feels like his new life can start
Sold you a thousand lines
I found sunlight six hours away
How is it you seem to know what I tried not to show
'Cause we're playin' the Palladium you can't get on Star Search
Tonight, the city is yours and mine
We might not sit in our rooms
Make a little birdhouse in your soul
And coach look at me now
Hoping it would stay there for just a little while
Then I fall
They'll split before they part
That's the way it goes
Oh, and sometimes I wonder
Ride the tiger round the kingdom
Ugly trends and pickup lines
Round the bend, all together now
I hope that you see through your big yard and white picket fence
You know the way it works don't be afraid to ask
The characters become my friends
Well I don't wanna break before
Daddy Legs standin' tall he can do the funky lurch
What the people may say about me
And every time I do
I found some kind of fairytale
Then somethin' without warnin love
You make amy dreams come true
If I need to take a breath
So, shut your eyes
It sets my heart on fire
She likes to leave you hanging on a word
Can't heal the pain
And you laughed and said I still know how to turn you on though 
'Cause I just can't get enough
I used to close the door when everything went wrong
When the sun comes up there'll be nothing wrong,
Well it just goes to show
And you got me wanting you
City roof top, summer night
To get me through this
Everybody smiles at you
You made so sweet
Gonna be a bright, bright sunshining  day
You got everybody putting on a show 
We would dance in your apartment
It's temperamental
We're finally intertwined
Oh, no, we, don't care
I'm gonna go out in the street and do anything I want
I can feel my dreams when I'm in my city, eh eh eh
Meant angry young men with immaculate hair
You've got me running around in circles 
But the hole that it leaves in its absence can make you feel so low
Will a child find me by a stream 
Tout bas car il est tard
I'm ringing all the warning bells
When your mommy is to cold to buy your pills
Better get yourself together, darling
Pour the cops a cup cause everybody's here tonight
Who You baby, you I'm talking about my baby yeah
Oh don't believe all of your golden memories
Drinks are pouring, girls so fine
Focused on the pain to see how we can get along
This land is yours; this land is mine
And I said I didn't like the way he got things done
When I'm down and my hands are tied hands are tied
Nothing else but you you and I
Oh no let's go
Our rifles blaze away
I tip top topple over for my fun loving nun
The line into this real life fantasy
Promises and nothing else done
When I'm with you I feel like I could die
Cause in the end they'll judge me any so whatever
Standing in line, I think you're pretty
I'm trying to get a feeling from the city
Somos solamente yo y tu conciencia
In fact, there's nothing I can't be
A high roller
It left us looking like a bride
But you can't be close enough unless I'm feeling your heart beat
I saw the wise woman sing
So just lick your lips
How the magic's in the music and the music's in me
Peace to fashion police, I wear my heart
We built our getaway up in a tree we found
It's a show all on its own
Know with all of your heart you can't shame me 
In fact the people they should
And river, it flows
Hopelessly I feel like there might be something that I'll miss
Keep my money in the ceiling, let my mama know I'm free
Got to live that love
It's beating in my chest
My friend you must be careful
And get away from it all
Some people cling to what they know
Don't try to erase what you have done
Covered in skin, and not all of it you can see
I know I'll be safe in these arms
I can do the Freddie
And I hate looking like a fool 
It's a supernatural delight
Yes we're lovers, and that is that
Measure distances with tears
In a cap she looked much older
Forgive me and let me in
Don't let go
I have gotta save my baby from a mess this world has made
When I try to catch your eye
We've missed, so let's get back together 
Bursts are where I find a fix
"What kind of life do you dream of You're allergic to love"
Converse boots and a look on her face
I'm going down all you night long
And as things fell apart
To sing you're okay
The end of the world
Imagine if the friend that you thought you knew wasn't really true
You shine a light on head and heart,
Shake it, shake it Oh oh
I don't like girls the way they are
It's a long way now through the deadroads to your house
I shall take this unbound train and flow away
The road is long and winding
She's golden, she lives for me
Go ahead with your schemin'
My mirror disappoints me, and
Can't go mad, ain't got time
I'm trying to keep my back from the wall
And can I wait for my devoter
You feel lonesome don't you
If I had it in me to stop my random thoughts,
And he's just put the paint on his new boat
Yeh when we are together
Then he cracks that smile
Time don't move
The simple life sure looks good
Do you think of me when you are playing
Saying, "Yo, have you ever said a pretty word"
'Cause I don't know how to love
'Cause today's the day I got over you
Cradled by moonlight, I'm dreaming we'll be
I was underage in this funky bar 
And let your love shine and you'll know what I mean
All my life I've longed for this afternoon
I'll make it like your birthday every day
Civil War skeletons in their graves
We're talking the way we used to talk,
'Cause you've got everybody thinking,
In the dead of the night he could see
Everyone thinks she's really ugly
Bring it all back now
I'm in love and it's a sunny day
Don't ask her how she feels, 'cause that'd be a lie
With the one thing that brings light to all of my darkness
I've been heading home
One saw right through me
So I moved to the Sunshine State
Swap around a little stall
They all go wild, but they walk instead
We're running through the aisles
Now I'm falling down
And say I'm here now
We tore up the walls, we slept on couches
I want you to get cured
'Cause the future happened yesterday
It is the passion flowing right on through your veins
It could be rainin',
I let it wet my lips
I hope that you don't think I'm unkind
What's the matter matter
I got attention, I had a pen
Big boy, come on around
You are so good for me You are so good for me
I'm telling you for the very last time
Come and get it 
It was such an important thing
Careful or you'll hurt yourself
Anyone you've loved once
And they're zipping white light beams
And I think it's time for shining that light
How come it takes some people so damn long
I'll choose unloved instead
Smile with the risin' sun
Where do we go, do we say,
If that's how I've got to pay
I know it gets hard sometimes
Watch the sky
He's a regal man
They do it  mile by  mile at a time
Oh, I, I swear the world better prepare
"And people are just people
Though nothing will drive them away
Beer bust, like I had last week
The actress gave up all her old dreams
Zima Saturday sunsets, watching the world
Now they're drilling my teeth while I'm soiling sheets
Cuando se besen la luna y la arena
Well maybe this time I can follow through
Looked in the mirror and you said goodbye
Everytime I stand up I fall flat on my face
Tudo o que quer me dar  Everything you want to give me
I go out walkin',
These are the days we won't forget
I took this girl out last night and we left around twelve
Sometimes it gets lonely
I'm a superstitious girl,
And in the morning and the afternoon
What's the point of livin' if you don't wanna dance
We goners, moving on to
It's not the last one
And talk me back down till I believed I was the crazy one Aaah
How can you look in the eyes
Shiny happy people laughing
In truth, the forest hears each sound
Happiness ahit her like a bullet in the back
Someday I'll wish upon a star
It's gonna take patience and time, mmm
It was fun fun fun when we were drunk
So happy together
Are better than the reasons you had lost
Some kind of happiness is measured out in miles
Yours truly, I'd die for her
Did you cash in all your dreams
On the window near my bed
I may never work it out
Know this ain't going away, here to stay,
I might survive the nighttime, I might die
Are you prepared to take a dive into the deep end of my head
You son of a gun
Now I'm not alone
There's something I need to say
This song drives me, Bananas
And you're blind to the fact that my
So if I survive, then I'll see you tomorrow
He says, Amen and Hallelujah
And I'm sure they make your point but
One wrong move and we're through
I got a question for you, ooh, ooh
But I see how you get sucked in
My tears turned into butterflies
These bees get me and I say Ow
We'll ride on
I'll tell you about the magic, and it'll free your soul
Now all I need is just to hear a song I know
And think about how things were right
Lift me up mama your love keeps lifting me
Oh well, we really gonna party
Do it 'til the ground looks far away
Is the only sense I've left
You are a film for me to see
It would be a spitting image
Turn me into something faceless,
Shake, shake, shake, Senora, shake it all the time Whoa
The st way to leave your lover, 
I missed the ark but I could've sworn you'd wait for me
I'm only shy, here, when I want to be, my head between my cypress knees
It takes a thought to make a word
When I watch you, wanna do you, right where your standing, yeah
Sing about that, oh, love is a brittle madness
And all the girls out on the stoops, yeah
Today is a lovely day to run
Nearby a parkbench in the sun
I believe in your purpose, baby
I almost got drunk at school at fourteen
Every time I look at you
Me and you, get it Ain't nobody's business
And that twinkle in your eye
Yeah, one more time, I can never get enough, oh everybody
With you tight skin, making me jealous when you're asleep
The record seems broken, yeah I really don't care
He says his prayers and
Everyday, so glad that I found you boy
Enough to bring the party down
Bbbbaby, I think I'm going ccccrazy
There's cheating on your lips
I can put all that to bed
You're all our brothers sisters and our babies
Their hair was soft and long and the beach
Kitten, not everyone's keen on lighting candle  
I'm on your side
Your life's got happy
I'm sending out all of my love
You look like the songs that I've heard my whole life coming true
A mystery lies in her
By your side, oh
I can taste the tension like a cloud of smoke in the air
There's a world inside and a world out there
I've come to greet you
When she smiles they all feel the power 
I'm feeling sorry for myself
I can't even talk, still stuttering
Or I might fail to be a lawyer someday
Now it's payback
'Cause there's a friendship, a lovely kinship
Part of what I would call amazing
I've never felt so much at home
Watch the water drop from clouds, it sure rains a lot
I've got nostalgic pavements, I've got familiar faces,
We'll put out to sea
Affirm my power to spend my dollars, to get us home, yeah
That stretches out ahead
For having fun
What you done with your time
There's no belief, no salt in the sea
I need my medicine
And they knew all the time
How'm I the only one who sees a fight 
That is, unless I'm getting found, and
I know the sound, of your heart
And if you kiss somebody
Waterfalls
The jumping dust made catfish bust from corners now dripping with mud
And you made this come true,
I wanna be your man
But when I hear those drums late at night
If only I could say that everything's okay
You don't get what you don't deserve
Up in my air balloon, air balloon, air balloon ha
All the people in this world
This whole damn world
Bright eyes and subtle variations of blue
ardiente de mujer
What's a man without all the attention
Pulling out the sun
I can and call forgetfulness
I'll show you mine if you show me yours
To that gun on the ground
Alone in the chain, it remains to be seen how
Oh Great Goodman, King of Swingers Given what you lost are you better off
Because she loves me so
Shimmy, shimmy, quarter turn
Down parkway lines, I was losing my mind
Time I pressed my hand into yours
Ah sugar, dance all night to this DJ
Come on, come on, settle down inside my love
Uh, say what Huh
Tell me 'cause I don't want you to hurt
Everybody knows it
Wheat paste and concrete walls
My love you built a wall inside your heart
You know everybody wants one
If you've got the patience, celebrate the ancients
Te busque, te busque, Yolanda
We are heading out of town and
Don't be afraid of the man in the moon, because it's only me
The only one for me is you, and you for me
You can feel them on the rise
Junk of the heart, there's junk in my mind
Turned out just to be an honest girl
If what you say is moving you
Slap young waves on wooden bones
I wandered down the streets with my new town
All I know is the wine lasts longer when you don't gotta share it with someone
And if I do I know the way there
There's a reason why we met and I'm glad that we did
And our time is not infinite
On how you keep on getting boys to stick
Heaven at night
It ain't nothing, kid
I do it every time
Lets go my love
Heavied by the early morning dew
Will we need it, will we need it
A whippoorwhill in flight, turns east towards westphalia
I would choose the darkest horse
Hoping to take you away
And now I've too much to hold
Quick you dirty rat shake your buns
Never start no static I just get it off my chest
The elephant won't forget what it's like inside his cage
Sending me back down on memory lane
Wait a minute Stacy, can't you see
In the rock pools as a kid
I wish you a merry Christmas baby
You can tell everyone, everyone
I am a satellite, I'm out of control
Oh, And in the morning your eyes open so innocent
Searching the world for what's right here
Happy birthday
When I feel you start to go
Oh girl, look at yourself
So who's the girl wearing my dress
If you will soothe my worried looks 
I'll know my purpose, this war was worth this, I won't let you down
I loved you from the moment I saw you
Kindly send her sailing back to me tttee
And you'll be free, yeah   
My lifeahahahahahife 
I see the road is long, so get on my side
Sometimes I don't feel all right
The solar flares burned my arms 
when all I wanna do is get off
Attempts to crack the party code
Spread the word I'm thinking of
I went there, I went there and I waited,
Kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss me on my lips
Cause you left me out in the cold
Come into my life 
Everyone would take a cue
The kids go sledding
No one needs to know we're feeling
And I can read what you think, yeah
Ah la la la ah la la la I la la la la love this
Her heels so high and my hopes so low
She comes anow running through our gloomy town
The breeze blowing softly on my face
Who loved his daughter more than I love you
I'm gonna tell everyone 
Leave the hawks of war in their capitals
I would like to hold your hand
Long legs,
You've got to feel the rush, feel the spice of life
Turn up on your doorstep
Don't do it if you're just trying to please me
Alright, already, and we'll all float on alright
She and her friends sit at the back of the bus
Do the boogie all night long
And if you can't be with the one you love, honey
She combs her hair
Countin' down the hours 'til I get to see your face
Oh I wanna celebrate the whole world
What's the matter with you
They try to pull the wool over our eyes And tell us everything's all right
So much more than I needed before
Of clauses one, two, three and four
And she won't give up 'cause she's seventeen
I've been waiting for, waiting for you, girl
That's right
I long to be right by your side
If music is the victim then so am I 
Salon will commence immediately following
But there was somebody to mentioned
Barefoot on a summer night summer night
Wear your hair long, babe, you can't go wrong
Oh Saint Jerome, I don't ever ever wanna be alone
Worryin' about the market place
Soldiers fighting with the Cong
He didn't believe her but the boy revered her
Take me by the hand
Think about the things were right
Your mama and your papa
Climbed in the world's biggest tree
How are you today 
And that angelic voice you hear in the background
Oh, I'll do anything for you
Now I'm breathing like I'm running, 'cause you're taking me there
If it's jug band music or rhythm and blues
We'll sing and dance to Mother Nature's songs
Misfits, twilight zone
Here, I'll give you my phone number
For estranged lovers and time all love ones get held up
Nice day for a driveby shooting
You do it for the money
The lights spell out a code
That you couldn't wait to see
You're the only one I'm dreaming of, you see
Nah na na no 'right
Still not workin'  to 
I'm steppin' around in the desert of joy
The tracksuits are old, and the hoodie's way too moody
Chatting so delightfully
I'm not cruel and you're not evil and we're not like all those stupid people
That's what I need
Cut out their pictures and I chase that feeling
Where's the time required for your health
Sooner or later, I swear we're gonna make it
I'm gonna be the man who goes along with you
Lady on the water, bring me branches, bring me twine
I don't think you got this
You're my first want on the worst nights
But the press let the story leak
Who's around when you can't be strong
Don't call me crazy, I'm happy 
And for a change he's not coming home
Lay down and wait for you
And it's alright
By all of the quiet sleepers inside the quiet earth
Meet you up at the Indian part of the town
We can take a ride just you and me
Now I'm feeling drunk and high
My fingers keep on clickin' to the beatin' of my heart
Worse things happen at sea, you know
I went walking with my mama one day
Yeah, I met somebody in a sea of people, and that's just how I'll leave it
It's no surprise that we get so much done
So, I quickly opened the wardrobe
I kissed you on the playground
Ooh yeah
Sick of being someone
Mourn the years before I got carried away
I said, I'll write someday the satyrs of old songs
It was all out of tune
It's like a hundred thousand voices that just can't sing
Your parents don't understand what's in your head
Keep movin' don't stop rockin' ah ah ah
Cause baby, all I see is, all I see is you
I will not sleep until my pencils lie in a straight line
And the stories that we tell will make you smile
If I say, "Too bad," I'll take a lesson in my head
Sayin' this is my message to yououou
Well your wartime is funny
I need to concentrate
Can it wait for you
Another night out late
Now you got a bone to pick with me
Warm in the woods that conceal him from light
Just turn around
Just can't help feeling something's wrong
In the sun
Brush my hair, kissle me some more
Lurking there beneath my feet
Because we only have one life
I got my own kind of company
The dog days are over
And feel it, feel it, feel it, babe
Everybody's gonna make it to the cemetery
You've been right in front of me
They can tell something is wrong
E'rey day feel like my birthday
Any love worth living for
I sleep in the afternoon and become the noise in the night
And I'm not doubling back now
All the ways you move
Pass my way
It's everything I wished
So devoted, completely swept off your feet
Now that summer is gone, you have to go back home
Conventional sister no she's not
Some kind of mysterious
Cover your eyes in the pouring rain
I wanted to wear what he wore in summer
Tonight
Given them what they dream of
You roll the number and I'll buy the lumber
I always knew
Tryna find a moment where I can find release
Raise it's big bald head
And they were a part of it
And that's the way we get by
Die die die, die die die die
You'll be happy for the rest of your life
It's gonna be a bright, bright sunshining day
I believe you mean the best that life can bring
While working for a common 'cause I only got a kamikaze state of mind
We all spit at stars
Darling, we will visit, you know you don't feel this way
But that won't wake your father from his every lasting sleep
Then the conversation stopped, and I looked down at my feet
So let's sing while we still can
Yeah an' every place feels like a familiar town
A stomach full of pills didn't work again
Lay your traps for a thousand miles
Meet her by the sugar mill after school 
I say hello
So when you come home you & I'll be twins
Remember me, I used to be the best time buddy
Or Eskimo your nose real close to mine
And we'll have so much fun
Beat out a pulse on his head
And the next thing you know 
I'll be the platform shoes, undo what heredity's done to you
When the winter's here, yeah, it's party time
Bluebird of friendliness
Shot for the money on the very same day
Now he's got the time
Just say yes do it now
The stakes are high, the water's rough
So come on, come on, come on, come on
There's a reason for the warm sweet nights
Wave lengths pull magnetically and I was right
I hate a lot of whites and I hate a lot of blacks
I think I've got a reason to enjoy the sun
I'll go out, get drunk again
Please don't despair
At ten, I shaved my head and tried to be a monk
Floating in the magic world, donate all your money
Show me a rerun on the WB
And we are homeless, homeless
, , , woo
And the dark goumas they flicked dynamite
I am older now, I see the way you operate
We're all in this together
You have to put the death in everything
Just to greet the day
His girlfriend keeps him living in
The world is our carpet now 
There's not a day
Got out backs to the pack
Now it feels like sinners in the sun
And honestly my phone's blowing up tonight
Remember when the sun was hot
I got a whole bag of trouble to be taken away
But, really, I should stay away
Too much candy gonna rot your soul
You shine a light on head and heart
Call the police and the fireman
It's this one thing that caught me slippin' oh no
And dreadlocks in her hair
Keeping dumb and built to beat
'Cause I, 'cause I was looking for, for an ending
Listening to house of pain
We can build a little home
To illustrate my homelessness
There was a girl that passed me by
My mind was thugged, all laced and bugged, all twisted, wrong and beat
The ones with hearts on the outside
I thought it was funny but now I got money on a monkeyfight
Would you still say you needed me
Down on the rocks where we sat
Oh we can be heroes just for one day
Woman says let's take a drive on south
Ten grand, let me see you shake it like you got no
Cut notches up and down the door
They usually stay out of our way
But with you by my side I can do anything
Brave down the open road
This means less than we know it does please tell me
There's a feeling in your bottle
Smiles light up as we walk in
And I'm so sick of hearing how your love for this has died
And the audience beside us
Don't sell your heart, don't say we're not meant to be
I can say that I have
That my stinger always stays
From the night we never had
All our broken plans I will mend
We clicked our heels and we wished we were home
What do you do when the music stops
'Cause into every life a little rain must fall
Then I just won't take it back 
Hear the bells are ringing joyful and triumphant
I sold you a thousand lines
Where streets filled with people
The last that we got away with lies
I ain't ever gonna stop
You're giving eighty billion years of giggling
She played a good game of darts, and the men slapped her back,
That's when you gave me a reason
My brown eyed girl
But I'm taken by the hand to a blue pay phone
A blue cassette covered in dirt
You've gotta let the water drain in
And girl, you got it so bad
In a crazy, mixedup world
And sing on the beaches and swing through the night
Staring up at the stars that aren't there anymore
Had too much time to think
You know he's so much more like Spiderman than you will ever, ever be
If you love it 
And rust in the rain 
I'm holdin' her down, holdin' her down
Whatever chances you get
Reminding you your love for me is more than six feet deep
And there's every type of girl
Don't throw your youth away and don't let me hear you say
I need to be high
The way back home always is the same
Are you sad because you're on your own
Just remember, tomorrow never knows 
I know you're beating my heart, you're beating my heart
After all this waiting such a big day
But I shut my eyes
My global position systems are vocally addressed
You serve a motherfucker, you serve him for that
Unexplainable sightings in the sky
I'm here right beside you
Tired of feeling bad
Turn on the radio, clean the windows
 Un pochettino un pochettino 'causeí 'causeí dai
We all feel ashamed sometimes every day
And the colors of the street signs 
Then I got high, Lord, I got high 
'Cause they're those girls, yeah, you know those girls
Clean these fingers clossing the line
What'll be revealed today
It's only one more day
I don't care what they're sayin'
Take another better look around
But I've been waiting Waiting
I don't know what's come over me
Onenight engagement at the eleventh street
By the time we hit Mexico you'll know little girl
You wanna fly around the world,
How long of time is left for you
And just because I am in misery
But I've been unfaithful
Oh yeah gotta stay away from my jock
So why don't we, sleep all, we sleep all day, sleep all, we sleep all day over and over
We rattle this town, we rattle this scene
And of all the places that I've been
Nothing against you but you dragged me for too long
Touchdown turnaround I never see you around
Can you crease the wrinkles back into the cracked and open brain
It lets me know that I'm OK
I have too many stories
I got money in the meter and a two bar heater
From the roof to the floor I'll crawl around some more 
But out of my ears my little gray baby hears
To pretend I do seems really dumb
From laughing and crying to pain that comes easy
Get a strange look from a girl who looked uptight
I can keep it inside
I draw the curtains in the glare of the same old sun
Everyone said, "Go ahead and ask her"
All mine
You'll always be mine
I couldn't wait another second 
You know, you know my name 
Just as long as you're gone
You got me to hitch my knees up
Satisfaction guaranteed
I might have not have reminded
You think you're clever but you never say nothing at all
And not recognize the aging street, and
I've got to get you into my life
Because tonight we're singing the songs, busting these rhymes,
You should thank him for every breath you blow
If it's just me, adjust me baby
And you've got me wanting you
If I'm a spinster for the rest of my life
It's all I need, all all I need
Let's sully every stage we meet
Justify your thesis certain that you need this
Last night I had a dream we were inseparably entwined
He met his lover almost every single day
When we had done our thing for a full Christian hour
Oh, I feel like a champion in the stadium
Que amanh~a                     		That tomorrow
Real sugar, sweet as a sweet can be
I just want your kiss
Across the border to a new land,
Everybody come together
So let me know before I wave goodbye
I see Mindfreak like, "What's up man, what's happenin'"
Heyla, heybahelloah
Wow, I've never seen Sharon look so bad before
Singing byebye, goodbye I tried
There's no use wasting time
But I'm hoping she might feel the same
And I'm dancing like every song he spins is bis
Lost control when I panicked at the acid test
We got a damn good reason
How I feel
She said she won't forget
Don't need a sword to cut through flowers, oh no, oh no
And I'm never gonna get it just because of my bad credit
As long as I am with you, my heart continues to beat 
All the girls I've known are crying ohohoh, ohohoh
But other times I'd feel so bad that I could not get out of bed
But maybe someday when my ship comes in
Because everybody else's mind is grey
Come on, baby, let's get away
Well look out, Sunshine, here they come 
All the times when I stole a look from you
Get out of the city and into the sunshine
And if I was a tree growing tall and green
Meet me halfway
Until the nut comes out, come on coco girls
Can we forget
Everybody trying to reach out to each other
Knew Nevers
Measure me in metered lines and one decisive stare
Edward and the Magnetic Zeros
And our daddies took a ride
Look, I used to cook before I had the game took
Somebody's birthday
And faced with all the obvious she'll carry us
Don't hide the treasures you've found in a hole in the ground
Capone
You got no time for the messenger,
Pay the donkey back, back,
You are a radar detector
Talk about me, and we'll talk about me
Of the love and laughter yo
You got a look in your eye
And the leaves like the artwork to "Major Leagues" look like dead foxes on the hard shoulder
A man walks down the street
Your beauty took my breath away,
That type of thinking can't get you nowhere 
Ride wit' me nigga, let me show you where we kick it at
Let's not nothing a gallon flawed
Disorder surrounds,
The clouds the darkest gray
As I wander through the street
But in discos they turn them on
Can I talk my shit again
I never knew where I belonged
I sure miss you honey, when you're not around
I'm thinking you're the girl for me 
Return like a prodigal sheep
I see you strutting down the street, you look important, huh
You know it's worth the nights we wait there
Dance all night to this DJ, ya luvva dance all night to this DJ
The girocashier and baby maker
Always inviting, always exciting but I must not take off my coat
Shakespeare
Baby look what you've done to me
But doesn't everyone
Let's roll, uh 'oll 'oll 'ollout
I'd have Al Jolson sing I'm sitting on top of the world
To help my fellow man
Now it gets ethereal, feet ain't on the floor
Coming around
They come and they go
So if you're playin' in a rock and roll band
It's the first kiss, it's flawless, really somethin'
One fine day one fine day we'll fly away
You show your face and take it in and scream and pray
Is life, love, with you
When the walls begin to creep in
Well he used to be somebody
I know that she's a hottie but damn that girl could party
Oh baby refrain from breaking my heart
Nothing to report
No one will ever forget your name
And it's fun
'Cause this  Side Where they say Shorty rhyme
"I like the nightlife, baby"
Get some one
It's been a while,
And everything is going to the beat
Alright
Oh my days what have I done,
I know that may sound twisted
She waits and
We laid on the mattress and tumbled to sleep
Drivin' away, just drive away, leaving it all behind
To feel better, to get a man
This a number one champion sound
'Cause every other song's telling me that this time is about our love
I knew that we'd arrived at a unified scene
Hey, I don't care if I'm wrong
How when you're talking, that you touch
Hoping I could learn a bit 'bout how to give and take
I'm gonna gather up a few of my friends
And another thing to live again
He watched behind the screen and she started to undress
Undid our footprints, even furled our flag, and
If you let a frown become your normality, yes
Now that my tralala's are dating
If you know this part right here, feel free to sing along
Now this would be our best song you have ever heard,
Saying everything is groovy
Singing these words to everyone
Can you smell the spring time in the breeze
Never felt so good, sleepy smiling
And when we get there yes we're right on time
Kissed in the moonlight
I have been waiting, I have been waiting for you
Tú más que nadie merecer ser feliz 
Two o'clock in the morning, something's on my mind
I cut my way out of control
The spaceship
You know that I'm the girl that you should call
All by myself, Waking up at twelve in my clothes again
Out in our place filled with lost existence
He's got the sun on his back Just go out, it's alright
Honey pie
Strong wind destroy our home
Our little place
There is an empty space between the lines tonight
I know that every single night
I look for work today
We were born with sun in our teeth and in our hair
It may get harder, cause you just restarted
Put a smile on your face
I don't wanna take my time,
I found a place
You thinking that it's me you're fooling
Hard to talk when you're staring at the ceiling
And that changes everything
Don't you let those other boys fool you,
Everybody drinks on me, buy out the bar
I stretched my hands out to the sky 
She bites at blades and leaves
I don't care where you move I don't care if it's far
And all the bad names gone 
I know everything reminds you of me
I need your body on me
And a wave tossed bottle is thrown to the sky
Would carry through your laughter
The growing pains
Don't worry, you're not alone, that's just how we feel
What this verse sound like, should I freestyle or write
We all grow old, use your eyes, the world goes and flutter by
And then Someday
The bridge and tunnel just seems to escape near our home
It's a good thing this is just a game
And if you would fall you know I will catch you
Of a speedway operator
Won't you please let me
We fail at everything we ever even try to attempt
Yeah, always feel the pressure from home
We've been talking on the phone for hours and hours
As we spent the day alone
And the only thing constant was the constant reminder he'd never change
Has got to give a mild holler to spend my dollars
Maybe one day you'll understand
That I was weak at heart
What if you could only speak the truth, what would you say
He has just thrown a bunch of gold paint
Tuesday, Wednesday, heart attack
The newlyborn crying realizing what life is
To smell and pretend
As he steps outside
But I never thought I did
Oh, all this years will wash away and we'll be claimed but we'll have nothing more,
Our aspirations are wrapped up in books
To live, to learn, to love in the major key
When will I get my chance to burn the shoulders of
Free to run and cry 
I've been thinking I'm drinking too many drinks all by myself
And still I chew it up and spit it out
If you leave me, I will follow you and bring you back where you belong
When you've got bigger plans that no one else understands
We cruised out to the other side
I'm tired of the fork in the road
They we're very very friendly men
But baby I don't need any of them
By four we be high, thinking of the girl lost second
It's a brand new day
Here we stand
Everything is serious and everything is fatal
Morning's first light
Even if my perdition were just in front
Yeah the way I make myself
Friends do things together, la la la la
What we make of those people we love
I'm not the kinda girl who'd get messed up with you 
And when we are apart
Vivo iludido a acreditar que o amor não se pôs em você
Do you know this house is falling apart
I'll be the waterwings that save you if you start drowning in
And feel it for a minute, babe
With a headache made in hell
Am I awake or is this just a dream
The word is good
I said there's nothing that I can do for you you can't do for yourself
"I'm bored" or "get away"
Got a tattoo and the pain's all right
Your love washes over
Well if I lived in Japan, I'd still have Chinese children
Pride is mistaken for hate, it's upgraded
Cause now you got me missing you
It's safety dance
As I opened up my bloodshot eyes
Yeah I slip, I'm still an animal
"Here I am to save the day"
To the remains of the ChairoPlanes
It's all right to show me
I know there's a light inside 'cause
I'll stick around but just don't promise, nothing bindin' 
Once I get up I feel better
If you sell that soul you'll be burning up right
Shake down, you make me break, for goodness sake
I'm a flower in your hair, I'm a flower in your hair
Maybe you got room to spare
When she doesn't speak to anyone till four o' clock
To get a little closer to you
My flow's a dog down boy
Clap your hands if you want some more pull shapes,
I took the morning to read the paper
Maybe I'll paint them in myself
Then we raise our heads for the colour red
Only you make me feel this way
Always golden, still the greatest
And his mother is his mother reluctantly
C'mon girls this isn't funny
If there's a choice between a chance and flight
Jelly, jellybones
Leave the widower in his private hell
We'd lie and tell our friends
Oh baby, I was blind to let you go
We said, Darlin' do not fear
So the fun won't start 'til she's living it up
I feel now
I didn't even notice it till it fell apart,
I heard your heart say love, love, love
Do the whirlwind, do the whirlwind
And I'll still think of you on cold winter mornings, darling
To walk like your pappy
It's time I accept the fact
Causin' trouble every time a young brotha try to hustle
Ooh, yeah
Now I'm trying to get back
Betty, I need you
I'll be holding you so near
Ooh, woo, oh I finally get my feet back on the ground
And threw them in the ocean
Move your arm in your watch To another time on the block
Never alone, no, no
We are jacking the ball
Infect the whole human race
Drowning, everything is drowning
Then again we don't want it to stop
But I can dance, dance, dance
Fuck with the sure shot
It's okay with me if you don't have that much to say 
Oh life, doo, doot dooo
All the subways around create a great sound
She's got a competition clutch with a fouronthefloor
Now is not the time and you're not alone
Well they forgot
We're never gonna get to the bottom while there's traffic around
Closer to the mountains, woods, oceans, and rivers and trees
I got so dizzy fell back into my bed
I don't like dropping names but Kurt Cobain is all in my face
Who knows someone I once knew
Our love goodbye
I'll send a message
Find your mirror go and look inside
Yeah, my name's on the wall but I'm happy
Ooh, I shot ya, yeah, I know
She got what she wants
Come come come
I love her
When you do I really hope it's all it seems
Money never beats soul
Shake your head to the sound
Oh no, what did I say What can I say
Gonna be a bright, bright, bright sunshining day
I got cursed or something man but
A new day is rising
Well if I lived in Greenland, I'd still have Chinese children uh huh
I keep my heart undone My heart undone
Oh yeah but don't forget the things you have
To keep my blues away
My love is true
I don't feel like I'm fallin'
Home is when I'm alone with you
Fed to the rules, and I hit the ground runnin'
They'll tear us apart if you give them the chance
Keep this skin out in the open
Over and over Kickstart my rock 'n' roll heart
The summer's day is hovering
But the scenery's the same
Kiss him in the face with no lips and no tongue
For fear I may lose you again
Don't cry for me today, ahahaha
Toss a couple milli in the air just for the heck of it
I got one question for you liars, man
As sleek as a sheikh spinning 'round and 'round
I'll have to say that I adore her
Don't you let me know
So I can wrap myself up when I'm feeling cold
On you I can depend
Well she got her daddy's car
And out of town it huffs and puffs
I know we said that we'd always be honest
Used to hang with the devil in the broad daylight
Tryin' to fit the world inside a picture frame
The blacktop singing me to sleep
Somebody once asked "Could I spare some change for gas"
Find it and shine it and wind it always
We'll be falling in love
Take you with me if I can get up now, get up
You're my love come get lost with me
I'm like a zit a wart a corn a cyst a festerin' boil
Last night I met a new girl in the neighborhood, whoa yeah
Boots and fists to pound on the pavement
Lady on the water with your jacket blue and strange
You gonna shine, shine on, my friend
Oh I love this house, I love this house
And we both know my heart could be broken
So I used my one phone call to dedicate
One dance left
Out into the gray streets
His Senorita a heavenly sweet soul
You might lose faith in wealth
Baby Britain feels the best
Gotta get that money man
"We got a young brother that stands for something We got a young brother that believes in the all of us Brother Kendrick Lamar He's not a rapper, he's a writer, he's an author And if you read between the lines, we'll learn how to love one another But you can't do thatright onI said, you can't do that without loving yourself first "
Why do the people in the country want to look like the people in the city
Your every day is full of sunshine
Through the rain and open wind
Jump in the line, rock your body in time Somebody, help me
The sound of all these passersby mixed in with the bus andmotorcar
Helping the kids out of their coats
I fell asleep on your cobweb
Toys are not sentimental
Two sisters,
Quilted on my hands and feet 
Give myself again till the well runs dry
Party like it's the end of the world
I was livin' like half a man
Well I need you I want you to know it's AOK
Is this the last time
Until we're there crank the radio
To feel something constant under my feet,
These walls won't fall,
But does the heart grow fonder
My love is here to stay won't ever leave
You You baby, you I'm talking about my baby yeah
She never told me that you called
Wow didi didi I just had to look
I'm in love with how you feel
I had a budgie but it died
I pray that you'll be waiting right there for me
To something good, oh yeah, something good
Did you ever care to sing your free love tune
I'm feelin' like Bob Vila nailin' up your behind
That life is my bass synth, I feel the attack now
And said, "This is all I really need to get by"
Staring up at freeway signs in dreams that make me sad
I can't really breathe, but I feel lighter 
Was planted deep inside your bag
It's getting harder to leave it
The model with the tragic air
Hanging on the wall of a schoolhouse somewhere
Wearyeyed and forlorn
There's a lot of words to come out
Cause America can, and America can't say no
 years
Informing me I'm near the axis of feeling
The girl
I don't know where your heart went
The ghost made that clear
Oh and she should have kept her head
Tickticktick now they know where you are
House buried to the window sills in snow
It feels so right to kiss your lips 
You wouldn't need binoculars
For a minute, I stayed watching this brilliant display,
Summertime girls got it goin' on
Well, it's all right, if you got someone to love
And I got a different angle like a parallelogram
And all their inaction will tumble away with the days
I'm also one of them
When the moon was out instead
You hang about the park but you don't play football
How not to see my life
Wide awake, waiting like a target
It ain't time to crawl
You're not a baby if you feel the world
, , , you'll fall in my arms now
Life is a maze, and love is a riddle
You did for the ballad of a comeback kid
Pretty green polkadot sky
Climbing up the walls
Never you mind, wonderful you
Distills each dream inside my head
And when we've had a few more days When we've had a few more days
We got supporters in this rock 'n' roll band
We should know better Dream of better lives the kind which never hate
On the underground,
They love while they can
It was pretty bright, up on the rainbow bridge tonight
Yet you're going to look at me that way
Wait there, I'll be right back
Anywhere you wanted to be someone else was talking to me
I gotta keep trying anyhow
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes
You'll still meet some new friends
Of Desmond and Molly Jones ha ha ha ha
I've become what a mother wouldn't want in a son
Who needs boys when there's Lisa round"
Nobody cares anyway
Falling, falling, falling, falling into the night
That planet Earth turns slowly
Oh, wherever I'm going, I'm already home
I want something else, not listening when you say
Fly around my pretty little miss
And by the time that it was dark, you and me had something, yeah
The bar men used to call her "Little Lisa, Looney Tunes"
It's the time to live
No, we don't need anyone
And when at last, my work is done
Over the hills the frequency's breaking down
You came around
Is It's too way , too real to believe be here or be
Tunnel under, tunnel under, underground
Other things just make you swear and curse
Nette Skelette wirken vital wenn sich dich holen
If you trip over I'll catch you're fall
August through February all the time
Now I'm lost in a daydream
Love is all you need
I bet you didn't even know
And I'm ready for love
I'd be sad and blue
For since last night
You still say 'what did you say' Argentinean Accent 
Never die, never die, never die
Then it's over before beginning the good part
I'll be home, I'll be home
But as long as you are with me, there's no place I'd rather be 
Always be my boy Ooh
Under pinups on the wall
You gotta love the sound
Well I'm tired of hanging around
I should say that I need you here
BBBButtery eyes, if only cries could come from those eyes, oh
Adrift on the sea
But you make me feel so pretty
I'll be 'round
I'm caught in excitement 
I change it all the time
On the darkside let the light shine
So Daddy throws clothes, throws on an old stove
Sometimes I don't speak right
See the cars on the 
Fumbling 'round the back
Oh what a beautiful day today
It is love from the first
Oh I gotta know
How d'you do Comment allezvous 
Different trips, different trains
But it's always the same problem, in the end,
Grab you expensive coat, and bury it inside
Somebody followed me even though I packed and moved my home
Today has never happened and it doesn't frighten me
If you listen to your words, he might like what you say
You've got something I can't resist
I'll fall into it
Is there some way you can be out on your own
What happened in November is what I needed
You know, you know you know my name
Can I take my friend to bed
Why would I say my name Oh why would I
The sun is shining down
When I kiss you
Everybody on an old jet plane crossing their fingers and toes
Honey suckle, you're missing
But we didn't mind
Let's get them dollars, Let's get this money
Where all them girls was doin' Tina 
And then I look down
My mother jumps the gun
From your previous life
Words, wars, and symphonies
Your poor family's name
And the way it came down to me
It's hard to breathe
Don't you think by now there's truth
To me in any sense at all
The lights and sounds,
Way up in the sky
But baby, how we spoon like no one else 
Someday 
I loved you then and I love you now
In a prison yard at night
The clocklike beat of the budgies heart
Help me drive this craziness away
Rocking like a cradle, yeah, it won't let you go
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I don't know what are you now
I'm movin' outside
It was quite a day hey hey
Why can't we be friends
Things can only get better
All the grittiness of life
But if Jesus comes to take your hand I won't let go, I won't let go
These things in life they just don't come for free
But everybody's going away
Can it be we've run out of time
I said girl
And in a way
My mind's tired, I've worked so hard all week ooh, all week
You took me by the hand
But you are an artist
And the first time that we kissed
And there are little more than pictures of how I see you in an Xray machine
Just say you do
Who's learned to love you but has also learned to grow
'Cause it's one thing to start it with a positive jam
Watch the basin drain
It means you walk backwards
The rumble of your water would be my call
Asking you to wait, wait for me
It's me that's done wrong
I know nothing can tear us apart
My My Time Flies A man underneath a tree
Nothing brings me down
But in the stars and closer to home in every planet
Come on home
Stuck to aging feet, and
But please come down from that cloud you're sitting on
If people try to put you down
And we'll become
Ba duba dop ba do, yeah
Don't push it baby
I've got big big plans
Do you remember where you saw her last
But in a minute realize that true love always waits
Pants have got to go
While you hold on,
Cry your guts out till you got no more hey
Speck of white, so fair and pale
There must be enough love to go round the world
And when I, and when I call
Hot kind of music
And you was looking at me like it was my bling
Everything is gonna be alright
Turns out I saw them a couple of days ago
Waste my days Oh, oh
Call out these chains and get me home
We're gonna be alright ah, yeah, ah yeah
Out of the orange colored sky
Come on lay down these arms, all our best defenses
It's such a lovely cup
Live your life until love is found
Candlelight, coconut ice
I've got a sickness, you've got the cure
You hold a candle in your heart
To finally talk to a girl a little cooler than me
Born to gaze into night skies
If I'm wrong, let me know
Fade into the feeling
And love is five in the morning
Where the minority face the majority
Long hair cloggin' up the drain
Like an ice age, nice days are on your way
Or the grace in your eyes overcomes any fall
I fell in love again
But the drinks are flat and the price is a crime
Pretty girl, pretty boy, pony on a tin can
Every time I caught you look
Three thousand miles northeast
Mostly you're a mind game in my head 
Bingo and rock were pushing out Xrating
I'm bouncing off the walls again
You know that we're all tied, and it's tied at one
And wanting to give love another try
Cannot all creation call it celebration
She said, "Let's put a plastic bag over our heads
And the mail room shift gets a real short shrift
It seldom turns out the way it does in this song
Circumnavigate this body of wonder and uncertainty
Just give me one more day one more day
Is it the world or how I see me
You can shake it all around
So I can rock on
I hear you come in loud and clear
Coming Oh it's coming around again
We love this exaltation woh oh, ooooh
The nights are silver, they make you shiver
It doesn't change our mind 
Something somebody stole
Does it really matter
Where the rest of the dreamers go
But long on time
I hope you learned it notefornote, like good little children
And round, around, around, around, around, around
Tried to learn what's right and wrong
It's such a feeling that my love
But it takes a lot of squinting
From the sunrise up above to the sunset below, they all sing
When I consider what you mean to me, It's everything
Let the music smother me
Cause now I'm standing on my own
And as I stood there as a broken hearted
Help yourself to a bit of what is all around you
And I'm gone to the moon 
Woo Peter you did do well
All that matters is right now 
And she should've had more friends,
Notice how your every look gives me tingles
The buzz of love is busy buggin' you
And little kids sliding down the steel park slide
And carve the earth without my tools
Then someone's beaten up
But the world was wrong and I was forced to march in line
Gone're the dark clouds that had me blind
Why you staring
But if you pay me, I can play the fool
Yeah, I left my body in a sea of people, and that's just how I'll leave it
Got enough for everyone
Bandages on my legs and my arms from you
Hey brother, do you remember when
Half asleep we are calmly waiting through her night
Like it's nothing and the words are easy
Shout out to the hearts you'll break
If you ever step on my patch
On the handsome fella with umbrella
Singing we'll fight fire with fire, fire with fire, fire with fire
Heard you laughing behind your friend
I'll be the grapes fermented, bottled and served with the table set
Disappointment was my closest friend
Well, there's a few things in this world 
Without you, I'm just miles away
For me to see that  this was something
Like I'm floating, floating, up above that big blue ocean
Rolled a pair of dice in Paris that got me to paradise all safe and sound
I choose to sit here next to you and wave
I really really wanted you to come
I sing about the tide and the ocean surf
All my friends drink alcohol
I wanna be a billionaire so fuckin' bad
Reading fashion mags to look at the girls
And that was all I had to say
I thought the older women would like me if I did
The wind that sweeps the sky clean and lets the sun shine again
I say the same thing twice, I'm awkward when I speak
Pulled the jungle underground
One step back you're leaving it, now it's moving on
For they are breathless over you
We gotta rock the neighborhood
Lock the doors, that's when Ghost just g'd off
With your babies breath
Now, what's cooler than being cool Ice cold
I declare myself
Wait for the dust to settle down around us
We're young enough to say
You can go to the doctor
Is it true looks could kill Is it true looks could kill
Songs about the local news
Tonight we're gonna climb the ladder of a thousand rungs
We gonna party like
And we don't go near the ghetto 'cause they'd shoot our ass
Never ever fall on the pressure
This life can turn a good girl bad
My heart's not made for someone else
'Cause I know you're right here in mine
Too much useless information plays with your head
In your big house on the hill
Imagine if the life that you thought you shared wasn't really there
Hiding in the bedroom
Yeah, I feel so down
Models will smile then tilt their heads back
You get older, and it's over
Still we can make it better throwing all your cares away
'Cause honey I can see him
Lying in bed in the sunrise 
How many times the city making me promises
Gathered up your things and slipped away
My story's infinite
And soon I'll wake up and I'll forget it
How I know your face like the back of my hands
A world record player's on a tour of Japan
Sometimes I'm feeling like I'm going insane
And we'll pray, all damn day, every day,
That was a  a big slash of paint
I smoke bud, get pissy, who could flow with me
I'm scared, I'm not coming down, no no
Happy, happy, happy, happy Bring me down, the love is too high
Gonna love
So if your business is running out
Well if I lived in India, they'd still be Chinese children uh huh
The better things to see in life
You see my shit speak Spanish
With my chick by my side the radio does the trick
He's not your boyfriend
Tell lies, tell dirty lies, tell diggory lies, until you're lying in his bed
Call me over, I trust we lay here, till we must
Bright future, bright pink
Oh, baby, right or wrong
And who you think you are screaming Hollywood burn
Let me put you in the magic position, darling
Who cares that it makes plants grow
Oh yeah, well, 'cause you Ooh, ooh, ooh ooh ooh
That was the only way I knew 'til I met you
You didn't even know my name
Mass romantic fool separated by sheets when the curtain calls you,
I'd still know where I'd want to be
It's , the girls are just friends
I wanna pay her back
I know a movie star, I've got her plastered to my wall
I feel like freaking out,
And though my lack of education hasn't hurt me none
And to my surprise my eyes were wide and already open
You'll always be the one that I want to come home to
Suddenly I see Oh, yeah yeah
A duotone on the wall
That's just how I feel
I'll get real high
I'm on my empty bed
Oh how does it feel to be the one shut out
I've got no one to blame
I don't believe everything I see
And as the tanks roll into town, as the tanks roll into town
Won't you tell me what I need
This love I pray that I can keep
I'm gonna do the things you do
You gave me love, babe
I got some money in my jeans
There'll be love love love wherever you go
Frankly, I let my heavy eyelids flutter
Think about that summer and I bug 'cause I miss it
North of the river all the streets are the same
I think you know, I'll be okay
We're gonna to feel the rush coming over us tonight
Too many regulations coming back at you
Maybe I need a little company
I know it ain't right
Put your wings on me, wings on me
Cause in the evening time she makes me feel all right
The blood of a stone
With everything considered they forget my name
Find that clip I been lookin'
Because of the things you told me, you told me
I didn't even see you coming,
Baby, anything you want me to
All you get is pain
Don't need computer or TV,
Grabbed my bag and kissed my mother
Really, I'll try to get right with myself
Is six feet underground
With everybody watching you
Along the sidewalk
The time has passed me by
There's nothing here to care about
I let my frailty take the wheel
Says he's got a big boat
Will you be my American boy, American boy
We'll get up, to sing some music
As I continue to expand your head is gonna burst
Many windows never locked
Me I ride this cat 'cause its claws have got my eyes,
And if I could reverse it, I don't think that it'd be worth it because I know in my heart I would never let you tumble to the ground
But I don't get disapproving from my girl
Weren't that funny
Ev'rybody's gonna be happy
And I love my friends
Clouds of birds are covering her dark blue sky
And they wouldn't let me sign on
That make life better
The reconstruction had just started
You look so neat
I love the sun, it's your reflection
Because, because
Yeah, I feel again
I think we've turned into a big mistake
He got a needle for a head
You and I buy star maps and ding dong ditch a televangelist
I'd like to take your head, place it
When I'm in your light
What are we Who are they 
I get wired like Western Union and I got to be me
But where have you gone, where have you gone, I'll never know
I put on my new black boots
Play a joyous tune
The high tide could take me so far away
She is Supergirl, Superwoman, Supersexywomannnnn
Sometimes I'd like to slow things down
Nice day for a drive through the city
Ooh, I don't need you now, the seeds are sown
Oh, here I go, dripdrop it way down low
And all our friends are gone
Big feet
How come we're so messed up
Expressing the desires that daren't speak their name
Got peace in my soul
You're tripping over what is wrong and right
I would've died, you never lied 
You'll want to share it with your friends like a poorly rolled joint
Or lose faith in your friends
Give yourself away
The wings are wide, the wings are wide
Neon black branches hanging from the trees
Tonight, maybe we're gonna run
That soak up all the sound
Tonight's the kind of night
Move on to the next one
Feeling feelings unfurl
Oh oh, the ancient commonsense of things
Out on the streets, where I grew up 
And we were back in ' 
In the attic of a house
I have always kept my faith in love
The smiles returning to their faces
I think my mind is gone
'Cause last night I had something so good
The sounds that the bands made, and the melodies is all I need to make me feel free
Well, you were there when the wall came down
When I was alone
Together we will follow
And put your feet back on higher ground
I really love what you've done with your hair oh yeah
The spider resumes the rhythm
Eighteen academy chairs
Soon enough you will come down, come down
I gotta feel like
On the blue sea I'll blend right in
Try and do the things you want,
Listen to the beat beat beat
And the bright light turns to night
Or scarlet begonias or a touch of the blues
May we never be stripped of anything we love, may we grow so gentle, never go mental
And then kiss and stuff till we get dizzy and fall on the bed"
We need it more than the air we breathe
Doesn't matter what she does
And try to look impressed
I love it when you call
Where all my thoughts are found
To lighten up I'm gonna tell 'em that
And I fed false information to the audience
Tried a little bit of moving on, it lasted way too long
In this passenger seat, you put your eyes on me
"Do you remember that day you fell out of my window"
Now your magic is working
When skies are grey, even when there blue
Took a long walk into the woods
I don't know what I knew before
I've gotta get outdoors while the weathers still here
And the room is cold
Baby, just take your time now
I'm not gonna say you don't
Oh, did I give them all
Through looking back you may go blind
Ooh, those girls tend to hide,
When I'm running out of loving
Don't let your worries wash you away
Mon corps ne bouge plus quand j'entends ta voix
And fuck yeah, we can live like this
A prisoner in PVC a minute after three
I woke up in a car
Oh I love you oh
Ever since I was a kid, I've been a brooding basket case
Shimmering travellin' light, echoing love at first sight
But I wonder, Louie, have you got room for me
Over a chairback
When I look at you
The call to arms you likened to a whisper
The palms of my sweaty hands
Like a hula, hula hoop, hula, hula hoop, oh
You'd get a line of coke
Ever fallen in love
'Cause we are a pair of apples
I remember when it poured and you sang to me in summer
And my lips are unhappy without you
So old that that it feels like it is ending
But you say it's okay
Oh, oh oh oh, yeah
Will be accompanied with tips on how to smile
Hey heart on the run again
Just like everyone
A Nolita fairytale Ba da da da da da, Ba da da da da da
Breaks tomorrow
When electric hearts, collide
Speed it up, or if you mean it slow it up a little bit just to speed it back up again
Don't worry about a thing
You got me good
Teacher gets annoyed 
I know that I could never be your man
People tell me not to let myself evolve
And I can hardly relax or even oversleep
Till Your ready to fall
He ain't never had shit, but he had that nine
But anytime you look at me
All the time, all the time
'Cause the world keeps dancing with the paperman
I won't go until you come outside
She's just sitting in her room reading books about UFOs
Residential neighborhood
Stay up get drunk with all your best friends
Load the box and ill pump that shit
Teardrops in his armchair
All this time
Set the perfect stage
Today was the day
Put a penny in the slot and count the swans through a telescope
Just in time
You You You, you, ooh ooh ooh, you
Makin' hairpins outta glass
And I'm no different from the rest
If I locate the fear, talk you through the tangles, can you chase me till you my feet touch the ground And go dancing
But I wake up in fear
The phonebook's been ripped off
All right now
I'm bustin' for the money so I get by 
The night air breathes
Upon a viewpoint in our town
So I thought I'd let you know
We stay young through each other's eyes 
And that unspoken feeling of knowing
I don't care where I'm gonna be
But I don't want to write a love song for the world
All my life I've been fall fall falling apart,
Yeah, yeah, yeah la la la
With all the stars above your eyes
Buzzin' in my head head head
Complains about the world
To The Stage
I wish I lived in the Golden Age, giving it up on the Broadway stage
Are you in the mood for some dude, are you in the mood to be subdued
Esanqoba phakathi e England
Here's wishing you the bluest sky
Hello partner, kiss your name byebye
Oohoohwee, wild night is calling
Yes, since the day we met
You got me feeling drunk and high
But the moment we had, I felt bad
In proud array standing by the bathing
Thin limbed gorgeous green eyes smiling
No sense, slipping away, can you wait for me, love, I want you to stay
You do the whirlwind,
With a helping hand to lend
With nothing but a piece of rope
And stupid words keep falling from my mouth
Remind me how to dance again 
I put the needle on the record and play that song again
You put him right on the X mark
Or take her for a spin around the town
Is this the way to carry on
But you never call at all
Cause everything must belong somewhere
To sheltered from the cold, who really knows
I say yes
Spend his day at the daybreak
Oh yeah, so happy
Hosted by the ladies who lookin' for somethin' to rub
See my life come undone
Prepare for the best and the fastest ride
It's the good times keeping me alive
Did your heart break enough Break enough
Nothing holds a Roman candle to
De du anda blir sta aldrig still
You're so fragile tonight
And nothing else would matter to us so
But one wish, I would grow up big
When there's feelings involved Ah
Yeah, he's got a shot though No, not really
Gotta lot to learn, baby,
We're on our way home
Home is where the heart is
You know I won't forget
Go ahead
At night the fever grows it's pounding, pounding
You only get what you give
"Harry, you're going to be a lawyer some day"
I say, hey momma, hey momma, hey momma, hey momma
And if somebody's going to fake it
How come we're so alone
The ones who told me that I would never win
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
Of all the blackouts I've caused you and me
Then bein' friends will do
What's the point of worryin' about being cool
A sacred night, where we'll watch the fireworks
We shall lie and dream
And all my friends deserted me because you painted me
The clocks go back,
In a momentary lapse of emotion
The bullet some kind of lord and king
You will come down, you'll come down, come down
I grind for the top dollars, fight rotweilers
A pretty train crash to me and I can't care
Woman's whisper Okay children, remember your breathing One, two, three, four
Something so super real
Inside a zoo
Right now my vision is gone, and magic's to blame
'Cause we're all in this together
'Cause every little thing gonna be all right 
And he said, "Oh, boy, you are so pretty,
Even though they look tasteful
And to go back to where I was would just be wrong
Till the radio plays something familiar
'Cause there's no way that I'll sleep when you're near me
Gotta let the feelings show
Up into a highrise block
Go in your pocket pull out your wallet, put it in the air and sing
Love to watch the colors fade
You ain't gotta say it
Oh, yeah Mr Postman
Some people write the books that tenderize their names,
Don't stop me don't stop me
He sometimes likes to spread it out around the floor
Grasshopper greensnake, hold my hand
Baby, you keep my feet on the floor
Oh, yeah
And paddle with both my arms
Think you'll find it's me plus one
Holy rollers roll
'Cause you're two friends I can count on when I'm blue
But now you got to humor, all these fools
Hoping I would see the world with both my eyes
It's something that I can't live without
I'm gonna keep it carefully
In the end they'll be the only ones there
Pull down the mirrors and pull down the walls
She go up in the air, come down in slow motion
The kind of voices she would soon learn to deny
I've got a wild heart
But it's behind your door
It's a fish in a sea of granite
Stay awake to break the habit
And she never told me her name
So precious in your hand
Oh, let all my memories be gone
You're the one
Got to find the reason, reason things went wrong
She won't stop until we stop trying,
It's a matter of fact
Would ooh, baby, make me lose in the storm of the eye
Why do I have to be bored with being foolish and young 
The rest is still unwritten
Ba duba dop ba do, yeah yeah
It's a cool place, and they say it gets colder
Because once we hit the top there's no stopping us, no
Like everyone wants to say I love you to someone on the radio, radio
I'm gonna be the man who's coming home with you
'Cause every little thing gonna be all right
I miss her bed, I lost my head
Another dream about shapeshifting
Don't stop me, don't stop me, don't stop me, don't stop me
Hey remember that time I tried to save a pigeon with a broken wing
Is love
Somewhere there is a happy affair, a ghost of a good mood
A bboomerang
studierst du Medizin
A piece of mine is a lot to ask for
And so peaceful until
Because once we hit the top there's no stopping us, No
If I wanna fly I could fly for freedom Hey
Since we had reason left to smile
I was eating with a good friend
And I feel like I do
Let the world see what you have got
Your heart will attack, even if she falls in love
Please say
A picture of fragility
Come on, come on, check it out
I'm your desire, my intentions are true
It makes my life complete
And these tiresome paper dreams
You can do it yourself, but make your ends known to your means and your lovers
Prom night, oscar night, got all that BS beat
I am just starting over
Sometimes
She is anyway
She'd have to tow the line, she'd have to give it a go
Bad days good fortune, yeah, are things you find
So no one could avoid, 
I just wanted to prove wrong the people in my head
You know I shan't ever stop tonight
And it almost blows my mind
I lit a match, then let it catch
I have seen the world
My feelings have not fallen away
Sends him hurtling back to the mirror of all of his teenager thoughts and fears
Can't play no highschool dance,
Can we forget about it
So the story goes, and so I've heard it said,
I broke my promise on a very sharp rock
Want a garden by the ocean tide
They say I'm too kind and sentimental like you could catch affection
Aged and lifeless is what Yes you'll become Yeah Yeah
Solace and sway of the sheets,
I get the tinglies in a silly place
There's a war on
They said she hadn't done this, she hadn't done that
Oh, no one knows
While you sleep in you car
Baby we were on our way
On, pressing on, all my distress is going, going, gone
In five years time, I might not know you
Get off, get up, you son of pop
And I'm skipping breakfast
But it's gonna take money
But it was a turning point
Eternally will always be
There's gonna come a time when the true scene leaders
Telling me there'll be no next time if I just don't treat you right
Behind your closet door
And the twinkle in your eye
The whole world bang to rights
Said you hate the way they scrape their brakes all over town
The pain ain't gonna stop
And do you feel the same
What will it take to make or break this hint of love
And I'm like "There's no way to say and there's nothing I can do
Cause you got strange powers
Is that what passes for vision these days
Is a real trip
In the city on the streets
And I only wish you someone who can do what I can't
Are you gonna live your life
We are the leaders of the not coming back's
So many motherfuckers wanna down me
You did this to me
But some things never change
Step into the corners, the darker colder corners fit best
Everybody knows you're a liar
You're two friends I can count on when I'm blue
Except for maybe when I think of how I felt that day
oh the silver bridge wearing nothing but a onesie and a veil      
I'm taking my time to make sure you stay
Climbed to the roof to see you if could fly
She was the sweetest thing that you had ever seen
You get so high you can't come down
Far and away whistle delayed delights 
There's something wrong with me, I'm a cuckoo
Do ya, do ya, do ya love me
Maybe we could even get together
Give her a dollar and she'll make you smile
Four letter word just to get me along
I left my baby on the side of the road 
Don't forget me
But she only comes when she's on top
I want to call requests through heating vents
He's on a strike and looking for you
And no one ever signed our stupid country disco band,
It was crime at the time but the laws have changed, yeah
It's silly wrong, but vivid right
Honey pie, come back to me
So Stand Up For the lololololololololololove Oh Oh
Into warm liquid, flowing, blowing glass
We wake up with the sun in our eyes
And all your winter sorrows hang 'em out to dry
And no this won't be a sad song
And very often causes his downfall
I really want to start a conversation
Move to the city,
'Cause I like to be gone most of the time
There ain't nothin' please me more than you
Ain't got the perfect smile, don't turn heads on my street
Oh Stacey, look what you've done
Nobody's business Nobody's business
Playing KISS covers, beautiful and stoned
With peace in my mind
Sais e minerais, evaporar
I'll do my best to keep you, keep you sleepy as the south
Mother Mary heard us approaching her door
Work all day all night tryin' to get fly
But right now, my time is theirs
With all the years I've wasted on you
I know you'll get me, know you'll get me through
Timbaland
Just get you off of my back for a little while
Tell me have you seen the boy
Kickdrum on the basement floor
Buy a brand new semi next door to the Taliban
Lost at sea
I thought about a new destination 
Can't cushion the beats of my heart,
To build a house up on an Oregon hill
Well let them take you next
And I'm sitting here wearing the weight of the world on my shoulders
Inside a perfectly straight line
When they're spittin' in your eye
Things can only get, can only get
So goes the backing track of all the sighs we'd ever sighed
Why am I alive anyway
Purpose is scaring me
Listened when you talked, dad
Then you decide to take a walk by the old school
And reach out your hand and I'll make you mine
You're thinkin' it's the truth
You're the saddle of the world you don't get to know
I don't understand it
Let's go out and feel everything
I'm blowing the day to take a walk in the sun
I went walking in with my mama one day
That's the way it is
And she's seen war
You paid to get in
'Cause baby, I can love you, baby, I can love you 
Ein kleines Rendezvous mit den Geistern
With the moon on my nose 
That I've got your number, son
I see the bare moon
I keep taking everything to be a sign
We should see Never comprehending a race that's long gone by
And freedom can be an empty cup from which everybody want to drink
Can't find the money for your rent
Just leave the epic poem on its yellowed page
Out cruising with their friends
Let it tear us apart
I got good at feeling bad and that's why I'm still here
After all we go through the endless crime
I'm not complaining that it's raining, I'm just saying that I like it a lot
It's just the end of the world
I said I die for you'
I'm only saying that where I come from
But when I look in your eyes
Gimme some time
Oh, honey, ah, sugar, sugar
'Cause you are the light
To stand
'Cause I'm havin' a good time
Ocean man
Let's blow this ugly, ugly, ugly little world
To let you know you're more to me than what I know how to say
With some rolypoly, little batfaced girl
Seems like we traveled for days though we vanish away
Strangers stopping strangers just to shake their hand
Always in love
The chrysalis is breaking and the superego's waking
Dallas, ride wit' a G, and Houston, ride wit' a G
C'mon can you count all the loves that didn�t last
And I walk the night
Oh Stacey look what you've done,
We will get by
I would wait forever, exalted in the scene 
I knew I'd find you in a day or two I knew that I would find you in a day or two
Oh, somewhere over the rainbow
'Cause music is power, it's easily sold
And we're all on our way to the beach
But I can't lie here beside you, beside you
Needs a whole lot more
You missed my eye, I wonder why, I didn't complain
Please God, tell me we're dreaming
Your hands on my cheeks, your shoulder in my mouth
Then take a baton, girl, you better run with it
To die in jamais vu
Everyday I look across the office floor, there you were
Show me that you care
You really got a hold on me
But I want the whole world to celebrate
If you think I wink, I did
Daydreaming, daydreaming into the night
Well, you got whatcha want and whatcha never knew
Don't wave no goodbye
And the stars they all aligned
This is the orchestra, the rhythm and the drum
Last night I ran into my old life
The dirty face of gold
Carpenter and soldier, one on one
Into the fires unknown
You're hurting my eyes
Got they bras and ran through they whole apartment lalalala, lalalalalala
We are skinny dipping underneath the sea
Tell me I'm not mistaken, give me the information I need
I know that you're smiling, baby,
Romantic Piscean seeks angel in disguise
And when you wake up early and the sun is shining,
If you cross the road and a drunk struck you
'cause hopelessly the hope is we have so much to feel good about
It is that flower that you took the time to smell
The way you can cut a rug
And if you say goodbye 
Then we wouldn't have to wait so long
The tree it fell on all the people
My feet run out of ground
Like dreamers do
'Cause they don't know how real love feels
It is the fear inside that you can overcome
Accept your life and what it brings
Carry the people that you hate
Gone, then gone
The next thing I remember, I am walking down the street 
In a tiny, tiny southern Swedish country town
'Cause dumb is back
And wrap yourself around me
Now my dream is slowly coming true
Black shoes, white socks, no uh oh
I said hey call me Mister Fahrenheit
I'm not sure, quite, why we work all day
I'm living every moment, girl, for you 
On an island way too difficult to be stuck in a daze
Ooh, and every time I saw you bleed
Oh yeah, they've been helping us out
I wish that I could break and bend like the world does
Awkward choices with smiles from ear to ear
I can read the writing on the wall
As I hear your voice 
I'm so in love with you, girl, 
You can't have everything
I have five clocks in my life
First thing they teach us, not to give a fuck How I got o
And don't go dragging your name,
And if you don't see yourself in the mirror, forget what you did
Boom boom boom an a bang bang bang
Give the word a chance to say 
Wewewewegotta kick that gangster shit
Wandering alone on the ridge of a coast
All the time, oh all the time
Oh, it's safety dance
And what's with all that shit you're saying; No, you're not interested in this
You want my air
Why don't we runaway,
Dreams really do come true
I'm fine here alone now without you
But still you're doing whatever the man says
Here in your arms
On my mattress I've been drawing a line 
So I said I'm a snowball running
These are the days we'll never forget
I know you'll be the one who'll always remind me
So one thing led to another
Baby it's fact
Flies are in your pea soup baby
Tucked in the woods and out of sight
And we can't be together
These walls don't stand,
Have you considered the way
And said to all those men as she said to me before
It's your money or life, it's alright, it's alright
What's the point in going 'round
In the place we used to start
Say love Say love Say love Say love
One shrunken head from Africa,
In my soul and in my skin
Getting nowhere, sleeping somewhere 
I wish you'd call but I know that you're out tonight
No, none of it's true 'cause I never knew you
You know I know you know you're not the tough guy that I thought you were
Black stone beach and a black death bottle
Soon you will see how life itself 
Bloodied, battered in the dew
And she'll have fun, fun, fun
It's a war on war
We can't makeup for the lost time that we both apologie for
You say stop and I say go, go, go
What's the use in trying, all you get is pain
And the man in the sea's got a millionK
And baby, you'd better believe 
In our blood and in our souls
The biggest fear running through my head
Get out of the office and into the springtime
And we'll stay here until someone falls in their own snare,
This world's trying to swallow me
Oh someday
Happiness, how you get to find
And I stepped outside and smoked myself a J
The scene ends badly, as you might imagine
That you are the one thing that I've got
Like a new religion
Just singin' in the rain
And it'll be love love love all through our bodies
I'll be CtrlAltdeleting your face with no reservations
You got a look that made me think you're cool
Oh you never stop, you just collide
I tried to do handstands for you
It's all about the fact that you're leaving me high and dry
Then I saw her face, now I'm a believer
And the ghost of Carl
There's a party on the rooftop, top of the world
I'm in the mood so baby dance
When I look into your eyes
Will you say goodbye before you leave
In despair with your drugs and your hardcore porn
Whoa, yeah
Now even if you hold yourself
If they ever find out you're not one of their kind
Anybody's title
Let's get set then to go then and let us jet set we'll be like the Jetsons
Yo I want to leave you with this line
Home, yes I am home
Key Largo, Montego, baby why don't we go
All of the world and all of its powers
Told you a thousand times
Then I saw her face
Hey, now, you're an all star
Drawing tiny little pictures of skeletons
Why would I test my faith Oh why would I
The blood keep flowing to your head
Chelsea didn't feel like following the rules
You got me feelin' like a child now
But I would die for you
It's such a shame to ruin this bright
Desmond has a barrow at the marketplace
Well, I would like to hold my little hand
It tastes like metal in my mouth like rusty Listerine
I'm on my way to what I want from this world
I had a dream so big and loud 
And it's wonderful baby, baby, baby, baby, please
But baby don't put out this spark, no
But not together
This opportunity
Heartbeat racing, body losing all control
That was bursting at all the seams
Yes, I know but I must say in my own defense
I'm down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, yeah down, down
I don't think I'll ever see your face again
If I smile with my teeth
Give you all the milk around town
Still I'll take care to see
What else can I say
And he says, "Lets get lost, let them send out alarms"
I walk down the lane
They're an embarrassment, they should be shamed
The party's just begun
Up and down on my legs and my arms from you
Oh, her lips, they really thrill me
That's the way you sip my cup
All the pretty girls on a Saturday night
Even more than I did before
An honest verse of longing
Hey yeah
I must have turned bright red
She gave you everything she had,
Your life's becoming hell
To the jungle, through the night forever
Maryanne, do you remember 
But you don't get me
Straighten up your tie, take the microphone
Chinese homeruns over the backstop 
From the land of the throne
So come on and hold my hand Hold my hand
There's always something in the air
All the girls turn green
See, see, when I rhyme I flow on the beat like piddadowdow
You can hurt, or take heart
Everyday is your birthday
Shut up and dance with me
That's all that really matters when you're living in hate
I've never seen a girl look so good in thickrimmed glasses before
Zero gee and I feel fine
Will have me thinking such filth I'll gouge my eyes
Baby, our love is true
So I asked to see her next week and she told me I could
Cause this shit's just right
Some postman you turned out to be
Me a little more skin it would fulfill my fantasy
What did I do in a past life,
Always sharp and cold, always beautiful
I want someone to carry me
And when I'm eighty years old I'm sitting next to you
Hey man, now I'm really living
And we're back at the end
It's suds and soda, a brain decoder
I will find my niche in your car
Oh, everything's right, said everything's right tonight
To change you baby
When the daylight doesn't ever stay
Steady my heart, it's beating faster
The blue is true
And I twisted it wrong just to make it right
Release them for a while
We could stick around and see this night through
My walls are coming down
Whenever I'm lonely I'll shout out
Betty, I'm a dreamer
Into wine, learning, burning, driven deep into this maze
Red sky creepin'
So I got nothing at all
And allow myself with time
Thought you'd want to hang for a while
O comet come down
For every inch we get we need a mile more
Now you can endure the lies now you can endure the fear
It's gonna be all right
How my heart seemed to leap out of me
The one who let you down
What's a matter babe, are you feelin' sick
They tell us we should really stop
I said we're out to prove the truth of
I need you now at long last
Had gone to sleep
The way you shift your eyes
I know how sweet a kiss could be
Back in the days of depression
Heading for home, you start to roam, then you're in town
Right beside it
Keep dancin around to the joyful sound that the band plays
It's a new start
How will I get one I don't know
Well you keep it warm at night
We've been places like this
Seems the more I gave the less I got
You've fallen down so far,
Pour a little sugar on it, honey
You're halfway till you're fully grown, you've got a real good shot
I'll brace myself for the loneliness
Your girlfriend says you better not,
Anything you said to me was lost in ether overseas
You got your youth, you got a roof over your head
Poppin' a couple of bottles, drink it all and get another round
But now you need time to clear your mind
It cannot wait I'm sure
Everyone's getting ready
I wanna be your girl
Combined with the lightness in my head
Its no way to be
Sergeant sends a letter to five
Cause sad songs about now, well that would just feel wrong
Hey, you, sittin' in your tree
Don't say later 
You're making me feel so fine
Yeah, still you endear me now
I spend with you is the new best day of my life
I had to put it in a song
No matter what you keep repeating
Just breathe in the air and blink in the light
Change the beat fast
So, come on and be my light
A song to you on the radio
Oh no, I say, you got it wrong
You're such a strange girl
A little dream together
I can't let you go now that I got it
Well, it's all right, even if they say you're wrong
More likely coarse and guttural one syllable anglo saxon
Time for another one
Are you gonna live your life wondering
"Man it feels good to feel this way"
Will you still call for me when she falls asleep
As the scions of history guess another mystery wrong
'Cause stories of your brother make my crush high bop
But each time she walks past
Spend my nights and days before
Do you want to fall apart
So come on and take a chance
Now I'm in a familiar place
It's a long way, Nehalem, to let the water in
Time to compromise to occupy the lies
Wednesday, stay with me Thursday
It takes some work to make it work
Do your thing, do you
So your boyfriend has no clue
I'll never, ever, ever, ever, ever gonna let you go
When I lived in Denver, I met a millionaire
And when she's walking, she's looking so fine
You won't regret anything we do
Do you still recall it
For the all time high
Now I wonder what my life is gonna mean if it's gone
It's a wonder this cold comfort
Summertime girls are the kind I like
Das wird dir gut tun
My hands are in the air, yes I'm in love
And I get so sick with the little things
We sure talked a lot 
Oohoohoohoohoohoohooh
I'ma send this one out to the gentlemen's clubs
Pop subculture in mine
We are bound and marching to an ever static distance, static distance
She have the range night, I'm in a benz mornin'
Remember when the days were long
And if God willing we will meet again, someday
Slide it to the right and I roll
That you're getting me to say I'm sorry
Three blues, two greens and a beer
But I will die for my own sins, thanks a lot
Cause you and I we're good together, oh You always get me feeling better
So forget the day
Home is a boxcar and it's so far out of reach
In concert tonight
He's mine
But I love you anyway
It's been beautiful to find this point, I'm sure it will when it ends
The one where you told me you'd love me forever
That I love you baby girl
All the things that come to you
Oh and we oh and we have been waiting for
I can serve sixteen ounces for six and get back ninetysix
Baby, put your name down on a piece of paper
Easily I fall in love
Were still the same
A new pair of boots and a chisel in your name
Those are the best days of my
Tuesday, shoot me in the head
Yeaheyeaheyeaheyeaheyeah, yeah, yeah 
The war it came 
We're back from Bloomington
Tell me what you're waiting for
Well I promise you you'll have your fun fun
To keep my feet from jumping from the ground, dear
Spent the night in someone else's arms
Ohoh, ohoh everybody
If I caught that one
And they think about the night so sweet
Let 'em wonder how we got this far
And do nothing
Well you don't relate to me, no girl
There's space for us to shake, and hey, I like this tune 
And run, run, run, run, run, run 
Until I can see your sweet face
The coolest kid in the neighborhood
Way, way, way, way too long
I've forgotten what it feels like to feel normal
About yourself or your family
Let's come together
Hey boys and girls we want to see what you got, hey
Normally I try to run and I might even want to hide
Oh, I sing but the world can't hear me can't hear me
As I look around me
Should I bend over
Who'll draw the line in the sand
I remember the times that we kissed,
So I'm showin' you the door, wave goodbye
To have a nice day
We're a bull, your ears are just a china shop
Nothing but road could ever give to me
Mmm What are we waiting for
Don't get upset, and now is just the beginning
you're deep in a mine, oooh
When both boy and girl start suddenly shaking inside
And there's a road with a distant glow
In the most unexpected faces, I see changes
I was running from the things that you'd say
To all our love letters
Something I can't define So let's
We're nothing and nothing will help us
In storm we scream against the stream, our eyes watering
I don't want to see a ghost,
You really should revise your dress sense before you walk on by
Cause I'm havin' a good time
In the most unexpected places
She tells Max to stay when the class has gone away 
When we bend the 
My life is my own
Love love
I'd rather be cool than be loved
The open summer breeze will sweep you through the hills
"What's the day What's you doing How's your food How's that song"
Scare up your letters
Just sit back in and stop time
And feel those radio waves flow
And the talk of the town be true
Next stop, Paid In Full posse recruits me
To sing to make you mine
Until I told you it was just fireworks like the fourth of July
Like authors and painters,
Down to the corner
And I read the bible to pass the time
You can have this song I wrote
I wear a coat of feelings and they are loud
'Cause you're a momma's boy, momma's boy
And he turned into a killer
And Brighton's lovely in the Fall
And I'll be dreaming of the day the dream died
We could fake our deaths to get insurance money
If you'll be my bodyguard Oohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohooh
I'll send a dress to you
Tell me why those clear skies so suddenly have changed
My baby, my darling
Then everybody'd be surfin'
I'll be here after midnight, wearing my beliquent frown
And it called that calculation perfect love
Says he's got a big boat but it's just a fairy boat, enough to fit an extra one or two
Oh yeah, there's nothing you can do
Well, I'm a little child
You simply seemed to take your place
It's a new world
Got my mouth,
You think you know me, but you haven't got a clue
On our way back home
I was an angry young man
Things will never look the same
With the spotlight burning a hole
In your light, just when I'm in your light
I stayed in last night
I see Neptunian blues that eyes forgot Eyes forgot
In the smile of the child staring at the TV screen
We're out for beerhunt, look out for our razzia, hands up, hit and run
Come along to bring you the banana splits show
Well, shake it up, baby, now shake it up, baby
We're conjuring the night
Feels so good you're coming home soon
A baby cries
A lopsided grin
Water pouring from her eyes
I'd have to get drunk every night
Yeah, that's a slowrolling country caravan of many sons
Honestly, a single wrong is not enough
Peel the candy crust of my body fake flowers
How do I reach fullfilment
And we're people too
And everybody's coming to say
I don't have diddly squat
And disagree with everyone she knew
And the angry silence that he throws on the floor
Ding dong ding dong ding dong ding donana phone
And let the sunlight in my lap
I happened to stumble upon a chapel last night
So let's screw this one up right
Then please don't go
Mercurially gilded by the sun
Smiles grotesquely in the light of the day
Go, go, baby don't go
As long as Mr Pleasant's alright, hey hey
You should tell your gathering friends
Honey child, you make my day
A sock hop beneath my bed
I got me so down, I got me a headache Headache
Put your weight against the door
Go home and cry to your mama tonight
I sit and meanwhile back
For the longest time
Half asleep we wait till she arrives
No time at all, I followed you into the hall
Darling you'd come home
Stay the way I am today is certainement disaster
If you believe in magic, don't bother to choose
I'll be by your side till the very end
Just say hello to the ground
Oh what a lovely day to have a slice of humble pie
And in the daylight I don't pick up my phone
But hiding at a crowded party
And all the "Ello" and "Ow are 'u"
Frustration, hell, who needs it anyway
Ooh, ooh success ooh, ooh success
For me, I didn't know I was sleeping 
Rolling fog into my room 
And you wonder when you wake up will it be all right
You're a part time lover and a full time friend
I can go where life leads me
Nothing left but pray
Please let's go
Making love to you was never second best
The turtle wished that it could fly 
And when the night has fallen,
Now I'm so bombed out by your paradigm kisses
The Carver and the bends
Chutes and sorrows are over now
Shout out to the dreams you'll chase
Don't look at me, man, I only have ten children Hoo
Things fall apart, I don't know why we bother at all
Where their pretty little blonde has gone
Believe what everyone else tells me is true
This liberty wind in my face
Come on, come on, because everybody's after love
And get down on my knees
Mixed in with light, these are my favorites to dream in the night
All the clouds have silver linings ohohoh, ohohoh
And Jimmy Pop ain't no heiny hobbit gaybe
So I'm standing here so lonely
I gotta get some, baby
Than the person he'd become
And I will pray that those rocks
They got the karma
I can't believe I'm back up in this motherfucker
It was then we sealed to unlock never again
And I will soon be put to rest now
We come and we go
There's nothing here to lose
You say goodbye and I say hello
Just lookin' and playing guitar
The plane has almost landed
Oh, who can take tomorrow
They're stomping their feet
Scotty liked all of the books that I recommended
My great granddaddy fought in Gallipoli
Ooh woa, ooh woa
And I really love the way you turn
Oh, won't you shine, shine on
You, more than anyone, deserve to be happy 
Yo, yo, this ain't the end, this ain't the end
So I've been walking home alone,
Of your Hollywood song
Won't help to hold inside, give a real, give a real, shout out
You carved a path to my heartland
No need to wonder why
She says, "Dad, the wedding's still six months away but I need to practice my dancin'
Chocolate on the boil, steamy windows when we met
Can't stop, can't stop the beat
Who I am, how I ever got here
With eyes closed
Pppeople in the streets
I've got the cure
Baby let's get closer tonight
Ignore them for a little while
Yes please don't ever note me as your friend
But when I look the moment's gone
Daddy, I'm coming home
But life's a slippery slope, regret's the steepest hill
Yowayohwayohwayoh
And we'll throw it away 'cause we don't need anyone
And you can take all the things
It would have worked out so well
For now it conveys a subtle mystery
Happiness hit her like a train on a track
I am delighted
Rely a bit too heavily on alcohol and irony
Recount the night that I first met your mother
I've got nothing to add or contest
No need to be uncalm, 
Fly in the air, comb your hair
'Cause when you're worried, your face will frown
And the world
But your body language is telling me that I'm not to blame
What my heart used to dream of
I know I say it too much
But it's not funny
It's okay to lean over, lean over my way
We get together
For seein' through superhuman vision
I don't even need to see your face
The air is wet
I took out the message and put the bottle down
It's so deep in my daydream
There is only one thing
That's right, now
Your Uncle Walter saw who fired the shots
You make we wanna say
Come home
This is all I have to say
Dogs in the moonlight
And I die trying just to keep myself from kissing you
But it's alright
But here and now this is our time
Because at home they got her smacked
They'll look after your grave
Oh, love was out to get me
Dressed in all your fancy clothes
I say
But let's talk about it
You are making me crazy
But don't you ever lose that light
I say, "Baby, scoot over please"
Won't you knock me on my head
Then groan at the goodness but do you mean not every time
Well life is too short so love the one you got
In history in history yeah
It's getting darker and I know time wasn't meant for us
But my son, she'll only drive it away
Now the colors all melt together
When I look back on what I done
'Cause they're just girls breaking hearts,
I see my body shake, it's tensing up
Girl, you remind me of summertime
And their whisperings fill the night
Still I know want a strangle or a mouth full
To pull these old white sheets from my head
When I think back on all the crap I learned in high school
Talked out, let's have it talked out
Urmanar er all till en afro paus så baby
Well all those times they come and go
And it's morning
Girl's got a love like woe Woe oh oh oh
Ain't nothing in the world like our love dear Yoko
When all I want to do is stay inside 
Come with me Friday, don't say maybe
I get jealous, but I'm too cool to admit it 
We'll all be gone for the summer
I like to keep them in a jar beside,
We keep the party moving till we drink the last drop
Hey this fire it's burnin'
Or retreat to the bottom of the sea
Life is like a rollercoaster
Like we've done for years 
I'm running out of things to say, will you please start talking
You put up with my shit
I can't stop hearing all the singin'
And watch it slowly die
Australia's Narrabeen Inside, outside, USA
Secret lives we have lived inside
And then the fireman rushes in
There is a line I crossed
And his mother isn't growing old gracefully
And it blows my mind
I believe I hear them say
Flyin' down the street again
So wait for me this time
I don't know what it's called or how it goes
And this could be the way for us to change
There's a party going down
I got a dalmatian, and I can still get high
Happy today
Pulled them out they weren't beating
If we play our cards right we can be more than friends
Murmur simmer and I'm feeling slow
arm in arm we are the harmless sociopaths
Up above the world
Shout out to the friends back home
And all of the people come and gone
And you will always have my heart
For you and me a crimson color tree
And after changing everything
Don't let the sun catch you cryin'
Ballpoint pen, mines spinning like a whirlwind
It's the place that I know well
I think I've found my baby
By slight of the hand you will turn them into dust
Well, it's all right, doing the best you can
'Cause it's not the fall that hurts
Every minute I will count
Through water when
And then you say
You could lose your faith in breathing,
What you see is what you get
When they made love he shared the burden of his mind
Windows of chance there, lost on the trail of dissent
The media are getting really good at lying,
I got a woman, way over town
I didn't even let her sneak a touch
I took a wrong turn and ended up in Michigan
I'm seeing hoes sex in the studio bathroom
I'm gonna be the man who's working hard for you
Beat beat beat of the song song
Oh, how she rocks in Keds and tube socks
You don't see me fly into the red  one more you're nuts
And you won't make a sound or be nervous around piles of pictures
To habits that we think suck
If you fled a million miles
I'll just unplug it for today
'Cause I've got the cure
Then I got high 
There is a map in my room on the wall of my room
And I started to shout
I'm pretty sure you have a new girlfriend
Don't let the ladies fool y'all now, fellas
You wanna go for a ride
Two steps closer to the level I imagined 
Baby sometimes, sometimes we don't know why
Gaze into these eyes of blue,
A small story which never happened
And nothing more
I gotta say what's up to Tony Williams
For once I have something
We would hit the town on Friday night
When it's time to get ill
Uh huh I'm cutting your strings and keeping my smile
Don't it feel like sunshine after all
I'm not gonna change till I want to
Then I stopped dreaming now
Anything you know you mean 
From all the bitches the one I wanna be is music
Hey, there's nothing in my art
So many turns that I can't see
I thought I was smart, I thought I was right
It was the worst date of your life
Wire up for the radio
The way it glows, the way it always knows
Ah, hold on, not my fairy tale you're trying to start
You shout and you yell, hi, ho, ho
And the dance music
Come on and show
You never should be lonely
'Cause you're so ooh Tootootoo, so ah Tootootoo, so cool
You know me name
Don't stop me now don't stop me now
That you on your back
Final de semana
We take back everything we said about you
Go on, it's gotta be time
You'll always keep the magic
If you hear him coming, won't you let me flee
You've got a shot though
Paintbynumber morning sky
I've been sleeping with ghosts
I want to live in darkness
I'm gonna loop duplicate my heart into a million songs
Turning away from the high road
Chelsea, Chelsea, I think it's 'bout time
Come on down to the disco, all right, right right right
I really knew you
And if she likes, I'll tell her lies
And asked what the damage was
'Cause your love makes me feel like
And I need you to walk me to the store 
I wanna try, make it right
To get out of town tonight
I'll ride across the park
Come and get it, come and get it now
Close my eyes
I hope we can still be friends
'Cause our lips can touch
Whoa, come on out and make romance
Hello Seattle, I am a manta ray
The room calls to me, says we're all strung out
It's time we take control get down
To say that we will never part
Now there's no place else
I am your love
I took to the desert with your harshest words and they saved me
Some crappy artwork that took too way way long to draw,
Long live rock, be it dead or alive
You're every word
So warn down, so torn up
And that's a slowrolling country caravan of many sons
Stop the car
Being valiantly alone
To groom my face in life and doom
So let's just sip it real slow
But the world just falls away
I'll be shaking at the sight  of  you
Felt the strangest sense of satisfaction
Wake up everyone
Yes, I'm sure you're right
With the record selection
We gonna live like it's the end of the World
I got a house with windows and doors
You stand up with pride
'Cause I thought I'd be living my dream
Come on board, it's a curious sight
Everything you say is right
And I say
C'mon let's make up a dance 
Foundations ripped apart
We can't wait for June
You're the key for winding up my heart
You make me feel like natural man
I could take care of my mom
If you come a little close I'm going to pull your hair
If it's all one in the same thing
When the people in the city aren't the slightest pretty
"You need to let go, you've got no control No"
Baby you'd be saving mine
Am I a disappointment
I wait for you I promise you I will
Somewhere back there I left my worries all behind;
And I've seen blue
Let all my memories be gone
Now he's back and he'll tell us what
Everything I can arrange
No matter how you try and disable it, yes, I'll still be here
I guess when it comes down to it
And you're the sun that shines down upon me
And just like the guy whose feet are too big for his bed
If you get deep, you'll touch my mind
Especially in the night time
It is the air you breathe, the element, the fire
The sky caves in
Take a good look
Ingen stoppar var chans
Crushed all I can then I crushed your hand
You get me freaked freaked freaked on Preakness
From the pouring rain
We got everything you need
Of every head he's had the pleasure to know
Start a brand new colony
Hear the bells are ringing joyful and triumphant and
There's a one foot boy eleven stone
And my mother laughed the way some ladies do
That you may reasonably require
There's nothing you can do that can't be done
And it doesn't seem to mean anything
They stumbled and wavered, but caught me a saviour
Alguns dizem que mais alto que um furacão rhéum
Just let my do my thing
If you ain't ever been to the suburbs, don't you ever come to the suburbs,
Woke up in London yesterday
She looked me over
MoneyGrabber
Something so undefined
Oh, what a lonely night
They slipped me the blood in the whole of the vial
It's the season
It's true you're my love, whoaohohoh
And she has to wash her hair
Sacrificed his life to bring us both eye to eye
You were racing in a car
You say the words will get there soon
Stacy's singing at the same time
You've got to have eyes in the back of your head
Ills, man kills
Let the song be sung to teach us
While you're waiting like a factory line
I can feel the summer sending signs of fall
That's why I'm singing baby don't worry
That I'm ready to hold you now, hold you now
I have done all I can do in this town
Half past one on the dancefloor,
Don't think, don't talk
Around Of memories I've made
Into the arms of 
But just remember who you are
But we didn't make a sound
Time I pressed my lips against yours
For all those nights and days you spent hanging out
Of lonely creatures singing for the summer rain
Of the little things
Words just aren't right
Something tells me I'm into something
Just leap don't look
Nothing is ever quite the same, really
Sooner than later, sooner or later
And even with the lights out, we'll glow
The ground control couldn't stop them
It's, er, gettin' larger
But how much, baby, do we really need
He said "listen to me boys, this will be last one of these,
Oh say wouldn't it be nice to know right now that we'll be
Don't wanna hear you say mayheyheybe Do ya love me 'cause I wanna know
Maybe you could break my heart next summer
I'm starting to drift away
SSayin' words like I love you
And surprised by the rain
It's so far away but I've planned a date
I bet ya been goin' around town lyin'
You remind me of a few of my famous friends
Waves of light are travelling
Floating down the stream of time 
I'm not the girl that you remember from the start
'Cause I'm looking up at the ceiling, but it's turning into the floor
But there's people in the floorboards said the mouse
Hooray, O'Malley, run
But I know that I don't wanna wait anymore
Lies, lies and propaganda
I kiss you all starryeyed, my body's swinging from sidetoside
But they locked all the barn doors
Now they want us to surrender
It was something you did
Rosetinted view 
Sometimes it rains, sometimes it pours
Wake up in a hotel room
But I can't find anything sweeter
She says, "I've got two tickets to Iron Maiden, baby
Oh and our good time starts and end without dollar one to spend
The minute that I saw your face
We'll share the shelter of my single bed
Fortune depends on the tone of your voice
Or a fitted sheet for Christmas bed
But as long as I can't get into Carnegie Hall
It's gonna take me home to you
It's gonna take plenty of money
I never knew you don't give up on me
No love in front of me
Don't want to end up a cartoon
When you're done
So far away from real
In the good and the bad books that I have read
We'll make it count like the best one we ever had
And it's mostly pretty nice, yeah it's mostly pretty alright
But now you are all I see
Well, I couldn't say
It's a shame that, did they get you they got you
I've been so damned tired
I put one foot in front of the other one
You looked at me, that's all you had to do
Sometimes dreams are all you got to keep you going when the day gets long
I can see that in the back of my mind
Shshake it
I know you feel deprived you don't trust me
Hone in on the buzz in ways you could not
Oh Saint Jerome
Not to accept eternal life
It all comes back to you, you're bound to get what you deserve
The sun's got my shine
Loaded words and loaded friends
And I keep on forgetting myself
If you want some more then she's fast asleep
We'll find out I'm told, my mother she told me so
And I need you to sit me on your lap 
He feels the
And tonight I'm telling you honestly
I'm ringing all the warning bells 
Coming clear beneath the clouds
And think of what the others say
Tell me that you need me
Don't close your eyes 'cause your future's ready to shine
Everybody, just hold hands
So far away
I's the radio that tells me so
And the sky is a bluish grey
We are thick as thieves 
There's a light inside of you
Baby's got a praise like a willow in the wind
Shysters live from scheme to scheme, but my th quarter pipe dreams
Don't wanna be alone
'Cause she walks looks and drives like an ace now
The past is gone, it's all been said
Who said "A Genii made me out of the earth's skin"
I need you to be here with me
Got nothin' in my brain
Real sugar, I don't wonna climb the walls
Honestly, I just don't, I just don't, I just don't
Singing, someday it'll bring me back to you, yeah
Whether you live or die
On a Sunday morning
The ride was short but my thoughts were long
Trying to throw this away
Moments away, Moments away
Oh yeah yeah 
But I still want more, with the cuts and the bruises
All I did for you
I wanna be your thing, your anything your everything oh yeah
When she knew she had been bad
Had all of my history
I couldn't tell us apart
I'm having a ball, don't stop me now
'Cause I feel like such an insomniac
When her heart kindles next to mine
But the sunlight's creeping in
Everything seems to look as it should
We came here to rock the microphone
Kids in the streets yeah they're all getting high
We got no penny, no pound
Take me to where your sister lives
I'm gonna make a supersonic man of you
Back when I was still
Look at all the people, happy faces all around
I've been waiting to smile, 'ay
I know they're easy words to say
Nothing too big or small
You can see through, you can see the way
Joey never met a bike that he didn't wanna ride
To hide my hope from this scissor strain
From my head to the
I can't stand by the side
Can I get get get to know knknow know you better, baby
So come on everybody let's rock this break
Is there a hand to take hold of the scene
You've got me to worry about tonight
Intensively she's aware,
Then we should be ok, and we won't get in a muddle
I tossed and turned all night
Negates the pains I went through to avoid you
You say you've seen seven wonders
'Cause it's ok if you don't know everything
It really is dark out here
I got a habit just to drive, gettin' head and I roam
Scared of spiders, scared of flying
This doesn't have to end in tragedy
And I can tell I'm her kind of guy
Love will fall around my door and
Keep on lifting me your love keeps lifting me
When every morning longed to fall
If anyone can make me a better person you could
You get old, I have
Pop and lock together, ZZt brrt zzt brrt
You don't even know girl
All I wanna be, yeah all I ever wanna be, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Wonders how you manage to feed the rest
Say goodbye to my heart tonight
My troubles drift away
Alcoholic and very bitter
Why don't you just roll away
A punchbowl argument
Uh, my name is ho, yo
As long as I'm your girl
But it takes you years to know what love is
All the things in only on the screen
It's the sell out show that no one wants to go to, yeah 
It's pointing to Heaven 
My exman brought his new girlfriend
Hey ah midnight cowboy
And if I had to die today
Snow still fall as beautiful
You always told me life's a dam that breaks, well, here it comes
My time x
Give up all awkward tomorrows
Summer, winter, scat and spring
Life in this town makes it hard to see
And time stands still
Oohoohoohoohooh oohoohoohoohoohoohooh
He had money for the truth
How in the world you gonna see
It's at some motherfucking disco 
We're getting high, but we're still feeling down
Went home and buried her love tonight
Mr Postman
And you don't know how it feels to be alive
Mom and Dad are out of town all week,
And you feel like there's no pretend for you
We're taking our turn with the kids that don't learn
And the shapes of your hands do tell of such a rare variety
I'm gonna lay right down here in the grass
They said farewell
I used to sit next to you at school
Longing for the old fecundity of my homeland
Get the hell out it's my night
You are driving me frantic
I got the money but I need it for my dealer today"
If you hear him coming, won't you say for me
Love's sweet pain
If she isn't screaming, she doesn't belong inside
It carries on till you crawl
And we'll stir the stars around
Another monkey in the mail could make me lose my mind
I want you by my side
There's one more thing, I got the pink slip, daddy
I'll be a lighter of fires 
In a man
To put in my songs of love 
Do you really love me tell me
This is my time
My friend the communist 
Gimme the love of an orchestra x
We need to fetch back the time
That you give me no reason, you know you're making me work so hard
Little kids can't play with things that have died
Now once, I was downhearted
Listen to my car
We could feel alive
That your love, that your love can heal
Early in the morning clouds are dropping on my head
And on the days I stayed in bed I sang and sang and sang
While there is time
The walls are closin' in but that's okay
I'm telling you from the heart
To spend my time missing you
I've gotta find out all the things
Or let the paranoia haunt you Haunt you
The ghost said, "Take off both your shoes
And as time goes by we get a little bit tired waking and baked another Marlboro mile wide
All the things I wanna say 
I feel the need to go
With the lights blinding and my heart weighed down
Swim to the biggest flower there
And I say, rocking in the dance hall, moving with you
Not just who I am but the pink in golden land
I told you that, I told you that I loved ya
Both can't be right
If it's true looks could kill and you will be the first to make me mad
The lonewishin' condition
Sleeping in until your father's shaking you down
But say goodbye to everyone
What makes you think you're something special when you smile
Everyday, it's agettin' closer
I'm on my way from misery to happiness today
Don't say next time 
And if you're looking for a boy with a voice, well baby I'm single
The footprints over the snow
Why don't you leave me alone
And fur on the floor
Running wild, but always in control
Star light has what you need
And run in little circles till circles are
Ever been to heaven at night to heaven at night
We gotta
Responsible for what I say 
She was in the habit of reapplying makeup
Can really break it down
Like Peter Pan up in the sky
Seven years of river walkways
You don't need eyes to see
My sunshine If you steal my sunshine
We'll start over again
Rroom boom boom boom boom boom
All of these spirit voices rule the night
Well I think that love has found me
Their prayers fall upon deaf ears,
Oh Alfie get up it's a brand new day
'Cause I found some kind of fairytale
If one thing I know, I'll fall but I'll grow
Hoping and praying you'll wait for me
Love the way it falls about your face
Know that I been waiting for so long,
Soon they're gunna know
Wanna run away
I'm not going out tonight 'cause I don't want to go
Baby, please don't go to far
Still I'm the only one who seems to care
Don't wave no goodbye Don't wave bye
Helicopter, helicopter let your long rope down
I'll take care of you tonight
Who cares that it makes breezes
Run, baby, run, don't ever look back
Is this the end
Who could say things that 
It's haunting every breath we take
Under the powers of an evil doctor rocket science monster with capabilities to destroy the entire universe
To put the pin back in the grenade
Your voice rings like a bell anyway
I've Got Baggage Too
Oh yeah, you know it
And I'm really gonna spend it right
And we save our money in good faith
When I'm crashed and got parts to repair
I've never seen two friends like them
Another chromed out gat
Someone tell me how I feel
My prediction imma be on the top of the world
And wait to be called
We traveled all night
Electricity
Waste my days Whoaoh, whoaoh
But love is nothing you can tax
And then characters will come to you
He might be nursing a broken heart
Suspense controlling my mind
Let's fly let's fly
You've been down but you been feeling itchy
So many things ignored
Glad to see you comin' I got nothin' to hide
Where, where is the town
Say you know my face like the back of your hands
Please stay for a while now
In the satin air
Those are the best days of my life
You've got to burn baby burn
Steady my hands, this one can turn around
You worry on your mental health
Qui vivent la guitare à la main, du soir au matin"
Lookin' shy, you caught my eye
Now I can't get out of bed
About everything
Say your piece and get out
It's gone away
Don't let it fade
I don't believe in no heaven I just hope that I'm wrong
You rubbed an ice cube on my chest
Ba dadada da da, feelin' groovy
Yeah, what do you think she got up to last night
I'm on my way now
Yes I'm certain that it happens all the time
Chances abound, we'd be standing our ground
You trouble me for money 'cause you've got to make a drug call 
But way down underneath
Only place I know I feel safe, I'm gonna call this home
Hopelessly I feel like the window closes oh so quick
But I won't get me down
I just get better with time
You've been my best friend
I promise to make it worth your while
Sorry I couldn't be there, I was tied to a rocking chair 
It's the time it takes to blow away
Will you still need me, will you still feed me
The colors are bright
To a place you and I
And everybody clap your hands and shout
Uh huh gon' forward move, gon' buy me some time
And when it starts getting blurry
I got a degree
Fifth time in your bedroom
You might have moved on but girl you should know
But I don't know her address; I wade downstairs
You like cartoons I'll make your heart melt
Dug a whole was so fun
Lot of bottles and a lot of booty cocktails
I fell in love
And the black and blue body from the weekend fights
'Cause, here's proof, we have suntans
You say, baby, I only want to make you happy
Reign of love on my knees go praying
All you gotta do
I'm gonna marry you out of common sense
She knows she's losing it, oh yeah she's losing it
Give me that thing
People are wasteful, they waste all the food
Pay the camel back, back,
But fair is fair, if my segments get separated
Got my back,
My chest suggest I am a man
And let's agree there's no need, no more talk of money
Oh deary me
And I can't breathe
Outside it was pouring
With all our dignity just in place
I was singing this song about you
Whenever I want you around, yeah
Girl don't you walk out
If you want you should move away"
Won't somebody stop me
We can make love not war, and live with peace in our hearts
The illusion of fun
When you drink with your buddies on the weekend
Gonna make, gonna make, gonna make, gonna make it, make it, make it mine
So don't you worry 'bout a thing
Starting something
He says times like these I don't want to be a superstar
And when I make up my mind
Yeah this is a feeling I'm not used to
California, a place they say glistens gold
Getting off the train
To the meadow in the mountain where we counted every falling star
To sing the world goodbye
I want you To fill my little world,
We can dance, we can dance, everybody look at your hands Look at your hands, yeah
Yeah, some people try and treat me like a man 
Blessed is this life oh, and I'm gonna celebrate being alive
Oohoohhoohooooh oohoohoohoohoohoohooh
The morning
No career plans 'cause you won't go far
Like a bird in a cage
The sweat rolls down your thigh
Bruno Mars
Then what are we so afraid of
And these are the days
Like a ghost town, I've found
She's got a secret and she wants to tell
The mean little people are such a bore
Mmhm, you're my little girl
Lock yourself indoors and plan a getaway
I'll be yours and you'll be mine
If lies divide to the end, we've got to make it
Said don't worry about a thing ya know your path is true
How does it feel
I have no reason to run;
If you brought a big brown bag of them home
Him hangin' 'round around you
Uh, and Jon Brion on the keys right now
Like he's someone who's lost his way
I say girl
And, I felt like there were two days missing
I been bummin' around this old town for way too long
I'm afraid of the dark,
Still I kept the sight of my desire
And when I ask you to be mine
Concentration slip away
You know that you're cutting ties when you cut in town;
Next time, if you think of it
You can raise everything to the ground
Well, well, well you Ooh, ooh, ooh ooh ooh
Y lloras de emoción oyendo un bandoneón 
It's gonna be everything you've ever dreamed
And people don't rely on the traffic lights, they don't believe in lights
Is taking my hand
Because I'm faking my own suicide
Break my bones but you won't see me fall, oh
We stumbled towards them
People lie, people hide
Only told to stay away
Slow down and think of your heart
Then we follow the sky with the eye
Yes, do you believe what he says
And know I could choose to let it grow
Don't let them tell no lies
That I will love her
And you breathin' in
Your love makes me feel like
Make it a nice place
Owl eyes her sun will rise and light the land
Breaking hearts to make the papers
I act as one
Life, yeah that's city life, yeah that's city life, yeah that's city life
And though some days still take forever I can't disagree
There is no need to be afraid
And let you know
If I pretend that nothin' ever went wrong
You be dancing, leave me asking you for more
With a heart of gold and arms to fall into
DDDo you love me
We don't get down
Oh it hurts to look in your eyes
Gotta go to work before it gets too late
I must stay deep, 'cause talk is cheap
You get so high that you can't come down
You and I go shopping and fall asleep inside the mattress store
I can humiliate myself to your face
oh arm in arm we are the harmless sociopaths 
Move outta' the way man, domdee
This boy has broke down
Yeah, baby
But you still sing
I know I'm in love
I feel as if I'm wastin'
Summer in winter
No don't say then 
No one else but you and I
Because you made me think about the times
Heartbreak comes rollin' in like a storm, sooner or later
Look again, rock is dead, rock is dead, rock is dead
This world keeps spinning and there's no time to waste
You look like David Bowie
But our feet never missed a beat,
Don't let them control your life, that's just how I feel
Cause you got a lot to tell me
Put on your hard hats and invisible gloves
Drank the tears from those who cried
'Cause when I'm here I'm always something
The tractortrailor driver radios
And I'm gonna want a girl that I know I can take home
I can't get enough of you, baby
The smokestack spitting black soot into the sooty sky
With the burning flesh of men
She's got super human thighs
Ain't nobody's business
As long as one and one is two
Oh, it's a picture of perfection
Two of us sending postcards
No one but you, you babynobody but you
To taking all your time
It feels like ten thousand nights of thunder
They don't sound like they did
I can only think it must be love
Take your shoes off, man
The day away
In darkness, she is all I see 
I called ya, I called ya, I called ya but you did not look around, yeah, yeah
You can cough in his face
I've got your letter I've got your letter, you've got my song
We'll have butterflies soon, 
It's the way my heart beats
And yeah, I'll be in a whole new tax bracket
I wish we had one more kiss
So we could die in it and die in it and die
I find it funny that you never even knew
She seemed like an alright girl
I got my personal health to deal with
Every location is mine
Do you know the reasons, did you wonder why
'Cause, I'm never gonna stop the rain by complaining
Money can't buy you back the love that you had then
You turned it on
Friends laugh together, Ha Ha Ha Ha
If I should call you up, invest a dime
Lost control, hit a wall
And you can love anyone
Tryin' to find the friends inside my head
I gotta get some soul I gotta get some feelin' 
That you can't define all the ways to say
Yeah, baby, you got me
Don't leave me in the dark, no
Care to see my reason
With just one more day one more day
You want a war You're old, you go
Shall we stop, let's stop
Slide up around the belly, face down on the mattress
Sleep away the day if you want to
You have so many relationships in this life
And far too early in the daytime,
Got my neck, got my boobs
Then I couldn't love but now I can
Cro war nur Tarnung, oh nenn' mich Carlo
In a second she knew,
I need you like the dragonfly's wings need the wind
And their tiny little hands
Flashing light, oh what a night
And the boys do the boogiewoogie on the corner of the street
Half way through the night can we talk and see 
Gotta love that afro hairdo
Be my head, and I'll be yours x
I loved you then and I love you now, oh yeah
Now we're dancing, dancing, dancing with no music
I was counting the trees
Is there trouble between the lines
Having the time of my life
Well it all keeps spinning spinning round and round and
Run around in circles all day long
We're shining bright and I want you, I want you to know
But baby, I'm the one who has the key
Why do you think you won't get none
Clap our hands and stomp our feet or something,
Leave those bad ideas in your troubled head today
Uh huh gon' work all day, work all night
No need to fantasize
And it's all flailing limbs at the front line
And that's got to be the way it is
I cannot find the way out of here
Devil take your money
I drew a smile on my face to paper over me
My baby don't mess around
Gave my middle finger a brand new start
I can shine my light on you
Age fourteen, they got you down on your knees
Always on the movewe heard that business will boom if some people are removed
I'll take it back
And now I'm feeling high
Then a nice man said he'd help her
We're the outsiders
Girl's got a love like woe Woe oh oh oh
And the beats my heart missed,
See, I lost my clothes, I'm skinnydipping
Well, you'd better get out of his way
From being my daddy's sperm to being packed in an urn 
City sounds are floating around
Throughout the world
And I can't hold what's in my hand
It don't matter if you're by my side At the end of the line
'Cause now how could I forget what she left
Don't panic, panic, don't act too manic, manic
Oh happy birthday, little Lisa
Hommage à Venice
But when them boys from out of town 
So come on and save this one in a photograph
On a river of red red wine
Starts to give, every single day
I said I die for you
'Cause the girls playin' beer pong in the back
I feel like a ghost, I've got the skeleton face
Just for tonight
I'll write you a letter that you'll keep
Tell my friends I'll be around 
We're eye to eye 
If you knew my story word for word
But for fifteen minutes or so
Woke up late one Thursday
I said, "Son you've got a full blown case of what is known as jellybones"
Thinking 'bout a way to get you off my mind
Maxine, put your red shoes on
A pretty girl
A hand over my mouth
Can you turn me off for just a second, please
And I bet everybody here
Will cast down things
When you look into her eyes
Rocking in the dance hall moving with you
"Do you really think she will wait for you"
If you could take all the love without giving any back 
And it's wonderful baby, baby, baby, baby
'Cause life long cracks
Maybe you should kiss someone nice
He's the killer of retentative lies
There's Nothing To Know
Come into my heart
You were born to love this scene 
Without makeup, without clothes
Yeah, I need you to help and comb my hair 
Something like Voltron
Feel mighty fine, girl
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
You're my favourite book
Take a chachachachance birthday
Are outside the lines
I'm sitting on my doorstep
I can almost make out the surface
Whatever weird way my mind goes
Missed my ride home, lost my iPhone
Because I'm afraid to try
How a life can move from the darkness
As light as the birds
I got you on I got you on
So Stand Up For the lololololololololololove Yeah
'Cause I can feel it,
I'm just trying to make you mine 
If there's something inside that you wanna say 
Don't try to work it out 
Spending time
Self addressed stamped envelope stuffed with your own death letter
It takes a night to make it dawn
That I get
And sing that old song, how does it go 
She wasn't asking anything
And those are the times you need love
Tuesday's grey and Wednesday too
She tellin' the same old story to everyone that she knows
I found my soldier girl
And so will all your fears
A superstar
All in a line we go, we will
But just when you think you've had enough and your dreams come true
As their shackles hit the ground
And it's so funny, so funny to see
Turn up your radio
Ooh, ooh
In the beginning I misunderstood 
When you're young you get sad
When I got up all the blood to my head
Had room for two
Sweetheart I'm telling you
Bending reason
But tears won't make any room for more
I'm gonna run like I'm seventeen, forever
Take off the mask let it all collapse
Turn up my symphony, man
And then you stop
And you're not a man who can understand anyone but you
If he knew what I knew
Now walk with me, walk with me, keep up for sure
Lay your flowers at my door
Oregon girl with your lips and curls;
Rainbow colors in my hair
Others sang your life
Can I get get get to know knknow know you better, baby Yeah Yeah Yeah x
Girl you will believe in love
Gone, gone
I believe I believe someone's watching over me
Longer than the road
I never did what you said that I did when I was gone for so long
Change these rivers in my veins
How this night is gonna be
And it's some kind of wonderful
So with the combination of my gift with one liners
Bring it on, here we are, win or lose, win or lose
What makes gold look like rust
Like some everlasting onion peeled by love
Oh, but there's no need to play with my heart
The streets won't be so plastic
When the days come and gone
Just bend
I just got a warning and I know and I know
Tempted just to make an ugly scene
Not music I'm told to like
You I will Will rise will rise Above above The room
And you've come around
Cold cold water, bring me 'round
You could be home, with Oprah Winfrey
No I won't sleep tonight
We do as we please, yeah 
And you'll say don't you worry your pretty little mind
Waking up in the midday sun
With the sound of your world
Another day in June, we'll pick  for football Pick  for football
There is still a bit of your skin
It cannot wait, I'm yours
If I could change your mind change your mind
They're all waiting here for me
Built to scan the deeps of outer space
If I could make you my own, I have my days
But nothing ever happens and I wonder
It's just the way we feel Come on
They've got violence, wars and killing too
You're drying up my bed
I power on hard and I check my messages
Leave a little room for some naiveté
I kiss you and I know
Girl, I say, if only life would lean our way,
Fall into the wrong hands
You tuck me in just like a child now
Or you're liable to get licked
When the world is on your shoulders
You tore away my shirt
Wanna come over tonight
You know that feeling you get
oh the calcium mines you buried deep in your chest
We get it almost every night
Did I hit you in the proper place
And I give love to a lover quite deserving of it
Now the clock is striking one
Down by the bur oak tree, I had lost your locket in the loam
Bandages bandages bandages
Go to bed, you sleepyhead
And it's byebye, goodbye I tried
In the most unexpected places, I see changes
But I look at the lovers
I remember watchin'
My own little world is what I deserve
It's the word, love
I won't live without it, I won't let it go
And what did you forget
I say we're out to blow the trumpet
I'm balancing on one fine wire
My girl, she know what to do
To see you eat in the middle of the night
The crust of a tan man imbibed by the sand
What do you see when you turn out the light
You can stand out, with a hand out, but nobody give a fuck
'Cause I'm feeling kinda good
And that is why we'll always make it
We are not what you think we are, we are
Put two and two together and a little bad weather
Well, it's all right, every day is Judgment Day
I'll surrender, 
The city's changing
In summer the bushfires rage and rage
And I'd never make it through without you around
I can't tell night from day
These silly days, but we got it made
Baby, look at me with those eyes of grey
And a hardcore life 
Where will we be when we've come undone Just a simple meeting of the minds
The place and the time where we knew that things would go wrong
You want some bourbon for the pain
Sing it to the world World, babe
You better believe I'll be down by your shoes
So I thought that must be a way
And I never knew her real name
One of these days
That makes you wanna dance  don't it make you wanna dance
When I sail back home to you
I saw a man
I'll find the things they say just can't be found
But it didn't make her happy
And what kind of God would serve this 
Hit the ground running, it's all over and been done
Like a shooting star, he shines
Into this life we're born
So won't you please come home
I've been a river bed, I tried to salt the wound
Could we baby, honey try to put it right this time
I couldn't even see the floor
Love isn't borrowed, we aren't promised tomorrow
Redirected some of my anger towards the mother ship
They say you gotta lose a couple fights to win
For falling like a spiny feather the tears begin to cry
Swore upon the sun I'd save you for a rainy day
Then I can't remember caring for an hour or so
And if you find a new way
Tuesday, Wednesday, break my heart
But I'm not alone
If you'll be my bodyguard
Can you tell me what you see whenever you look around
Ooh Our friends all say goodbye
And makes the world taste good
Ooh, don't pull it's legs They're pulled
But you know we're all tied, one to one
'Cause you're leaving and I won't know how it ends
Say hello to feelings that I detest
Some people say such awful things
I go up to my room and there's girls on the ceiling
Can't you see me wavin' I'm flaggin' a ride
And had you gone, you knew in time
Oh just remember the telephones
He is decked by a Japanese geisha with a garland of pearls
I thought love was more or less a given thing
I've been looking for a way out
Maybe we were born to love each other
Nothing new for me
To break in these bones
I heard it also rained in Tallahassee
The way you look like you do
Of thoughts and dreams that scatter
So turn the lights off
Sing it out loud, gonna get back honey
But when I get enough
You don't mind the taking girl, but you don't know how to give
Let me be the one to lift your heart up and save your life,
Dance my way I gotta
We'd fry our brains
In the middle of the night I call your name
You don't dream for me
It's a long way now through the deadroads in our hometown
Let us be free, let us sing songs along
After all the things you put me through
I want you by my side
Let me just say
Don't look back on life man and only see tragic
This will turn into something else, something else
And we can climb its way
And we're treading water now
I said baby, you're amazing
A baby king with a grown man's crown
You are over dramatising
I had a dream that I had to drive to Madison
We've come so close yet so far away
You were there up in my room
I hope that someday I'll see without these frames
Here is that rainbow I've been praying for
There ain't no hope for coming back
Well, in the waiting room while waiting for news of you, 
And I cannot help but ignore the people staring at my scars
I think I'm on the edge of something new with you
One stop to the rhythm that divides you
The ABC's we all must face
Give it time, it's worth the ride
I know a drugstore cowgirl
Can't think of anything better to do
Ain't got any money left to blow
You must get lonely No
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Problems at work
The aria is bleeding and the boyish voice is leaving
To friends it brings a happiness
Underneath the tropical sun
One day like this a year would see me right And only now I see the light
Show some mercy today
I can't feel anything at all
The last time you look me in the eyes
I get too tired after midday, lately
Disco lights and a glint in the eye of
Say the word and be like me 
So lovely
Here is the place where
Everyone's got a combination
And were there more than  hours in a day
Come up and fetch you, saved up for the train fare money,
Well, I feel just like I do when I'm with you
Helicopter has taken to breaking this dreaming spell
Sunk in the midnight shade
Walk my bare feet Walk my bare feet
Though I know you'll never make the call
But wounds heal and tears dry and cracks they don't show
You don't need no memory
Won't change how I feel today 
Wasted days
And I don't talk much, shoot straight
Now I can't walk in a vacuum, I feel ugly, feel my pores
All these colours
Would send you my way
We'll keep on moving anyway
New yellow lines that I earned
A track fiend and the saw dust
Then you said Stop it Ça suffit 
We'll turn up the heat as we burn up you boxes
The two drunk kids, trying to figure out which way was home
You hold me tight
Aw you've got flaws
Seconds today
I put the needle on the record
Baby, I can love you, baby, I can love you better
And soon it would come into focus
I never tried to hold you tight until you left me now
'Cause when I skating with my friends
I just hope I'm not alone
Oh anyway, it's looking like a beautiful day
Before they put us in a coffin I've got things to say
All right now, fellas Yeah
Till I was stung dead
There's no one else
And I fall in love every day and I feel like a fool
Trying to get my self to bed
We just sold out all the floor seats
I'm far away
And I need you to heal me when I'm sore 
I was kidnapped real young by the sweet taste of love
It would take a left wing Robin Hood to pay for school
Should I choose not to run
It's been a really, really messed up week
I know I'm always drunk as drunk can be
It's suds and soda, a smile decoder
More than  he's my friend, it's nothing
I need this now
A pinata pops, this has gotta stop
Most of the time it's misery but there's some joy at the start
You're not homecoming king
But I need to find it
I haven't seen you in forever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, baby
Mystical forces are circling me, while perfect nostalgia is dating the enemy
Let's do loneliness in style
Burns my feet as they touch the ground
We heard that's what you are into
And it's all about the days you spend
I learned how to keep my head 
Good morning, good morning, good
But, when I let you down,
I remember those two letters
Don't wanna be a loner
How the music can free her whenever it starts
Good news will work its way to all them plans
Look into their eyes and you suddenly know
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off you got to
You've made me yours, with your lovely cures
I know there's a time and a place where you can call the shots but it's not here
Is a map of the world
And the whole wide world is on your side, hey hey
You might find some fools at your doorstep
On a partially cloudy afternoon
An easy girl to hold
Dansa pa scenen och dansa i publiken dansa for rappet
'Cause I know that you wanna dance
It ain't nobody's business
And you've got
Sometimes I just can't explain
You're making something out of nothing
Who came up through a steely sea
When I come home When I come home, oh, I know I'm gonna be
Use your life, you'll know you are
On the underground
Living without life
Now nothing is sacred
Two kids, a dog, and then the cautionary wife
I just came to say hello 
Excuse me, what is your name
You never walk alone
Some of us have to got live as well, you know
Like hot water  in my tea cup
What d'you say
When I saw you behind the corner you asked me
Oh think it over baby
The solemn warmth you feel inside of you
There's love
The things that we don't see
Drinking stolen gin from the rich people's bar next door
Quarter to two on the dancefloor,
Slip away discreetly
I'll walk in that room and see your eyes opened so wide
Here's to all the pretty words
All these reasons too hard to explain
Sip after sip, yeah I swear I can feel it
I'll put a bullet in my head
Inside I'm burning
I've got soulful days to counter evil ways
Don't give me no head rush in the morning
When there's no one watching
Do you care what I am thinking
I figured it'd take 'em too long to look up and besides
Take a good look; you're bound to see
I left the people that do
A knock comes on the door 
Leave the whimpering dog in his cold kennel
Will only bring you years of fear
If this is what we've got, then what we've got is gold
You were dressed like a punk, but you were too young to remember
It's ok if you don't know everything
Intimacy becomes intensity
Is it some kind of function
The trendsetters make things better
Just follow the seasons and find the time
Yo, meet me at Suzy's Rendezvous
Neon black flames cook the calm air
But girl I apologize
Caught up in the things that everyone wants
Everybody gonna hit the ground
All bananas playing in the bright warm sun
Took me to Columbia, back then CBS
And they showed me that it was lead
Let me in your love it's sticky when we touch
I can feel the salt of the sea on my skin
Took up all his old things
There's something about you
She gave a smile but I was shy and looked down so down
Hope, hoping you might whistle, get all dizzy, 'cause I found the reason why you're around
You go ahead, let your hair down
From now on with the sky as my roof
Don't you think it's gone on long enough
Falls down and does not mend
Fly, fly, baby don't cry
Here is my request, play the ones that we all know best
Hangin' out up at Laquiji rock with pops for sure
Take my hand, don't let go, but please remember, hearts can grow
After all that I've run from, where the fuck did you come from
I said what they told me to say
I got a greeting, can't say what it's all about 
Been working and put on good habits
Hot wire my heart
But my crazy love 
I love you Sunday sun
Leaving town for sell to pal
He doesn't need to trouble his good soul
When the day that lies ahead of me
Have you ever been to heaven at night
The fables and hands
It's a very dangerous thing to do exactly what you want 
And the world is made of energy
If what they say is
And Ill stare off through the darkness
Stone to stone they take me on
Well, they're are no friends of mine
And I lose all control
I just got paid, we've got it made, ready to go
When this party ends, when this party ends
I try to put it into words, but the words just sound like mistakes
That's not always the case
While trying to restructure my character
And I got troubles oh, but not today
Love is like a song
We're on our way, way, way
Yours and mine
But it's awful complicated and you're warning me to beware 
Eye patch tongue ring little black book
I'm getting it out, whatever I've gotta keep in
If you are the Ghost of Christmas Past
I hope you can find the time
Is all a tremulous heart requires
And I'll be at your side forever more
I'm waxin' on I'm waxin' off I'm waxin' just because
So now I'm standing on the overpass screaming at the cars
'Cause they'd fill the open air
Praying for the light of day
I'm walking on sunshine
Front to the back, I'll make you go 'round
In the city, in the city I love
There's a boy with his head
I remember
Numbers, letters, learn to spell
Payback the camel, payback,
I stood stranded in the water
Depende da paix~ao              	        It depends on the passion
You know you know me number, too
Come on and raise your voice
Every morning keeps returning at my window
Never knew when it wasn't there because
The love that is left turns quickly to hate
And that was back around '
I'm sleeping in a dreamhouse
The face of rivalless gods, deep in your thoughts
It ain't what you say, it's what you do
When I look at you, you look so bored
This moment with you in my arms
Smiled at me from the window pane
Sends shivers, up and down my spine
Livin' life in these cold streets
Still in Love
With some old grandmother
The past is holding on so tight 
If I knew the way to the ornamental tree
We stalk each aisle,
He condescends to read the words I wrote about him
Come and go, caught that slow alright
I am asking for the planets to align
A higher, a higher power
The way that you kiss
Talk is cheap but lies are even cheaper
I'm not so sure when I got here or how
I'm falling to the ground
And when we grow old, yeah
I know she got a ring on her toes
And nowhere is the place to be
Scared of what I'm feeling
That's all you've gotta do
I didn't think I'd find you
So have a nice day
Don't say when 
And the stars in the sky, they never caught my eye
Built a fondness for things that just weren't good enough
Fighting in a foreign war so far away from my home
You're tender and you're tired
I've got these feelings
One more time
And we will run, we will, we will crawl
No, that's not fair
You're my doll, rock 'n' roll, feel the glamour and pain
Come and get it if you really need it
The fear and the consumption
And when I steal you gotta smack me 'til I cry 
With a beautiful highway
My heart is beating madly for her
Come go with me, we've got it made ooh
When sky cracks open and the thunder comes
Too many shades of gray
And everything is quiet
I thought love was only true in fairy tales
Who cares that you get home safe
Yeah nobody else
Been getting to hard to imagine 
And move away to the Midwest
The future of my understanding of love
I go walking in my sleep
Pull myself around
Where there are freckles I would die for
Imagine how the world could be
Makes me wanna come right out
We sailed up a river wide as a sea
Away we go And away we go
But in the end he'll soon recover
Come into my world
Oh whoa whoa whoa, way oh, way oh
Remember how uncomfortable that made you feel 
Oh I am a man on an Odyssey
Pressing on, all my distress is going, going, gone
If you could blow up the world with the flick of a switch 
It hurts from the bottom to the top
When you get old and start losing your hair
'Cause you're always wrong and I'm always right
Never gonna get away
Now people send me emails that say thanks for saying the things they didn't know how to say
And bite our thumbs at the acquaintances
I love making you believe
'Cause I've ruined this one
I thought "this one knows better than I do"
The way black is black
Don't ya feel that sunshine telling you to hold tight
With my headphones loud
Have a good time 
Our name is our virtue
And it feels like I'm somewhere
But we're alright though We're alright though
I bought a paperback and want to go real soon
It's not a slow dance
And are you going out 
Anyone who imagines
squint your eyes and no one dies or goes to jail
In the middle
I feel like I will never learn
You'd remember drinking horchata
There's so much in life that's undecided
The knots in the laces, heart it races
How kind of them to mellow mellow mellow my soul
Break away this fear,
Ccc'cause, baby, it will all soon come to an end
Oh, everything is uncharted
Making up all kinds of ways
Cause you can't feel a thing
Am I the only one
I stare, seems like I don't care
When none of the pieces fit
All of the time, now get out of my way
You got me and I got you
Or the planet for a clear blue skyway, oh
And times before that I was mean, I was mad
People who surround her feel the benefit of it
Raise your glasses, here's to living out our dreams
I got my tongue, got my chin
It's Friday I'm in love, oh
Someone always thought a good reason, baby
We'll be riding horses all the way
The sound of the crash, and gasping for air
Hope for the best, plan for the worst and maybe wind up somewhere
I wish you were here tonight dear Yoko
You gotta stop sipping on the sweet nectar of your memories"
Been alone since you were twentyone
Fly away
I'm gonna dream about the time when I'm with you
I've got nothing to hide
Couldn't stop the flood
Spent the last two years getting to what's real
Good night, baby
All my party people let me say one time
Dream of falling in love
And you glow a purple star
Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me
Work, work, work
And the devil was a girl
I gotta feel like it don't make sense
We're Moments away, Moments away
When silly thoughts go through my head
He washed my sins away
I'm wondering how things could've been
'Cause you make me smile
Something new, than what we've got here
Shake, shake, shake, Senora, shake it all the time
Now in the sticky love nest sits a widow
I promise hidden words of tenderness in every single line that I write
I hate Jon Bon Jovi but I hate his music more
Sneaking looks at you sleeping around, 
It's pinned against her bedroom door for all the world to see and she says
I'll be higher than the government
Wakin' up in someone else's bed,
Look at me, boy, so what is fate to say
Now it's gone
To the sound of a ticking bomb
You might remember me as
Trying to act like you just don't care
I don't know where the bus stops next
Have you ever made love to a beautiful girl hey
My friend left college 'cause it felt like a job
So I rode my bike like lightning
I keep feeling the lights
I'm crying in the corner at five
I wake people up
You know my name, look up the number
My face blew up at such a casual sight
And I'm on a roll so don't you be late
Let's all melt down together
I knew that it would be that way
What is happening, happening, happening and no feelings
I've been a lot of places all around the way
I went and cut my hair
A track fiend and saw dust
Stating point of view
Vanilla smile and a gorgeous strawberry kiss
Move like you really wanna be number one
I'm a young soul 
Sweet thing, take me to the end
The world is made up of so many opinions
I'd turn the, lights down long enough to hit repeat babe
I can hang 'round with you
Black as night on a summer day
Where the words can't find you
When I turned 
His vision borrows mine
Yeah, you are the fortunate
Why didn't I dare
In the rain
I met you one January day, 
Noone you can save that can't be saved
Now your hands, your tiny pink hands, grew larger than my hands ever grew
Whoa, whoa, yeah, yeah
We were heading for at spin
But yesterday when I saw your eyes in a black haze
Of a thousand centuries of death
Just to do this thing
Oh, let it all hang out
Hear voices I don't want to understand
You leave for the city, well count me out
Keep like my daughter and a run away
For us to make a home
Find a way to bring myself back home to you
August of last year
Ooh yeah, playing a new game
With tears like flashbulbs
But most times I've met those with a narrow mind
I got's to get them bigga, figga's, fuck what you talkin'
It's a dangerous scene
But if the summer's wasted
CNN, Network Channel 
Nothing there to prove
Said you hate the sound
You could be the end of me
Friends borrow money, never pay It back
I heard your lyrics, I feel your spirit
I don't wanna fall face down in the flood
What's the point of livin' if you don't take a chance
She killed it with kisses and from it she fled
Hey, I hear the voice of a preacher from the back room
Little brother's
But nothing I could say could make you look up
My tears quench five feet of lawn
We're happy together
Wrestle to the ground,
The sun is up, I'm so happy I could scream
They come in doing cartwheels
Now you can have your phone and eat it too
Heyo Heyoooo Heyooo You are the fortunate all the time
Well, it's all right all right, riding around on the breeze
If I had to guess, I'd say the monkeysender thinks its great
I knew you well, I knew you then 
Walked a couple of blocks to her destination
Wanting bracelets, never had a rope on my neck
May your feet serve you well,
I'm talkin' bout blue eyes, blue eyes
Yeah, we're alright though
How can a scalpel tear into skin
I was gazing in your eyes
My knees they got some cuts and bruises
Instrumental
Wake up, I don't feel it
The arguments and fights and money troubles seem so worthless
And let it flow out from within
I asked him time again 
I'm in love, but I'm lazy
As I'm wanderin' from town to town
The time was passed so pleasantly
In cafés they look away
Sa fete med micken backsimoodsbrad
And half of what I didn't do could be different
Well you know I'm a woman
Some are lost
We're all alone and there nobody else
I would like to hold my little hand
And I won't delete it He won't delete it, woahohoh
My life in shooshooshoo, shooshooshoo
But it was ruined by the sun shining through me
Oh but I'm not one for handouts, no they got to pay their dues
Your spirited friends, now a ghost town
I took the bus to streets that I could walk down
Maybe it's time I put a profile up
I tell you friends, I adore her
Examined the dirty ground
What the mama saw
Passed the medical; don't ask me how it's done
Her tongue and said "This will all have to come undone"
I know one day I'll see you all
Everyone, is just the same
'Cause that's the way I like it
And my chest it wears a singlet
I could live with so many burdens 
The storm maker says it ain't so bad
Jesus told me go after every coin like it was the last in the world
Photographs and stupid fights
Love is always hunted
Real sugar
But when we were kids
Seems impossible to face
And when the troubles arise, we hold on tight
Who puts me in the magic position, darling now
I've got a cure
I have to get this grade
In every way, you know I just want you to stay
The light is just right, even if she falls in love
Can't you just shut right up
And whoa, my nights are so long
I'm looking tired and feeling quite sick
I'll need a volunteer, how about you, with the eyes
Alright
Just close your eyes, take a deep breath, and start another war
I want to fall in love tonight Here tonight
I make my own way
For to seek a warmer sky
Oh, like dreamers do,
I sang a hymn to bring me peace
We're so ahead of this
Since I've seen that smile
So find a place as this forever divine
And I can't keep this smile off my face
Love was out to get me, that's the way it seems
And now I'm callin' out your name on this radio campaign
A daydream will last long into the night
His heart is pumping blood
Should we take the chance The chance, chance
Tågen går varenda år i samma spår
A little number counting back to nine
Trying to keep myself away from you,
So I drop my top, mix and I mingle
Shake shake shimmy shimmy
We have dodged the ropes of rain
To turn your world around
If you break my dick, I won't break you're balls
The way I'm feeling, it's gonna happen
And I never know where I stand
And if you want to say no, say no
And investments fade away
Completely unaware, could be anywhere, anytime
Step one 
And then boom
With redwoods around us
Take my hand, we'll get there
Come on let's go get it on, everybody let's go have some fun
For time is a river rolling into nowhere
You never felt so cold
Gold and silver shine
Your life is your life gotta live like it's your life
You look inside my wild mind
But I'll know where several are
Sing me to sleep tonight
But we are hidin' in a safer place
And I gave some sauce to my bestest friend for cooking
I say, hey momma, hey momma, close to you
Figures fly past through space, faces shine with shattered light 
And I can't make love in my grave
We stayed up till  am, with all the gossip and the latest girls
I thought we would have to break up the band
Leave the old town drunk on his wooden stool
﻿Well, you done done me and you bet I felt it
But that was then, we could pretend
We hit her on the head
And big bright lights INEQUALITY FRANCHISED
Young girl, girl, you're everything
They may not make sense but they sure as hell made me
When I hit the flow the girls come snappin' at me
And it did our thinking while we lived our lives
Coming, colours in the air
I ain't gonna stop
That's why I'm up all night counting sheep
That I could leave this starcrossed world behind
It's my party dance if I want to
On the ocean On the ocean
I've got life,
"I wish I would have loved less"
On silver stars I wish and wish and wish
Remember I'll always be true
I saw the world crashing all around your face
When will you all run out of gas
But in my mind I'm havin' a pretty good time with you
There's something special on my mind
Or you could return to me
There's lots of fun to be had on these streets
There's a place in this world
Free your heart
The mystery you're trying to preserve
Asphalt to me has never looked so soft
'Cause I can't recall a better day
I need the other one to hold you
Let me climb under your skin, oh let me in
A popular gauge will measure the rage of the new PostModern Age
Ya, It's a new day, In a new land
Because you know wherever you go
But I knew that's what she'd say
You'll be with me next time I go outside
Doing crystal meth will lift you up until you break
Keep on your love keeps lifting me
PC  said "We've caught a dirty one"
You hope that if you're lucky this is where you'll settle down
It's the way that she curses
She's broke his heart and that is rough
I'm sick of waiting
Careful, you'll hurt yourself 
You feel so free like your high as a kite
Take me above your light
The feelings insecure
And heaven who knows
I thought it was for real, babies, rings, and fools kneeling Babies, rings, and fools kneeling
I did not mean to frustrate you
The covers pulled up over your head
Yeah it's too late to turn your age around she's not the one you want
On my knees
It all falls apart, apart
You'll never find a boyfriend unless you get it adjusted
That everything good always would 
Oh oh oh yeah, oh
So headphone tones do float me home, my chair was begging to come
Well, shouldn't you be fucking with somebody your age,
Brace yourself for love
I drive around a bit 'cause work isn't very far
When storm clouds gather 'round
The shape of your lips and the size of your nose
Happy new year, ha
Well, it's all right, even if the sun don't shine
And alone don't seem so long
But I only work here to pay my tuition
Is a lonely box that holds you she's a star
We are just
Et maintenant le voyage a la supermarche
When you're so far away
Baby says she's mine, you know
I see my friends play the fool
Or I'll fall through
I Know one day you'll be old enough
I've known you for lifetimes, baby
A deer, a deer, dear, a deer, a deer, my dear
Even if it's just a day
I look at you, you look at me, we bite each other
Dancing on the dancing floor
Another onewouldn't be too much
Got each other and that's funny, eh, eh, heh
And I just don't believe my eyes
I've been waiting just for tonight
We stand tonight, hearts in our hands
That they hoped it would rain forever
Sun melting the fake smile away
Nothing
How come it ended up like this
I'm in the mood for dancing, romancing
Now I'm on a comeback trail to make a statement
I know I was up all night
And behind closed eyes, I cannot make them go away 
Find a tree and put in your house
And people should smile more
There's nobody else around, around
What have I been waiting for,
Shake your coconuts, coco boys
If you've got the money, I think it would be funny
The dogs will let me know
"I can't believe how naive a man can be
G Rap tried to get us to sign to Cold Chill
The rabbit hides beneath the ground
Climb right on me, lay it on me
And all the earthly things they stop to play
Switch on the sky and the stars glow for you
Fear is in your head
Someone help us please
Don't wanna be one of them
Boys had better beware
In the morning when you awake, let's disappear
Yeah, we laughing like a Wednesday night
Should have done it her way
And the hours of your life
No matter what the distance between
Watching out the window
You've got them all fooled
And I said your love lifting, lifting, lifting
We gonna ride down Bankhead, my nigga Bankhead
When you're saying "goodbye"
When you're with me, baby, the skies'll be blue
Tell me that you love me more
And everything that you receive up yonder
Yes, I know sometimes we all wanna give in
And let my love grow good for you
At the speed of sound
I'll be next to you and you'll be right there next to me
They stand on the block
Running out of time
Every time you call, you get so emotional
You should have seen that sunrise
But I know you're still the one
Our lips were cold as clay
And there isn't a hell where we'll be sent
Today is a day I will remember
Now don't have me break this thing down for nothing
Through the crashing sound
Something more beautiful than is there
They say it was written
And we're moving through the night
I prefer to give the inhabitants a say the inhabitants a say
Whenever we kiss, I get a feelin' like this
An ugly woman cooks meals on time
I never thought you knew,
There's no one left to cry boo hoo make it on over now
He's got a shot though No, not really
I want you in the morning, girl, I love you
If I knew what you were up to
A sweet little lie, I cry wolf, cry
Picking up the phone
Twentyfour hours on an empty brain
I know the world's been mean to you
Our love is so alive
And it makes me feel so fine
Lost in the endless sound
And call it a gift
Though you're probably feelin' blue
Because it's needing badly taken in
I couldn't care less about the dues you say I got
And every crotch is a siamese gun
No one else has ever known
And at the ceiling of my feeling, backed up against the wall,
And you leave me with my jaw on the floor, hey
I get so hot inside I'm burning my clothes
And the bouncing body drone
Topped it off with a pair of old shoes
And tonight I have to
Me back again
No one will ever miss you, so you know that you'll not be missed
It's you and me tonight
If you want, want my time
The rust and the rain endure
Tell me 'cause I'd like to know
We haunt the ins and outs of this house of our gracious host
There's too much doubt and not enough dare 
The stretcher's coming, it's just what I need
Wear my shoes
But you're the only one who knows how to handle me 
Mr Pleasant don't mind
Harry is the one I think you'll marry 
I was floating, did it go to my head
And my blues they won't go away
Let his riddle rub on to my pride
Everything around it isn't
That's the way it seemed
But by the time you figure this out
Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah
Nobody can take away
All the zombies on a hot Friday night
You've proven everyone wrong
I will not tell you this, because
On the graveyards and dead seacaptains
It makes the world go 'round and around and around and around
Looking for a good time;
I can't do everything
You have to learn how to die
I'm singing in the rain
Cruising across town,
No, you don't even know my name
I said people are people regardless of gender
In every way, I've changed since then
I'm gonna sleep all day till the sun sets
But that's just how I feel,
You know who you are
I want to kiss you on the mouth and tell you
I got everything they don't
Well I can't say there'll come another day where money and time will fall,
This girl listens to the band play
There's always something to cry about
And if we try to hold on
Or put off, put off every old face
You and me Sunday driving
I am all out of love to mouth into your ear, 
It's the only way we think to get ahead 
Pour a little sugar on it, baby
I never had a love of my own
If she loves you, let her go
Did they mistake us for an eight that's turning into a nine
Let's get it, homeboy Ha ha ha ay
The rats come out to take it over
Anything to show you
In the streetlight dawn,
Control your bad side in to peril
I just want to conversate with you but you keep on talking to your phone
It's not fair it's not fair
i know what causes your heart to ache 
With the moon keeping watch over me
I'd say I'm one step closer to being just 
It feels small but I won't get sad about it
To the left and to the right, buildings towering to the sky
My name is blue canary, one note spelled LITE
It's right
And it might be hard to handle
Sparking up a rhythm
Said if I played the evil lover, can I trade you for your alibi 
To qualify her luck
She fills up every corner like she's born in black and white
To be trying to call you
Put my hand on the Bible, tell it to the judge
Every summer we can rent a cottage in the Isle of Wight, if it's not too dear
We are magnified
Got to find another way to keep from going under
Won't you come and make up my mind
So many days you passed me by
It caused a mudslide on the banks of the operator
Bonedigger, bonedigger
You've tried before to leave me but you haven't got the nerve
I will learn to live again, for now I'm breaking
You're eating brains out the back of my head
Never let it out just like that
I'm tryin' so hard not to get caught up now
My name would then be Junipher
While we all ride on
Now I've looked in the mirror and the world's getting clearer
So we can pretend it's natural
This boy has broken down, yeah yeah
Just singin', singin' in the rain
So much so how somewhere something
When I say 
And last, but not, least grant somebody their last wish
I was half a world away from my home
We're all just lovers and takers,
And heres to my lovers hands and feet
Sweetheart
Well, baby, baby, baby down I'm really down
You set me up with your girlfriends
That is why I love you so much
We're gonna be alright Ah, ah, ah ah, yeah Hey
That you would walk away
My love will turn you on
Friends
Broke what you fixed you're so underground
Wrap their arms and embrace the air I breathe
See  it could be you, tomorrow, next year
'Cause you're as old as you feel you are
Broke my heart to see
All my islands have sunk in the deep
My name is Denver Max and wont you come sit on my lap
A pretty pair of blueeyed birds
I've gotta take in the starlight before it disappears
So you claim you love me too,
It is her hour so let it be hers 
It's the time it takes to blow
So I will help you read those books 
If you think you need inspiration 
And stories are all fiction from their moment of birth"
Triumphant in delight
But there's a light on in Chicago
What you behold is no longer a word, no longer a word
But it kicks, yeah
With my electric heart I then will find
There's so many things for us to do
Said, I'm that kind of feeling
The sky is blue, the trees are, too
Close your eyes and hold your terror close
And construct a summer home
When we get bored we like to sit around sit around and stare
It's a perfect day for letting go
Parents and governors can you handle the truth
I need someone to take
Whoa whoa, I got to tell you something
Can fall apart
My My Time Flies Four guys across Abbey Road
Would you have them all if there were enough hours in the night
Give me a moment Just give me one shot
We're just one big family
For someone just like you
Sooner than later
Back at the end all over again
No, I'm not done yet
Yo, yo, who think I don't got it
In the city
When I see you at the finish line
Do you hear the voice inside your head
Selling subtleties in cities 
They lose their ballads and their lipped mouths in the night
Casual we ride through the big blue sky
A little tyke, like to tease for fun Tease for fun
And I can feel your rhythm if you feel my rhythm
So stand in the place where you live
Moats and boats and waterfalls
Come and get my inner smile
You've got time, you've got money but you wrap it in a joint 'cause you don't see the point in using your time for making your dreams come true
Das ist Wahnsinn Wer die Sachen in dein Kopf bringt
Some people write the books that bastardize our claims
Bears heavy on my mind
When it's just too far away
But when the ads come
You got me up so high heyey
Is a cross that you bear when it's cold
But I can always tell she'd rather be allone with some other guy
Your eyes are doing naughty butterflies
All you have to do is touch my hand
First love, heartbreak, and true love
I can feel a storm brewing over nothing
As we land, you pinch my hand
Bungee jumping, I don't care
Strung up, hanging 'round
Just please, please,
And rockin' on the horsesized
Line after line I read on and on
Because you know you will never leave my side
Not much good to talk here ought to walk it
They're shooting bullets
That's why I'm standing here today 
Kinda suits you anyway
I answer life's big questions
Drop a chance in your hands, then
Escapade Come on, baby, let's get away ooh
And I break out in a cold cold sweat
I'm back, back in the New York Groove 
Or does everything just out of reach seem just too far away
You give me ten thousand nights of thunder
Down by the ocean, walk by and see
En Descontroool ooh ooh
C'mon we gotta kick that gangster shit
It is the beautiful game that you choose to play
It must have been the way
I put myself together
My heart is pounding loud, just like a timpani
That you didn't have
But what can I say I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive
I'd have something to say
But still we couldn't find what it was we were looking for,
We're flying through the night
But I thought it'd make a good song
But only one or two will last
To make the stars come out
In Camden road in a second floor flat with
Young kids stealing cars and having switchblade fights
In sunny Southend
Lying here asleep on a sunbeam 
What the writers say, it means shit to me now
And fall down again, all black and blue again
I'm out and about, so I'm in with a shout
Lick my lips and twist my hips
Deep down inside we wanna believe they still do 
They come back around 
I walk the other way, I don't wanna bother you with my sobriety
I'm going to get you
And into an hour's time, within which a day's worth of work
Oh, somewhere over the rainbow bluebirds fly
Those words of wisdom I had prepared
You don't believe, and your grievances show
Just want a way of keeping you inside
You give me feelings that I adore
The Candy Man the candy man
And life's complexities
Betray white water, delay dark forms
I'm standing in the middle of town
Crazy Eddie in the slammer 'cause he's givin' it all away
It's me who's feeling strange
'Cause I love the gap between your teeth
I'll be mine where I place my drafts
As you brush your shoes, stand before the mirror
We danced with monsters through the night
The mama looked down and spit on the ground
She moves in her own way
You'd do anything to jinx it,
I got troubles oh, but not today
And baby, even on our worst nights
I wouldn't say that I'm sorry oh no
And you carry a little speech with you
Love the way you wear your curly hair
And I know that ev'rybody
Your heart got broken,
Your tear drops fade and then I saw
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah down
You didn't think that you'd be coming home again
It ain't the end of the world
I need to improvise
And around my neck is superstition
I keep seeing this picture of you
I wanna be with you tonight
And why does she give a damn about me
Hey, be better this time
I know you're still the one
But wait until tomorrow morning
Now how the hell do you ever expect that you'll get laid
You get that woo, you get that
You just try to stop me now 
I guess I lose, but life goes on
Got caught in the crossfire
Living in a dream
Wake up in the morning
Has come down,
Let's just talk together, you and me and me and you and if there's nothing much to say
Un p'tit air et toujours
I can't stop hearing all the singing
I'm gonna break down at fifty
And what I really want to do tonight
I'm going to get you out of my head  get out
Woo hoo, and I know you're mine
These 's keep the attention of bitches
So scratch my name on your arm with a fountain pen
The happy phantom has no right to bitch
If I had the chance
And watch your eyes as they poured
Whispers Chinese leaves a message, leaves a metaphor, 
Still they walk pretty good hand in hand
I can't say, who do I believe
And you hear it from friends
It's a little too late 'cause I'm already gone
Tell me darling can I get a break, somehow
Really nothing to feel bad about
You and me it will always be
I gotta dance dance dance dance now the beat's really hot right on the spot
When you've fallen in love
Have you got the time
We're losing time, time, time
May as well polaroid her with the way I stare
Like God's hands
There is nothing left to do
Sit around and wonder what tomorrow will bring At the end of the line
And so I stayed up all night 
It doesn't matter what we do
Bins up front 
Without you, it's a waste of time
There's no other love just like this
I could have read of your heart
The two of us are really one
Yeah You'll alway now you got someone
I always gave him wedgies 'cause I thought he worked too hard
Because we're dead
He did not admire
We'll fly our flag right up up out of your sky
'Cause they all lead to better days
Le p'tit air et toujours
Tu attends que je viennes
You can ask for my money If you like you can have control
See what I've done
If it were up to you, I'd be in my bed crying
The weekend is the weekend
It's been a while since I felt like this
We'll be playin' and havin' fun
Each quarter note, each marble step
You are the fortunate all the time
But yours would look better than mine, 'cause you're outta my league
And that was the turning point
I'm back in Liverpool
Boy, your touch makes me feel like
She's also saying I got low self esteem
Oh, baby, I'm down down I'm really down
His shoes will walk for miles
She says
When things don't feel right
So what it I break down
Four forever, two together, we'll play dead, we'll play dead We'll play deadly
It's true, we're one
Not with you, nor her, nor anyone
People cry, people fight
But I'd rather make a song they can play on the radio
Cause there's someone younger and you're feeling older
And you were mad as hell, you felt
One summer, a suicide
To call a friend of mine
Stop it watch us all get lost
I took a pill almost every night
And awkwardly
Jump on in, the water's fine for swimming
Convinced that it's mine with her
It's the beginning of the end today
And my heart feels so new
In the way that I spell it out
And he sees the children
It looked like a newlywed
To my motion fatigue, farewell
They break and they bend
Well I'd say don't throw it away if it's not working anymore
Oh yeah, I've been waiting for, waiting for you, girl
All I gotta say is I must've done something right
Let's leave this place
So I thank the city, the lights that it's spinning
Say you haven't had enough, say you wanna
But I remember one clear feel
To Anything Taboo
Yeah uh huh yeah yeah
And someone falls in love
I'm with Akinyele in the street, trying to get us a deal
Step right in
You got an angel on your shoulder
Now I'm a free agent and I'm thinkin' it's time
On a street where reality is not much different
Rosewood from '
Seems to be no reason at all
Wishing for the time of my life, she says
Here's to all the pretty girls
I count the days the Great Frontier
Against my building's back door
I walk the streets with a song in my head
Dance dance dance dance dance dance yeah
Cause a lot of wags want to hear it
stripped away by days of being hailed as "Your Highness" 
You're such a delicate boy,
If only there were clothes on the floor
You and me will always be
Crazy in love
Nobody paid much attention
The changes that come when
Her bone structure screams
To new days of doubt without you
We love each other
Must be something,
Let the good times roll, let the good times roll
Gonna cry, yeah yeah
For thinking that we could be something for real
In the end
Never be lonely
Imma do it till I get it right
He comes here almost everyday
So lay your head onto me
You'd say we're playing house now you still say we are
And get well cars to the hostage vans
Waste my days Waste my days
Let me watch night fall on the river
Yes like those forest lights
Oh, what joy for every girl and boy
The messages on the tablet
With a happy refrain
This time I won't save you
It looks so good, good, good
Man, I just saw something I'm glad that you are here
What is this Are you some kind of hypnotist
Tell me, did you think we'd all dream the same
From the point of loving thunder
And it just feels good when you're next to me
I'd rather stay here all the night with happy boys who sings
Moving on and down the road to the 
I'll say it, I'll say it, I'll say it again now
All the things you say
And the dream that you dare to, oh why, oh why can't I
We see the banker sitting waiting for a trim
And there are those we know who'd have us five miles off the track
Oh, when you're sleeping on your own
Never be who you aren't
There's something you've forgotten
These days of frustration, keep y'all on tuck and rotation
All right in a sort of a limited way
I give everything up for your touch
All our friends would say
I'm sad to see that you are sad
We can get him started, yeah
You look like a girl from Abercrombie and Fitch
Underneath soft sun, chewing Nicorette
'Cause this is my interpretation, yeah, yeah, yeah
That lives like yours, were in the hands of these erroneous fools
Pretending that I've got a clue
I could hide behind a big blue screen
But no one could do it
Just who you are
But I'll be there, I'll wait by your side
Here I stand, crawlin' home at night
Ease my mind
A lovely day
Steady wasting the day spittin' silly verses
So I printed him a letter to be sent out to sea
What I feel now
And you're the perfect thing to say
Leave the real one far behind
That great love sound
Gonna love you every single night, yes I will
Typically terrific, busy and prolific
Light me up that cigarette and I'll strap shoes on my feet
Some children are so strange
The cowards way
What's the use of money of you got no time to use it
I start recovering
I'm standin' on top of the world, right where I wanna be
With our grill in disguise, we've got more lives than I
We can be us just for one day
She's only one breath away
It's a perfect day to throw back your head
And we all want to talk and we do, we do
Leaves you in the cold
Tried it out it's like nothing you ever seen
This is what I always wanted,
I don't care 'bout that, I don't care 'bout that
Baby, it's fact
But I wrote the book too well
Some people write the songs that really ain't songs at all,
Come see, with me, come see
So is this how it ends
Hey girl, you've got a short fuse
I'm a windup toy in an up down world
When the night feels my song
Singin', don't worry 'bout a thing
Celebrity minds, they're humbly taken by surprise
To the point that no one would even believe that we existed
But you know I love it
And talking 'bout your eyes
In school yeah, I fooled ya
I got to find me a way to flow
Pay the chicken back, back,
Black and on the ground
Everything is made with the same old labels
And that will bring everybody down
And do you ever see yourself in love
The power to be
But I love you, yes I love you
Wear it like a bruise or black eye
We can't rewind, we're locked in time
Prescriptions scripting a timeline
For one moment's eternity
You can feel fire in the night lying here
And sleep on the wind with the fires right behind
Always changing my mind to be a friend is fine
Absentmindedly makin' me want you
Where I'm going you cannot come
Sometimes it feels like I only dream in black and white
With a frame like a skeleton
Oh everybody
That the grass is not always greener
Gone gone
You can say it out loud it will be okay 
They were in our minds
Play it through the air
'Cause I'm more scarred, more scarred then my wrist is
And glints in the night 
Ooh baby, baby, got me feeling so right
Weakened knees call
I've got nothing to say but "It's okay"
Once there was this girl I knew,
Grace in each face that is making the wastedest, brokenest ones fairly fly
Looking forward towards the next scene
Your feet are going to be on the ground
We drank the ocean dry
Sweet thing, you know I'd fall in line
Oh, to make it rain
His heart's in a bowl behind the bank
Yeah, but I really love it here
Until we realize that we are the same
Well if I live for a million years
I don't know what's with your friend
When my baby
Yeah, I would have a show like Oprah, I would be the host of
I told them, I said to them, Bernie, I said they'll never make their money back
Our lips can touch
Use your eyes, the world goes and flutter by
There's a land that I've heard of
Get it together, make it nice
You're ok with the way this is going to be
Where will you carry me
The age to get in
He's gotta be all for me
When's there gonna be an end to wondering
Do the signs begin to show
And it always grows back
This whole world will take me down
They never knew, they never knew, what you're going through
And I think it's fly when girls stop by
Not a chill to the winter but a nip to the air
Burn and start again
Happy to see how far I've come to the same place it began my dreams and imagination
Would you care to sit with me
Steal some covers, share some skin 
I was thinking of things the blue ocean brings
Though nothing, nothing will keep us together
What I have is right here
If only I could always be just as I am right here
Leave the poor black child in his crumbling school today
What did you expect
That girl's my life, I tell ya
Support your brother, support your brother Sport brother
You and me always
Clocks are running late
First choice on the haunted stars, now the one true loves,
Out here in these streets, we're so young and all alone
I watched you get undressed
There is no such thing in life as normal
Or they were counting down the ways to stab the brother in the
'Cause the thought alone
On a highway along the Atlantic I'm rifling through these last seventeen years
And I will always love you, baby
We search vegetation
The birds in the trees
And you cannot hide or ever put it away
The day is beautiful and so are you 
But don't sleep, 'cause now it's time to go
Meant to play the penitent part
Blazing new trails
Can you taste it any feeling that you got
Call you up If I should call you up, invest a dime
I'm seein' stars, I can't believe my eyes
Pick it up with the band 
Bang, bang, a knock on the door
When it's cold
Sure you were swift when the handsome Greek boys dropped by with gifts
He's on a strike and looking at you
So please stop talking
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off whoo
Now it seems too lovely to be true, but I know the best things always do
Wahwah Here come the sun
Red in the morning, blue in the evening sun
Do you want to go to the plage with me
They say ooooooooooh weeeee
Traps will be sat by the people below
As I look out
Out of the concrete or from window ledges
Six in the morning, baby
"I love you"
I don�t fall in love, I just fake it
Barefoot and game
Mommy and Daddy's got the best cocaine
So I thought I'd win the war
Of the freeway
And it's our Godforsaken right to be loved, love, love, loved, loved
Taxi driver, sun is rising
Who'd gathered there to watch it topple
Like there's something
Ooh ooh ooh, Ooh ooh ooh
I can't live without it, I can't let it go
Take it slow 'til your body's saying more baby
All things know, all things know
If you're lost and you look, you will find me
I think I'm getting closer
Will it stay skyhigh
And I see you on the TV at night
Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet fires in the street
I really, I really, I really remember when you drank my wine
In New Jersey, they got a god damned Swedish parade
And the sea's all right
I wish that every kiss was neverending
Come on out and dance
And in every way you know I just want you to stay
It's JuniorSenior time to show us you care, hey
You know, it seems the more we talk about it
Find the money for your rent, find the money for your rent
It's like no other feeling she says
Boy I hear you in my dreams
A game show love connection we can't deny 
It's that I love you girl
And this is my mind
And we can't hear what they say
A back up plan to find you
I gonna tell you what I need
Well, baby, I'm down down I'm really down
In love you'll always find
I'm a Barbie girl in a Barbie world
The stars fall down like money
I can't believe I came home to find my car keyed
He doesn't speak the language
I asked but nobody knows
The more we know, the less we care, what's damaged on the way
I got a desk full of paper that means nothing at all
I met a man
'Cause there's a million things to do
Waking up on the bathroom floor
Let's make a list of who we need
To bike outta town tonight
Walk right up to the microphone
I'll be the switch she turns on
"You should�ve seen me a couple of years ago,
Back to my bed
Make me real life hurricane
Before I knew you baby,
And any bitch givin' head, if she blow I know
And all the pleasure points attacking
Don't you want something else
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah oh yeah
Old habits, young ways
Come on, come on
Oh it really lifts my heart
It's such a burden to carry 'round the vestiges of dead dreams,
She is the kind of a girl
I get it down on the dance floor
"You'll all die in your cars,
Saying she's returning home to me
Don't you dare ask questions 
You turn the picture on to me and I'll turn over
'Cause I wanna go where the people go
And you'll feel better
Think I am looking over your shoulder
Through my head and mouth
And I will never look down
Uptown funk you up hey, say what
That you'll ignore until blood shows,
Oh, you are beautiful
Never say it's the last one
And the mortars may fall
In my jacket, pack of playing cards
Impaired my tribal lunarspeak
And fall onto the floor
And I would walk five hundred more
This family sticks together
The beach homes and ocean side
She comes in colours
To the water's edge and watch you drown
As I did today
And who makes me feel like smiling when the weary day is through
So tell me darling, do you wish we'd fall in love
I have done a few things I regret
Ring all the bells sing and tell the people that be everywhere that the flower has come
Mons Venus, Crazy girls Know what I'm saying
The city's nitty gritty but it's so much fun
In the wide world
If I lose my fame and fortune 
Shine, shine, shine on
Killed the vibe and took my perfect ten away
Off on a cloud to another time
Saturday Morning
And feel united oh oh oh x
I've got a sheet for my bed
Said, I'm a believer, yeah I'm a believer
We're gonna be alright
I live out of state in a mobile home
And I'd have never been aware
Can't stop thinking about you, baby
Then gone in the goodness wish I could stay here every time"
Behind that crooked line
Our love is true
And some children are so strange
Three little birds
Join a local gang and get a cool nickname
Now I'm crawling towards the sun 
For a sweet summer night
Oh, it's a big boat and it pumps up the poor boys pride
Whatcha waiting, whatcha waiting for
I know this ain't real, it's gone to far
Ooh ooh, I've been trapped by love
You fall apart
So let's jump the border when the coast is clear,
It doesn't matter now
Contact was questioned from the boulevard
You cast your line and hope you get a bite
Be a night like this forever
There's some kind of wonderful
Muck around
Losing control
I can't wait 'til the morning
It wasn't 'til I looked into the mirror     
This is the best one
And put it back together again
And I wanna see you break it down,
And to sleep under the stars
Baby, you're sailing away
Seen like the gods
A smile, a guise
You don't get me
We'll get hot by the refrigerator
Oh, nobody know
She said "That's when the feeling hits
I keep talking, begging, tell me what I want to hear
And nights of together
And maybe when the night comes
Gonna hold up half the sky and say
Say my name, you know who I am
I'm getting it back like it's four in the morning
I put the pedal to the floor
So call me Mr Magic Man, I float on Cloud 
All I dreamed of
That's some kind of wonderful
I got legs on my chair and a head full of hair
Now grab each others' hands, get on up;
Your name into the wall
Making the best of what was mine
Been wasting all my time
If we forget the things we know
So where's the sun It shone no love on your face
And I wondered if the leaves could grow back
Say shut your mouth you're in a fatal tiz
And no, this won't be a sad song
Yeah, after all this time, I'm still into you
Like the man said, let it all hang out
Following the girl
Are you out there where the rainy days
So shine the light on all of your friends
But I know gold is just a trick of light
You're so bitter; you think he's sweet
Lying on the bed
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart, now
You paint a picture on the wall
You don't do it on purpose but you make me shake
The blues they send to meet me
Now I can't make you love me, baby, if you don't
I know that what I've started
She's out of my hands
She lets me drive her car so I can score an eighth
Live while you can
Time together isn't ever quite enough
To the feel good hit of the Fall
So wait here, wait up
I know there's allbody types but we have just one size
Well out of my toes my little black baby grows
Playing Hookey, Making Something
The things she does for me
But I can't remember what I meant to say
Makes me feel like I took happy pills,
If you believe in magic, come along with me
Come on girl
So I'll never be alone
Ain't got the intellect 
"Beware", the sign on the door suggests
What are you doing now
Hiroshima, Los Angeles and each town in between
She's so beautiful now she doesn't wear her shoes
Free, yeah 
Climb the fence, books and pens
You got me on a mission
The moon is before us
That your love, your love
If you get drunk and vomit on me
For this correction I need direction
Someday we might learn to tell the truth
Baby, I know you do this to all the girls, but baby, I'm fragile
Nothing to do, it's up to you
Live my life without
I'll never get, I'll never get to be with you
'Cause I am the only child there is
And the taste of sex couldn't be too soon
And we can watch the sun
Too afraid to say, he'll give his heart to you forever
What you waiting for
She's a lot like Catwoman
Don't you act like you ain't heard a thing
See what you've done
Moats and boats, and waterfalls
And we just lay awake in lust and rust in the rain 
Oh, you make me feel
Now, she's the only one
If the malady don't go away we're in a little trouble
You will get the best of me 
Ooh yeahah
So I let it go what matters now is story soon
Make you feel so good
We don't stand a chance 
You better get real, real, real and realise that the situation is going nowhere
Chimps aworking on a chain gang
But then she stuck close to me the whole night through
Where did we go wrong
It's just the way we feel
When she says, "Let's go, I like the nightlife, baby"
And we'll all float on anyway
And when I wake up in the mornin', I got's to hit a lick
You feel emotional
You gotta know what you want to be
LATER that week
'Cause we know that every night's gonna end some day
Bursts are made to colour me rich
You warned us If you came back and we still on the corners,
It makes you feel happy like an oldtime movie
You don't think that life's for us to talk about
All got our dreams
Steal the feeling and focus on the flames, girl
A face to face you will lead them by the fall
I'm stuck in the crossfire
On an August day
Run, run, run, run, run, run
We can beat them forever and ever
So I jumped into the back of and eighteenwheeler head north
The load on the road brings a tear to the indian's eye
You take my hand and drag me headfirst, fearless
Don't you know we'll both fall to pieces too
The rain is fallin' on my window pane
Would be a welcome surprise
Don't nobody care about 'cha, only thing you got is God
Lisa met Chelsea at the knocking school
I get a lotta doubletakes when I'm comin' around the corners
If any word that you said
CCCCinnamon lips and candy kisses, on my tongue, fun
I got some pictures on my phone
So uhoh Spaghettios I forgot to hide away the body
Let the songs begin
If she wants me, yeah
Nothing ever happens
There's a million lies burning brightly just like fireflies
You could seem to color your hair
Leaving me, I'm sad and blue
Just give me a call
With the wisdom that my father gave me
'Cause I got some intuition
I picked her up and she was threeforths gone
Sleepless long nights
O'Malley, run
What are you going to play
She just wants to be accepted in this place 
And this one is for you
I've been asleep for a while now
I just want to float through the sea
I go crazy when you walk in the room
My excuse is, my pops just died, and I ain't wanna make music
Ooh, can we be a family
Every night we smash a MercedesBenz
Last night he flew to Baghdad
I'm beggin you please
No, never let you go
Desmond stays at home and does his pretty face
Finding the word
Heartbreakers gonna break, break, break, break, break
Yeah, I know sometimes we all wanna give in
All the things that I relate to them
I feel the love that's really real
I got magic in my dancing shoes
And say "hello" to jersey
When it comes to other men
To lose your arm would surely upset your brain
And check the stove four times each day
Gentleness clears the soul
I wrote to tell you that I hope you're feeling better
Me and you over something to do
She said your friend's on the phone
I'll keep it with mine
Wouldn't it be a lovely headline
But I will contented be right now if we could keep our secret
We're really onto something special little girl,
Who knew Mind you I never had to stand in line
The shoe is on the hand it fits
Filtered water and pictures of you
Cause broken legs can be replaced 
There was a loophole in my dreaming
I like to rock 'n' roll,
It is the power that you know you got it well
That love never dies, love never ends
I don't want to waste my time on simple little things
We didn't get wet, we didn't dare
I could stand by the side
As everyone else thinks
In the broad day
It's pointing to Heaven
You can't dance and stay uptight
It's easy to get right next to you
Anyone you've loved once was right
And meetings after dark
Hoping for a frigid air to come passing by
Fate doesn't hang on a wrong or right choice
Insects flutter up against my window
That's chimps devoid of any hair
Turn off the lights
The girl next door who's famous for showing her chest
We didn't know better
I came to this strange world 
Are spelled out on a double word and triple letter score
If you don't move and get a job
Well I believe it all is coming to an end
This heartache rots that which spills
I'd scream and I'll fight for you
To a place we never, ever go, go
With the ghost that was there before you came
My My Time flies A new day is on its way
Everybody looking at you crazy Crazy
The light is the sign, that love will guide you home True love
I'm permanently black and blue, permanently blue
Put myself into bed
"The world is everlasting
Like remember when
But I'm still, I'm still an animal
Three little birds, sat on my window
She had to pose for life for all the scholars of art
You get to the next on down the line
In the twinkling of an eye
On the leaves of a banyan tree
We both were born to be one with that which the public scorned
I can only do it once, they'll call me lazy
'Cause I can't afford to buy one
The softest voice said to me all through last night
This parade still marches on
Pull out the stops got your attention
Let's get older
Now we're so high, it can't rain
I miss you like the sun don't shine
Souls are lifting only dreaming
Tore it up and walked away
Dressed up to the eyes, it's a wonderful surprise
I am at home in this high five
That the sky is such a sweet blue,
Cunts watch their bodies
You know they started something I can't stand
Where's the love Just give it up
And I'm still wondering who to be
And I find that I'm never alone
Ooh let me be X
I remember way back, I mean, way back, ages
That you always give out
These tricks that I'll attempt will blow your mind
I'm just winding you up, oh
Everywhere I go people stop and they see
Because it seems to me that I wake up and sleep
She has abandoned me on highways and desert plains
Persian kitty better stay out of the train
Which she has never studied
To our subjects on their knees
Sipping the golden drinks
So suck it up, Sharon, maybe it's time
Oh we'd stay up late playing cards
I say, we can go where we want to
Third time in a doorway
See through this point of view
Do it good, alright
Declared a war
He does And I do, baby I do
Uhhuh, goddamn right, it's a beautiful day
Address unsure of, but it turned out just right
Standing beneath that mistletoe
Ah, and my hair is growing long
Cleaning up the house again
No hope or love or glory
So stop laughing and play the muse
I would've shot you down
"Son this world's gonna kick you in the ass"
I'm not sure of my every step
If there's such a thing as love,
I'm might pleased we met
Wish I could undo the time
There's no body next to mine to ooh
Whatever together
Been getting some extra help from a special band
Our rulers and idols get greedier and seedier
Every second of time Keep wait
There's something underneath my bed
I don't give a damn what the people say
I got a family, and I drink cups of tea
Sit back
To something good, something good, something good
Did he cover up my name
You're better off leaving town
You walk up the stairs
Well, her face is a map of the world
It's all about the way that it unfurls 
The train off in the distance, bicycle chained to the stairs
It counted up our feelings
The kids fighting up the lane
And as they as strolled along
Under these Northern skies
I wasn't feeling all right
Content to yield, despite pride
This must be rare
Oh boy, find out what's up with me
'Cause it's the only thing, I think, that's real
It's getting cold, I'll catch the bus
Oh baby, all I need is one more chance
I laid on my back, let the punk record spin
Just want a girl as cool as Kim Deal
Then both of you'll get practice"
It means I love you
I'm playing like shakin' under the coconut tree
I found a tape in my back garden
Something good happens
Do you call me
It's looking more blue than it is green
Just to hear it fall is the sweetest sounding thing
And a book on Presidents deceased
Parents little girl will be wondering
We be near heaven at a quarter to eleven
Daddy ain't home from the dog run 
Extended works of fiction about imaginary success
I love in the rain
God damn you shrubbery
This is a repetition of words, dancing needs a
Somehow, someway
Looking back, you shouldn't have fought it
I really don't understand a word
It's a comforting feeling
Lucky to be coming home someday
Get that, get that, get that, get that
And when I, I wanna kiss you, yeah
I see the road is rough
Just kickin' down the cobble stones
And see the sun come up
She said to get better
Still I think I'm doing fine I'm doing fine
Not that I don't care about you
It's the way that's the best
You think I'm fly don't you Whoo
You gave my life direction
Around him
My words get lost in the morning heat 
Seeing our dragon when we look
'Cause soon enough we'll die
We can make the time stand still
But I'm in love with Stacy's mom
Suddenly you are the one
When the cities are on fire
And girls, you better beware
In your old car 
Her name is Noelle, I have a dream about her
Are you gonna waste your time thinking
Woohoah, love, love, love
All that I can say
She's everything I've been dreamin' of
Why would I stick around Oh why would I
Don't you feel that hunger
Won't you stick around
Ooooohh MundiaLLL
Till they stop rollin' so far
We've got nowhere to run
And I got pulled by the pull of the tide
Walking on blue waves, blue waves
New York niggas is foul, we body sling shit in the val'
Thought about it so many times
Lord of the earthquake
Right back at ya, it's the world's most talented record label
Or clutch a rabbit's foot when I'm twisted like Oliver
And take on hippie names, I'd be Snowphish, you'd be Sunny
Right now somebody's counting my money
My passion's neverending and I'll love you till Tuesday
Mister Blue Sky is living here today
I walk into a club and I've found paradise
So much on my mind
You can sleep with one eye open
I'll be down where the waters flow
So let's lose ourselves
Someday he's gonna show us all, I bet
Dirty floors and sticky tables
It's what a heart is for
Daydreamer, we used to be half alive, now I'm alright
Hey girl
Deep in the heart, I'll seek and find it all
I try to be honest
All through the ATL, come and ride wit' a G
And I will never need umbrellas in the rain
Gets my lungs confused
I'm feeling upsidedown down I'm really down
And there's times I think of leaving
Have to contend with all night
But it doesn't make sense
The whole world began to ring
And all the letters are inside
Everyone you see is full of life
Even if I could have kissed
Go out and find me when I'm dropped
Then I'll try to hold on to you
Behind the facade is a lonely angel still
Not much like a lover
I know they'd never match my sweet imagination
And things pushed in my face
We should find a flock of birds big enough
Do you hear me I'm talking to you
Yes I've been too long a rolling stone
Oh, who the fuck's your president
I've gotta rise above
I have sat alone and wondered
And dreaming of houses, none of them that I own
The world we loved forever gone All you love, but it's gone
A clear ground division
Late nights and weekends our hearts only go so slowly on the local track
Some cats didn't make it alive
I'll never let you turn around
To my wall like Danielsan does
I hid myself from failure and fear
But still, you know, I'd long to get some
I give a smile I give a song
I feel the aura and I feel the atmosphere
You're playing with your telephone, you're playing with your hair
Strangest thing I saw
She met a boy and at the summer's end
How I missed you, my love
All together now
And dreams of splintered sounds
'Cause my life has begun 
And you'd better get out of his way
Stack it up like cinnamon, we'll get it real fast
I'd expect something in return
Always past never and still faster
And they know it now but no one makes a sound
Going to work, don't want to go, feeling low down
Ach, Aurélie, in Deutschland braucht die Liebe Zeit
And a gun in the hood and a mob of police
Finding a way from what's dark
Didn't belong to a couple of old white guys 
Doctor Jones, Jones,
And they're splattered up and down your windshield and the headlights
Don't be afraid, it's only me, hoping for a little romance
One of us is gonna die young
Resting our head
So who's gonna be my next door savior
There are those who know to look
I knew it would be tonight
A love attack
Gonna knock you off your feet
Now I'm looking up at you
And when the sun is out
Than the love from her mother
I don't wanna risk losing everything
Open up the dirty window
Like a painting on a wall
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
They say you have to be someone's
Standing back
And I only found it today
If I looked all over the world
Summer's gone and it left me with a sunburn
No one knows where they take us,
Big boy, come on around Big girl, you are beautiful
There are things that I can do things that I can do
When you can't break through
You look so cute writing out your own death letter
Everybody is waiting for everybody to get out
Fills a void rewinding me
And we are legends every day
Some postman is gonna cry
The tree said "I wish I could be 
Hoodoo voodoo
So we should party
I want to get so stoned and take a walk out in the light drizzle
In the rain
Some hesitation to this life I give
Cause the dead air is what makes me whole
Wake up, you know I feel OK
Not that I'm aware of
But I feel we won the lottery, that day
That I still won that rush
Get that, get that get that get that get that get that get that get that get that
Pickin' it up but then I put it back down
My head it tends to stray away, sometimes I can't see clear
'Cause my heart gets broken so easily
This time I know nothings wrong
It's not a threat to nobody
Absorbing sound that's never been right
Neither will move till it's over
Man, I feel like mold, it's prom night and I am lonely
And open hearts with clear content
och man kan var dom andra eller du och jag har festival
And I'll live in a house with a bunch of people
Twenty grand, know it's a sin, but before me you show
We get down, get down, I want more
Standin' in line in the front of the club
Yeah, they say 'true'
Lisa likes brandy and the way it hits her lips
This is a black tie affair,
There is no other voice
So put me in a cage and lock me away
And I love you sounds fake
Never walk under ladders,
Your alibis just don't sound right
Don't care enough to write you a letter now that I'm doing better,
That the word is just the way 
I know I can't avoid her she's in the air
You would not believe your eyes
Maybe something's wrong with you
Nothing could be further from the truth
Oh, won't you hold my hand
You don't know 'cause it just passes right through you
Been away for too long
Have a good time, 
Found a flaw in the ending of a book that I've read twice, 
Things replace things
I'm overflowing with ambition, but I got to keep in mind
Oh, what's in my mind
It's all right, all right, tonight, tonight
But if you don't have a home you can buy one there
Seems like forever and a day, thought I could never feel this way
And we kissed as though nothing could fall nothing could fall
They let us play with markers but I keep trying to draw infinity
At least be confused about right and wrong,
If I ever found a pot of gold
She's a super human girl
From a feelin' that is here to stay
I would, do you catch my drift Yeah PreChorus 'Cause I would go the distance for you, baby
Ghost in your house, ghost in your arms
You can't just give it away
I want you at the moment I feel blue 
Like nothing's gonna happen
Sweetheart I'm telling you
I'm gonna be the man who's havering to you
I reach out trying to love but I feel nothing
Each breath that you take has a thunderous sound
Within shouting distance, you can hear a blind man's bluff
It's all bad, it's all good baby can't you see
And swaying like a smokey grey, a drink in the park
It's been this way for so long
Dirty dancing in the moonlight
And through many dreadful nights
And you're still mine, we're locked in time
And a snake it bit you
Met you one summer and it all began
They'll lie to your face
I've got nothing at all
Oh, I'm always in decline, always changing my lines
Each day
Hey Hey man, now you're really living
Before I've many a time
Think of a place I would go
Finding replacement with a heart sedated, I'll forget you
Hell no no, oh no, I won't let them take you, won't let them take you,
Oh yeah Laquiji rock it was a blessing
What's my boyfriend's going to do and do the shot and do the do
Well, that all depends what you qualify as friends
In the high boots Oh yeah
Well before I catch you complaining that it hardly rains at all
Though the nightmare is gone now I don't have a dream
Choo choo Charlie had a pretty good band
Workin' all day for a mean little guy
And it's the feeling like you're oh so glad you came
Just assumed that you lost me like a left turn
Let me tell you what they say, when I'm pullin' off my drawers
It's jealously, they can see that we've got it going on
Just drive away, yeah yeah yeah, go
Ist da etwa jemand
You never give me a chance
The story goes
To ride a wave on your inhaling
Or down in London town to go, go
Now I got this feeling
Summer wind, desert stars
Oh I kiss you and I know
Now I'm in need of some protection
The winds of fear
You know what they say
Every time I turn around
Can only get better
Say it with a smile like it's meant to be
Can you feel it 
Let's get nice and friendly, join us for a surfride in the mud
No rhyme no reason no job no class
This weight's too much alone
Waiting for the proper time
It goes over and over the same old lines
Baptized by the fire, I wade into the river
All the sights
Sends you flyin', cryin'
And I know that it's a wonderful world
For just a card
But that's OK I'll be president someday
Cause girl we're good together
And now he's someone else
I won't forget to lock the door
One piece of wood from Noah's Ark,
So many people I know, they're just tryna touch ya
And it's clear to me that this life is gonna be
When the music's making people tonguetied
And she'll say, "Yeah, well I feel all pretty happy too"
Feel the love and to your arms I fall
What happened to that father, who swore he'd stay
Are you free or are you tied up
Strangers' silence makes me wanna take the stairs
And then say bread and butter
From this pain I just can't disguise can't disguise
But everybody's lied
Looking for answers in the pouring rain
And I think of you on cold winter mornings, darling
Now the record always spins on the trails we blaze
This man makin' money, how I know
Woooohwoooohooh
Which stood on rocky shores and kept the beaches shipwreck free
Underwater you and me
Is she outsidein
Waiting for a love like this
No doubt you'll hurt my feelings,
'Cause killing people's not my scene not my scene
Don't need a gun to blow your mind, oh no, oh no
So up off the ground, our forefathers are nothing but dust now
Colors fading and frayed at the sides
Laughing in the back of chauffeured cars
Wie in aller Welt sich die Deutschen dann vermehren
Your song
I'll be out of my mind
I ain't got nothing to lose
Phone call rings and your voice is desire
She said "I got a problem with your shoes and your tunes
I must misread what the good book said
Well, love is blind and you're far too kind
In my mind, I'm running round a cold and empty space
We can walk the road, kicking up the dust
So, let's go
Ends extended
And it feels like heaven
Don't take a genius to understand the reason why
You're every thought you're everything you're every song I ever sing
She knew she could go crazy but didn't think that soon
So won't you please show me won't you, give me, baby
When there's noone else in sight
She rings my bell, I got gym class in half an hour
Home will always be here, unseen, outta sight
All my life, I've been searching for ya
And protect the wayward child
Every night I see you standing on the corner
Got a dark cloud that's hanging
All I need is a bumpin beat to bump away my blues
It's like I've seen the light
Don't bring me down wit'cha baby, no
Reign of love by the church we're waiting
Everything that's made is made to decay 
And if it kills me I am going to smile, cause
I'm not your baby and I'll never be
You've got so much to give
The cathedral of reason lets the bells chime
She rises up like a yawn, grips my heart like a claw, splits apart like a jaw, like an eye
Out of sight
It don't make sense to me, but
In the shade, there's still warmin'
One day, I'll be stepping
Nothing good comes easily,
oh the calcium mines buried deep in your chest
Bound to be together
Now if I lived in Russia, I'd have some Chinese children
What would you say was the matter
Mr Postman
You've always got a new bubble to blow
Get off this situation and feel fine
To catch a shooting star
Take a look at the boy like me
Set aside a moment to forget
And you take my kiss
There's no getting it by us now
This land was made for the good of itself
But I tore it all up and then I threw it away
Would it take some hailing Mary's so full of grace to get my sound to you
Because you're sweet and lovely, girl, it's true
And fall on my face on somebody's newmowed lawn
Why would I mind
Burned deep into my brain
You're alone, alone to stay
You smile and laugh, and I feel the love you have for me
We'll come again
Yeah, yeah
Everything is closed, it's like a ruin
But I'm always to shy to work the courage up
More in the mornings
And lead is light as a feather
Ain't got no ticket, ain't got no token
You can talk about Cha Cha
But nothing is all right, all right
Michelle Pfeiffer, that white gold
I'd rather dance with you
I'm always at your service, oh her highness
In this very strange world 
As long as anyone with hot blood can hot blood can
You whisper half thoughts to me
I'll lift you up I'll be the one
'Cause you never made a sound
And the moon is so full
It's gonna come, one thing is certain
My war paint is Sharpie ink and I'll show you how much my shit stinks
So excited baby
They say true love's the greatest weapon
Seventeen company men
that all I wanna do is get off
My time will fade away
So don't hold it
Of the misuse of words used to diss dudes
I see the sadness in all your faces
And pulled my sleeves around my heart
Did we fight, or did we talk
Things happen for a reason
I'm waiting for you to get out of your situation 
Like a flying saucer landing
Have a seat at the bar
You wrote your number on my hand
We have fun we have fun we have fun when we please
It's a bright June afternoon, let's play in the park
I wanna talk to you
And even after all this time Hey
I'm not looking for a way to replace what love can give
Eh, eh, there's nothing else I can say
Adding scars to my heart
Friends are people who are not strangers
Everybody lack confident, everybody lack confident
We love this exaltation woh oh, oooh
Screaming "Big girls, you are beautiful"
From the TV's buzzing in the house
Yeah, they bite
I don't know why you say goodbye
And nothing but good times to share
Before I fling it out into the ocean
Try to treat me like a friend, get another late call
Open up your plans and damn you're free
Imma go 'cause I got no
But I can't sleep with you there by my side
But we could be safer just for one day
I say no
Got this feeling that you can't fight
To a death that's not worth cheating
So I just bend their spoon
Find ourselves a new place to haunt
The neighbors are dead as wood
You're never coming back again, no, no
I don't know if we're ready to take our train
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Don't worry 'cause it's all under control
Move your feet
The view behind the legs of dancers
Breathe, and I'll carry you away into the velvet sky
Everything you want's a dream away
Held each other to the breaking day
Belting out sunlight, shimmering love
This city's nitty gritty but it's so much fun
I can play the guitar like a motherfucking riot, uh
All you want to see is makebelieve, it's nothing
Away from this machine 
Everybody's there
Found your bottle, found your heart
Well he came back and
We are diamonds
There's no time to cry, happy, happy
The wild night is calling
These are days
With my boyfriend
The world lives for the weekends
Heads are holes and clouds
Shake it like a Polaroid picture Hey ya
To the city
Is what you gave to me the day I wandered
So I sat with him awhile
If music is the victim then so am I
If any word that I said
More than a friend
We play in a basement
Oh Recalling of the while we used to drive and drive here and there
Wahwah Here comes the sun
That I no longer feel
I hope you believe me
And don't go finding a replacement,
In your mind
If I told you things I did before
What could come when we realize
Said, "It ain't nobody's business"
That's what you do with no sunlight
Don't take chances
For me to come unglued
What's gonna rock
A curious and enigmatic thing
Magnetic screens that fold in backward
We've become material
But some people really suck
There's never been a reason for
I don't believe in love
But to a writer, the truth is no big deal
Hey brother, it was a nicer time
Forget where they differ and get big picture
And we are homeless, homeless, homeless
Just let me close my weary eyes
Wild as a flower, true love carries on anywhere
In the morning all I could do was sing
I ain't gotta wait for no one
No, you've never left my mind
There's a bitter cold chill in the air
Two days, she's leavin' me again
And shotgun the seat that beats beats
But my birdheart's turning cold
I don't want to fight
What are the forces that try to tease us
Driving slow on Sunday morning, driving slow
We discovered one another stumbling through another summer
You can't be dumb enough to dream so big
But you can't sleep on account of screaming grandkids
Somebody's gotta care
Yeah leave the cold behind
The picture was a masterpiece of comic timing
This is the way that we love And I'm wastin' everyday
And I hope, I hope you are tired out
You'll never get back, yeah
Oh, let's get rich and buy our parents homes in the South of France 
As I walked down the alleyway it was a Sunday
Well maybe I did
But only because we thought 
On a life boat sailin' home
Well, right you are
His eyes begin to flood
Oh happy day,
Or if your birthday fall between June and October
It's a sight that I fear most
Leave the grey macaw in his covered cage
There's something in the air you can't deny
Everything falls apart
Now momma feels guilt, yea momma feels pain
The second hand would pass us by
That's his first words, we asked what it meant
Well if I lived in Spainland, they'd still be Chinese children
You said I lied since the day we met
Beneath the shady tree
Yeah yeah yeah
We celebrate, we celebrate our love
Oh, Cecilia, I'm down on my knees
I drank the water and I felt alright
I wonder if she's been naked in her room since I've been gone
I put a price on what you say
To pass in the night
You'll say I'm thin and bring the washing in
I learn, I see the dreams are made so I'm cooler now
And watched the fires that were reaching
And ease my mind
And all the morning glows anew
It's the music that we choose
They make me feel that you're only what I see sometimes
Shake, shake, shake, Senora
But the other half's at the bottom of the sea
I said aren't you the woman 
Tell your boss he can invoice my ass
You don't know cause it just passes right through you
You're taking everything off
Uptown funk you up come on
And you like to be home most of the time
And I feel alright, 'cause I know tonight I'll be with you baby
Cowgirl king of the rodeo
But I'll buy you brand new shoes if you cross to my side
Increases the chance of misinterpretation 
No more northern skies for her
I say I don't want to pray no
Lamplight makes the shadows play
I got a story, it's almost finished
He's a heap of junk that pours from his top drawer
So just breathe it in
Rumors say that you're very sorry
But it all coincides some way
I'm a victim of fact let's say I loved a girl
We moved out to the places, heart it races
So after all is said and done
They sit back and watch the evil grow from the youth club ruins where the kids used to go
In the palm of your hand
I would tell you, we'd be jailbirds, I'd be winking twice for free
We used to laugh a lot 
There's so many people I know, they're just tryna touch ya
Like a hundred souls
A schoolgirl is denied
When I scream out baby
To a little standing place
I've never felt this way before
Trying to get it through to my friends
Oh, I remember you said can I fight and breathe
Just grab it 'cause it's yours and the empire's dying
And I thank the sun for shining your light
Just that things got so complicateeh
Oh oh everybody's making love
There is something I've been meaning to do,
Dim the lights
In the streetlight dawn
Shout out to the hearts you have known
Oh yeah Oh yeah Oh yeah Oh yeah
It breaks my heart to see you
'Cause love is free
I've been this way for quite some time
Rainbow colours fading to brown
Then it's back on the road again
If you had to go away
So I'm sad and I feel lonely
It's time that you and I sat down and had a little chat
You still don't believe, you don't believe
Not saying that you brought me down all the time
There's no place that I could be without you
But me, I'm feeling pretty good as of now
From the mountains of faith
And I'm still asleep
Out of which only twelve will make it back again
We made a promise to never get old
Are loaded guns to our heads
She comes in colours everywhere
Oh sweet angelangelbearded face
Crowning of the cool kid queen
I took my sister down to the ocean
Sixteen years later, here I go
Who's around when the days feel long
To wander down that oneway road
All we need is a reason
And the bright light of salvation
I'm not in love
And there'll be sun sun sun all over our bodies
They forced their way inside
A trapeze is a bird cage and even if it's empty, it definitely fits the room
Six cylinders underneath the hood crashing and kicking
I say, mmmm, hello, little girl
All right baby come in
My head is spinning all around
Girl, let me love you and show you how special you are
At playtime we will throw the ball
She took an apartment in Washington Heights
Oh, I could hide 'neath the wings of the bluebird as she sings
Take a little time
And I had a lot to tell you but I didn't think you could say it better, oh baby
Danger, heartache
And I don't believe he'll come back
The side she tries not to share
It's like hey you were always there
That dreamy look in your eye
Tonight I wanna be like them but I'll mess it up again
My heart is beating, beating like Ringo
To call my own
Woo ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
That there's people out there in the black
He'll never get
We put on our makeup and work out all the leadins
This song was in my head and now it's in my mind
Just leave the lilac print on the linen sheet
I wanna get better, better, better, better
I knew at least I might just have a chance
I've got my baby
A message you can swallow, 
Take your friends and move them out
I tried to be just a long time ago
'Cause if there is dancing I won't lack fight
Look out for dreams that keep returning
I ride rollercoasters, I try all the cultures
Wherever I'm staying, you're going away
Even if it's just one hour
Our haven on the southern point is calling us
They call me quiet girl
We're feeling so good
For sun kissed golden days
I'm a cool low Jane with a skip on my feet;
Unless the dreamer is the real you
Where I rest my head
And I feel the pain you feel when you start crying
So let's let yesterday go
Word gets in the wind
And if the lights are low they'll never see me frown
Us to surrender
Our hair in the air
Beneath the wormwood, ooh love me so good, they won't hear us screw away the day
Now I can't forget you and it makes me mad
Tell us the name of your
I set up a record player, and a generator
I feel like I'm losing the fight
'Cause I need you more than just for tonight
Some place back there
Out in the sun while we're all soaking wet
Aprender a dar foi o que ganhei
So don't hold back, just have a good time
Felt the joy and the fear
All the clothes hit the floor
Trying to get the girl all the bad guys want
Shiny, shiny pants and bleached blonde hair
When I find love with Uranus
Think I'll grow myself a big ol' hairy moustache
I'm lying in my bed
And a chair and a lamp
To unlock this mystery
And disappear again into a summer's bliss
Say the word
I didn't mean to frustrate you
I guess I lose but life goes on
Sleepyhead Óró mo churaichín, churaichín
Look up the number you know me name
A different city every night
Walk your walk and don't look back, always do what you decide
It's over, Good luck
Now I remember watching that old tree burn down
Oh, I love you, all I love
Cigarettes and lies
Everybody gonna stamp their feet
I'll join 'em talking 'bout whatever everybody talks about
There's nothing I want more and
And it feels so down
Thursday doesn't even start
Hold your head high and reach the top
And I will love your heart with mine
VCR's and motorcars unite on the Seventh Day
Don't understand they're so hateful
Six sorry years and now the gloves are off
Everyday I do this
Good thing there's no mercy rule in love 'cause I would long be beat
You are not so old
I say just use me
And you look like
Sometimes I need to be alone
That won't wipe off your face no matter how hard you try
I said I'm blue babe
Pack up let's fly away
I still need you, but I don't want you now
The skies behind my eyes 
Can you feel it
Here is when we shout
Let's put our money where our mouth is and get out today
Went out and killed herself tonight
Get some new scene to wipe the dirt from everything
What we're doin' when a fatboy's slippin'
Just tell me do ya love me Do ya love me 'cause I wanna know
It don't make me feel bad that we're still friends
That's when love burns
There is no need to deny 
It's time to turn into a frog yourself
That float above me while I sleep
Still am your man
She don't love me like you
Someone else's door
Just give me back my pieces
And we couldn't have even done this if it wasn't for you
It's too dark to discard the life I once knew
Our disappointed hearts will heal
In the van with my friend
You are my candy girl Para, papara
And I need you to make me take my nap 
It's like there's no one else in the room
My hand moves away, you melt dry ice for days
Clouds are shrouding us in moments unforgettable 
The way my soul gets lost in you
Lie back and fast asleep, if you could see what I could see,
With all of the violence crashing around
We spend all day getting sober
You'll see it's all a show
And where's my friend, I wanna hold him tight
Replace it with a UV light
Took her home and nearly made it
Aruba, Jamaica, ooh I wanna take you
Or did I speak too soon
Now I'm back on my beat
Every moment like a sudden pleasure
The rain must fall on everyone 
And you wrote the song I wanna play
We were humans being useless
I gotta feel like it don't make, like it don't make
Just keep walkin' on
Someone who needs me Whoa, for once in my life
I don't wanna be right, right
They said "I hope that you will never change"
To worry about some things
Here comes Mary
I should walk before I run
Hey, get out of my mind
To see you with another man
But it's like trying to tell a stranger 'bouta rock and roll
The motley kids and ugly cast
Hey, come on
In their bereavement, all of her colorful friends turned to a milkygrey depressing blend, 
Sometimes I feel so confused,
Do you see me, baby
Well, a lot of good cars
Backwards through the megaphone
Bedspread bandit since '
Come back round, round, round
Nostalgia's thick as the August air
You keep stopping, should tell your girl more often
I said to her, can it wait
I will learn to love again
Start please start please start
And you're getting all the words wrong
To win the war caused by pain pain
I did not mean to keep you waiting
Gonna change his ways
Got to find a reason why my money's all gone
Say you're true, say to me c'est la vie
You've put a seed inside me
I've looked in the mirror
I feel so caught up in a bud
From my sleep behind the wheel
And they will haunt the streets at night
Think of something, look, look following the crowd
I'm just to hollow inside
But now I'll show that I know
And looking out her window she could more than assume
And let your love bind you to all living things
Near the bed,
She's crawlin' out her window 'cause her daddy just don't care
But then I knew you, I knew you, I knew you
To these tiresome paper dreams
And I feel like I do even more now that
And I'm always gonna wanna blow your mind
I'm keeping the rabbit, the bat, and the reindeer
Yes, I saw her face, now I'm a believer
No time, 'cause I'm running late
All night long believe me
We don't have to tell anyone about our
If you really want to stop it then burn your sperm
Make these bitches wonder what he be in so much trouble for
Throw away the ones that make you feel bad
With every step we take, Kyoto to The Bay 
Play it cool boy
I wonder how you decorate your room
Give a little love
I got tha, mentality and tha motive I'm on a mission
Whatcha gonna have to say for yourself
Well they called me once, and they called me twice
Nothing plays out like it should
Will you choke your children when they spit in your face
A little bit of Jessica, here I am
'Cause you can't run and you can't hide
'Cause I'm falling bad for you
There's a gypsy's face make on my pillow
And I'm mentally slipping
Hey, yeah now
But there's no point in listening
Kick it with the King and let me show you what I mean, man
For your song on karaoke night
Can't say I've felt such twisting
Today I said the time was right for me to follow you Today, said that the time was right to follow you
The happy hooded bluebells bow
I want it all, but there's nothing you can do to stop me now
Oh, next light bust a right
I guess it's time again for me to mention the wordplay
When did your heart go missing, yeah
I'm having a good time having a good time
Time doesn't wait for anyone
When I am with you, there's no place I'd rather be
Yeah, love is an ocean of sweet emotion Sweet emotion
I wanted to sleep forever
Monday morning and it's time to go 
The wonderful thing it does
I'm a shooting star dancing through the sky
Woahohoh, come on, ohohoh, all you animals
Yeah, that's all I gotta do
And I was flashing around and the news spread all over town
Everything we should but don't
While they may depending on your heart and wealth
You've come to the right man because
I wish I could change the ways of the world
And there's a thousand chances to get it right
On the sea bed
Oh well, I guess we're gonna pretend
And oh, underground, I wasn't that far from the tree
Well I know that it's a wonderful world from the sky down to the sea
I still don't know anything about you
So tell me darling, do you wish we'd fall in love
In my mind sayin', "it's gonna be all right"
Ain't nobody's business Nobody
Masking vapor trails from Mercury for a killer on Umbria,
If fear is all that we should fear
You and me, no one else, nothing else but us right now
I'm so in love with you, I'll be forever blue
And climbing the waves
Jeden Abend fragt sie sich
Your feet start tapping, and you can't seem to find
And your mommy suddenly becomes your daddy
Loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah
In this game you lose
When we're driving in our cars, we will sing
Don't you stop 'til the tears run dry 
Make of the people we love
And now I'm always home
Honestly, you can try to wipe the memories aside
Home is when I'm alone with you
I've been up all night and fight to keep out the dawn
You cannot move, so let me in
And a homecoming queen
Clouds drift by and everything is like a dream
Sleep a lot, eat a lot, brush 'em like crazy
Transparent paper wings
In a cavalcade of anger and fear
With the guy, with the guy too shy 
Next day, suck my teste
Let me hear you say it
Giving it up, now you're taking away
Sweet love all night long
And we sleep all, sleep all day, sleep all, we sleep all day over
Just clap your hands But I have no money
These days get so long and I got nothing to do
You've been thinking that your fun is all through now
Sports cars are thrilling
I gotta feelin' that you can relate
We will never part
No I don't believe in the wasting of time,
Stumbling over what to say
Oh, well, we made love
Somebody remind me where I am
Well, it's all right, remember to live and let live
All is love
From the morning
All those days gone forever
Remind me once more where this is going
Always be
There was a dead mouse in your arms
I'm thinking you're the girl I need 
Just for a second the combination of sights, sounds around him
While I try to find words
When someone else instead of me
The wind it has no pattern,
We started out friends, said that you're the kind of man takes every girl for a fool
One coast out to the other, following the sound
Ignore life if you want to babe,
And if it's not a big thing,
Don't be scared of what you cannot see
I tried to make one stick to me
Someday I'm gonna draw from the left side of my brain
I rock the cow girl blues
Leave the cauliflower in the casserole today
Shake and wiggle to a hip hop song
All those bugs buzzin' 'round your head
I didn't know I was broken till I wanted to change
Flying away from reality, whatever ever happened to gravity
They were in the habit of taking things for granted
What my mama and my daddy said was real
Which incidentally made Grey feel inane, so he set off to find a less trite identity,
This city, is sitting
I see a door, holes in the floor
Boy, your love makes me feel like
I want the people in the country to wear flannel shirts
Don't give up; You've got a reason to live
As you step down from the podium
And I'll blend up that rainbow above you
Can you hurl me the game, Oh Starlight Has what you need
She puts her in her arms
Everything is turning grey
That's just the way that things turn out
Calm that wicked wind,
Oh I get by with a little help from my friends
And if you go, you could be gone forever
Saw you standin' there with a smile
Up in my lonely room my room
Ooh ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
"Get up" a voice inside says
Life I love you, all is groovy
in the calcium mines buried deep in your chest
And I need someone
You tell me baby
Flew me to a place not far away
Gentle glowing light
And kept out of sight
Why do I give jealous judgement
Just give me the time and the place, and I'll be there Oh oh
It's just a dream
Robert's got a quick hand
Wake up, kids, we got the dreamers' disease
Gu'fanden do we care
Who can take the rainbow
Better tell them while they're here 'cause
'Cause we gonna wash away
They're gonna help her spend the fortune
Oh baby, do you wanna dance 
Never heard the warning bell 
It's been a long time coming since I've seen your face
And the dreams of my delight
swinging his arms
Seen your eyes
You're entering this town
And in the streets we're running free
Oh honey I'd swim across the Atlantic
I could spin you to hell
It ain't hard for me and dear JoJo to see
I'll take my friends' advice this time
I just wanna have fun
I have faith in my fellow man
Come over come quick come laugh get sick
Lay down your arms
If you want me down, I will get really low
To my left is a window, where did I go
I'd rather not, let's just say I'm starving myself
And the lips that leak seem to know you best
You tell me that the tears of a clown
Feels like I've been standing right here for years
But I'm floating away
When skies are grey, when skies are blue
But then you dance dance dance with the woman that lets you
And there's nothing I can do
You're looking beat but you say "no, oh, no, no"
And if I was a word could my letters number a hundred
I was only a baby
Hey, girl, why can't you carry on Carry on
But give away love GIVE IT
We're caught in a landslide, the minutes come tumbling down
Waiting like a flower to open wide
All night long
You seize the opportunity to get you some rest
She sleeps with the covers down
You got me up so high, yeah heyey
So tell everybody I'm on my way
Flying kites way up high into the blue sky
Worrying about my brother finding out,
It's gonna take time
I'm a sight to see
And I was home in bed
And give me back my broken parts
I'm lost at sea
Moments in time
Grandchildren on your knee
Just to be the man who walked a thousand miles
The thing that I tell you now
That girl is like a sunburn
Rabbit in the hat yeah, so that's why I'm bringing
The scent was perfect in the dusk by the moon
It's a trip on a flip
Understanding you is making me not want to do 
We'll join in with the songs we know
Highclass apartment
Oh, who will care, yeah
Chain smoking cigarettes and three bottles of red wine
Practice makes perfect sense to me
Ain't got no mind
CNN, CNN, Capone and Noreaga, you know what I'm sayin'
I'm not listening when you say goodbye
Nobody likes us
Do you have a heart to feel it
Don't you love in vain
And waking up in the water
As long as, as long as, as long as we can live in harmony, yeah, yeah
It hurts to see you looking so fine
Have you seen a lady fairer
Magic, magic, magic
An open tab when your judgment's on the brink
En Descontroool Yeah ooh ooh
From life to life with me
To follow through your days
If he had to say 'hello'
We're all too busy working, entertaining ourselves
We thank you people for being around
When I arrived in my own set of clothes
Go take a step outside see what's shaking in the real world
And hoping something better comes tomorrow
May come our way
But this feels so unnatural, Peter Gabriel
Can you tell me who will still care
It's a perfect day for making out
And I whip my loving arms around you
I said everybody's gonna love today
Clap your hands if you want some more
Pining away in a heatwave there
Dance with me and we'll be all right,
A plot begins to take shape
Maybe we're diving in over our heads
From all the drugs the one I like more is music
Well, I love you
In the corners I get lost
Maybe you will look into my eyes
That talk is even cheaper told in bulk
For once in my life for once in my life
As if I could live off words and dreams and a million screams
Let's cut to it, my girl for lunch
And I was haunted by a demon in my sleep
To lighten the load
Just to take the money 
Everyday, I'm so happy, baby x
Then I'll say
They were talking in the strawberry swing
Someone is born and someone dies 
I had a dream, it was all a dream 
But if I had someone I would do anything and never, never, never let you feel alone
Let the morningtime drop all its petals on me
Over numbers, unencumbered numbered words
Thoughts has crossed my mind
And when I look into your eyes I knew it was true
You gotta let the water drain in
You'd be a work of art
Returned from the war to a hero's welcome
You can see that birds and worms do not agree
I feel
Make your tongue stick to the sun
Hey, I put some new shoes on
I want your answer so I won't forget
I didn't care, I just bummed from my friends
So come on, come on
Dance a little stranger show me where you've been
I like where you sleep
Put your arms around me baby
I want somebody to love
This is the way
Breaking barriers, tearing walls like it's berlin
Away from everyone
I'll meet you tomorrow, sort of late at night
And you, you gots the mud
Though she was born a long, long time ago
Gonna drink my hardearned pay woo hoo
But fine lines I don't see
We're gonna see the sunlight
We caught another white snake tonight
Let's go away, let's go away To stay in a heartbeat
I guess there's just a part of me that likes to bring you down 
Hold on, hold on
Because there's a few more things beautiful than Spring 
Smile when you feel the sunlight
Getting nowhere sleeping somewhere 
A Rhodesian Ridgeback, off the beaten track
I've been waiting for you
I've been a new sensation
Oh well, it's safety dance
You know my name�ha
Did your mom get back from her business trip business trip
Uh, uh, can't let you go
Away with the small ideas I know I'm not the only one
 years remain in a trash can
It started with a mix, 
I'm turning my head up and down
To break some fragile backs 
Saturady's so far away there's so mush shit to shirk,
And, eh, there's nothing else I can say
Well, I've been thinking 'bout all the places 
In a crossfire kind of new reality show
Why would I get burned down Oh why would I
At night time I'd lie in Beckenham Park
Never running in the streets, leaving me all alone
Don't stop now, no no no oh, oh, oh, oh, I feel fine now
I've got one hand on the steering wheel
Then winter moves into summer fires
You're caught between the devil and the deep blue sea
Everyone, everyone, everyone, everyone
Just like the waves
Und falls du mal kein Rücklicht hast
My My Time flies Maybe we could be there soon
Now looking back on all the days gone by
But if there's trouble she's got the moves
Oh dear
I take it out on my good friends
The only thing at all
Just leave me alone up in the broad daylight
Tropical iceland
The winter is long in the city
When every other part of life seemed locked behind shutters
So just get off my case
And it don't, don't make sense
I sent a message out into the dark
I can't help but look, thinking that everyone doesn't get it
Twisting all through the night on the terrace
Wegotta kick that gangster shit
And it's quite scary when you wake up in the same old clubs
Upon an endless trail of moonlight
In body, in deep I saw you creeping
All the winds are changing without fail
Always look on the light side of life
'Til her daddy takes the TBird away
Is another dream to ashes 
Don't let me colour your opinion
It's already in my mind, inside
But your empty eyes
Too afraid to open your eyes
Things that are right in front of me
You're running to lose
Praying that the holy water don't go dry get it, get it
We need a holiday
And to this day
I always know
I could start over clean
Say the sweet little things that Make me cry
But there's no escaping your love, uh
When the sun goes down
High five, look up, look alive
I love God all the same
And finally we rested
With mountains, lakes and the human race
No one else could heal my pain
'Cause every little thing gonna be all right, I won't worry
Oh, hey, I put some new shoes on
Hold back the river, hold back the river, hold back the river
They think I know shit 
It's too big to swallow
Oh yeah it's no reason to go crazy
They get nostalgic about the last ten years
I'm about to break it down,
Just say the words, and we'll beat the birds
It's a long way, oh, joker, to let the fire burn
Got brown skin, I'm a West Londoner,
That I could love you like you want me to
They are the roots that will weave through the floor
And I can say that I have
Junkyard fool with eyes of gluegloomblue 
And reveling in energy that everyone's emitting
She never waits too long
Just don't use me up I say
I was dressed for winter
East or West well home is the best
There's too much riding on that anyway
Bring your congregation someday
The pay was ok but I didn't like to swab
And girl you got that body
Did he asked, if I would come along
I'll crawl the sandy bottom of Puget Sound
Said everybody's gonna love today
Can't get no rest, keep walkin' around
We must live while we can
Is this the kind of fate you could contemplate, a breakdown at my very sight 
But getting used to this is hard
Crossed his eyes
Our days are as the wind blows us,
'Cause we've gotta figure out
I'll trade your broken wings for mine
Boom boom boom tick tock boom
They don't think what they say
And the way it's gonna be
In front of the other one
You'll be damned to pining through the windowpanes
And his father's not the man he'd like to grow up to be
In the middle of the night
The way we've been made to live
On such beautiful days
Now see how the two colors blend, my friend
You're right back where you started 
So he sits and lets the current take him
I you keep tearing out the pages of an alibi
But we're all in this together
I must learn to deal with this disease
You don't need poltergeists for sidekicks
Mornings eleven, the feelings are severed
Couldn't you have stayed on your feet
Of girls and their emotions
To do more things like that 
You know I've seen her in her uptown world uptown world
And you're bursting with pride
Sucking the white light Indians
You can sleep on the floor, 
Thinking Oh is it love
Wear your shoes
And we looked at them eleven ways
Address to places like Abbey Road
I wish all the pretty girls were shaking me down
To confront his own fears
They call me hell
She met another blind kid at a fancy dress
Here comes the zoo
Some big thunder law forces me to eat shit
Neptunian blues that eyes forgot Blues that eyes forgot, eyes forgot
My love is so good
But it never feels right
I'd sing the song that I sang then
It's a hop to a step to a jiggity drop
And I need you to recognize my friends 
You're still miles away
Oh, my heart ached, but I know fate
Mexican waitress
And I give a thank you to my father for not raising me
'Cause one of us is gonna die young
Fly, fly, baby don't cry
I fooled ya in school, yeah
Sleep, I sleep every day
You don't relate to me, no girl
I'm gonna chill the marrow in their bones
But if you do it right it is sublime 
The end of December, what's going on
Hold each other close the whole night through
They're gonna wash away
We feel a little pity but don't empathize
It doesn't get me down and I feel OK
With a showing of hands, who's going back to the south
I got up to wash my face
I was tired, I was hungry, I fight
But, baby, what you want I just don't got it
But all I ever find my love
A small thanks note written in French is no shorthand for
You get high
Awoo arf
When I felt the way that I do right now, right now, right now
Does love buzz because that's what it does
We'll take the trail marked on your father's map
I'd rather dance, I'd rather dance than talk with you 
Everybody fades away
I feel alihahahive and the world's turning inside out,
We could stay here till closing time
Better keep your head up, keep it on the up and up,
We are golden, we are golden
Junior high legs; blond hair gone brown
"What can I say"
To your golden age where they tuck you in at night
From a seat on a whirling waltzer
Uh, days of our lives
Une brume et d'embrun
As many fits into an army tent
The sound of our voices made us forget everything
Till everything's forgotten
So please can you stop pulling my hair
I know it's overdue there's a key to the door, 
Searching all the crowded streets
There are stories in the soil, loose leaves cover the ground
To breathe again
Girl, you might hold your breath 
Óró mo churaichín ó My beard grew down to the floor and out through the doors
Everybody will die
'Cause you're there when to talk and you're there not to stop and you're with me
For romance is
I used to get mad at my school Now I can't complain
Momma cat, Tommy cat, diapers on my clothes line
We don't need those diamond rings
Ooh baby, yeah
For once in my life
I ain't gonna live that way
You think I look alright with these mascara tears
I get kind of hectic inside
Another big bang and you're down on the floor
Tuesday gymnastics
Everything, everything's magic
Beat of the song
What you gonna do when it all breaks down
But I still see clearly when I see you smiling
It's this one thing, I want to admit it
Come and ride with a nigga right quick, a'ight
For seeing lost opportunity
I just want to fly
I want the whole sea an endless cherry street
They come and watch us bleed
Smile at the man when you wake up in his bed
Hawaiian notes, don't need no pounds
We goin' down town, oh yeah x
You're anything but classy
You make my dreams
Underneath the moon
Oh, honey pie
Suddenly all comes back
Would be the one to kneel
Then I waved goodbye to you 
Lord I got high 
Three times that I told you
Some people write the songs that stay inside our souls,
It was some time in early September
But, long on time
She's got super human eyes
It made me very cold
I can live in honesty
Far away, to stay
You take a lover for a dirty weekend, that's ok
Girl, I gotta have you
We're a thousand miles from comfort, we have traveled land and sea 
Be my holiday, yeah
You make me runaway baby,
And to those of you who mourn your lives through one day to the next
Forgiving, faced the seventh year
'Cause somebody once said when I was young
Maybe a handful of silver or a hundred bucks
I still wear these worn out jeans
And in the morning you'll know all you know
Tabletop pleaser
All rejoice is all we are when in her hands
And I've got platinum vision and a tin foil touch
And damn sure do a lot more than FEMA did
Ooh baby, baby, dancing in the moonlight
And still your heart
This is getting out of hand
Doctor says, come on, eat your pills
Now where's the woolen sweater
We take life slow
They don't make stationery like this where I'm from so fragile, so refined
Even now I'm holding my breath for you
Come on now, yeah, come on, now,
In the moonlight, on a joyride
I feel them when you're gone
Sky is grey bit more than ever
"What didn't you tell me"
The gangs are out
I feel my heart underneath my skin
Until a day when there was one
The show isn't over, but I'm long since gone
Looking for a guy guy
That I'm your man
Woohoo ohoh oh
It's easy if you do not run
Yeah ayeah, you make amy dreams come true
All my days inactive will be justified
And the only film I saw, I didn't like it at all 
For misguiding our youth, they're the ones to blame
Around us, and stick to what we know
For the folks back home, I will make them proud
Occasionally guarded, just keeps us surrounded
Friends help you shift into a new place
LA parties in the phony lands
I got a question for you
Upside down
We're different and the same, gave you another name 
Darling, hold my hand
Twist and turn on a lonely road
Is 'cause I was never broken by you
And the baskets weave with your mothers strength but the ones we'll never keep
It's neither here nor there, but shake your derriere
The friends that I have and the shoes we're not shining
Swallow pride but spit out fire
No doubling back now
And fellas, you got to watch it
We're taking our chances here on the run
So put your faith in a late night show
And death's the final word
She sees my plane in the ocean
Hello big family who's gonna cook the noodles today
And now the truth of it is, is I wanna be like you
Ariella are you sleeping
I don't wanna be right
Home, let me come home
I can't believe I'll be bright for another
Celebrity parties, the red carpet mile
Such a big day
We'll be rollin' on up
Touch the fingers of my hand
And in the daylight we can hitchhike to Maine
From the pornographic page
From skating all my days
Who can take a sunrise
Take away my record deal
You know it don't mean a thing to us
You know I need you, girl,
So I'm burning the thoughts of the things that I once said
Pouring out of your mouth
I need to know
Taking heed for everyone
I found the truth beneath your lies
Make me walk, make me talk, do whatever you please
I gotta feeling
Plus you're the best kisser that I've ever known
Boy your touch makes me feel like
I don't need a reason not to care what you say
They say ooooooh wee
Put a penny in the slot and watch the Drunken sailor boy dance
Heart stopped beating
Everybody's gonna hide out back
But what would Frank Lloyd Wright say
Try something new 'cause it ain't over
You were going to a dance
All my life
There's nothing like finding gold
Up so early, feel so bright 
It felt so sweet, it felt so strong
Around at his house,
Perched on a lawn chair and staring into the sky
And meet an old man to present my plea
And recall my treasuresearching days
I crawl around behind you in the shadows place
And this life is a beautiful one,
Tell me what your point is in defense
I didn't mean to hurt you
But don't let me fall
But he's coming for you, yeah, he's coming for you, wait
All in a single night,
Vom leuchtenden Saft mit der feurigen Kraft,
When your word comes up
Of any sort, then please don't go
A paper sack
But no I'm not alone
It's a little onesided but that's all right
Got the waiting cab, stopped at the red light
When we come to them
Oh now look to the east
Whose that guy, I don't know
Different voices different tones all sayin' "yeah, we're not alone"
When it does, I ain't looking back
It started in my eyes
See how sad the real fun gets with the morrissey girls
The time is short You know we only live one life
'Cause last night he got a visit from the
Said, I was never young; I've always felt beguiled
Got lucky, beautiful shot
How many acres, how much light
We'll run away together
The moonlight lingers softly in the air,
But I've found my friend
In the dark, for a while now
Finding trust and love is not always easy to make
I don't need no tv, I don't need no news
But I've been waiting, I've been waiting, I've been waiting, yeah
And nothing is worth winning without a fight 
Soak it in the sun and make a groovy lemon pie
Sometimes that's just how it is
And that's okay
I'd hope I'd be up 
All painting gorgeous time
And I cried as cameras caught my eyes
Will somebody wear me to the fair 
Get away from the door
Yo, yo Melvin Flynt drop, my whole collasso stop
Tired father at the bus stop hey bus driver take him home
With all your power 
I'm done dreamin' that we can fly
We can leave your friends behind
They say that they don't know me anymore
The tapestries turn
I tripped on my way in, got kicked outside, everybody saw
And the linens
A  minute lecture
My baby, my darling, I've been takin' a beating
Looking at life from the perspective of a boy
Now you're certain enough near a man free
There's nothing in between
You give to the next one
No curses, writing bout our girlfriends
La lagune se maintient
But I just plan to live the rest of my life
That you don't make me wait, and never let me break
Eh, eh, oh yeah
And curses through your door
It's the mess that feels so right
I know Professor Blumen makes you feel like a woman 
"I got booked last night I need another fix, dig"
And although not really, it might not even come true
You need consistency
No one's around
We are grown but cannot see
Shit And look at me can't think of anything better to do
She say she got a man why she lookn' at me
Everyone is slipping backwards
And there's a rose in a fisted glove
Carved in your name with my pocket knife
I sit in the window watching my days from a safe distance
Show me what you've got underneath
Three steps till I finish mine 
I look up to my right, and there you are
How my heart laments
But the songs that make me dance along
'Cause nothing else can compare
Can't show me
Oh, I'm a little child
I always thought you were pretty like a whip
He lost the scene, there's something wrong
So feel the air, feel the air,
Zero chance of rain,
We can hang around by the ppppool, oohhoo oohhoo hang by the pool
Cause you forgot
Walking on the golden line
I would have liked you anyway
All the animals together break it down let me hear ya
Well I met an old man dying on a train
The house is quiet now and everything inside, it seems to know she's gone
Your body's a dream that turns violent
I can sleep twelve hours
I hate people that think that I care what they think
I am floating away
You can plant any one of those
Plunge your hand, rip out my spine
Our differences would be the end 
It don't sit so pretty when it's looking straight at you in the eye 
Just remember that the last laugh is on you
No I got nothing at all
When I get some money imma buy me some time
Ohh, talking 'bout the magic
If you wanna have a good time
Become bitter from our loneliness
From our hats to our feet
Where everybody's hanging out just like they hung out before
The drunken dames
But I chose to evolve and got myself from out the gutter
Hey, wait a minute
Damn right you got me good
I said your kisses are nice, 
Behind movie scenes
Live your life with arms wide open
And move on, and move on, and move on, and move on,
Don't you hear that rhythm
A backless dress and some beat up sneaks
I love you baby rest of my life
To get this off the ground
Byebye blues
So I hope there'll come a day when
She told me about the winds from Santa Ana
Honey, from the gal
What I want, you've got
We'll take a ride downtown
Says he's got a fast boat, talk about high speed
The place and the time where we knew everything could go wrong
Yes I am the man who wont come breakn' your heart
Everybody's gonna love today
I've got a family, and I drink cups of tea
I couldn't turn it around
So please
But you're just so cool, run your hands through your hair
Next time, at a party
But then she started to moan
Yes, tonight I have to
Of an eighteen year old who didn't know what loss was
And all your thoughts been left to drown
Well, it's all right, if you live the life you please
When electric hearts
The fishes leap up to take a look
Deli markets with their flower stands
Talk about, taking breaks
Like a queen in days of old
And the grease in the hair
'Round and around and around and around
Thursday, I don't care 'bout you
Do you remember the time I knew a girl from Mars
Gimme what I need or give a little sign
"Death campaigns are a fucking gold mine"
It's me against a wardrobe
What do you know This house is falling apart
Please repeat the message
Sometimes I feel so full of love, it just comes spilling out
No candy in your till
I saw Johanna down in the subway
I got your days I got your days
What was left now is right
Stuffing my face and now
Let every second step in boots on snow
Back in school again
The youngest was the most loved
Then put it all together
LOVE love, it's coming back, it's coming back
Started having hiphop, pops didn't buy it
Living with no reason, dwarfed, alone, imprisoned
I know that it's time
The hedge shake, the last living rose
A world that I built on my own
So my sister went kissing a mapleskinned boy
Didn't have a word to say
You're the only one that I want on my back
But you have never ever felt it like you feel it right now
You never know what might be coming your way
And the entertainment saccharin
And I have left a million stars
Lets go fishing for a dream
But I'm still not sure what's going on
On my way, on my way
Feel the bass in ya face
One day girl
Oh, they'll split before they part
And it came off in the rain
But that's enough, the love is over
Heyo hey we are the second, you're minutes behind
Said, mamamamamamamamamamamamoney, oh
Den enda regeln är att du ska ha sa jävla kul och du ska
I tried to discover, a little something to make me sweeter,
From your mouth to your hands to the floor you're babbling syntax
I know it sounds like the same old line
'Cause if this is what we've got,
Anywhere anymore you are what I'm looking for
Watching the laughter play around your eyes
These lips will find strawberry wine
Tonight I'll dream while I'm in bed
If she doesn't beat me, well brother she tried
When I was a river dried up
Chris Schwartz, RuffHouse, he was the best man
I'm a girl's best friend 
Now face west
You're a butterfly in the wind without a care
I can take my clothes off
Sometimes it feels like life has no meaning
You watered me down till
First five hundred bitches went crazy we he let 'em ons in
It's not right, it's not right 
Time long time ago
Was it not sick when we came across three men
The starlight above my hometown
I want a shot at redemption
Where is the book
Whistle blowing love is dead 
I can see what I need 
This time I'll get it right This time I'll get it right
Any day I'll come back thinking that if one is against me
But I'll stay in love, in love with you
So shine forever
I'm on top of the world, 'ay
I like what you say
It's starring me and my sweet thing
I feel the chemicals kicking in
In the hills and highlands
But I'm the luckiest guy 
You seem to be sunk, life is no race
In so far to know the measure of love ain't lost
I'm still crying all night and all day
You're bringing out all the colours,
Kicking us back down to the suburbs
The rest is out in the cold
Fly away to what you want to make
I've got a perfect body
The time it takes to get from here to there
But it can do what it want whenever it wants and I don't mind
There's a city I saw signed Something
So that's fine, yeah come by we'll take the afternoon off
Let's call out all our fears right now
If you actin' menace I can pick another hoe
'Cause I know I'm growing up to be a better man
Before they open their mouth
She's my uptown girl
Nolita flat on rent control
Away get carried on a reign of love
Yeah, she's kind of friend indeed
An interesting way of life
He's changing fashion, the way he dress
Finding you, a voice is found on a missing page
Don't call it a trend 
We lay on the bed there
Now there's a majesty at, my doorstep
What a lovely seaside holiday away
The moonlight sleeping on a midnight lake
Messes with my head
Thinking about the time we share
I'm legless at sea
Until you're fully grown, you've got a real good shot
The free world
But I can safely say
That makes you wanna grab your lover's hand
I'm holding it all tonight
I hear you calling,
The greatest of men, sir
We're gonna rattle this ghost town
The clouds and rain
Track the beating with a chart
Gonna look you right in the face
"It's a might big world
Can't feel no pavement right under my feet under my feet
At least you got your nest and
All over La Jolla Inside, outside, USA
It starts to call on me
And if I lose my patience, oh yeah
This little story keeps repeating itself
Barcelona  It was the first time that we met
The engine hums, a humble tune
Put your hands on the ground
He would never take a bullet for you
And I, I'm never letting you go baby
Everywhere in town is getting dark
As I recall, you were looking out of place
You collect lovers like gem stones,
This is all that I will say
Last night we had a rendezvous
Come on, come on, I wanna hear you whisper
Get back here
It's such, it's such a perfect day
Jump in and go and we could drive for years
I just got myself to blame
How the hell am I gonna tell him Elvis already took first base
You just say those words, and we'll beat those birds
Maybe we were born to run forever
Turn everything red and the beat is complete
But all her looks were too sad
Wasn't always gonna be this way,
You're putting on an awesome show
Walk down streets
See the moon alone
You mined what you died for 
Just like the one before
And my way
Me far away from my wise
Yes, tonight I have to leave it
I love the way you dress
Get carried away
These bandages are anonymity
And break the rules
Will you say,
And then one day, those who would passing well they passed on
The closer that you get
And that's no fool
I fell right through the cracks
Nothin' else but us right now
On a therapist's couch, with his face to the ground after fucking around countless nights
Is this the way to carry on 
A way through all these damn street signs
Who always inhales
My girl's name is Senora
So what if this world just throws me off the edge
When she places them in front of you
Check it out, I'm rocking steady
Ooh, Tonight the stars are so bright
It was always you and me, just me
When I feel the whole world falls apart
They got yesterday's heroes in last night's clothes 
Well, I woke up in a car
She broke my heart, I wanna be sedated
And I wanna feel it too
And I don't care where the bus stops
I'm glad it's your birthday
September, as far as she remembers
Seconds in a day 
How you got there, so just blow your mind
It's mama calling my name
We've got to eat some of them
Always heading towards
Cause this is going to be the best thing we've ever seen
I'll stop the world You've seen some changes and it's getting better all the time
Walk away 'cause you're breaking up the girl
Well, no way to say and there's nothing I can do
No one gets high on themselves
The front page is all your pictures,
Will you wake if I open the door
'Cause you steal my soul when you leave
You look like the songs, oh oh oh oh
Don't look down no no Go go underground
One, a bit right then we got two
Come on and let us in
Follow a straight line to the brink
As they surround,
Swirling, soothing all the time gives me a thrill
Maybe it's not right
The rap world like, what's all this commotion
I spent my childhood lookin' at the stage
But it'll be back tomorrow same time again
And name
A letter to sign, 
Sitting in restaurants
Don't wanna know bout something that you don't understand,
Yes I really need you
And do you ever lay awake at night
When all you do is stay and play in your computer games
We'll have drinks and talk about things
Caught your hand inside the till
Never get tame Grownup and lame Yeah Yeah
Ever fallen in love with someone
We'll turn out all of the lights and set this ballroom aglow
I ain't trying to do what everybody else doing
I'm in love with a girl, sees what you are what you are
In case our timing is right
And I don't give a damn if you don't like me
You look like someone
I'd rather waste my time with her
In a canvas covered wagon stuff with apples and with guns
Ain't got no cash, ain't got no style
These rocks have always given
Like it never been done
You're so scene, listening
Everyone says now or never
I get under your skin and I sebaceously form
Constructed to keep one's goods on one's own shelf
This time is yours, this time is mine
Throw me into the sea for my ability
Opna augun
And it can its way to the top
Crept up to my head
Make it my fault, win the game
He'll never get to say
Up to the weather vanes and the tops of trees
* He sings "the radio" but mimes "my radio" in the official video
To live like this all the time
I've played that song from long ago
When you talk sweet things in my ear
Yeah, I know that I left you all alone
If you take a trip through my mind
Bought JayZ's CD with my own cash, man
So I could go into the sea
So I walked on pretending that you still belong
Tu m'as dit "J'ai rendezvous dans un soussol avec des fous
And words come out, words come out like
You love to run
How I hope that you're happy
The lights go out and everybody screamed  team 
With the wings that god will give you someday
When passion turns into greed
Like the land joining the sea
There's just mareseatoats
You are
Say whatever we think actions are
I'm so scared, but I don't show it
They're gonna back up
All the roses blossom into skulls this season
Gave me love, babe, now it's over
My senses say that I should tell
Name the place, I'll be there,
Got my feet, got my toes
I wilt just like a fading flower
Got a taste so sweet I swear this beat
How can a body contain something so great
That I would love everything that you do
Remaining in our lives together
You're the best we've got going
Here comes my Chinese rug
Oh no, oh no, no you're not the one
Never stood on my own two feet
Makin' our time
Mastercard or Visa
And I can't beat the feeling
With anything I do
Still it made us kind of happy and it kept me off of drugs
When it's almost supper time
Then play along and catch a cold
It ain't nobody's business No
Don't need no coffee in my cup
Which way will the wind blow
And they will steal and they will fight
So you better get on your feet
To swim beneath or over outside till they're reading between the lines
And I watched as Summer turned quiet 
About how crappy I felt, not realizing how many other people would relate
Well, one look and I yelled "timber"
I'm all cried out 'cause I grew up cryin' 
My mind's tired, I've Ooh worked so hard all Ooh Worked so hard all week Ooh, all week
You're my love, whoaohohoh
Every move you make
She is my salvation in the dark
The way to my heart
Tambourine style, walking in a single file
We were walking up to strawberry swing
'Cause I'm down on my knees
Righteous men of the earth
It's silent down here, hey I want to get loud again
In a heartshaped hotel room
Oh how I hope that you're happy
And my heart beats faster
Devastator, in a negligee, does a strip tease while he sings this song
Can you feel my love, my love, my love, my love, my love my love
Do you feel lucky tonight Just go out in the night
I used to love the taste, I would do anything for it
If I looked out of a
I'm so hard for the rich girl
I'm kinda mixed up in this disco inferno
Common and breathless, shrugging at what they've become
Mountains grow from just a stone
Go, baby, go baby, go
Down in Times Square
Well, I can see, I can see, I can see the story's starting to arc
The big collector from the start
You've denied me baby,
I'm just, I'm just, I'm just a man stuck pushing some wheel
It's alright
Sick of dressing like a human when I'm feeling like a leopard
If you ain't got no soul, that's fine, alright
I'm gonna be the man who wakes up next to you
You know my name
Still I'm the only one who seems to care 
Wasn't a rapper then I coulda got a pop deal
You don't know what's right anymore
I don't care what they say about us anyway
Don't care about all the pain in front of me
The man from Galilee
Choke, choking on a wishbone in the firing line of lovers who will never slow down
Is that a new boy stuck on your shoe
So sweet I can hardly speak
Come go with me, we've got it made ooh Go, escapade
She's only one step away
There ain't nothing too high
Lets put on moonlight mile
Oh damage
Tune on my lips and my quest in reach
Hey get out of my way
With a couple of gold coins
And gone upon your quiet way Quiet way
I've got a cure, hold tight
Oohoohhoohooooh hoohoooohoohoohoohooh
You misunderstand me,
Should you be blown back
Momma still wants you home for supper
Well the girls can't stand her
"Lets make the world's stupidest stand and truly mean it
There's a picture opposite me
It's all right
There's a way
Calling, calling, falling, falling
You say that I changed
I'm burning through the night
And I can feel fire in the night waiting here
Clark Kent just signed Das, he didn't want us
I've been spending my time in the old town
When they told you to clear the room, that's when it hit you
I'm closing up a bag of air and wire
Doesn't matter if I take my time
I start choking on my pencil
And if it's worth your time, I've got ten digits
I want to go on a mountaintop
Did you feel it
You drove me crazy, but I don't know, baby
The Jehovah's are standing by your door
Are we just faces in the crowd
As a broken man
So many ups and downs and nothing's changed
Climate change and debt, I still want you
I'd like to go out taking a shower
Call the cops and arrest you this time
A house was built, a baby born
But we could spend the night together
And I can see them looking at you
The parttime jobbers at a call center
You can't find the words to say
I keep sketching birds, that are all like herds
The life she had
It still brings a smile to my face
It's fresh, so heavy, hear it breaking down
When did your heart go missing
For my baby and for me, ha, ha, ha
You're out with your friends
Then the enemy dropped a bomb
So this is why I say
There may come a day
You are a thunderous thing, wonderous king
And my heart beats big before it drops
Oh baby, give it to me
Inside of my heart you're here
And he came running out of the water
My car is ugly but then I'm ugly too
Daydreaming, daydreaming into the night and I'm alright
Abandoned as a summer cat
Even the songs you thought I'd never sing
Chocolate candy, Jesus Christ
When there's nothing in her bed at night 
She holds him, though, he probably won't remember it
All the things we've written in it
I forgot the colours that the grass tend to grow
Out of words
Moving forward using all my breath
Had a conversation with you at night
I said I never ever thought that you'd be messing 'round
Live like I'm still in the yard till I pop ya god
I feel love, honestly
Of livin' in the hood where the shots are fired 
Double D chicks huggin', I got racks on racks
If you listen to your words then he might like what you say
Why don't you just go away
Though London girls aren't snobs at all
Eleanor, how you put one on disguises
Strange light shimmering over the sea tonight
And if I fall
Although they did not feel, no
In the basement of words we knew, there were more of us
But I've also had the feeling Yes
Man I was mean but I'm changing my scene
But time is often on my side but I give it to you tonight
I don't give a fuck about goin' home
And we in control of the whole damn place
Damn right, you got me good
Hey, love's gonna get you down Lollipop
Beyond your darkness, I'm your light, oh
Rolldown gates look the same
For a kid with the will to funk
I find more missing every day
But it's too late to turn your age around she's not the one you want
You can see that life's for us to talk about
Mr Pleasant is kind
You need another man
The porter smiles to me
Nobody else is in your room
A brand new car
Woo ooh ooh ooh ooh
Spread the word and be like me
"Who am I to work so much less
And the weeks fly by and the years roll on
People, happy people
Just write the answer on my hand
Coming towards her, stuck still, no turning back
I see my name in shining lights, yeah
Can you cut, I can cut, 'cause I'm a rough gem 
And whether we're supposed to or not, we still will
But you disappeared on me
I can't beat the feeling
Like the moon and the stars and the sun
My sisters and my brothers of every different color
If you have to come and choose a name"
I'm still wondering why
Why does it always seem like I've never won
To a river so deep
Oh, I'll get 'em back in a few more tries
It's like , , , okay
Should we pretend that it's the end
I shoulda known better not to wait around
But you can get back home, you can get back down;
I don't know where the sunbeams end and the starlights begin, it's all a mystery
Bird outside the kitchen fighting his reflection
A time outside this common notion 
And the sky is fallin' down
Somene else's date
You I see Will see My dream Your dream for real Come true
And though I see it coming undone
But you, I'm just an illusion you don't seem to care I wish that I could
I've got a cure for its crimes
And all the lines of your life
And I've got nothing left to lose
Because a part of you will die
I'm ready for this, you stop me falling
But I'm not afraid to have an eloquent boy at my door
But I don't think right now you care about anything at all
Clap along if you feel like a room without a roof
I see the way the wind blows
By the way you smell I can tell that you're fifteen
There is a feeling I love;
The sun is out
Showed me how to love again
Well she'll have something to say about it but
Too far from the floor this time
We have a good time with you
But there's nothing else inside it
Someone takes his pants off and the rafters knock
I'm on sunshine baby yeah
Shake it, shake it, shake it, like your booty got a seizure
We won't stop until somebody calls the cops
As a Pabst Blue Ribbon unravels woo hoo
As if to pray to the gods of the festival
well, there's a reason why the last is smiling wide 
But they are all imaginary
Wednesday, Thursday
You can feel, but you won't sing
Now I feel silly
There was a time I was down, down
Waste my days
My cellular, bananular phone
You get more
I played video games in a drunken haze
You can see that birds and worms don't get along
I got da da da inside my head
Tell me that we'll always be together
That I believe in afterwards
Think about a new destination 
It's sending the boys on the run in the time in the hot summer sun
"Time isn't kind or unkind," you liked to say
Apparatus to the ground
I don't dare to think of you
And I got on with making myself
I'll get that car to start
Alone though Shit, he just doin' what he known for
So out of date, that only you could understand
But with a little bit of money we could buy us a car
'Cause we're all, we're part
Locked up inside my opium den
Stay here, my dear,
Until the day that I die for the first time
Of everyone's contentment and you
Good times around the corner, I swear it's getting warmer
Silver hammer man
Of language
Ring ring ring ring ring ring ring banana phone
Then you know who you are
We all need something,
Where the horizon and the rooftops meet
Perhaps its time I settle
Secure life, baby, you should
Of familiar faces
You will not back up an inch ever,
And there are twisted days that I, take comfort
Fog rolling down behind the mountains
The nightingales are singing loud
Wouldn't change your mind, non pas du tout
Your head, come on, is dead and gone
I want to take you far from the cynics in this town
And even if time is passing me by a lot
It was the middle of summer in Texas
I'll be shaking at the sight
Everybody gonna dance tonight
Everything will go on it's own way
I can't walk through life facing backwards
There's so much for the kids to do
You've build for climbing towards me
You've got to
Count to one, two, three
Don't let it grow
But keep the fives, twentys, tens and Bens completely separate
Like guardian angels it's always near
Yes I'm on my way
Translation not sung
This maudlin career has come to an end
On the same greasy street
Ya estas aqui y mi mente exploto, 
And when you notice that your heart is bleeding
I was alone, I took a ride
And how I wish I was an ocean
I reason with my cigarette
'Cause baby you start
I have to let you know
Lookin' over crossed eyed
To More Than One Dimension
Oh, she hates to be alone
You're hangin' 'round, yeah, you're there too
I never say anything at all
We'll be handinhand down in the park
There's a shortcut through the forest that smells
And if you are a deity
'Cause I couldn't really stand it, I'd admit that I was wrong
I'm just thankful to be facing the day
'Cause nothing can hurt us
I don�t fall in love, I don�t fall in love
Come home with me
My city shakes the fear in me
Just tryin' to get by
I can dream realistically 
And I managed to sleep alright
And you try a little harder each day to be
I'll write down letters inside letters but I can't let her see
A small boy from a poor house
I am the only one just until you finish this year
There's an empty street
Oh, I lack what the world can't give me can't give me
In the middle of a dream I call your name
Girl let's get it poppin' Crackin'
Got to love, got to love
Fresh tears leaving nervous on me
We played golf on the moon
I want to be like water
How can I get any rest now
The craziest thing of all, over ten years have gone by
Our plane is sleeping on a cloud
I used to be cruel to my woman
You'll catch 'em surfin' at Del Mar Inside, outside, USA
It doesn't matter what you ask, it's who you're asking
But hey man, now I'm really livin'
Her lover
Will you be there to carry my load
Red wax, it paints me unclear
Sometimes it creeps up on me and before I know it
And always look on the bright side of life
We're walkin' into the fields
In the thick of the evening when the dealing got rough
Cradled in our dungarees
Let's not stop
So where did you go Where did you go
They were put up there to keep us apart
Feeling better than I ever felt before today
You can trip on my
Human law, automatic oracles
No me tengas mas consideración
The man nearly flipped to learn that he was free
I would surely still find
We should spend the night in a small hotel like this
Take our time
Yeah, 'cause we can get down
Blinking in the morning sun
Gimme just a little break
Drum the beat of a heart I can't defeat
But when I lean in you just turn your head away
Fun, fun, fun now that daddy took the TBird away
Of falling in love
'Cause my eyelashes catch my sweat
She told me she loved me like fireworks
Moving on forward
It's moving through town as big as a train
From all around the world
It's too small for people
The reason for aviation
You know that you're cutting ties when you cut in town,
Trapped inside a fantasy
Before the sun would come 
I remember the day when I could walk right down the streets and feel so confident,
That I will love you
Ooh, Ooh, One of us is gonna die young
And now the sky is such a sweet blue,
You looked a lot older
While you're getting restless
And when I touch you, I feel happy inside
Tttttthings are never gonna be the way you want
And no, well this won't be a sad song
Have you ever wondered if oceans can freeze
Shaking at the sight of you
Ritalin's never gonna feel the same
But you like it, so say "Thank you"
When we're apart whatever are you thinking of
Scootch over closer dear
She's my one desire
Just love someone more than yourself
I've boarded up all the doors
Parliaments
It's where your heart goes, 
There's a whole floor before us,
Revolution has come
This woman is my destiny
Herzlich willkommen im Nirvana
Daydreaming, daydreaming all the time A dream is all I have
I'm learning to let in all the laughter
You've only got what you've just polished clean
Are you callin' me bird
I got a mongo's dream, yeah, yeah
Yo baby, can I get another lap dance I tell you I
I take it back; I take it back
Well, we'll float on, good news is on the way
We knocked another couple back
Shame the band's broke up I just hope we'll remember these
Then it's bound to blow back around
My baby brother Alfie how I wish that you could see
A flick of light and wonder
I took a look at myself
Out the windows of our traveling car
Slowly strolling in the sweet sunshine
That our love is true
I said wow didi didi how those hips they shook
Murray Your fly is undone
Unrestful eve, I sipped on leaks and sat in the room had a grudge
To the top of that cloud
Still surprised to catch you
Let you take me home, let you rearrange
And when our city, vast and shitty, falls to the Axis, yeah
Oh, love come get me down
What's on your mind
C'mon people, we're making it now, yeah, yeah, yeah
I remember when I'd run to you
When out of that orange colored view
But are you mine
Smile, smile, yeyeah
Confirm the terms of our love affair
While cookin' up bones
Strike while it's hot
Always right behind you
You know what they say
Riding with the boys and pushing the luck 
Gives me the greatest peace I've ever known
And with just half of a sunburn
I'm giving you warning, baby
A wet cigarette in the rain
Shields up Shields up Bar the door, and keep your dukes up
Live while you can,
I'm not pretending
My brother punches my ear
Your fashion caught her eye Another conquest of your personality
Everything that happened
Saw you hangin' from a tree
Oh baby, do you wanna dance
It'll help that soul, a little help may do some right
I'm amazed that I'm talkin' to you
Then you're in my face telling me to grow up
A bushy, bushy blonde hairdo
Pee Wee Herman
I got some troubles but they won't last
We can pretend that you're a star 'cause life's so very simple just like lalala
Yeah, the world was still in my backyard
Barcelona  La musica vibró
You will know, cause it ain't hard to tell
Believe in the magic ofa rock and roll
I don't want to get much older
I'm on top of the world
It's really such a lazy way to be
Ooh We're shining bright and I want you, I want you to know
It's you and me, we could get out of here
Rome, Rome, many tears have fallen
I just wanna be your girl, whoa yeah
I know I can't wait until
Time, time of my life
And finished up the game
All my life, they tried to push me down
I made a big mistake, alright
Yeah, there's blood on the wall but I'm happy
We are the second, you're minutes behind
You came over for a while
See that was my old man and he said
Synchronicity weaves like a web
For the price of a night with me
You'll be my American boy, American boy
Like Billy D said he's feelin' me
Nothing ever happened
Some say, the river won't flow
Is there a drum beat pull shapes,
That can make this life so unkind
Oh and I wished we could be dancing in the dark
Dad took off when you were four years old
We'd be good, we'd be great together
Not to be alone
Thought could be fun
I feel my heart beating
Came down upon her head 
I'll let you down
Now and then you can bend
You could see what I've done
Someday we'll meet beyond the limits of who we are and it'll be
When the sky is overcast
There is something I've been dying to do,
Amen
Yeah, I left my body in a sea of people, and that's just what I believe in
that was seen shooting from the window of your room, 
And though she feels as if she's in a play
She's a hurricane in all kinds of weather
Maybe then I realize you ain't got what I need
Imagine the rest, I was put to the test
Shuffle the cards and let's argue
You got women, you got women on your mind
We're never gonna differ 'cause we know it's true
No, no I know you need it
She was a working girl
Careful and steady
You don't need to call I ignore everyone
I want her blue eyes start sayin' "Hi" and "Hello"
There was a man at the wall
Come on over here and take a second chance
It's the flip of her hair
I wanna live for today
Sometimes there's bullshit that don't work now 
But Jackie had a baby, then she had five more
I'm travelling at the speed of light
We sang along into the start of forever
It was fun fun fun, oh it was fun
Lay your hands on me
And she should've studied hard
I was walking along
And that's the hardest way, ooh la la
Oh when she love me, love me, love me so tenderly
But fuck it though, what I'm spendin' something on a nothin' for
Get yourself to the Butterfly Lounge Big girl, you are beautiful
Try to keep it down, six feet in the ground
You know that fortune favors the brave
Hear the sound coming round, see what you nearly missed
Get up in the morning
And we can sleep where we reside
'Cause you were always made to want it all
Talking bout, 'IIIIIII, I don't be going to the strip joints'
And bad ideas, but ideas nonetheless and so
But I can see them slipping through almost feel them slipping through
A speech to please the poles
But your mama thought there was somethin' wrong
Tell me something over nothing ain't so wrong
Let it all go baby x
Got me feeling drunk and high
Is how to let you go
I will live while I can
Feel like it don't make sense
But we always yes we always we always have fun
To make his supper and eat it alone
Alone, awake, and thinking of
Every time I fell on you yeah every time I fell
Everything I knew, why didn't I feel
In the Morning, nighttime too
Sing about that, oh love is a brittle madness
Like a lonely road, clear as day, alive
You'll be the song of the last bird calling
You know I didn't think I'd find you
And you're a long time
And then someone told a story about something dead and gory
'Cause in the daylight anywhere feels like home
A young girl's sighs
I could only afford one weekend
If you touch me you can never go back
I feel the impact
Goodnight, goodbye
Or pick up the phone
Illinois in it ran from the Ronald Reagan toll way
Trying to hit a Saturday nighter
Cause her family was wearing on her nerves
Kick it into gear when I see that face
We've both been searching for
I say you're born rich 
Baby get your feet on the floor
My lips are unhappy without you
Between God and a shot of scotch, let's get fly
Man it was a miracle that nobody died
The sky turns to a different shade of blue
Meet me on the corner, we'll start again
If near is just as far away as far
And then I would become all knowing
I won't leave you alone
Hey you know my friend lisa
Got to find the reason why my money's all gone
Really do come true
Close our eyes, close our mouth
Oh no this is rising to the clouds
Oh, the days the rain would fall your way 
Why you do the things you do
And I'll blame this world that I live in
And everything's going to pass 
Now, I've been sitting on this abandoned beach
As a young girl
One forgot to wear shoes
Do you believe in love at first sight
Off alone to the great unknown
Its very funny to be a frog
I know that the world is gonna smile again
The grass gets greener when you get to the finish line
Morning dreams come true
Why are my eyes filling up with these lonely tears
Never get to let you know how much I think of you
Et tu feras, ça t'apprendra
Are you listening to a single word I've said
When we came inside
And this ain't the place for me
If we come, come together
Angels again "How long till you can see her"
And still make a day of it
I'm starting to feel 
This this could be the summer, the summer of love
Drivin' away, leaving it all behind
Man, you ain't like anybody else
The paedophiles playing his neck of the woods,
I think how burt sunzanka made me drink
Why can't you leave me tomorrow instead
The girl's using me as a punching bag
Not the snow, not the rain can change my mind
Sometimes we take chances, sometimes we take pills
Good grief I don't think that I can take this heartbreak any longer
You expected my war diaries
And I'm taking off tonight, now I'm free
And to see it fall on your simple country dress
Well these days I'm spread so thin
She is Superman's cousin
And I grabbed your wrist and told you
Now some black paint
You show me prejudice and greed
Oh but baby you can turn it on
For the Mister AZ, they say
A thing or two at night
So I darted back quickly to spell out your name
Like"how can he save some summer night,
I really want to come kick it with you
You'll never gonna have to be alone
I'm wastin my time
That same boy that stood by the sea
A holiday
All the good things that you've found to yourself
'Cause you might get run over and you might get shot
Makes me forget how to think
If you want, want my love
To find that our home
Was something that didn't suit youa lack of interest perhaps
Leave the death ledger under city hall
It's too far to discard the life I once knew
Talking points from talking heads
So I just sign the dotted line
To all the bitch ass hoes that hate me the most
I saw life turn into a TV show
Before it's time to leave again
I'll find another skin to wear, I'll find another skin to wear
The sea of lava
The only light that shines there
Sweet body part
But while they search for a mate
Measuring all my shadows by old star shifting to red
Heart attacked by fear and doubt 
The cutrate mime walking through the dirty streets
We all be sharing a river of love
Seven different reasons for satellites,
I don't want to miss even one song
The date didn't mean that much to me
Find a road to a humble abode where both of our routes meet
I see your name on the walls again,
Well I have no way to say and there's nothing I can do", go
And the ground, it's closing down
I don't make the papers, I'm far from JLS
Celebrate the few, celebrate the new
Temptation's not a word until we've let it go astray
We are smoke
I I am just a number
That always cries when it gets some sleep 
Let me hear you say
And you said don't you want to be like that man
Say lil mama
"Can I take you out to the pictures, Joohohoan"
You had to hide away for so long So long
But hearts break and hells a place that everyone knows
I said I'm blue, baby
Candy, she's sweet like candy in my veins
I bet you're saying to yourself
They had church candles wrapped in newspaper
When I'm far too tired to fall asleep
I'm supposed to feel better
Tell me have you seen the girl
The words of the things I think about
In the most unexpected places
We gonna rock it to the top
Place next to the ocean
The hills are his in all embrace
Why am I always on a plane or a fast train
She says 'everyone around me is wasting all my time'
Mama don't take my Kodachrome
When I was seventeen, I followed my dream
Push my back against the wall
And abandon it
Until you start to sing
What's the point of language
This man you call with lover's draw
Kiss me slow and softly make me dream of you
And erosion can't stop their being
I'm a traditional man 
And she's so sweet and
Your foots on the clutch
Boy we're free, so what is fate to say
'Cause I sung songs spun stories loved laughed and drank wine
Hearts need a beat, like awake needs asleep
I tell you something
Oh tonight's the kind of night
Just a minute close your eyes
And I think that I can get used to that
Well, an eye for an eye, and an 'F' for fight
A small key's gonna open the door,
Who can't decide which book to read unless the paper sows the seed
I love love you darling
You've got the wrong idea
Lucky we're in love every way
It just feels like I can't afford to let myself go
So breathe in and breate out 
Here I am, completed my whole record deal
This is the time
One foot boy
I'll take you up on a dare,
I like to marvel at the random beauty of a simple village girl
Everyone thinks you're a crazy old cat
And though you're out of tune
Mama don't take my Kodachrome away
My trembling bed
Just in fact to make sure I can't
To find a room that's natural
I got to gage and barter to get out
In this heaven up above filled with everlasting love
Well I don't feel right
Enough love to fill your empty heart
Let's go on the subway, take me to your hood
Life, life without surrender
Down in Bronxy Bronx the kids go
She says that I cannot go
I thought a year from now
Sing it right back, I like it like that
What in the world you thinking of
Just remember
Never been alone as such
We can dance, we can dance, we're doing it from wall to wall
You put me in the magic position
And never be lonely
Now I look at love like being stabbed in the heart
And tonight he's not gonna come back home
Work, work, work, Senora
Station wagon rides
One good day of the week
There's a lot words to come out
Maybe we were born to kiss another
I can't stand in line at the store
I was thinking of not growing old, forgetting and forgot
And sometimes I wonder where'd that crush high go
Woke up this morning
Some days I can't hold it at all
Your pointless life will end
Days replace days
Someone above is looking with a tender eye
Just a little bit a little bit hot
I love you never feeling old,
They'll never know we're in here if we don't make a sound
Just say you want me too
Till we fall asleep
Like come here, we go right
I'm lightnin' on my feet
Who was recently given a Fulbright
I went away, 'cause you were near
Is it true, do I care
And family in free verse On this road with Kerouac
They had me in mind oh yeah when they designed you
But I worked somethin' out last night
I found a reason for staying home tonight
And I feel alive
Girl you're living in danger you're sleeping with strangers
Singing the gospel in my mind
Hey, I'm looking up for my star girl
You know I'm in control
'Cause she's the one makes me feel this way
Track down the beating of my heart
If you've got someone who can't dress properly
Clothes are made of rags and they don't even match
The cork that bottles up your wine
I stand up to the shadow that never leaves 
Beats something else, you know I never worry about myself
I must be sure these are the signs
Sure did help but it didn't solve everything
You will believe me when I'm gone
It's morning
Nothing's gonna bring me down
She makes the Indy  look like the Roman chariot race now
But say goodbye to you and meeee
Can I get a little fading on Fade it, fade it Don't be long 
And I say if I don't leave now
Send your epistle to my better fellows
Away from everything you've loved before
Oh, somebody
In the dark
And it just feels good when you're waking up
Listen to reason, season is calling
I think I'm falling
Leaving me alone in the broad daylight
So go to your downtown and bring what you've brought back home
She danced with me like I hoped she would
Cherry ghost
But I won't waste a day
Quiet, boy, quiet
But he's old for his years
And will you get over it this time
I am a vampire and I'm looking in the city
You were stuck in the badlands
Try and test that, you' re bound to get served
And it kicks, and it kicks like
"Swim in the ocean that'd be my dish
Be right back after this 
"I need to get myself away from this place"
"And people make you nervous
That's why your love your love keeps lifting me
I'll stay if you're gonna keep me in line in line
It's suds and soda, a smile, decoder
And they sell things for apartments smaller than mine
Who would've known the rain and the sunshine
That's when the feeling hits
But you're still miles away
If you've got the money
Or is it right this way I feel
I howled at the moon with friends 
And I'm sure you had your reasons you change 'em every season
There's something
Thanks for the call
Always worried 'bout what I'd lose
Maybe not one
Bring it all back to you Bring it all back now
I'll realize how fast time could go
Let's hit the limit of loss over lover's arms
When everything breaks
Ain't got no skirts, ain't got no sweater
Blister on a turnpike, let me by
I try to imagine a careless life
Into a fog, into a lonely drink
We hope to find enough outstanding
But that's when the feeling hits
The new frontier is not that near
We carry the mail
Like the party going on in my house,
Where have your laws gone
And there's a light inside of you
The moon was sagging in the sky as I held her face to mine,
Honestly, why are my clothes out on the street
It would not be new
And no two are alike
Take their cue from the slightest thing 
In me, and we would be forever together
No where else to eat but your floor
I'm looking up for my star girl
Satisfy my needs
Burning down the city
You work on the torso and
Life goes on the same, bury the pain
I didn't wanna know the things I knew
It's hard for me to show
I call my phone and I check my messages
Soft and sentimental
Oh, in so many ways
And I can start a book
Once or twice I've been on the floor
Not my imagination
You make everything make sense
Óró mo churaichín ó Like stars burning holes right through the dark
Things don't seem to go my way
You don't know how to stab a nigga dead, keep a clean hand
Eagle eye, eagle eye
Before you blow their town away
If you surround yourself with negative people
The places I've been
Oh it is love from the first
And before evenin' falls I may find myself there too, singin'
Mister Blue Sky's up there waitin' and today
I have a hammer, a hammer to break down,
Ice cream and a bottle of ten dollar wine
And we can act like we come from out of this world
I laughed at all his words
You, you know my name 
When I'm in the glow of the warmth you throw
And they, they just roll their eyes
And she is constantly aware of all the changes that occur
If it comes down, it's still about the sweet little things you say
Changes this Fall are going to last forever
Nothing at all in the world to do with you
By moon
Bars start spitting cowards
And I took out my tongue, twice removed from my face
The same way I want you
Oh baby you're too pure
I did before and had my share
Sat by the fireside, apondering on
We're gonna see the sunlight ah huh yeah
Having headaches in my brain
I believe that it's called al fresco
You got no fear of the underdog,
Got my hair, I got my head
You aren't looking hard enough
Stop dead in your tracks from her eyes
I get scared
I don't feel like I'm falling falling falling
You really know how to dance
And when you've gone I'll put it through my chest
And people are my religion, because I believe in them
Maybe that's why when we're all alone
Oh, you're just reminding me
I'm down on my daydream
And a prostitute with money spilling out her hands
'Cause ten years ago we all strived to be twentyfive
Take your time you're gonna need some patience, girl
And make a home from a rented house, ohon
A little bit of Sandra in the sun
You've bought yourself a second chance
And the end wasn't funny though we'd all had fun
Hanging out his mouth, he's a cowboy kid
Me number
What did you want to be
Sometimes I'm talkative and sometimes you're not talkative, I know
Holy Moley you're so funnny
If I start believing in you
I was in so deep but couldn't get out
The preachers and books of your empire will fight here alone
But my feet won't dance no more feet won't dance no more
If her daddy's poor, just do what you feel
And then never let go
Hello sunshine
I know it sucks that daddy's done but try to think of what you want
Next day I feel so sad 
There's no resting now
I will face the world alone
I've got this feeling, so appealing,
Hey, hey, hey, come and ride wit' me, nigga, let me show you where we kick it at
Lay down on daddy's lawn
Oh, the way I fell for you
All of this world, is gonna see you shine
No need for a thousand cranes
But you just laugh because you don't understand
I tied it to the net, girl
Set me free, babe
Let burn the cigarette somewhere
They'll be spittin' in your eye
And I could show you the way
I'm getting it back with the rest of the leap year
He was lookin' to the sky
'Cause I knew I'd never see the ground
And if I go out tonight, dress up my fears
I know I'm always drunk as drunk as can be
I couldn't wait around 
I'll sleep through the alarm head under pillow
It's like heaven to me I must confess
'Cause you know you give me something
And the chair is a ladderback birch but his friends call him Karl
Just bring a pair of your dancing shoes and get down to this beat
But now I see right through 'em like a crystal ball
To make it hurt twice when your restless body caves to its whims
You are eighteen year old girl, who live in small city of Japan
Jackie flips the pages and she dreams little dreams
Broken hearts and faded dreams
There's volumes in the forest, no one reads out loud
Floating over a sea of vodka
She got to know his mind intimately,
Come into my bed
I'm gonna be the one who makes you stop and realise
I was falling deep, deeply in love with you, and I never told you till just now"
I see how you like to run
Like when my hands got lost in your thick hair
Some strange machines repeating beats and thumping bass
We're really rolling
So let's say, 
You'll always smile upon me when the seasons bad
And blue is just blue
And though you seem absent minded with that lazy walk 
And I love to give my blood sweat and tears to the mic
You keep telling yourself it's all right
And I'll be kissing you
I'm blinking in the light,
Doin do do, feelin' groovy
In my hotel room
Maybe you're gone
For the desk with the windows
And feel united oh oh oh x
Like I'm something worth holding on to
And I'm alone
But I got you, baby
And when I raise, raise my hands up high
That always steals my stare
At the party at the club on a Saturday night
I ain't playing games
Et le musique dance
Under lamp light glow
You're gonna need a heap of glue
Come on the fun is just begun
I'm thinking of a song or two, a boy a girl and a rendezvous
Do you trip on love
Shot callers, What are you a preacher
And your heart is feeling lighter
'Til there's nothing at all Ah
You won't hear me, still you endear me now, yeah
In a blaze of fear I put a helmet on a helmet
Uptown girl
Do you see me reeling off the lines
Oh, kiss me like a final meal
That I want you for more than a friend
I had a dream we went away,
Leave the worried look on your lover's face
Hear now honey
Than the average detective,
Trust me, those days won't be mourned"
Yeah, she's kinda hot though
Inside was an antidote to the spell
They walk fast
You know I'll wait forever
Only just a friend the love story begins
Just a little something to help to keep you high"
th grade I think, feels like yesterday
Yeah yeah Is enough to love you baby
Lighting fireworks in parking lots
And if we stay on our feet we'll make it in our own time
It's a simple message and I'm leaving out the whistles and bells
Damn, your dad's basement feels like '
Adamsville, Bowen Homes, Center Hill to Zone 
Stand in the place where you are
    went out the barrel of a gun
You can live, you can die
Nobody's business
It takes the dust to have it polished, yeah
This was so because, because I watched all day
And doesn't that sound familiar Doesn't that hit too close to home
For someone half as smart
He's got no safety numbers, his ASBO won't allow him to be hanging around in gangs
They say if you're not lonely alone, boy there is something wrong
So let the beat control your body baby
I thank the stars and the heavens for you
We had a route, a walkabout,
Get them to love you
Still I would sing my song to me
Feel like I'm gonna die
And we be chillin' like a bottle sittin' on the rocks
I've got tunnel vision but I'm doing fine
I can't be bothered to get you alone in this world
My mind's beat up
And all those doubts have drifted out of view
Take my hand  
Careful you don't hurt yourself
Shoot me one of those glances I need to interpret
To ten million fireflies
Can you tell me Which flower's going to grow
But I was looking
Welcome in, welcome back, well come on let's go
'Cause honestly, I just don't care
Hit the redial, maybe we should sigh a while, save our second wind for sentimental warm weather
You're taking me for a ride
For years
I'm just a prisoner in a reign of love
Work it all the time
We've got a beat, beat, beat, that will beat your beat
To gaze down on the city below
Now I would do anything to get the taste out of my mouth
Spare me all the misery as I tear apart your life
I'm a be your girl
In his breath on the glass
Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day
Oh, I know life is hard
Time has gotten by on alibis and wine
She was everything to me
It's land I can see for miles
Getting into the swing, getting into the swing 
If you took all the girls I knew when I was single
Pick a verse, any verse, I'll hypnotize you with every line
And the feeling's all right
A grandpa phone and a gramophone too Oh Yeah
The planet spins and we watch space pass
I'm beyond repair, let me be
Mulling it all over in my head
Nothing you can make that can't be made
I'm unconsoled, I'm lonely
You became a legend
Far away, let's go today
Hey, boy, oi, where you at
They ain't getting too far
Stop dancing to the music
And I love
The rock candy's melted, only diamonds now remain
Father, I will always be
And I'll be stranded out at sea
And you will never stop me
Now you're acting like she was pretending
Those raindrops are falling on my head, they keep fallin'
Hey, I can't stop my feet
You're the only one that leaves me
I guess this time there's just no hiding, fighting
Just smoke cigarettes
Oh ooh oh ooh
I'll be the lighter of fires 
Makes the world taste good
And everything is going
And I'll walk you outside
You are such a blessing and I won't be messing
Imminent, you seem you seem to be
My thin skin trembling with these salty wounds
When I feel kinda bad and don't want to stress
Cause everyone thinks they've got a new phrase
Now she's getting off the plane
I love you in the same way, there's chapel in a hospital
Whoa ooh whoa, I've been waiting for, waiting for, waiting for
'Cause I need you like the dragonfly's wings need the wind
So please forgive the words I use my mind it tends to run
Aslappin' on the floor
Still you act like a man who is cross with every woman he's never had
You're hoping for a ride
I come to this world so wild and free
Can you look at the truth
I can feel my breath growing faster
She whispered 'wait for the trumpet's call'
Let's all get up and dance to a song
If I'm a river, where will you escape away to
When I found you I knew there was a chance that,
And a rock on the corner and a line full of fiends
It's not you, it's not mine
You can't hurry love
Baby, your ship has come in
Every night when I'm on the prowl
The music drags
The rock swallowed the girl
You can feel your body changing
I know it's stupid to dream
Did you think that money was heaven sent
And afternoons and mornings
He listened to his heart when he should have used his head
If my depression stood the wind
Look, we gon' break this thing down in just a few seconds
A room full of all of my friends all dancing 'round and 'round
Did you ever care to shoot your silver gun
Bathing in the sight of the others
Pulled out my insides with an old safety pin
And I don't understand
Nothing new to say
Wednesday morning papers didn't come
But you won't see me wasting the best thing I ever had
Hey, you talked to Mark lately
And I hate what I've become
And you're forever talking on the phone
I know what I should get
The best day of my life
If I ever had a chance, it's now then
Just look at what we got ourselves into
I'm all about the wordplay
When I am such a bad man
I could write a song with my new piano;
When all the sentimental memories you own 
These days you might feel a shaft of light
We are shocked to be here in the face of the meantime
It feels like
Oh, baby, I'm down down
And Danville window sill
Bring the beat back
Gotta get to the top
I guess that's just the way it be
Waves waves carrying them away
Pardon god and mom
Little footsteps through my sleep and
Look outside at the raincoats coming, say oh
I got there, where
Oh, ooh, ooh
Mine and my baby
The more that I live on the inside there's nothing to give
And if the world stops spinning
I never said what you did was either right or wrong
Wanna get a lick of this lovin'
Through the room
I guess what I'll be saying is there ain't no better reason
I'm dreaming of sleeping next to you
We found a new kind of dance in a magazine
Baby won't you be mine
Oh yeah she's losing it
And your skirts fall below your knees
The last time that we got away with lies
Attractive day in the rubble of the night from before
Underneath your very eyes
Baby, you're a rich man
What makes you not care
Hang up the phone
Let down your hair
The devil cuts loose, zing, boom
So say goodbye to green 
Where did you go
It's looking quiet as I jump in
But once I stopped trying I fell for you
Hey, soul sister, I don't wanna miss a single thing you do
I'm dappled and drowsy and ready to sleep
I swear there's truth in that
The rest of your nights with the light on
Que paso, que paso, Yolanda 
Listen to Iron Maiden, baby, with me, ooh
Oh make no mistake my friend
You know I love it all the time
I know 'cause I've been 
I'm in love, but its only temporary
But not you, I feel your faith is destroying the world
You might really love it 
Marie was exciting, you could say inviting and they both took turns with me
I got your remedy for those who don't remember me
Better start running
You're the kind of person that I've always wanted to be with
It's getting heavy and I want to run and hide
In the silence I hear your fading call, in your eyes I see and feel it all
Try my luck
Just like everything I said
Don't be afraid of anyone
We better drop them sails and get inside
I still want your love
My imagination, my imagination
Those days you were wearing that velvet dress
I salute to the champions on the wall
that's why i wanted to make you this song 
Going out the street again 
But you gave me wings and I used them
I want to be like water and slip into your throat
K  I  A baby let's get this started
By the faultlines and the soil
Oh these are the comforts that be 
And this town is still making me sick, whoa oh
Just tell them we could be building something out of our despair
Then you'd better get out of his way
Four bitches guardin' me safely as we walk to the window
Hey there baby
Why the hell it means so much to me
There's no stopping us
If I could tell the truth
Look at this big great world that we're living in
Sailed along a foreign wave
oh the silver bridge wearing nothing but a onesie and a veil
You could be waiting for a day that won't come
I believe that anyone can see it
Scratch my name on your arm with a fountain pen
It goes while you're here
You've never earned your soul
Let's take this back two thousand five
A scenic world, where the sun sets are all
It's a lovely day, just got paid
"They're pricks," he says, "I didn't get a second chance,
I hope tomorrow you'll find better things
You're just a momma's boy, momma's boy x
We've got to get away
And I will think of you now that we are apart
On the Ronald Reagan toll way
We were love at first sight, now it's crush, it's crushing
That might be decked out like a christmas tree
You staring at me
It's a spectacular show, 'cause my heart pumps diesel
You dared to kiss the face of the night
But I really do believe that someday 
Let's see how far we've come right now
Because loving is the sweetest thing
When will I get my chance to put you in a trance
Society becomes jealousy
We don't need to
And synchronize in time
Marie is delectable, just turned bisexual, I heard she's into me
Six in the morning
That all of the world and all of it's powers
be a dream
Give me a moment
I'll be the last one on the dance floor
Hey you with the long and lonely face
Waves in theta slipping into dreams
That is, unless they're walking slow, and
'Cause they've been wait, wait, waiting for Friday night
I've got to know, know, know you
You made me feel love like the old days
It's all a game of this or that, now versus them
Mondays I sleep away
But we're both just waiting for this Friday night
Is a well, if you need
Here comes success
And baby dolls
Pick it up with the band on the Ronald Reagan Tollway
The radio was playing "Crimson and Clover"
And even one lost guy from Arizona
I waited so long, I couldn't find a cause
Don't wanna control ya, ohoh
And clarity turns to dark, blindfolding prisoners of war,
Someone I've needed so long
When I told you to stop
Hey you, when I hold you in my arms
Unplugged the phone
I know you'll cover your eyes
And you can be anyone or just some mother's wasted son
I've got all the right clothes to wear
Money lost in the backfire of the boomerang
See me, sell  right with  creep
 Riverside, it's time to say goodbye
Make love to you
That depressed me yesterday
If she wanted to remain inside the family home
Cause there is space
Because we hadn't slept for days
You will come down soon too
We don't want these days to ever end
My music is where I'd like you to touch
Just another day in the hood lalalala, lalalalalala
Even though that night you flipped on us
Sprayon dust is the greatest thing 
Be cautious, 'cause what I be on'll leave you with amnesia
I fear the need to standardise
In his kitchen, in your chair
Nobody knows it but me when I slip
That Doesn't Remind Us Of 'Musetta's
Just before he finished breakfast 
Stolen rooms are the alloy of chrome
Blessed is this life and I'm gonna celebrate being alive
I don't feel like I'm falling falling falling down
I'd come into your party
Whenever God shines his light on me
But I'd be fine wasting our time
Five cold years before I
But my guitar is out of tune
From shades of gray meaning that turn out so sweetly
Well, then the rhythm is complete,
let's get out of here
I've never heard her say
Twist and shout twist and shout
Tossed this in the river like I threw away my old heat
There's no stopping us yeah,
You're looking at me unsure
Is in dire need
What is the outcome
Is it just me or is everyone, hiding out between the lights
Are we runnin' out of time out here
Hell no no, whoa no, I won't let them take you, wont let them take you, hell no no
Ooh I feel so good tonight
So as we lay upon this ground, I swear you look like Lucifer
Tangled inside of me
Incidentally, this record is available in the foyer
Just another ride and you
What's the matter with you
Hold music
Pour your sweetness over me
Won't let my heart, my heart turn into stone
You're gonna get what you give
Suspend disbelief
I feel alright, I found a face that fits tight
To build my very own Motown
Someday spare change
So when I'm gone these words will be here
To make amends
Inevitably, well it still exists, so pale and fine 
I'm feeling all right, I'm with my boys, I'm with my troops, yeah
DesscoontroooooLL Oh oh ooh
I walk down every evening and I stand on the shore
So she dressed me up as the man she loved
To a strange and distant land
She'll be mine too, I get off
'Cause my love has just left me
So don't you stop trying
And just because her only signal is mayday
I'm drunk by noon,
'Cause I ain't got all night 
To do it right
When you send us in
Life is a flower
Cause the filth took away my license
Und sich 'nen Teufel um die Bestäubungsfrage scheren
Me your love Me your love
Oh yeah, ayou make amy dreams come true
When you fell in love it was so sweet
Before the day begins make it on over now
I'm just saying it's fine by me 
The world is just waiting now 
Who's living in that house
That it won't and it won't because it can't
Still the memory of you
Completely breathless
Dressed me up in women's clothes
They don't know nothing
Just watching the miles flying by
When I feel put down I try to shake it off quick
Take all of your money give it off to charitytytyty
So welcome to Meadow Brook and welcome to Shady Space
 double bins up front 
Sing, sing along along any song you want to
But stole it back now forever in debt
Every single one of our London cabbies played
I'm fine, I'm fine with waiting on the line
I can't fight your war, until I'm finished with mine
Oh I won't sleep tonight
It doesn't matter that you're serious
Where have your walls gone
Such a danger so we gotta slide
And no, none of it's true 'cause I never knew you
To a distant place that you will be
In love with you suddenly
You took me to your rented motor car
And I will find her in the skies 
And America does, if America says it's so, it's so
Oh well, my baby's number one
Everybody
Feeling that sunshine
I'm infatuated by your moves
The way she danced, the color of her hair
The one and five in four
It's a street in a strange world
Well, it's all right, the best you can do is forgive
We got live like it's the end of the world
Look all around at the mountains you haven't climbed
It's all good luck charms,
Without me at our home
And buy her a round
Feel the sun shining for your eyes
The lips I am missing
I'll loosen my hold
But that's what you get when you live in a small world
You are gone
Hear it in your rhythm
Big money,
If you stay gone
Loove, love
Right now masquerade, master the mary go round
Leute kommen mit Stelzen und Zylinder
You've got a heart of gold
She's gonna tear your heart apart
Well it finally begins, oh just around the block
It's quite romantic, I know, that's how I wanna feel today
Of the days too early to come and too early to stay
Wouldn't get too far 
And what about your friends
When I come back to bed
Well what's my name, well what's my name
Cap in hand
This boy is cracking up cracking up
I'll keep tossing rocks at your window
Dreaming every night of you
The golden dance life could be
We all start in the streams
I walked all morning to lift my heart, 
Dropdropping
Nothing's gonna stop you know
Well II, I wanna be your lover
The one with old wood creaking
Looks like the tide is going home
I know you're really in love with him, are you up to your knees
But when you have your own children
Yeah, sing it 'cause we're all, all, all
I couldn't look on the bright side
'Cause they're just girls
So old that it feels like it is ending
Sneakers looking fresh to death, I'm loving those shell toes
So polite, we're busy still saying please
Being under someone's thumb
We will be dimming the lights for this evening's entertainment Enjoy, enjoy, enjoy, enjoy
We don't need a ghost in the light off hope
The Macon county cars,
I feel the love
Keep on lifting your love keeps lifting me
If you leave me I will follow you and bring you back where you belong
First gear, I face the trouble ahead
I know that you are almost in love with me
Don't look now but I lost my shoe
Man it's you to seen us this way we runaway with you x
And the books are fried
I came along one day and you rearranged my life
But in directions, actions and words
She'll never forget it
Cause now they all throw me they money like a wishing well
Know you make me feel all right
It's just the bureaucrats who won't give me a mortgage
You're making everything inside
Trash sack, jump back, EFG
You're making all time alright
I will shout the same from on high
Whispering rude things in her ear,
Keep your pride, don't go
When I'm in your light, just when I'm in your light
I can't run and I can't kick
To prove they loved each other
You Oh You, you, ooh ooh ooh, you
The calm of turbulent seas, fallen to sleep
So let the music play
I've come to embrace it
C'mon we gotta kick thatthat gangster shit
So dear, oh dear
Until, the light we are returning
But the hour is so late
'Cause I don't need your mess
Bring it forward to the present day now
And you could say, "Your love to me,"
Come back, come back, my little peace of mind
Jamais un simple hochement d'tête
Whos always hurtin',
I don't want to stop at all
And then this one doesn't want to admit she's falling in love
I'm gonna make a supersonic woman out of you
Is call you on the phone
And watch me walk away
I didn't wanna fall in love with you        
Can stop and smell the smoke
In a cage where only one thing could be free
What I'm looking for is a sign that you feel how I feel for you
I just wanna move, I don't care what the song's about
I got the magic in me
You could kill a rabbit with a rib
Cause the woman, She knows a place
Just like it's done for years and years
Would I still be into you 
When the papa found out, he began to shout
He's been there for years
Acting like a bad bad man
When the breaking waves arrive
Tear out the pages with all the bad news
I promised you the world again
I wanna hold you close but I never wanna feel ashamed
Flowers and the love in my arms
Midnight at the shoreline, fireworks above us
Escapade We'll have a good time
You live too far away
Only shootin' stars
How's it gonna feel until I catch you
I come home late and I love your soul
You look perfect King king king He looks perfect Fresh king
I never thought that I would get this far
I see the road begin to climb
I'm enchanted I've fallen under your spell
Under a pale blue sky
What a day for a daydreamin' boy
I can hear music
At first you might see this one bright beam of light
'Cause I never knew a home
One wrong move and yeah we're through
I'll come around and make peace
I'm gonna ask you so ya understand
And let's make tonight go down
I used to think that I knew the big time
I never ever had the heart to do
And to strike faster than lightning
Woo woo woo woo woo
That when we forget about everything that hurts us
Death never hands recycled cans
All the things I wanna say, and
I can be alone
And everyone must do the same
I need some time in the countryside,
But you can tell by the lines in my smile
You and I buy star maps and drive my car around Los Angeles
Oh why For me I'm always waiting in shadows
Everybody's hurting
Ashes till it fall, fall, falls
If you had just looked once or twice Once or twice
You're so damn keepable
Pay no mind what others think
Boy, you got me feeling so good
But there's a power
We are the happy boys and girls
I don't know, half asleep
Step out in front of me baby
'Cause the love, the love, the love, the love, the love
Lovely day
It's just a sweet
Upup, downdown, leftright, leftright, BA, start
To show you that I love you
Because without a doubt he'd given up the fight
No time for thinking, don't even ask me
Some say I'm paranormal
And I love that here you live with me
All my loving I will send to you
My baby, my darling, I've been thinkin' of leaving
I'll be okay if you'll
Tracing the lines in my face for
My parents got divorced
Shut your mouth, my wallet's fat
Ain'tcha got no rhymes for me
And me I gots the snail,
Why do you bite the hand that feeds
Looked like a newlywed
Hey, remember that time when I would only read
Don't bring everybody down like this
This has gotta be good life
But they only light the stage
And life is going on in your mind
Let's save our troubles for another day ooh
Am I wrong for saying that I choose another way
So now I always, always hold my breath you see
You think your love is just a score
Feel the beat of the drum
But there's no way I'll let'em take me for their petty little woes 
But I can feel you crying,
Seated here by my side
When I complete your song
Made her look a little like a military man
Well you landed on my mind
You go through all the pain and strife
Would life itself stay or follow me
Yeah, I'm just a little bit caught in the middle
And solidarity, on the razor's edge, boy, what You're a big puncher now, right
There is nothing stopping you,
And you say you belong to me
The doctor walked her crew of surgeons to the table where I lay
I wanna be with a girl like she
Breathing tornadoes
Oh, no I run while knowing
And in every way, I know that you still want to stay
Turn the treble and fight my limit
And that don't look so bad to me
Bear this child directly into misery
It's gotten so bad, there's just no more anger
So now we're drowning in birthday cakes, well, here it comes
'Cause I'm wearing my brand new shoes
Ah, so mundane and incomplete
But if you don't, stop there
Numetal friends and what became of them
Calling it off just to keep crawling to your arms
I miss you when you're away
I saw you walking
Do it in slowmo as the day unfolds
But she came home today with a ring on her hand
I'd get to see you again
Seems to be part of human nature
C'mon we can rock this party
You want to put your trust in some solid thing
We found the avenue of trees went up to the hill
Pretend everything can be alright
I can't control my brain
I'm tired of looking up into those starry eyes
Baby it's fact
Trying to come up for air
Would you become my queen
Even with the rest belated, everything is antiquated
If you're going off to war then I wish you well
And I got a bone to pick with you 
And the sleek sleek skeleton I hold
I've got girls and friends
I'm gonna save a million songs for you, so I hope you enjoy it
She spends her days
You know the night life is just not for me
Taking time for the things you love
It's everything
It ain't the way it has to be
A Nolita fairytale
I speak a different language but I still hear you call
In five years time, we might not get along
It's one way, now on Wythe
Merry, merry, merry Christmas baby
You held up a stage coach in the rain
Now that I know what I feel must be right 
Never wanna stop at all
But once you turn the car none of that shit even matter
In the morning
I'm waiting on my knees
'Cause I was fine till you came along
And we get better
'Cause I wanna know Do ya love me 'cause I wanna know
Where those nightmares had just been
But I know things will be all right in the end
Winter in springtime
We got the feel good vibe to make the place jam
Little Lisa, today is your day
And it comes as no surprise to me
Let the song carry you on and keep you strong
For ripzipping buttonpopping kiss and well
Yeah we're feeling so good
'Cause with a match that's mean and some gasoline
For two years
In the end, technology unto the world will set us free
And she says won't you calm down
From a guy too cynical for love
You could even write your name upon my back
It's the best Beats the rest
I need some of what you've got
The floods and fires might be coming through,
But they'll be bringing you the same old shit strife
Too late, too late, run for cover
You can do anything you wanna do
Yes we'll come and we'll make a scene
I was a man but now I'm only a child
Correct over time
Is love
Racetrack season pass
I'm starting to think that I'm kinda shy or at least I'd like to be
Trade your broken wings for mine
For her rooftop, our last stop
Oh it's good to know, tomorrow you are coming home
And it seems that every time 
Yeah if I lived in Brooklyn, I'd still have Chinese children
I'm looking up,
It left my heart in a mess
And then go stealin' through the moonlit nights
I won't sleep tonight
All we care 'bout is talking
That I like in a man
When I'm in pieces you pick me up and put me together
Yeah, kiss me when my lips are thin
But we know who we are and more
Got laid off my job the night before 
When I woke up he was gone
How you gonna feel when it's all found out
So I just lay back and laugh at the sun
Keep it clean and no one's ever won
I don't want to forget this and I don't want to be forgot
Singing songs from the balcony as the city crumbles
And I'm pale as I ever was, baby face
To the land that would be rediscovered
Just leave a little room for some naiveté
Kiss me beneath the milky twilight
And Wonder Woman's hair
I told you a thousand times
So baby whatcha waiting,
And hides you from the world
All these places
Well, it seems like she can be anything
Would you please just let me go now
Nothing that doesn't show
It ain't nothing a soldier can't handle, ya know what I mean
Worrying we start to wonder, what was right
Just standing where I am with all the people passing by me
I suppose that's the way the cookie crumbles
Tell me where you need to go
Some day we're going to make it all right
Bring me down, break it down in the hot, hot desert
A dark congregation 
Strings let themselves loose, my feet won't touch the ground
That it's all to start
Because I wanna stay wet for a little bit longer
It all ends up the same
You make we wanna say I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do
A small story which always happens
Hard working sound and vision
And totally removed
It's just man killing man
I kinda wanna be more than friends
Oh have you ever felt so goddamned strong
We're all standing with our backs against the wall, sooner or later
Me, I ride the wave of never gonna drown,
I'm not above being unloved
You gotta 
DJ drop the record, I'mma start a stampede
The same kind of pain that I had when I was seven
 gold, CHA CHA
Standing here right now 
London bridge is safe and sound
And were winding up straight in your sneakers
Dirty mind, don't know what you're gonna find,
Waving your powers around, the sun eclipse behind the cloud
Come on, Barbie, let's go party
And it's berries in my heart bread
Makes you feel like up and running 
Over rooftops and then dive 
And write it's so much fun out here
And doing anything you want to do
When Uncle C passed away, leaving us empty
I got it
I fall asleep with my friends around me
It's never too late to start living
'Cause all too soon the clock will strike midnight
You stopped laughing and you asked me,
Sleeping with a gun,
I work all day, keep the rhythm through the night
Aha, shake
Just waiting for the perfect hideout
I'd hoped, beneath, asleep, is where that you had been
When I get myself home to my bedroom,
You can tell by my smile 
Lay down be still
I see the stars coming down there
Joy and pain are fighting in the corridors inside 
Jealousy lay all your spells to bed
Lord knows that I got mic control
I was rolling lowly
Out on the floor
We're changing in the light
Stand back in the shadows and be a right hand man
Let me through, paper and fist
And I will work, will work these fields
It's all love you know
Baby, give me time Give me time
Ooh let me be
And if you start to warm, you could further break the ice
Convert your self belief for a new Religion
So in the day when you wake
Can you see through the wonder of amazement
The way you move your hips
On the hook, so toss me over and cast the line we'll all try
New friends and new places to see
I wonder what clothes you wear to school
A little ray of sunshine, a little bit of soul, 
The chilly wind whipped my both cheeks hard
Come carry me home
We're talkin' 'about my baby
You'll always be my girl Yeah
You will forget about me when I'm on that plane
You shouldn't've fallen in love with
Memory has become pain
I kissed you on the face
My thoughts is jukin' the block, and dodgin' the one time
And I just get sick of the things that we think, we think we know
Misty morning in the springtime
Then breathe breathe breathe breathe a sigh of sweet relief
It's a risk, it's a risk, yeah
Show me that you're caring, you see my fascination
Think hard woman
There's just one thing you should know
I've got a key
'Cause he's got all her jewelery and wallet
It's a little bit you
I don't get the connection
High above the chimney top, that's where you'll find me
Ow woo woo woo woo
Oh today I finally overcame
And all the forward thoughts
Heart still beating but it's not working
Waiting for my moment, I was destined to shine
With the show"
Uh uh from this day forth only forward I pedal
I grabbed some frozen strawberries so I could ice your bruising knees
But he sleep all, sleep all day, sleep all, we sleep all day over
Somewhere over the rainbow
Yes, I'm havin' a good time
In the car
In the zone, where I think that I lost my phone
Hand to mouth
Oh, can't you see I'm full of lies
We could let this love be the fading sky
My little brother's in his bedroom smoking weed
With red in our clothes
I've been limping from tunnels since my original sin
And I am the blue in your back alley view
That's the place we always went
And if this is what we've got,
While it's still free
Can you reach it does it make you wanna walk
I stand and strain to make ends meet
Fire, move my body like a merrygoround
Man I gotta lease nothin' I own one
 months, yeah I feel fine
So give in to the rivers wind
'Cause I'm a little bit tired of fearing that I'll be the bad fruit nobody
We're always happy
Never let go, gotta hold on in
But I'm coming back for you, and I'm walking through your door
Look at all the people like cows in a herd
If I can't even dream up a dream that's worth the keep
I wrote a letter on a nothing day
We'll take you apart, we'll swallow the ocean
Went to the corner of a second and main
We are moving as one, we align with the stars
Be strong, get off at the next stop
And it's hard to breathe when you're not near, oh yes it is
But backstage back on earth again
So now you're giving up like they always said you would
so dry your eyes or let it go uncried, my dear 
We gotta rock, rock, rock, you get us rockin' the house
You hold your head up, your head up high, like you think I do
It's all in your mind"
Don't abandon him
The bottom line is the dollar signs
oder Hubschrauberpilot
Står i din port, står bara still
That crossed my mind
If you touch its skin 
All around the world statues crumble for me
Rather stick it in the background
These are the days we've been waiting for
You are not my kind
But now I don't interest you, I'm like a blog from 
Festival varenda dag gör mig glad
Waking up on the line of equator bathing in my own sweat
Oh I love to hear those conkers fall
Why would you wanna make the very first scar
You are so good for me Just how I wanna be baby
Leave the ocean's roar in the turquoise shell
I always act a fool ow, ow
But come right here, I swear I'll never let you go
I need to laugh
Well, I've been dreaming ever since I've seen your heaven when you came my way
Surely, there's a story in counting all the minutes 'til July the st, 
Can I get get get to know knknow know you better better, baby Yeah
Love, love, love
Wandering, waking in an empty wood
'Cause I know we're taking a break
No no no no I don't need it
Before the highway road
Back to the street, back to the place
In a violent rage
I say, we can act if we want to
Ey, wieso sollte ich mich jemand anpassen
Macaulay Culkin wasn't Home Alone
Got bruises on my knees for you
Outside the lines, 'cause they're out of their minds
Couldn't cop to what I did
Cleaning her gun, and shaving her curls
I wish she let me be 
We pitch a tent and have one sleeping bag
We got it all right here
Try with a giggle it will make you look so nice
I hit the light and I thought you might be here
It keeps turning in my mind
Nothing after that but you and me
I wheeled around behind to my blind side
Lovers, keep on the road you're on
Yes we always yes we always we always have fun
And we'd start the race behind
And eagle flies with the dove
I'm like "Well, the sooner the better"
Nothing at all
It's just love
All right baby come on
Any more tears for the birthing pool
I think I realized just in time, although my old self was hard to find
I'll give you my sweet grass
Well, she should've went to school
The sooner, le bett
Am I home or am I simply tumbling all alone
Terrified of telephones and shopping malls and knives
Just don't ask for it back
Of a bus heading out of town
I get a table and a nice bottle of Chablis
En la gran feria, de la mentira, tu eres el rey el rey de un día
I need you darling
Whoaoh, baby
On such a perfect night
And the captain is playing the radio
For every single ghost on that freeway, baby
Man I swear she's come here to fill us with power
See my name's not Hoover and I don't give a damn
You make it easier when life gets hard
It rings like all through the daylight
Blackbirdy, bluejay, one, two, three, four
And she should've had her day
Everything you have done
Let the lovin', let the lovin' come back to me
You got it, you got it
Life is a drink and love's a drug
This is the best one  one yet
You build me up just to let me down
I don't think you even realize baby you'd be saving mine
The town is yours to take
When I see you every day
This is gonna be the best day of my life 
In the morning brush my teeth
I feel the warmth in the cigarette
But I remember all the times and all the words we said
One for me and one for you
Don't you see your dreams lie right 
We'll make quite a pair, dazzling all the time
I want to let you see
I don't want you now, bang, bang, bang, gone
Shoot at a full moon  what's my line
Smoked a cigarette, blew smoke rings in the face of Death
Chasing the rabbit
If her daddy's rich, take her out for a meal
Listen to reason, reason is calling
Sweating out all the whisky tømmermænd
Hold me, darlin', come on, listen to me
Dates before it needed blue
Left this city for a day,
Mountain climbing in the rain
It's all money gum, no artists anymore
Close your eyes, so afraid
Are we not, are we together 
'Cause it's written on the wall
In regards to the last word
I feel that ice is slowly melting
I got a long, long day ahead of me
There's no need to play with my heart
Let the stormy clouds chase
Would the real world even care
Who was kissing foreign fishes
Alright everybody, gather around
To call up on the weekends with my cellular phone
I still remember she was like a princess
As long as I know I have love I can make it
Every little part of me is a part of you
Friends sing together, la la la la
The world may be ending
Roll down the windows and open our mouths
But you wouldn't benefit from knowing all the truth
Down to our feet
The renegade feelin' satisfied
Well, I'm a fool, there's no doubt 
Sing a happy song
Staring into the bloodred sun
That's faith, there's happiness in death
But right now, CNN and Premier nigga, do it like this nigga
Cclimb right on me, llay it on me
Just touched down in London town
Sleeping with a gun under my pillow
Why am I hanging around in the rain out here
Too all the people underground
The highways and cars
I'm comin' home, baby
We watched the sunset from our car, we all took it in
To the river so deep
Before the last ten years have passed
Choking on a vitamin tablet the doctor gave 
SFA  Hello sunshine
Drip drop a lovely dream,
And on the drive back to my house
Open your heart
Don't get mad
You wanna fight You suck, you blow
I know I should get next to you
It doesn't matter what you did
So you better start winding it up because the party's almost over
And the glory to the feeling of the only unseen
Towel under the door, we smoke until the day's end
Please ooh ooh
What would you think if I sang out of tune
And so I will say,
She wrote me a letter from San Diego
More times that I get it right
Where bright lights and angels meet
Well, it's my birthday too, yeah
Leading their Fifteen sordid, wretched, checkered lives
The architect's rendition 'Meri
It'll probably get druggy and the kids'll seem too skinny
I'm not goin' to school
Made a promise to never say goodbye
She wore scarlet begonias tucked into her curls
And one day we could move to another town
I'm not sure who I've got in mind
Now, it's only fields and trees
And still be friends, still be my friend
Blondie, Blondie, Blondie, Blondie
Remind me of you because you rock my world
And had it nailed to my forehead again
And thought about the moment and when it will pass hey
I just can't stop it
People are just people like you"
I never wanna shake their hands and stay
I get a shiver when I see you with those other guys 
I put all type a wholes in ya face black
You know and I know, a thing or two about loyalty 
And my heart's beating out of my chest, whoa oh
Anywhere you are is where I want to be
A land sakes alive
So they hang like ghosts of the people I've been
You sigh, look away
Now, yeah
I've been hoping your moping around the street again 
Seen enough, make a motherfucker scream, "I love myself"
Oh, c'mon girl
And it would take a calculated blow to the head 
I'll blame it on the pain
I'm too hot hot damn
I have a girlfriend
A million to one that you could survive such a crash
There's no tomorrow
But when I get back home you're always there to rub my back
I'm never in my right mind
Coming out your speaker cones 
It was the last time I forgave you
You're not a land mine
Oh oh oh, ooh ooh ooh
Catch my tears, with a kiss
'Cause there's a million ways to go
Land I can see for miles
Keep ya head a goin'
'Cause I couldn't really stand it I'd admit that I was wrong
An underground design
You cheated your fate now, we can't read your face
We are splashing in the water to the beat
My ears fill with the sound of your arching
Make your heart drop and come alive
Locust wind
And it's feelin' like old times
Nobody nobody nobody will ever know her longing
Well, I guess they just don't understand 
Just decide, I've been waiting all night
Years go by and hearts start to harden
You know baby that's all you're really gonna get
In Penny Lane, there is a fireman with an hour glass
Love for those, who can make a mil and sit back and laugh
I've been dreaming of a true love's kiss 
New names and numbers that I don't know
Some are collectors
I wanna kiss you on the mouth and tell you
I got my finger on tha trigga, stayin' on tha grind
Everybody in a hole
And the stormy nights
I've been trapped by love
Inlitterati lumen fidei
Everyone watching us just turns away with disgust
And there's a reason why I'm feelin' so high
If I knew how you do it to me 
Drivin' away, just drive away, leaving it all behind, driving away, yeah
That you can't see air or time
But I fear I'm getting
There's too much, too much, too much love
The less room you give me, the more space I've got
She still got plenty lonely but that's just the case
Make your wine of my worship of divinely strange refrain
There ain't no way the gangstas say
Accidentally in love
This whole life is too complicated
But I believe the world is burning to the ground
Somewhere in the night time sky
In her saucony kicks
They remind me of when we were in school,
The inside lingo had me at hello
Yes you are my star
Cause one of us is gonna die young
I never knew could get so dark
You should stop treating me like I was just a child
Best place in Paris to be
Well, you could bring your roommate
It's just the radioohohoh
Damn it feels so sweet tonight, all by myself
Can drive to the flies and bees
You don't know what happened to that kid you raised
Now listen, now that I am across the sea
Maybe you'll meet someone to know your life
Something tells me I'm into something, ah
To think about the girl you love
Left one day and never came back
At the end of the day
Making everybody look like ants from way up there, 
Timb are you on it
I don't mind it when you whistles
To the fact that I go this break in my back
Then  years, then  years
Friday night arrives without a suitcase
Some kind of wonderful
In the middle of nowhere
And you're not just a lover
I won't put white into your hair
Maybe it's because I've finally found
And I showed you the things that I'd made
Imagine how I'd feel to be called a promotionalist, a mitt man, an emotionalist
With fifty men
He's so far away from mountain lights
Imagine how the world could be, so very fine
I'll be yours, you'll be mine
Ease my mind
Molly lets the children lend a hand foot
I said, baby, I just want you back, and I want you to stay
I'll think the bells inside have finally found you someone else
Money's all gone but you need some 
All night, I guess I did nothing right
And now I know I'm at the end of my wits
Like a line of poetry
'Cause I'm waiting for the moment to strike you back
If you've got something that sheds some light
That we'd grow up sooner or later
Oh when the sunshine beckons to you
I started to realize 
Sunshine
Everyone, c'mon
We're so pleased to be with you
This is the best thing that I've ever had for real
Pocket that rug you'll ride the groove
Five cold years
But what use is that to you or me, baby
People say that when the moon is full and all the stars have gone to bed,
A thousand years in one piece of silver
I was looking for a holy ghost
As I picked up my matches and was closing the door
Some things last a long time
That's right
And what it is you're saying today
The East Coast kids, man, we just don't know
But it's still the same
Just the way you are
A smile I've bought
Then in walk the mannered men
I've got the mind to walk away
So tie your mask on and pretend that nothing's wrong
And I've been shamed with no words to find
I've been traveling abroad
Nervous and shy for the moment we will come
MC Hammer girls can't touch this
Just as long as you are free
To get up and go
He said you're just as boring as everyone else
Maestro, what are you doing
Until I felt his breath at my neck
In any season
Where we are going to
And all the things you need to know,
But every time it comes out the same
The one who gets me there
Such ridiculous hate in the hot summer sweat
Feeling like roadkill
"Well maybe you should just drink a lot less coffee
This ugly little box, no place for me and you
I know I'm always asking for something
Nothing made sense
And hold her tight
Type of girl to remain 
No turning around now
So you say, Yeah I'm all right
Welcome to the rhythm of the night
I need another
It's hard to say, it's hard to say
When we drive in your car
I'm sure that I've already gone
But it's all right if you act like a turd
Oh, yes, wait a minute, Mr Postman
And you can tell everyone, everyone
My star girl, rules the skies
Let me assure you, friend
While the lights are out
Let it burn, let it burn
I'll call for pizza I'll call my cat
In a physical way
Someone do the math
Nothing is too good there for my girl
Billy Shakespeare wrote a whole bunch of sonnets
For the teenage boys
With dull knives and white hands
And we'll become silhouettes when our bodies finally go
I'm sleeping to dream about you and I'm so tired
Don't stop me now I'm having a good time
We are young, we are one
I've been a spoken word, I've been a river bed, I've been a rabid force
This time
I want a woman with the same brown eyes
She said unpredictability's my responsibility baby
Nothing else but us right here
But you never knew,
Over me, yeah Over me
The frozen city starts to glow
Stacy's mom has got it going on
Because I'm happy
I'm in, I can't get off
Get up under your skin
Everyone's banging on their gongs
And I would walk five hundred miles
No matter where you from, you'd better hear the truth
I'm gonna chow down my vegetables
Oh guillotine
I will disguise myself as a sleeping pill
In the nearest neighbourhood
I will let you into my dreams
And as he spoke, he spoke ordinary words
And I come alive
But we've got our love to pay the bills 
We Spat, Orbit, spoke of lost hopes
It seems like every other day
When your working is done
Då får man aja baja imse vimse spö för man är inne
There will not be a new one
I used to think I had to change the way I am
You'll have to shout out loud
Speed up your breathing
To be something I'm not
Waiting around nails cut to the quick
And I love, babe
Would I see the world the way I do
When you know where my lips have been
Now all those clouds have nothing left to do
Using words I never say
With your long blonde hair and your eyes of blue 
Sun is getting high
I don't get lonely So
Something I'd never lose
Run run rurun run
The more I try, I try to stop
The world record player's on a tour of Japan
And never ever let them see you fall
Glimmering, Glistening, banishing the darkest night
And my rainbow cake
When I go out, yeah, I know I'm gonna be
But every weekend I see you walking with her quarter to three
Oh, this love is make believe
I've been wrong times over
Blue babe, I said I'm blue, baby
The rain it started tapping
Who's that shadow holding me hostage
My coke has got no ice in there
And I was thinking just one night wont hurt
You know, you look so good look so good
I'd like to give you everything that you deserve
When the dream lights are coming on
Well now there's no one to watch your TV
Ah, ah, ah, is there anybody home
The man was talking about you simultaneously
And it's always
And you know he never showed his face again
You're coming home with me tonight
I painted you on my toes,
Where we'll work so hard, we can do no harm
You might really love it 
Oh yeah, well, well you Ooh, ooh, ooh ooh ooh
I can tell there's something going on
So you better get to the table, get to the table on time"
You kept back, you kept unspoken
'Cause that can be so funny
Please just stay over the weekend
I love to dance dance dance dance now the beat's really hot right on the spot
Yet again I say
I was looking at your window
Never had a friend or wanted one
There ain't that much room at the top
Creating in right now
I found you a home
I want the sun to bleed down
"Oh no, what did I say"
We don't say a word
There's much in the world I don't understand
A hope that time will slow the passing day
You felt the weight of the world fall off your shoulder
She says, "Inch for inch and pound for pound"
Oh yeah Oh yeah
And the redbreasted robin beats his wings
And up from my lungs and standing on my tongue
I wish, we should have stayed at home
A rush of wind is gently playing with their wings
Turned your face into the squall
I could talk to you for days
Sleepyhead Óró mo churaichín, churaichín, churaichín
Hoping I could learn a bit about what is true and fake
And when you walk across the room
Today
Screaming someone shoot me
Anything you've been thinking of
They may say some awful things
And, make it sound so very nice
I been bummin' around this old town for way
I don't get angry at the bills I have to pay
He was in the habit of taking things for granted
Go catch her in the fast line
Once more 'round the sun dried
We play in a room where the mix isn't right
I will pretend to leave this world behind
I know we had our problems, I can't remember one
I'm just working with what I've been given 
Over to the field for tackle football 
I said that's the way we get by
Bring your friends and we'll all go into town
So we'll live it for the weekend
Taking for granted all of her smiles that got away
Heaven at night heaven at night
Even with the heart of terror and the superstitious wearer
Says you can do it too in Jesus name
It's because happiness writes white
Every night on the couch
Get it right
Oh yeah x
Where I'll shut my eyes and where you should lie 
I said, "You're still miles away"
'Cause I can't figure out just what's inside
Yes, something worth keeping an eye on
Bluebirds fly
Their ears are getting tired of me singing all the night through
Momadisay momadiyah
Anytime, anywhere
He dances in secret, he's a parttime punk
Take me away from here, so far
And just one thing
Do they not know you're about to fly high
When we have nothing left to say
I could sing about how love is a losing battle
Now his hand is on your shoulder
I'll stay here with my beer and fish 'n' chips till it gets dark
Not a chance, that is
I know somewhere in some faraway galaxy
I'm startin' to realize lately
They're calling us together
As the night fell, I heard church bells 
Now I'm sitting alone
I would murder you if I had the alibi here in my hand
If you're small and on a search
You'd go away and let me spend
My My Time Flies One step and we're on the Moon
So I stared up at those leaves 
Now the light shines on
Someone who needs me Oh, I'm in love baby
If he is up for what you have in mind
Only shootin' stars break the mold
Wipe the cobwebs away
Friday night, midnight, Atlantic City
While I lay dying upon some bed
Seeing double on a one last one night stand
But who cares where it's going
In love with someone else
Like 'em run state mag 'cause we living it up
Across the water across the deep blue ocean
I'd jump up and down and hope you'd toss me a carrot
Like love, loss, lies and us and woh oh
Now baby I'm sure
And if I wait
Tattoos on his arms
Your house,
Leaves and trees are calling you
Hey, remember that time when we decided to kiss anywhere
But you're with him, now I'd do no good I should've fought him but instead I let him I let him take you
That's the horse I'd ride
Pay them all back
Down your tools for a holiday
I'm not sleeping
Everything within my hands
Oh, you, you are that girl in my dreams,
Husbands in winter, they know the truth
And there are no floors beneath me
The only thing that matters is just following your heart
Like a street to a hustler, a face to the soul
Through the curtains of the waterfall
Sing it out loud and let yourself free
And where's my mom, I wanna hold her tight
There was a factory
You're going to crash, I'll set the bails in front of you
Closer to the clouds than all the people ever cared to see
I'm on my way
Is coming to take you away
So count the days till you give in
Of thirtytwo gently clenching wrinkled little hands
You get the blessing from above
Livin' life in these hard streets
With your cherry lips and golden curls,
Try the coffee shop, but somewhere on the way
Tried to change my figure my diet too
Do you see these tears in my face
Hold fast to myself, make these good feelings stay
And the big bright lights INEQUALITY FRANCHISED
Is it ours to let go
We replay it in the back of our minds
Oh my mind wanders through all that I've been hiding from
The passing stars light the way
And it seems I can't get a grip
It's a matter of getting deeper in
Cause everyone thinks that it goes away with age
Workin' down the street
New, tall, elegant rich kids
My friends and family
Where storms are sand
I said your love your love keeps lifting me
My legs are dangling off the edge
I love you most of all
Everyone else's goal's to get big headed
Hey lover, do you remember when
Now I'm letting silence do the talking
Here comes corner winds and the changin' tide
Back to where we left off, baby
If those lips start speaking my name
Mmm hmm, you make amy dreams come true
Up up and away
I know I'll never be lonely
Nothing's going right
Be gone
Wonderful songs of love
He hasn't got the money
So come away with me
And I blew that room away
We've taken adventures to new levels of fun
Got my eyes, I got my nose
Shouldn't talk about it
She don't feel no pain
My ears fill with the sound of your kneeling
And I had to get away from this here masquerade
My friends in LA they don't know
'Cause she'll never be mine
My feelings have not passed away
I got peace in my soul
'Cause you get me
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart
Dark times Gotta let it go because I got my friends
I reckon it's again my turn to win some or learn some
I will be alright, I will be your light 
When it looks to me the grass is greener on the other side
Is this the last part
Damn man kick out the likeness
Every single day of my life
You been workin' out
And I know I should be home every pane of glass
Angels "how long till you can see her"
You might be the village joke but 
Doubling back now
Maybe be your baby tonight
Swing, swing, swing the spinning step
Have I gone too far Am I too far gone
But if I told you the truth
So what's my line  shake it baby
How I know your face
Is the day we've waited for, ah
You take your skinny girl
In the middle of the bath I call your name
And when you're tired and think the moon
We're going backwards now
They can make our shoes
Lady, your kicks of silence cough into your room
And in my room
What you done with your time
After all that I've come from, you're the woman I should run from
Why do you bite the hand that feeds you
I sit and wonder what it would be like if I'd never went away
Run run run run
Everybody dancin' in the moonlight
Long live rock
That clock up on the wall was tickin'
Sitting on a camel back,
You are a song for me to sing
The romance is over
Slow down, you move too fast
I'm so glad that she's my little girl ooh
The truth lied and now I wonder
Touching you makes me wanna come right out
My side
Hit the ground look around but you're nowhere to be found
We're all carried along
Gonna party like
C'mon baby
It needs to be defrosted"
And the senses being dulled are mine
Will never be my fool
'Cause if it's all you've got left
Ringing in my head so clearly
Ripped down from the brownstones to the street
Aye yippey aye ooh
Long live rock, come on and join the line
You got everybody talking
Oh yeah, you make amy dreams come true
The beats yeah, they were coming out the speakers
And we are height and seeking,
There must be some word todayayay
We make the dirt go flying
We had our mindset I made a lot of mistakes
The color, the color, the color of your skin don't matter to me
The river's ran dry just when it was needed
A smile a guise
When you're standing on the crossroads
You left me alone
I stopped eating and sleeping
There were people who needed something from me 
I think I'm in love with a girl who lives
And now she flies alone
Of the tears from the years that we loved and we messed up
I'm touchin' folk, any time they try and Grand Hustle folk, I'm bustin' folk
Hello, hello
When you hit me baby
A pallbearer aboard took me to the giant tire swing
And I wonder Louie  have you got room for me
Today skies are painted colors of a cowboy's cliché
Fun, fun, fun 'til her daddy takes the TBird away
And I will kick and beat my wrists together
For when it's dark
Come come come come
Young Money, Cash Money in the building
All my words unplanned
You didn't see it coming
We'll escape beneath a violet sky
'Cause if you've gots the poison, I've gots the remedy 
Well I saw you with your hands above your head 
Free, free to run and cry 
Through your mom's kitchen chairs
Crimson and clover Don't, don't, don't let's start, why did we ever part
Let it rain on me
We just look a lot better in the blue light
All I do the whole day through is dream of you
I kiss you once or twice
And I'm not ashamed to admit I've been uncool, I've looked a fool
Very fine Imagine how the world could be, so very fine
Ambitions are already starting to fade 
Baby, ow, baby, baby
I've been here for days
Yes, I do believe what he says
Evocative song
I just can't seem to remember, yeah
Close your eyes and use your mouth 
You let your perfect nipple show
Government warning
Got no regard for the thing that you don't understand,
Uh I can hear it calling
But secretly I always want to see you cry
You can stand in line
If you still don't know how the cadence goes
It is the moment you remember you're alive
There's no one else around 
Picture book
Will you help me break it down and get on through
She's a California dime but it's time for me to quit her
And kiss it all goodbye
I could be blue
This whole life is just overrated
You're gone, now, I feel fine
Oh, Susannah's bedraggled but she 
Especially me, sister you've got it all
I'm cracking my sweet love x
'Cause America can, and America can't say no
Hug and kiss it 
No sense in cashing us now
I never would've got here if I'd followed my heart,
And someone's home 
I rock the Haro sport
I wish the world could do
The birds all were quiet
And pulled my legs apart
And not the sadder times
And my doctor she says that they're safe
I felt this darkness over me
I was nearly in, but then came the pushy friend,
Porcelain in a paper cup world
Maybe you'd be better with a Barbie girl
With the water rolling in
But since your dad walked out, your mom could use a guy like me
Left alone to drive ourselves on the opposite side
Where you will look for me
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
How's your sister, how's your brother 
I saw your face in front of me
But for this moment I am fine 
But uh oh, she came to my show
But you can't hide standing under these stars
We won't fade away
We're part
How come
One look and I yelled "timber"
I know there's a light
Then I met someone
And there exists a star on stage
Safety dance
You get that woo, you get that woo
I dreamed that you were on a train
I'm sure you always knew what you had to do
We may never find our reason to shine
Come take a ride jump in
S'Come fly with me, let's fly let's fly away
Okay, yeah
Sleep well, I pray that cardboard boxes,
He'll drive a funky car
I change shapes just to hide in this place
to be a spot against the sky's colossal gloom 
And I can't help until you start
We'd be the best of friends, you could stay here forever
Sara spelled without an 'h' was getting bored
This one's goin' out to the strip joints
He has a tendency, a tendency to fall for shining eyes and baby fat
We're walkin' into the forest
The kids are yelling "Play the song
Now bugging because the label had just dropped Def Jam
Somebody will take you there
Drags me kicking and screaming through fast dreams 
I love her and she's loving me
You I see Will see my dream Your dream for real Come true
You will search, babe, at any cost
Walking the way we used to walk,
Give me hot, hot love around the bend
Damn, sun's so hot, make the girls take it all off
Wanted to fly
I've just got to get myself over me, yeah
Descoontroooool Ooh ooh oooh
Hey, remember that month when I only ate
If you listen to your words, then he might like what you say
Her heart so heavy
They sing on and on and on through the town
It's time to shine cause what you've got is
Fell deep in love, but now we ain't speakin'
You're exhausted always coming down
I don't feel supersonic
With the voodoo
We were in Heaven for five or six minutes, then we passed out
Before I just fizzle out and die
One more song for the radio nation
Before the levees start to crack
Catch the train out to what you're tryin' to do
Destruct, As It Broadcast The Words
In the sky are next to mountains anyway
What you gonna do when I turn around
This guy is 'gorge' and I got hit
Can't you feel it all come down
When you need to shout
You can start when we say it's a lot, I know
You say you wanna walk with me
There's something about you and I can't help but show it
With your feet up in the clouds
I used to be mad at the government
I thought I recognized your face amongst all of those strangers
So kiss me
I'll believe when the walls stop turning
I've got so much love in my heart
To see a girl that's prettier than a diamond shining in the sun
Thursday, it's more than I can stand
She's looking beautiful, totally beautiful
We are old in your teenaged tyranny
I'll make you say no I won't let them take you, won't let them take you
I used to think maybe you loved me, now, baby, I'm sure
Always on my mind
Jump little girl down to find the undersea sun
As they carried me away
And you might be a little bit bruised 
I go to her when I'm feeling slack
At least she makes a lovely pair
Our hearts in our
I could show you the way
And  reclining chair
Yes I'll make it all mine
We want you to party with us
Same old thing happen every day
So get up on the floor it's time for you to move your feet
And I've been channeling but I think we're alone
Now I got this pain in my heart, that's all
Right now there's the the right time
My pops just died
Man it passes right by me, it's behind me, now it's gone
Oh, that's all I've got to say
How she got in the door uninvited
I'll tell the girls that I'm taken
I'm living my life
For the record label puts me on the shelf up in the freezer
Just pretend that things are mobile and will never stay put
Bones bones brittle little bones
To fill a book or two
There's something in my eye, a little midge, so beguiling
Is taking my hand and we're walking and talking
She hid around corners and she hid under beds
Put your arms around me
Your hand's on my crutch
Nothing you can do, but you can learn how to be you in time
Let loose, honey
I'll wait and see if you'll give it to me
If someone's got a heart of glass
And doesn't it feel peculiar when everyone wants a little more
Now take it in but don't look down
Mind waves rolling through, carry me far into the tide
I'm for damage
Of doubt in my mind
Oh happy birthday, happy birthday
Dancing, dancing just feel the beat, babe
That's hard to own, sooner or later
Images I imagined with pretty imagery means you and me
I lie awake ain't asleep no more
I don�t need the stars in the night
Oh, and you're right
I say "I've never heard the tune"
But everything else
I'll make it famous in every way
And the day is closing in
You've already robbed me blind
Just doing nothing
But can I get out from under it
Do the piggy payback
As long as we're together, there's no place I'd rather be
To lose my way but let me say
Oh no they shout
Vegetarian, can't stand to be wrong
I knew before, long ago
With automated smiles
Aw, some day I'll understand
That's right, look up my number Hey
Is more than words could mean
Up one more flight
You could make grown men gasp when you'd go walking past
Good evening, and welcome to Slaggers, featuring Denis O'Bell
Right is right
Stop and say hello
It's getting better all the time
You'll always be as handsome
So coarse in kind it can't be sought
Had it been another day
If we don't, nobody will
You'd be the village joke
It's too much that they say you need
Like a number two pencil I always got a point
That crazy avenue of trees, I'm living there still
No one will ever know
And my stomachs got some tasty food
From all the boys the one I take home is music
I will be waiting here with open arms
Light me up that cigarette, and I'll strap shoes on my feet Dee dee dee dee dee
Hey there sunshine lift my heart,
You've got no answers but you've got your concerns
You're never coming back
Onto a bale of hay looking the other way
I have a bad day
I fall asleep in hospital parking lots
Say the word now fascination
'Cause these walls have all worn white
It seems to me that it's spiralling outta control and it's inevitable
And its the rain, not just the sun that helps it bloom
January is endless
My god just please don't ever let me go
A nice smile, a wet kiss
Makes me feel tingly and hot
Will you make my children bear
Just 'cause watching them copulate is very funny
The great indoors
When you had that accident in your car
Just a little deuce coupe with a flat head mill
Till all my skin was gone
I'm a cherry ghost
Can't die
We can get crazy, let it all out
Baby, you're a hey rich man
And everyone who sees him says, "Eww"
I bet her feet don't even stink
Educated, but a refugee still
Because the world keeps spinning
On a night
And I swear it isn't fair
And my mystery my mystery
And the way she said, "You missed a spot over there", ehhere ehhere spot over there
If she's the one or not
Little codes bring the balance to none 
Make it sweat baby
Using their Fifteen pristine, moderate, liberal minds
I should be lying on that sunsoaked beach with her
'Cause I keep on forgetting myself
Let's bring up on the better times
Back to the street where we began
It keeps my soul all right
Yeah, that's the way I like it
You feel the heat
I've been waiting
Is there trouble on the line
And your tree, it never grew any leaves
But I don't know what I've been waiting for
And while Jackie bestowed the joys of fingerlickin'
To go back to where I was would just be wrong
Face down on the ground
When somethin' comes up to me, he don't even try
When your doors are shut tight, I will dream you tonight and my dream will just sweep you along
No one gets you anymore
Why'd you have to get
Enjoy it, it's your last chance anyhow
And they all fall down
Hey, it's goin' no place
Sans m'en faire, je vais t'assurer
That would burn away right on cue
It proved a rare change is, now I got that true predition
So rent a car or take the bus
Like you'll show me where to go
'Cause you are your own destiny
Can you, show me how we can escape
I'm gonna be the man who's lonely without you
But it gets bigger till your horse is always running
So sing your life
Boy, we've had a real good time and
Take another heart through this lonely town
I guess that I was afraid that if you rolled away
He found an island off the coast of Mexico
Your love is like a city I visited
Picking up the pieces of our hearts
Shake it, shshake it Oh oh
Peace in my soul
Sleep around if we like
My neighbor digs the flavor, still he's moving to another town
You know it, ooh, ooh
And the man that stood there next to me said "Everything is gonna be alright"
You steal the show, no competition
I thought I loved you, and it's just how you looked in the light
And I had blood in my mouth when I spit
Well everybody twist
And you've got the curse of curves
We got carried away
I wanna go there and I'm not scared
So let's stay out tonight
See I'm looking to become not the prayer but the prayer
And I'm screaming at the top of my lungs
Or are you slowly drowning me
Wished you would have loved me, too
Oh how the sun shines inside you, just like I do these days are gold
Not to put too fine a point on it
We all get the slip sometimes every day
Waiting for another to come inside
Even if it's just one night
People, what you got for me
 I get "Byebye babybaby bye babybaby byebye"
So let seasons turn
Don't let the waves let you drown
Body like a weapon that'll make you go boom
I tried to change a tire but I'm not that way inclined
I could show you what it is
Oh, so hold on to the ones who really care
And have fun
He lives on my block and he drives an IROC
And they say Hey Hey
I need your love tonight
The way they did to others
They make you look so small,
And all I'm doing here is just waiting for you
And how I'm doing things my way;
Well open up your mind and see like me
The pebbles forgive me, the trees forgive me
I know I've got to try
Come on, come on, come on, come on, baby, now come on, baby
I've been tripping from sipping the dripping dirty water tap
Circles of street lights
I'm your pole and all you're wearing is your shoes
From ten thousand lightning bugs
I bought two from them and I lit one for you
We're going right back to the borderline
Love's what I got, it's within my reach
C'mon everybody
Out of gas, out of road
To find opportunity you should give yourself to me
I make these phoney ropes but I know
Of what's become your life
It took a car crash to turn it around
If you get deep, you'll touch my mind
And Baby please don't break my heart
I set off there alone
We've got an energy
Please, oh yeah, ooh
But I'm a little glowing friend
You holy rat rattlers, holy found fathers
Why don't we runaway baby,
Georgie said romantic love is flat
Stacy's mom has got it going on she's got it going on
A struggle always suck it out  
No I won't get by if you take that light away
The fear is an anchor, time is a stranger
'Cause I ain't got all night
This is where it's at six in the morning
Hey, I see you working it
Oh now I think I must be miles up
There was a good man named Paul Revere
The dirt bikes going on stage thank you
The lottery's got a rollover
We get high in back seats of cars
Drop your guard, get over yourself
And you've got nothing left to lose
Opens up my eyes so I can see
And when you see in them something you recognise
K  I  A is my faith departed
We have got all day to recover
First line should it be about the hoes or the ice
I've been feeling wellrested and healthy
"Maybe you should cut your own hair
You come to me, you're my best friend
Everybody gonna feel alright tonight
Marmalade, we're making out, oh yeah
I'm just glad to be here, happy to be alive At the end of the line
Nights not up close still hold a ghost of our empty town
Outside of make believe
Didn't get much sleep last night 
Gotta kiss myself, I'm so pretty
I don't mind a little pain
I don't like the way they look at me
The colors of the rainbow so pretty in the sky
I'm so hard for a rich girl
It's crooked in the side
They'll still remind me of when we were in school
Get they first car and then IRS show up
Take order in your own hands
Of militant families
Please don't go away
Boombox intones like a greek chorus
Let's skim the back with a song with love
Heaven nor hell
Maybe it's just one wish away 
I can do a backbend
Do you know who you are
I set her straight, it's not based on your life 
Maybe it's his first time around
I can shine my light on, too
And the music within makes me whole
A roomful of dust and a broom to sweep up
With his hands clenched tight 
And we'll all float on alright
But I know that you are mine to keep
She is the reason that I still believe
I've got, so many secrets to show
I won't be so alone
I've found a reason for not going out tonight
So move your feet, babe
Always cried into her pillow
I know you damage me
Forget what happened yesterday
On our super lunar honeymoon
And now it's lonely
Color me with images of faith
We'll be lovers once again
All right, all right, all right, all right
Nothing has changed, it's still the same
By the eyes were ears and the arms are
The truth lies we could be together
Bound to get together
Avert your eyes from all of this, we'll make it all back
Sometimes I see her sitting on the rooftop
It's your own life
Rap about big paper or the black man plight
There'll be love
Electric love
Maybe I should drop it
And when it's blue it means you should call her up immediately
And twice you left in fall
So much they can't see the top of the stack
I've got a lot of homework
Well as long as we keep our stride
No one gets by on themselves
Well pick me up with golden hand
But I never thought I'd see you as I did
Over and over away
Of the fear,
My joy will be complete 
This is the moment that we
Everything is beautiful and you are the reason
Whoa, ooo yeah
And please don't let me escape
I still love you, the girl from Mars
Let them bums stay mad 'cause we living it up
Drinking in the morning sun
Guess I lose but life goes on
That illiterate light
It's growing silently to be a life
I wanna go all night, yes
And you don't remember who you're talking to
There's no need to exaggerate
I just wonder Louie, have you got room for me
I loved you in the evening
Aaaallllllll the people gather 'round now
You're gonna wait a while
Goddamn Europeans
There's a small voice crying on the other side of the river from here
Hey, boy, in your tree
But I'm in my bedroom
We've gotta get out of this place, she said
But you can come along with me
And all your dreams have vanished
Plenty of girls and boys in love
Touchdown turnaround play by play keep the score
I'll give you my heart, give you all my soul
Each one that passes 
You came upon a quiet day
They're cued to sway
I can't hear anything, but hey, hey
But the beats so boring
And watch them fall away into the Hudson Bay
Yeah yeah yeah, la la la, la la la la My girl
Let's get rich and build a house on a mountain 
It's the strangest, most dangerous place I could hide
I see water, I see land
And I never really loved you more
I should have known better with a girl like you
Feelings sleeping in the field again
Lady on the water, rest my head upon your chest
These days await if we believe
Spend all our lives just having lives
Black bird slow and softly breaks a glass of wine
I just don't wanna see good love
Payback the donkey,
I found a driver here's a fiver
Out of black paint,
But I won't change you honey, you're for keeps
On my sleeve, let the runway start
Wanna break the door down
Another one, another one 
My best friend's house tonight
Take parts of Salford in Manchester, dying on its feet
I was unaware that she liked to act so kind
Shit a little funny, feel a little laughter
She's a player and a downright bore
Yes Jade is the girl of the hour
And timing changes everything when I was right
I don't wrap you all the time, girl Don't wanna be rude but
If the next time I saw you
I'm dot com, I drop bombs, kill ya squad
After the light has faded
So I'm always sober
Now play the record straight
And that's the way
And I know we'd do anything for love Oh yeah
My vision is cracked, but it looks like it's healing
Keep my hands by my side
Till I hit the dance floor
Her brothers her brother
And we left things to protect my mental health
So there are these little pills I've been takin'
Got a few tears to dry
You cannot find the light Light
A noise comes from behind 
'Cause I've poured my heart into
So get on up and let your body sway body sway
Since you walked right out the door
I been clubbed and I been snubbed
Moonlight sleeping on a midnight lake
And do you ever take a chance, my love
How I've hacked at our southern hemispheric eleven gods
Wrap him round your finger like you're playing with gum
Mistaken for magic
Keep me up, but keep me in my head
So let's love fully
And even then we'll start again and just pretend that
Any sunny morning
Hey, that's what they say
Yeah, one more time, I can never get enough of everybody
It might bet he way that we talk
Alleyways and payphone calls
There is joy to be claimed in this world 
Come on, come on, Come on we were once upon a time in love
Oh, baby, yes, it's true
This land is not your land
Without I'm a one track mind dear Yoko
People tend to disappear
Skies are blue
There's too many clouds, not enough sun 
Addiction don't come close to this
Don't you take chances
That is all I need
She said I'm so obsessed that I've become a bore, oh no
To the actual size of everything
OK I'm letting go
I've been waiting such a long a long, long time
Nighttime, is mine to lie eyes awide and I
I can't walk right
Everybody gonna sing it out
Let me see, let me see you drink it down
You creep into my mind
And you can be sure that if you're feeling right
Drive all night, go anywhere you wanna go
And I won't be waiting for your call
Drop for me, missile that'll make you go boom
There's nothing from here till tomorrow morning
Life's a piece of shit
Blow that breeze on my face
Our inclinations, hidden in looks
Do your thing, your thing, my thing, oh oh oh oh
You tripped over my site
Friends are the ones, on who you can depend
I will always keep your gaze
You know there's something going on here
Girls hit your hallelujah woo
Threw his bags on to the back
And every evening when he gets home
I feel your baseline bumping
'Cause I frozen time between hearses and caskets
in your eyes, i lost myself 
I could have guessed that you'd be this way
You gave me something like loving
In the meantime you're in between time
You're a momma's boy, momma's boy
My name is Denver Max please excuse the mask,
Gonna take on the world, one kiss at a time
Even the stars
If you gave me a chance, I would take it 
Well, it's Saturday night and we in the spot
And I dreamt through the rainy night
Shine on, my friend
The last word was meant to be
And time to compromise our lives just a little while
You lay there naked upon your back
Well, everybody wants to go forever
Well it's gone, gone, baby it's all gone
But tell you too much conversation won't get you off
I'm just trying to make my way
And I get to kiss you baby
Somewhere in the wasteland of your head
Throw your hands to the sky like your flying
Wants to get in your eyes
Oh oh what are you waiting for
Take my hand and watch the world go by
I don't feel like I'm falling
She makes me feel like I could be a tower
All the things you love
We won't need them where we're goin'
Life, life, without surrender
You're repeating me lines that you think I wanna hear
Gotta get my feet back on the ground
What you sow man is what you reap
From living hell
That I'm confusing while abusing my mind
We carry it home
I want to turn the whole thing upside down
People around gotta find somethin' to say now
Yes I do now I want you back
That original feeling never went away
Standing in the light now 
Don't really know how I got here
She's enough to make me warm
Caring without pretense, a picnic on the hillside,
Don't play your games with me
And you'll remember these
Sukie was a kid, she liked to hang out in the graveyard
Looking at the stars from underneath the tree
Her mother called her "Mary," but she changed her name to "Tommy,"
That all this shit our President has got us in will go away
Don't look down, so what'd we do
And Sunday always comes too late
I'm down on the ground down I'm really down
Don't ever want to pay for anything anymore, boy
Run round with trousers on fire
But frozen things they all unfreeze and now I taste like
And when I asked her before, she said she's holding it out
If Jesus comes to take your hand I won't let go, I won't let go
Singin' sweet songs
It takes some silence to make sound
I wish she cared to see 
We put them right in our path
To a daydream believer
Oh the unspeakable things
Now she drinks away the will and she's not proud of it
Whoever you are in the light
You know he's been around the world
You can use his higher power
Still photos and noisy arcades
I will not sleep until I've counted to  three times
But I still feel you pulsing like sonar
Still prepared for an attack
Please don't let me go
Your love is perfection
Changing looks slightly like back in the 's, 
It's the way my heart beats,
My My Time Flies A rap on a rhapsody
Till there's nothing left that I haven't tried
Shading my eyes from the morning sun
I need help and you're way across the sea
I felt the darkness of the black metal bands
How can you sleep at a time like this
Well, it's all right all right, we're going to the end of the line
Give it to me bay don't you dare lose it
Baby, let it all hang out
Just trying to get by
The carpet and the trade
Friends help you when you're in danger
I nearly did explode
Build me a home from a cardboard box
I can't get you off my brain
Oh well, I look at you and say
And this is how we introduce them one at a time
No life
You say it's what you need and hide your eyes when you're close to me
All the once upon a times
Dragging the sea of a trouble mind
I kissed your throat every time they said it wouldn't last
For the tree of life is growing
And sweep you off your feet
Yeah, shake it up, baby, now shake it up, baby
Dear Dominique you have a bold imagination
How will I get her to strike a pose
We will find a way
I'm feeling like a lost little boy in a brand new town
All your troubles they don't stand a chance
One more tab and your silk hits the chrome
Love was just something you found to add to your collection
I know I have given you hell
Now all the secrets of old age
I've been waiting all this time to be
I'm going to get you
We're gonna make it through this war tonight
Whether or not our season will soon be done
I feel the same as you
Dreaming of when the morning comes 
You once thought of me as a white knight on his steed
This feeling that remains
You look at me, we kiss and then
I'll see you on the other side
A brother and sister and a dogaphone,
Now there, is this song I wrote
Hey man, now you're really livin'
And the world I'll turn it inside out, yeah
All the things I wanna say, and 
You fall in love for the first time
For my love vibration
Wake me, shake me
You're thinking 'bout your mother way too much"
Clear away the clouds inside my head
Who knew that my luck would change
We're the dream boys baby and we'll make you smile
Chelsea, Chelsea, are you feeling me now
Starsky and Hutch chimps
The arc of time, the stench of sex
The higher you reach the harder you fall
Walking around with shit on my shoes, well, here we come
With a little bit of money we could buy us a car
And I sing songs back to back until I go to bed
And when the leaves return
With a suitcase on your back
Our time is short
And all the swine at the cabaret lick their lips as they clap along
Late nights and early parades
And my supplies in a magic pack
Use your eyes, you'll know you are
Five, four, three, two, one
I gotta
Stop the car, lay on the grass
I just want to feel today, feel today, feel today
Work is anything but quiet these days
Rise and shine my sister
Creating a still photo of a scene
To live and die in it, live and die, live and die
Off the darkness that comes in sometimes
Well if you want to say yes, say yes
I've been all around the world
I can love you better than that
Then played some shows in the suburbs
His greasy fingers strung together and stretching 'cross the sky
To our own fairy tale
This is the definition of my life 
Will start to show
Remember the house we used to live in
So much pain
Does a mullet make a man
She's got super power hips, for super reproduction
Does the pain feel better
Bought plenty of ice for them shinin' on your friends moments
And I see the sun up 
There's nothing left to rise above but you
Good Music save your soul
Together
Are swans deceiving us all Oh, I for one should know
Every word is a curse let loose on me
Messes with my mind
Hello, I've had you on my mind
Lýsir allan heiminn og augun blá
She says she'd like to score some reefer and a forty
Oh please, I bet everybody here is fake happy too
And it's always sad to go, but it's never that sad,
I hear the music hold me tight now baby
And the oceans
I scoured your town, completely aroused
And we talked a lot 
She's getting tired of her high class toys high class toys
And when she knows what she wants from her time
It's a crying shame, I'm all alone
He washed my sins away
And it's a pretty good feelin, yeah it feels pretty good
Deliver de letter
And still I want you all the time
To the room where I'm staying, 
And we'll forget about our problems
She's looking through me
I placed you on a windowsill
And you get the evil eye
Yeah, alright
Na for,ca do amanh~a            	        In the power of tomorrow
Around
You've got the music in you
A little way to your heart
It's a little bit me
Ev'ry day at five
From now on fly as high as I want
With ribbons in her blonde hair
And I followed the sound of music
And they stuck up their noses and started some fights
Let's get a silver bullet trailer
Are shouting up through cracks in the pavement
And I hope you find your train
No matter how they tossed the dice
I squandered my daydreams
It's all in the way you are
Who knew Mind you, I never had to stand in line
There's no need to look around
We'll get there fast
Calls her on the phone 
Eternal life, but you say no
I will not waste my days
Cloning while they're multiplying
I was up against the wall on the west mezzanine
It's time that we
Tomorrow is another day
The Patient, the Patient fall
Follow you home
I take a piece of paper
Have you ever been to heaven at night
And I'd just look on through my love
Ooh, and every time that I'm with you
Byebye feeling
And when she walks
We're holding back our tears
Little me is waiting, standing through the night
Your dad was silent, his eyes were fixed on what was on TV
And then they took my blood type
While my friend, my associate
He said; oh baby fry some more eggs 
There's nowhere else to go, I hope that you'll stay the night
And all you need is a hunger to feed
Look over my sandcastle, and there's a sight to see
He started the day with a mood and a shake, he was finally arranged
I just wish that I could still
Our hearts will spill, over you, over me, over this
Watching the world go 'round
I said, "Hey girls, you are beautiful"
And say what you wanna say
And can I break your sentiment
You've a quiet life out of town
Feel the air moving, submit to the sound
You are always trying to keep it real
Never want to stop at all
We were holding hands walking through the middle of the street
With this slight
Told us where to drop 
I got some shaved chimps
Hannah takes the stairs
Stuffed sailor up, up with eyeball sun
So put your arms around me
With him your troubles you can share
You've got your dreams, I've got mine too
She's got a super long tongue
Such were the grounds for divorce I know
I need you in the daytime
My little tulip my Norge dear
It must have been the way you kissed me
"Help me someone, I'm out here all alone"
People in love, their hearts get eaten
The ground opens and he climbs inside
Still your hands
You and me there's no one watching
With one hand off the side
Why can't they see a good time
Saw you in a crowded bar, pale with hungry eyes
Give me what I need a
And It's frayed at both the ends
What you here for, I don't need it
This is more like April fools
I heard you're feeling 
But everybody knows the truth
I know nature is beside me, when he's inside you
My first one, man did indicted, how I write it, sister can't stand it
All the time
You mean a lot to me
And I'm afraid I won't get out alive
The melting, sliding dice we've always been
This is the way that we love
Well it kind of makes me nervous
And not feel bad about it for days and days and days
Hazing loveless fall into
To Bermuda, Bahama, come on pretty mama
And that clock up on the wall was tickin'
Now you can endure the fear now you can endure the hell
Commit another atrocity,
Oh baby won't you cum again
Dirty old shadow, stay away
To walk out and make me lonely which is all that I deserve
Let's keep the moon awake
Everyone is conversing Everyone's listening
Somebody told me that nothing is for sure
It seems I'm too hip to keep tight lips
With every breath, I wish your body will be broken again
Friends drink beer in the sun
Why are we losing time
Because you looked just like a girl,
Big girls, you are beautiful
And though I walk home alone
But seconds coming back
Hey you, could you ever fall for me
It's outta sight in the dead of night
The chance to be heard, not ignored
Tous les oiseaux du point du jour chantent l'amour
In my mind I was waiting for change
Come, come back to me, honey pie, ha, ha, ha
Though we know we were wrong, we can't give up the fight
And then crawled in my mouth
Baby you're like lightning in a bottle
There's something you should know
That woman come to see you with her song so sweet
Tell 'em whawhat, blood
You always get me feeling better
My lady on the water, place your thumb upon my tongue
Come on save this town
I hope they taste of me forever
Your daddy
Yeah we're all right here so you better eat up
In the distance the desert sleeps
Before the whole thing is through
You'll sell your vinyl records
All of my friends think I'm mad
The sun's going down for you 
You're tellin' tall tales girl
Well its OK, I know you've got the time
Be me, be mine
Light my cigarette and
Let's go home and throw away the key
Wait for me I'm nothing on my own,
Shout out, don't drown the sound
I don't need nothing
So just what does tomorrow mean
She's said, she's a star,
She wants to dance around the world
Birthright's a trouble, my father dug too
So make a move make a move
Coming down there to my heart
I live in constant fear
Or a fucking fit of honesty
I was all right
Attic in a basement
We're not bad people, we're not dirty, we're not mean
Walkin' that walk, talk that slick talk
Can we go far away to the humming meadow
So many interesting effects
How to get from point A to B
The way you spin me around
I was walking away,
Tell her I just did what I was told
Casual we ride, we ride
I think about you day and night, it's only right
A picture of you in your birthday suit
When I saw you on that stage
'Cause wood grain makes all man made things seem so out of date
It's the morning now, it's the evening
We blaze away, oh
It don't matter if it's rain or shine
To decorate the tomb with petals from the groom
This moment is the moment I will appreciate
She'll always give you peace of mind
'Cause I think this whole life is just overrated
Down at the Astoria the scene was changing
I feel again
ABC's 's bring your friends along
Where the shattered glass is lying always glittering
We're going at it tonight, tonight
When we're with all our friends, we will drink and laugh
And let come what may
'Cause some other time is right around the clock 
No matter what they come and they come, they won't leave me alone
Back corner table, order lobsters and Black Label
Told you on the phone across the sea
Confess the dreams
No use to no one else
Won't help to hold inside, give a real, give a real shout out
You know I'm going to take my turn
You just gotta call on me
Chairs to sit and sidewalks to walk on
You gave me love and took it away
I can feel my heart
Have you heard the word is love 
To alter their opinions honey
The sun's coming up 
Everything you see
I've been poking a voodoo doll that you do not know I made 
The way you love me
A chimp in black, like a goth
But I must get from there to here
Psychosis, don't what you call it, oneness might be the closest
An easy girl to love
Chalk it up to bad luck
Once in a lifetime
But then the hell storm came and yelled,
Come on Barbie, let's go party
In my mind, a hard lesson to learn
It's hard to look at me
And everybody wants us to stay with you
And nothing's gonna stop me but divine intervention
I believe in travellin' light
It's a fact printed stained
Don't play the game of time 
And I spend most of my night guessing 
Our time's just begun, oh yeah
And nobody's gonna take it away
Where ho niggas be snitchin' at and often come up missin' at
Tonight we're gonna sing with the power of a thousand tongues
With days like these you couldn't ask for more
Maxwell plays the fool again
She says she remembers
I was still in love
See our friends, see the sights
Oh, yeah
If I lived in Prussia, I'd have some Chinese children
'Cause it's your heart, it's alive
When I feel that something
When the stars are shining brighter
Must have disengaged every phase of the stage
Without a care in the world
But someone else, you see
You say, mmmm, you're my little girl
And leave your clothes over there, that's grandma couch
I picked up the bottle and star sixed it
The fear and the yearning
No good pretending
I'm busy, busy all the time 
I'm not sure about a life after this
Those nasty kids are fantastic
Four letter words won't hold any sway uh uh
So let me be your star for one night that's right
What can I say This house is falling apart
That everything good always would remain 
What's a girl to do with friends like this
Your all right
Driving on the road again the Chevy's packed
Singin', don't worry about a thing, worry about a thing, oh
It comes in a day, then it'll never leave you
A beauty so strange, something he didn't expect
She saw me sneaking out the door
Everybody knows
And having to say
I was hoping that someday
And don't it feel good
You calling her a hooker He without sin cast the first stone
'Cause we just begun
Let's give it a shot, let's give it a shot
At the studio console, asked my man to the right
To the the ones you're with
And get out from behind this plow
Maybe sometimes, we got it wrong, but it's all right
Heyo heyo heyyyo So you say, "Yeah I'm all right"
Make its way across your face
I threw them all away
Ooh If this is what we've got
Yo a lot of y'all sitting with y'all girls
I got
Not as smart as the words you spoke
Ooh C'mon everybody
My uptown girl
Ain't got no gal to make you smile
Who's to say
Let me take you on an escapade on an escapade, baby Take the escapade
That's right I will show it
Ride wit' a G, come and ride wit' a G
Touchdown turnaround everything is safe and sound
Dear Dominique I wrote to tell you you're delightful
We all have a story to tell
You're a parttime lover and a full time friend
I'm telling you, girl, there's no future for us
And I'll promise to fight the wind and waves for you
Walk, walk, cat, walk
Just my nightstand and my dresser
As the people that you know
And I feel fantastic
And I'm singing "oh oh" on a Friday night, and I hope everything's gonna be alright;
They mute up my mind
You'll be wailing when they sell your soul to the repo man
And I've got designs on lighting you up
Just bring your savings and a bottle of wine
Any kind of frog, any kind of bear
Let's sully every stage
Splitting necks and calling it dichotomy
And the dry, cracked, trembling lips
Throw me a lifeline
This road that is narrow is the one we should follow
With you gone, I'm alive,
Everyone, be happy
You closed the door and stumbled down to the street
Reality is a lovely place
It's been a while
Fantasize long enough, you know it just might come true
When you smile
Leave a bad taste in your mouth like moldy liverwurst
Now we're here, with the lights turned low
Why am I weary and why does my head feel so light
I think about you day and night
Only 'cause the sun shined once again
Well take a journey into my mind
Till the next show in the next town
She's a super human girl,
Pictured the look on my stepfather's face
Is that the kind of thing that you think you might be into
I'd like to turn you all upside down
They could not believe that such a body was for real
No, no, no, no I never thought I did
Yes, I am always right
Let the sun shine
I'm as deep as the plot to a gay porn
Can't help but love, you know
And I know that my heart is my home
They rave and shout
I hear her playing the drums late at night
You wear your heart on your sleeve
I was feeling like a champ then, in summer
There's nobody lying next to me dear Yoko
I hope you got a healthy appetite
And I'll really get into it
And if he smiles, it's no more than a genius deserves
No one likes to take a test
For some people it's an easy choice
She didn't feel funny, she didn't feel bad
Summer in the city, and winters in Miami
Can you feel my heartbeat when I'm close to you
Found eighteen reasons I can't pick up on the phone
Playing cards, we all get to act sly
I will leave the wallpaper life and run away to the Foreign Legion
Keeping my head down 
Those certain words I just found
The sun blinded them
Break a promise to your mother
But we're alright though
But I was runnin' on my own two legs 
My heart it dances, 
Floating in circles, there's more to remind 'em of less
Brand new shoes, walking blues
But I think you're a pretty sweet pill that I'm swallowing down
Just kiss me before I go
Trolley cars and buses too
When you got that spiderbite on your hand
No excuse to be so callous
Because there ain't no party
I traced away the fog
On my last night on earth, I won't look to the sky
Hear it out, push it out, watch it how she work it out
Silver scars in your hand, in your hand
Honestly, you can try
I know I'm not the only one
I've been having good days, think we are the right age to start our own peculiar ways
We're gonna be alright ooh, baby Ooh, ooh Ah, yeah ah yeah
Trying to be a superstar like everybody else
Look up the number How's that, boys
People are my enemies and people are my friends
I wanna feel so brand new,
We want to feel ya hey
So far away I wanna be
I can't defend you truly
If only some rain would fall on the houses and the boulevards
Put out that smoke and breath some air
I'll stop the world I'll stop the world and melt with you
I close my eyes and what a beautiful sight
Always travellin'
I ain't goin' to school
To all the people underground
From a fountain to a river to the seven seas
I started crying
I was young and I was stupidI had just turned seventeen
Don't hesitate to come by, yeah, yeah, yeah
Everything will change, ooh
Ah, la, la, la, love
They get on from here
We got the man then stab him in his back
We are free
Bursts are blocks, Stickle Bricks
And at the show on Tuesday
Some nights I break down and cry
And I've seen honey bees before
He's keeping you inside
Come and rest your bones with me 
Listen to your voice
Every time you get high
I won't take anything away
All of the bad feelings have disappeared
Some things work, but me
You're my every thought here, everything will
To live the rest of our life
I saw the dark side of the moon
The way I'm feeling inside
Oh, been trying to let it go
It's like a picture of a loved one in disguise
You might feel the pain
So can I break your sentiment
I'm leaving you tomorrow, but she already left, she already left me
Been waiting for countless hours
'Cause there's no place that I could be without you
Gonna shake the water out of every nook
Or Thursday watch the walls instead
To  the winter snow
If you catch me with my hands in the till
Money is a sick muse
Knock me off my feet
I don't know why I feel so tonguetied
But I'm gonna dance with three or four
I'm breathing deep before
Don't shrug your shoulders, lay down beside me
Yeah, reminding me
Of the song song
I was feeling the night grow old
So I can dream of you
"High school never ends"
When your song is sung
One more song we can sing along to
Painting testimonial pictures, oh, ohoh, oh
Just to touch a lonely heart
'Cause they remind me of you
All you need is love All together now
Fifteen celebrity minds
I wanted someone to love completely
Baby, I'm dying for another taste
Sometimes we don't pull or flex
Where trouble melts like lemon drops
My brain is burning then I want it all
I can see it clear as day
When I wiped the tears from my eyes
Please write my folks and throw away my keys
Or hold her head down
Sat there with some new girl, what is this
We staked out on a mission to find our inner peace
So let the love tear us apart
Grant my last request and just let me hold you
What that window door went to
Always seems to know the way
You've got heart, and you're going your own way
I check my head, it's getting tighter
You know what I'm sayin', you know how it go
That we will have to part 
And get to work, work, work till the job gets done
And think about you all night long 'cause you're the one for me
He starts running beneath the awnings
We can be heroes just for one day
All I could think of was sunlight
Oh, the trouble we can get in
I'm in love with her and I feel fine
Rush of excitement as he holds it in his hand
But all the news reports recommended that I stay indoors
As I hear your voice it sets my heart on fire
Opinions were like kittens, I was giving them away
Fall in love with a girl like you
Maybe I won't, but your cold eyes baby
Compare where you are to where you wanna be
Just take your time, wherever you go
The way for us to change
Looks like I got here just in time
Yeah I could show you a place
I got most of the means and scripts for the scenes
I need some wheels to move you around
That her baby buys her things, you know
The coral that lies beneath the waves
The many winged escape
I'm driving around in my car
There are so many special people in the world
Watchin' my youth slip away
Well don't lie down on the job, oh yeah
You feel it when the dance gets hot, hot
And when Zak finished Sara's song, Sara clapped
And all those little lambs from my dreams
And if like me you wanna take that chance
So put on that dress tonight
In the middle of a cloud I call your name
One hundred telephones shake and ring
Working weekends just to pay for drugs
You're my picture on the wall
Some day one day you'll miss me
Gonna fix the world up, up for you
Will you wait until tomorrow Will you wait tomorrow
Hello Seattle, I am an old lighthouse
Well, the fall hit me hard 
You're so vicious baby
It's getting too loud it keeps on pushing you out
Whether or not this cold front is moving in
Take me away to be closer
Told me not to take it to heart
Anywhere, anytime or place
You could get back down 'storian
With blue skies ahead
With your wine down my feathers as the cock crows given time
The future's here today
Skipping beats, blushing cheeks
But no matter how far I row
So won't you look my palm over
I need a photoopportunity
I was happy, just getting some answers
And I will find her in skies 
Oh my homie got the booze, I like it like that
That if you go won't you please take me
Rurururun run run
No she don't know that we've been up all night
You didn't have to be so nice Didn't have to be so nice
Standing solo in the sun
Your love it's all I wanted
Do it, do it, all right
You've got everything I need and nobody can please like you, you baby
I'm feeling sexy and free
Young gal, you done me bad and I went and did ya wrong 
And they covered up the sun
So, so I need it too and
Well I'm just a boy
Moving way too fast
So this is the last time that I'll hold your hand
Throw this book away
Going down a bumpy hillside
Well they're the perfect jumping up point
My old clothes don't fit like they once did
So I gathered everything I had left in my world and put it in your
Because we know we can't be found
Suburban Threat was the name and we really were
Sing it out loud, on a trip back honey
And it's going to cause a crisis
You should stop and ask me
For I feel I've held him for all of time, and he said
You say, baby, I only what to make you happy
Fluid lines that soar like towers
Stumblin' with every step I take
My world's on fire, how 'bout yours
In this one horse town, I wanna stay right here
Distant looks from your face, take me to another place and time
But I'm finding now love's unreliable
So backwards the landscape you thought you knew, it starts unwinding
You want it you got it all
Don't you know that Rome wasn't built in a day
Years they, years they, years they 
That will set your soul apart
You can't carry it with you if you want to survive
And we will all go down together
And couldn't you've stayed on the ground
My heart is beatin' like a jungle
We're waiting for the bright light to break through
C'mon we gotta kick that shit
I'm having a ball, oh baby, don't stop me now
Oh, I'm burning through the sky, yeah
Take me off somewhere cold
And I am breathless over you
But you could get back home, you can get back down;
Wyclef extended his hand to me
Return to me
Vegas, New York, and DC, they all ride wit' a G
I've got to change your mind change your mind
Nnnno, no, no, no place I'd rather be
Smudged funnies in a broken bottle
Always seem to be on the run
Feels like the world's at stake 'cause
Double dare kids up pollute their lungs
Let's get into a coma just like the stars
Of the life that's breeding in the dirt
Ooh la la la la, yeah
But if I show it, someone lock me away, because
Chinesespeaking girlfriend, big brown eyes
After changing everything
Started staring at the passengers and waving goodbye
And she has got a baby with brand new eyes
Life ain't always easy and every day
In this brand new colony in this brand new colony
So come on make your move
You've got a smile
You've come to save my life again
Waving goodbye to the audience
Recite your lines and I'll quote scriptures
I put my headphones on
I climbed the stair that led me to your front door
A whole lot of precious time
And I will only look up
She's dying to make it out of this hell
I'm beggin' not to fall
If you find yourself caught in love
Tragedy he used to come through all the time
Yeah, I'm just a teenage dirtbag, baby
Baby, come on
If this the last time
Nothing left to do but to keep on seein' uou
I don't believe that anything can recreate your youth
I get to play at being irresponsible
And I believe this way can be the same for everyone
She'll do a hundred and forty in the top end floored
And so I won't play a part in your mistake, no way
Now it's me against the world
Here we are, here we are,
Well, it's all right all right, if you live the life you please
Single in his bed somewhere
If we could find a reason, a reason to change
Are you callin' me darlin'
Hey there sister wife
We've lost the plot
I hear a song makes me think of a girl I used to know
Girl, I said, ooh
Now a whole lotta woman
And I need to practice my dancin'
I gotta message for your auntie
I say, we can dance if we want to
It's one of those days for taking a walk outside
I haven't found the one for me
Faster we'll divide all the sense
Change the weather, still together when it ends 
And the question that comes forward
And when tomorrow's too much
Will dry the tears behind your eyes
Eftermiddagen går
Won't you take me where my feet feel happy in their own time
And I didn't even know it
But that doesn't mean my eyes will soon be turning red
I met a girl who kept tattoos
Kids across town
In his magical armchair
Well homie let 'em know that they shit out of luck
Oh just burn down the house
Away with the small ideas, I know I'm not the only one
When the dream lights are turning on
Bright as ever
You make the whole world wanna dance
I know you understand
Messageminder
My trouble raised its ugly head
Onwards past never and still faster x
I'm gonna put, put things in perspective
How can you hate something that you ain't have tried
When, it all amounts to nothing 
With a lovely wife beside him
I got a dalmatian, I can still get high
Well, it's all right, even if you're old and gray
I say high, you say low
Good men come to those who wait
Measuring your dreams of this life seems
But when you make demands
Every night, oh darlin'
If my tips helped send a pretty girl through school
Turns out there's nothing at all
Still be into you 
You You baby, you
Left, right, left, c'mon
Not something real so I'd rather keep whackin'
You can stretch right up and touch the sky
Known to act wild and make girls smile
The wildfires look so pretty
I'm sure, because I'm in so far to know measure of love ain't lost
Wit' dreams of ownin' a records label, flippin' words
With a little luck we could get away from where we are
It's really hot and a little bit sour, we're getting your strength to maximum power
We are still learning
I can feel the bones are smiling in my body
In the light that passes through me
I'm just looking for a little squeeze
Don't let it show
Staying on the turning away
If it's not over baby,
Sh sh shouldn't need anyone
Oh, I wanted you to move
I'm yours and you're mine
It's just a dream he keeps having
Well, staring through a window, standing outside they're just too happy to care
The tree by the river 
Four days, she's back with me again
And keep it locked up underground
Don't get your dribble on my
With fronds like these, well who needs anemones
Love is all you need
You won't have to say it twice
Never dreamt of such sterile hands
So we could walk down to the stream
Make sense of the scene
Saving face with all your friends
Do it wrong or do it right, it's alright, it's alright
He'll find me fighting back a terrible force
Oh yeah a big boat,
Listen to Iron Maiden, baby, with me
Oh if I was an Injun yeah, if I was an Injun, uh huh
We can start right now
And it feels like
Wasn't even like that kid
Somebody say ih hih ih hih ih
Old dirt road
She's the kind of girl who's not too shy
It's still early morning
Since my heart is golden
You can see the truth, you can see the way
Really don't matter 
Do your thing, make my body sing
The boxes and rings and get going
You're breaking up the girl
How dare you come to me like Withnail for a favor
We'll sit for days and talk about things important to us
I mean the world to a pottymouthed girl
And I'll play the games that you want me to play
Wanna hold you like never before
Picture yourself in the living room
C'mon everybody, move your feet
If I had a scheme for everything,
A jackofalltrades and a master of none
For once I can say
Empty arms
But they all figure the only way he make a fortune cruise
A life with you I want
I'm lookin' at you
Follow if you wanna or just hang around
Packing guilt for a trip
We long to see the sun
I saw my friend when she's finished working
When you have to work late 
Don't recall a time I felt this alive
We'll come again 
To everybody
I need some time to define my mind,
We would shout and swim about
'Cause every time you hold me in your arms
There will be no flowers flowing
Acan I, can I get get get to know knknow know you better better baby x
Don't let go; You've got the music in you
He also said, "Imagine you go away
Author of the moment
I wake up in a room and realize I'm insane again
There's nothing you can do
To me ain't nothing else
You know you make my world light up
And we don't care about the old folks
It didn't suit Sukie
When I came to, my kneecaps were off and they were soft, I had jellybones
Your mother should know knoow
I wanna be the one
I know you got the feeling and I can't say I'm agreeing
A book called Timbuktu
Always the same
And that's the way I like it
If you can't dance 
And we're taking some pictures or something
'Cause she's the girl all the bad guys want
As I turn to you and I say
We're on our way somehow
That's all right, don't worry 'bout it honey
To what I've got to say
I can't tell you but I know it's mine
By the time I recognize this moment
A ghost is born
And I don't wanna choose just one
Even more than I did
This time, this time, this time
She's waiting for a soldier to come home
The rain, the rain, the rain, the rain, my rain now 
Though I never meant to let it get away from me
It's gonna come I swear I swear I swear I swear that it is
A pack of men, they're yours to stay,
I said please stay
I was born on the day the music died
I think I can make it now, the pain has gone
Never grumbles or fusses, always treats me right
Yeah we can nurse it all night
It rockets through the universe
Put it in your heart where tomorrow shines
Real niggas recognize real niggas, and ye ain't none
Hot Chelle Rae
The water feels nice, dive deep down under
It's ending all too soon you'll see
It's been a long cold lonely winter
Just Hold on, yeah hold on
Here's a picture of my mother, there's no one like she
I'll never act my age
Well you knew all along
Always my first choice
I'm halfway through a test
As you know, I've never been a confident man
And you can't understand why all the other boys are going for the
We know that something is wrong
The most truly repellent techno music ever made
Watch out we are rhythm bandits
Come on, baby, let's get away ooh Baby, c'mon, now
Just to find the ground deserving of your feet
Are you quick to kiss
I'd rather dance with you than talk with you 
I can't stop my breathing in
Soundstage in California, televisions in Times Square, yeah
Uhuh, I got stung
Knows no lines
And then we hide from light 
In the midnight, moonlight hour
And it's frayed at both the ends
Traveling by choochoo train
The songs that I have sung
You break through them all
And love
Crime is on the rise, I still want you
I'm the one
 Chinese brothers; 
Don't run away now
'Cause I'm not afraid to die alone
Just tell me when it's coming around, coming around
Please, please cure me
I'm all grownup now, baby, can't you see
I feel like I let them down when I don't wanna trade my sunshine for a cloudy night
I'll take off all my clothes to the thrift store
I bet her mama never told her why
So let that feelin' grab you deep inside
Or just forget about your life
She said there's something about you 
Nuclear distress, I still want you
Turn your right on your left
My tears rolled down and arms went round at night, I gapped at her gowns
Seconds away, Seconds away
She makes my head
It's a nuclear show and the stars are gone
Behind my back, you're supposed to be a friend
There's Judy Garland taking Buddha by the hand
I threw mine to the sky
Practiced for millions of years
And maybe you will be the one
Set me free, baby
And I probably forgot to tell you this 
And in the sea there is a fish
It's, oh, so still
I've known a lotta girls before
To the ruby redwood tree
She's the night pick of the day, yeah
Well here comes my bab
I want the best and the best things in life are free
Tell me all the things that I wanna hear
Long time ago
Everyone I know's been so good to me
I've got one week behind me,
I'm getting rid of my phone, and I made it clear
Why don't you walk out the door
We are getting better
The way that she does it, I can't get enough
I can read you, you're my favourite book
This could be the right time to change
Your world can change forever
I've terribly taken a turn for the worse now, I fear
Baby, oh baby, oh baby
Oohwoowee, wild night is calling
In the streetlight dawn, this beat turns on
Music is my brother
But I don't care, 'cause right now you're mine
Of his golden thread
You got everything they don't, uh
Come on, come on, Come on just get yourself inside her love
That might stop the tick of time
The colors of the evening stars
Should one of us had blinked
But the hard times are golden
Say it's time to leave 
She just can't stay home anymore
Now, right now
Well your laws are for dummies, yeah
We're gonna break it to your folks tonight
Hello, hello 
You've got your headphones on
He knows that time can not endlessly go
Oh, they've eaten this one
And I hope you enjoyed it,
It could be a dream come true
Come go with me, we've got it made
I suppose our thoughts about United Nations
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah I want you back
I've got no money, got no secrets
Here's an evening dark with shame
If it's a dry life that you want
And I wish that you could give up this game
Yes, I'm sure you're right
Everybody's trying to be a billionaire
If you seek a pillow for your head
This could really be a good life, good life
It's the ride we take
There's no time for fighting 
But don't ever go away
Mom and daddy says Sleep a lot, eat a lot, brush 'em like crazy
One thing that I could never confess
I'm twenty stories up, yea up at the top
I never have a bad thing to report
Come on let's go get it on
The dream of all the bowlie kids that hang around here
I wish that I knew what I know now
Night time is so pretty
Dusty brown boots in the corner by the ironing board 
I put that record on just to make a sound
These lines of lightning mean we're never alone
So go unlock the door
Shake it, shshake it
And all the sunshine banishes the dark
Dive straight in on your girlfriend
It's just an ittybitty little thing on my mind
Me and him together, la la la la
Of the game
Hey, all right now
Won't help to hold inside, give a real, give a real shout out, Matt
Above this dull apartment view
But you don't pull my strings because
To make me come alive
That kind of soft, that kind of silly
It's setting the stars all on fire
I'm lota, yo sir
But it feels so much better now that it's done
The only thing you'll get is this curse on your lips
It's a crying shame, that the love you've made
'Cause I just wanna be your baby tonight
In your tank top, rainbow styling
Sgt Pepper's one and only Lonely Hearts Club Band
Shut up and dance"
Blow steam in the face of the beast
Good morning
I hope they didn't get your mind
Let's do it now, 'cause one day we'll both be old
And love is not the answer if you're taking me for a ride
So come on and hold my hand
It's up in the morning and on the downs
And you can hear she's a beautiful girl
Please oohooh
And a five mile sky over me
I've got something I can laugh about
Sit down, enjoy the show
It was like Rockaway Beach in the month of June
I never learned just get up and go on
He takes off both of his shoes
You've even got money to spend
To get better with time
If you knew what you do
Providing that's what you are into
Waiting for the salty water
But more I gave the less I've got, oh yeah
Pay back the chicken back, back,
And time
Do you wish upon a star
Blood stripe falcons
The clown with the frown driving down to the sidewalk fair
Moving in boredom but I'm sitting around
Inquisitive mind, you're destined to find
of TVC as it sings you goodnight 
All the people I have left behind
Winding through, a plot controller from another age 
The future's trying to wait
Honey pie, honey pie
Thinking of you like the way that you were
And you don't even know my name
You're so ooh You're so, so ah You're so, so cool Baby, baby, you're so
We been so long waiting
Well you better go back to beautiful Texas
With the sun shining down over me and you
Butterfly
They want us to fight, but we just wanna get high
We'll be starting what you're searching for
Perfect picture card scene, changing all that has been
Buzzin' in my head
Survivors there were none
Once again if I feel better
Come meet me in the sky I'll be waiting for you
I believe that I hear them say
The sky's blue so what should we do
All things go, all things go
All this love saved up for nothing
Call on a Monday, come on a Tuesday
I've already noticed the many cuts 
And there's this scene in the show when a hustler knows he's gonna die
Now there's a whole lot of faking
You pretend to know exactly all the things you keep on moving
And though I can't guarantee there's nothing scary hiding under your bed
By the eyes of the blind
Weatherwise it's such a lovely day 
Then I guess I fall
Brainstorm,
I had some nightmares
Daddy works a long day
Money got no hold of me
Ah shake it shake it
Jumpin' out the window
And honey, there's no hurry, 
To do this things that people do
Till neighbors would knock on your door
Hold it up, hold it tight,
Yeah got my friends right to the end
I know he knocks you off your feet
Tell 'em to buzz off your nutz we don't care what people say dudes who critique clothes are most gay
'Cause I talk of nothing but you girl
Dream like there's nothing to scream about
I sometimes lose myself in me
The tracks'll run for miles when I feel those
I can't stand it
He's teaching mamas and papas how to be a little cool
Sentada do seu lado eu queria encostar
And the grass stains are wet on your new jeans
I'll be by your side
Watch who's gonna get you back on the bus
At a weekend dance we like to show up last
Good day, sunshine
You see mom, I'm a good little boy Good little boy
Oh, but I'll be right there beside you,
And I'm dizzy from her kiss
I bet she never had a backstreet guy
And even when you're gone I listen to my favorite songs
, , , , let's go to, the, the dandance floor
He's a Spanish fly who bucks like a stallion
Neon black cocks rot into poison wine
I'm down down down on the ground
Well, he just drove off, sometimes life's okay
Before I lose control
On the corner is a banker with a motorcar
I don't think you even realize, baby you'd be saving mine
Find something to hold on to or to let go
Springs comes in when I'm rolling up another one
I feel it all in the center of my heart
Don't let me go
Show up in the crowd, take a look around
Is killing me right now Uh
Take all of your money give it all to charity
I've got music on my radio
The motor in my head turns
He said to only look up
If I stay in one place I lose my mind
'Cause I ain't never had nobody like you
And the waiting scene and the Sunday dream 
Riding my decision home
Up in dark and empty skies
But uh oh, I love her because
Your bleedin' heart's at my command
You're all out of tune
Oh sing your life
You only need to know
Be the most closed minded as I could get
I could die in a hundred odd ways
'Cause she's the girl all the bad guys want There she goes again
See I would if I could I'd do anything spontaneously
Baptize your tears and dry your eyes
No traces of civilized living eaten by earth
I feel it too
Could he be waving from a tropical sunset
But nobody knows the way
Leave the joyful air in that rubber ball today
You got potential come on
And the sign said "Long haired, freaky people need not apply" x
Say love will never ever be lost on me
Oh, I ain't foolin no more
While I'll forgive you of anything
Just walk on by, don't turn around
We'll agree to call it The Compromise 
And that's all right, I must confess
Listening to the sound
The busy sister's stunning, won't she be stunned
How come that I could feel so free
I didn't wanna know the things I knew       
If you could just crack the shell open
But every time I fell for you
If you don't hurt me then you die
I have returned to the Northern skies
I hope some day you'll understand
Hard times, well all I know is that
Well, it's all right, sometimes you gotta be strong
The new year is out here
And I was so in love I thought I knew what love was all about
No more runnin' 'round with the usual crewwho cares
But she likes the way you sing
I left the house left the room with the foxy on my back
So wipe the sleep from your eyes
Or you may be daydreamin' for a thousand years
Yeah, I like it when the girls stop by in the summer
I'll take off all my clothes for you
One summer night's the only time we've known
Because I haven't read a single book all year 
Bombs outside, such a small forest laughing at me
"I quit, you you m I didn't I didn't make it all the way through that"
Slow it down and take a little time
Chop the tree
With locked arms, making me nuder to everything
So deep you say
Everything you are now
'Cause it'll give me time to think
You know dessert comes last
It's the trees of this day that I do battle with for the light
I just want to be bothered with real love
People say, get away, somebody will turn you in
Wish I knew how you do it to me 
I know, I know such a big day
Yeah I know nothing ever falls apart
Always so eager to pack my bags
You're a old school dude with a kick on your shoes;
Let the traveling band on the interstate remain
Who can take the rainbow
Yeah it's all right, all right, tonight, tonight
While lessons learned go down the drain 
You'll find a soul behind a thrill
When you're bored and you need a kick
And make no mistake, my friend
You can be the word I, can be the rhyme
Well, I sincerely miss those heavy metal bands
Webbe As my feet become unstuck
And the kids on the corner playing ghetto games
I've got someone new who's just like you
With every breath, I wish your body will be broken again, again
I spread those maps out on my bedroom floor
And let me live my life
Oh marry marry me oh baby now I am insisting
In my mind I try to let go, it's so hard 'cause you're all I know
I got faith you know
I jump before I get around you
You heard me on the radio about one year ago
Come to life on a brass spring
Ah, la, la, la, life is meaningful
Go bbbbbbbb  honeeeeey
And maybe I can meet you in the morning
So we make a lot of noise
You get me through, ah
'Cause I've been having too much fun
Clap along if you feel like that's what you want to do
The bluff's a classic 'cause it always works
Oh I wound around you for miles
This is a lonely place This was a home of mine
See how the sun shines brightly
One or two oohoohs
Such a thing as love
We'll see our name in city lights
Do you believe in magic
The moment that you stepped into the room you took my breath away
Heart is pure and thoughts are clear Love, release our mind
Dip it in a dream
Meet me at the house with all my heart
Then this somebody, somebody is you
Oh kiss me with your eyelashes tonight
When the wind comes racing off the river
The way it begins
Boom boom boom an a
Just say hello to the ground
Bounce bounce, baby Bounce bounce, baby
Four people
This is the hardest story that I've ever told
When you walk out through your door, I'll wave my flag and shout
On the floor of Tokyo
Flowery frocks, no uh oh
Is it amanaemonesia
This boy has broken down, yeah yeah hey
Behind the craze there's a pretty sunset
Until the birds had flown away
I've gotta big, big, big heartbeat, yeah, I think you are the sweetest thing
What more do you want baby
When we hear that song, we will dance
Keep your head up
To say
Everybody wants to go to Japan
Every silver lining's got a
Hand me down my pants and get me off this street
In that sweet cool darkness
And everything looks like a giant cupcake
Uh I can hear you calling
Let you go baby
And you know you love me and it shows
We are all alone, but we're better off by ourselves
Feeling as good as lovers can, you know
In an octopus's garden in the shade
But you're a million miles away
Wrecking ball outside the door
Just give them back to me please
If you're willing just to take a chance
These constant broken heartbeats sound like breakbeats
A tree gave me a fruit 
What you need
Hey, yeah
'Cause I've been waiting, I've been waiting, I've been waiting, yeah
I don't do that kind of thing
Car je ne t'en demanderai jamais autant
I've barely been gone
I feel mighty fine, y'all
Your gonna scream the pain away
The sleeping in minor, the gold leaf, the tire
I wanna make a supersonic woman of you
I feel myself changing
Now she doesn't feel lonely but she'd just as soon
Oh no, my friends
Till your sinews spoil
Coming home
A friendly face will bring you around
What a ride
I borrowed your suitcase and filled it with pearls and gold, 
And even if you try and hold me back, there's nothing that you can gain
I'll repay you in the end
Oh, that's a slowrolling country caravan
Saved you the room you used to stay in every Sunday,
Payback the donkey, payback
For when I'm a billionaire
Like a kitten up a tree
You could beat out the comp
Over the twilight you're listening for me
Once in a while you get shown the light
But then he cracks a smile
But you can make my bed
Oh, Mister Blue Sky, please tell us why
There could never be a father
You tell me that your love is true on each and every day
I dream of cherry pies
How d'you do  Comment allezvous 
To help you through the hard nights like a flask filled with hope
If I should fall away
But we can say we really try
Ooh, ooh baby I want you back
We make a pair of parentheses
All the blearyeyed boys getting high on the low street
I could take you to heaven
Fighting for her country's name
That's why we got more hits then a dealer at a Dead show
I'm on sunshine, baby, oh
Tryin' to pretend that we both know
My waist it's got a slinky belt
And says I never ever thought that you'd be messing 'round
And far away somebody read the letter
To things like feet
Then can we become love's persona
You're such a such a such a strange girl
On my last night on earth, I'll pay a high price
Oh girl, when I'm in love with you
Give me love
Of his run down eighties car
So I'll never feel alone in your arms
Is he teasing you with underage
Come on, come on, the fun is just begun
So whatever you saying, it don't entertain my ego
Your envelope and fall to little pieces every time
And if the sunshine has a meaning
Yeah we all think we're right but we're wrong, we're wrong
I asked somebody "Could you send my letter away"
Don't you worry baby I'll be right here
She's got superpower lovin'
Calm your ears baby
My mind takes me back there, oh, so quick
Alors défendezvous
Snowmobile on the field where the gunners throw their weight around
So listen carefully
But this love is ours
Love is all you need
Copped mad cars, laying back in the driver's seat
She knows she's losing it, oh yeah she's losing
You're lovely baby, this war is crazy, I won't let you down, OH NO no
Oohoohooh, hoohoo, hoohoohoo
Comes down to hope
Boy won't you turn your game boy off
Call your office on the phone
As they carried you away
The devil's in the air and I'm spitting out prayers,
But feeling this way he's just playing a part
There's a village I visit, that's Vaguely
Not in my name
And I ain't got no time to kill on your dime
And send you reelin' where your love can't hide
It feels like so, so,
So I may understand
You're father pointed out that you said copy
I was glad that it didn't destroy you
All them tears gon' come and go
And I'm racking my brain for a new improved way
And if you're partial to the night sky
Put my glasses on so no one sees me
'Cause what we are, is victims of fun
What if I led a different life, would you stay
Well I can tell you for the money
Someday we'll meet beyond the stars and it'll be
Here we are, livin' the dream
She moved so easily 
Time is not the constant my friend,
Your head is there to move you around
All the people above us
And then I open my eyes
We had no money to speak of
You can trip
Underneath the stairs
So glad that you fell in love with me
Good times around the corner, good times around the corner
The world we loved forever gone
You can show me the work that you've done, your fears have been disguising,
And they took it away from me
Give love, give love
Why is it always, always
Don't give up, oh no, all right
I'm gonna be the man who comes back home with you
Hey, remember that time when you OD'ed
Underneath our feathered skin
So hot I can't stop staring
Do you got mic control
I'll give you a taste
If wishes were trees, the trees would be falling
Get back here, yeah
Back down, you could get back down, 'storian
I've been waiting, I've been waiting, wanna know if you'll wait for me too
And when I'm dreaming, well, I know I'm gonna dream
So I missed a million miles of fun
That's the cause, just because
Við spilum út um allt saman
Girl, I gotta tell you, I'm feelin' much better
I love you never talk in dreams, 
And watched the sun rise
And you're with me around the clock, all around the clock
Taste where we are, play the music loud
I'm starting to kink
'Cause I can't get over you,
The goddess really smiled upon our love dear Yoko
Over years spent tracing, wondering how you left your track
Right here between their crossfire
So what do you say hey hey
You quiver like a candle on fire
And if I didn't hurt so much, you know I'd give you it all
Before I do something lame
From indigo to crystalline
Suck my menthol feeling fresh all night long
Gonna shoot somebody
Hey what's the matter
Because your baby is so far away
Upon the stairway to your room
Everybody in here has got it goin' on and I can't compete with that
You see, I just can't stop it
And still you want me all the time
A double kick drum by the river in the summer
The moon pours down like mercury
You are the light by which I travel into this and that
Life's for living, yeah, that's our philosophy
Your western homes are locked forever
I am the wizard of ooh's and ah's and falala's
Like a song I once sung
You just need
And in the flood of morning light
And the skin violin is where the neighbors wont read meals
I love you Amy
Do ya, do ya, do ya, do ya love me do ya love me, 'cause I wanna know
Hey heart on the road again
But when the weather's nice all the other guys don't stand a chance 
She wears a twoway, but I'm not quite sure what that means
The open sky
In a cancer ward where the patients sit
Shut up about it, no one can bring you down now
Stay by my side Stay by my side
You got me losing my mind
My mama said to me
Is all I have to show for
No, I'm not asking much of you
I need you here with me
This place is so lovely
The Mason winter door
This is my body
Banging on the door
What have we become America
When we touch I get a
Where I've been for the past few years or so
I feel like I'm in paradise
There's a baby in the bedroom, he's starting to scream
You can drive all night
And ask her out because she'll most likely agree
Se esmera, cora,c~ao            	        Do your best, heart
Strolling so casually 
Tell everybody I'm on my way
A fire, I can warm my hands 
For the face that I once saw
A pair of frozen hands to hold,
There was a time when my world
I'm the American dream 
If you leave me all alone, I'll make a mess for sure
You played me boogiewoogie I played you love songs
We talkin' bout  million dollars here, this ain't Playdoh dough
Play that thing
I wonder how you touch yourself and curse myself for being across the sea
You could be the end of me
I need a definition, is it love that we're sharing
I can feel, I can feel, I can feel the celestial beings
My time
No time to be strong enough
Swing sets, grade schools, and black eyes
Now I've lost it all and I don't feel a thing
Wish that I could step away and breathe
When the rainy days are dying
Something we can see but not reach or be
Tonight our song will find it though
Little bit of love, little bit of love, little bit of love, little bit of love
Leave the slot machines on the riverboat
There was a car in the bay
You didn't know I'm in a band
Driven outside
You were caught kissing  Chinese brothers, 
Eat it like it's gonna get away
Fill it up, fill it up to the brim with love
So I spend time guessing on you, oh
In the kind of world where we belong
What are you doing there
Pulling you back to me
We found the little man
The more I learn inside the city
So I call you out
You should turn into something
The drunk horn's so violent, all spinning out sounds
Many a time I've before
It's going to be a bright bright
But they can bloody well just try it
I was just singing in the rain
He got smaller and the world got big
And time would be a distant memory, nobody could tell us to stay,
Time and time and time again
A girl's not a tonic or a pill
On such a lovely Sunday
And when you came my heart was saved
Here she comes
Yes the type of lovn' that can tear mine apart
Wet trunks and schoolbooks and sand on my toes 
But we gotta put a guard outside
Duckin' every other blessin', I can never see the message
I know you love to rub a dub with a thug
Shake it baby
Oohoohoohooh, ohoh
And I just handed you a giant load of gibberish
I waited so long
And in this crazy life
I feel sad
Saying we can't go, saying we don't know
Your guns don't bother me
The rest is up to you, you makes the call
You do everything you can 'cause you're never gonna let it get 'em down
God takes care
All the sadness, all the rage
He hits snooze twice before he dies
I can not believe my eyes
Our breath rose in the cold
Don't you ever fear for I'm always near
Underneath the power of the light
Sometimes someone's saying "yes"
Slept in all day 
Shattered but not lonely
You were lazy about it, you made me wait around
I'm daydreamin
Hot hot like a fire
Silver stars in your eyes, in your eye
Like cold lemonade
We gave up before we gave it a chance,
The other guy
There's just something
La la la, it doesn't matter
And I get set to exercise your right
You like the adrenaline rush
Wondering if there are clouds in hell
It's the place to be
Kids today are getting old too fast
And I'm feeling alone
You're everywhere and nowhere, baby
I've been a real bad family man
I know I've got to let it go
Oh, and you love me too
Patterns reformed just like child actors"
Can't forget; We only get what we give
And why's it gotta be dark
Since I heard from that girlfriend of mine
The day expires
Yitho omanqoba
As the kids throw yellow roses on her grave
Boy it ain't long 'til the warning arrives
I'm the next best thing to "X", oral sex
A standin' joker like a vocal oneliner
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah gee baby
Ever dreamed you could own at one time
It's a unique find that only some people get
I lose your heart, and I'll lose my mind
You are earth, I am water 
Said no no no baby music cannot last
Always look on the right side of life
I'm gonna teach them all to work for liberty
Or maybe we were born to come together, or whatever
While outside the leopard frogs sing sweetly
And we'll laugh, yeah we'll laugh
Watch me ride on you On you
We'll live rejoicing, ev'ry day, ev'ry day
And I'd change the song now if I could
She likes to fight
And the world is possibility
If I could be for an hour every day
Your mother should know yeah
All the money
That is running to the promised land
Livin' with the police right behind ya
Hey, hey, gimme just a little break, hey, hey, ain't no more that I can take, hey, hey
But girl I'm not your savior
But no one sees me when I crawl back underneath
How does it feel in my arms
Nothing will come from nothing, you know what they say
Make it everlasting so nothing's incomplete
I should make some time
Now this romantic duel is into the streets, bon appetit, you've eaten me alive
But maybe, I'm ready, I'm falling into you
Whispering to live your dreams instead
For a holiday romance
That do play my favourite songs
He'll look around the room, he won't tell you his plan
'Cause I don't really need to wonder at all
Dreaming of someone else's wife and kids kids and wife
I say hello
But I'm not sure if they're alone  
And here comes Mary
It feels good they're a little tight
But then the sun resets your mind
From the inside after you drive
He's got a heart that will never melt
Right about now it's time for everybody to stand up
And nothing's going to bring me down
You've got your nest and
And when I put my arms around him
But the sky is old
It's like a million dollar phone that you just can't ring
As the days that you hurried and months when it all seemed wrong
And shake the foundations from the skies
I will take off all my clothes for you
Take me to New York, I'd love to see LA
And we'll remember when we said
I am driving in my car up Highway  
For your heart is like a flower as it grows
I've got you
Goddamn, this business is really lame
They're really saying, I, I love you
You're just the one that I've been waiting for
There's no stopping curiosity
Adelaide, Adelaide, you really had me going this time
I'd fall to the bottom and I'd chase all my dreams away
In the middle of a shave
You know we all sometimes, say things we don't mean
The sequence of a life form braised in the sand
You can have a rabbit or a rib
Still it's all that I want to do
You're all our brothers, sisters and our babies
Use it for something good
Well I didn't mind, I didn't mind, I didn't mind
She heard about a place, somewhere she could go 
That everyday he finds, just what he's lookin' for
Can I ride with you until the sunset gets all red
All the sentimental memories you own
An easy girl to kiss
You won't hear me, still you endear me
Then we'll see who's kiddin' who now
Ooh ooh
Before you go and break her heart
Oh, you just gotta call on me
If this is love you gotta give me more
I plan to beat it with a heart
For a few into the city
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
Of love
And I got nothing at all
This is the most magnificent life has ever been
Girls who are on magazine covers
Or alone, that would be better
Can we take the next hours and talk about me
When I let go of your throatsweet throttle
All we need is a chance now
I never tried to hold you tight until you left me and
Replaced her uniform with dresses, silk and green
May I remind you that you don't live in poverty,
You're the apple of my eye
Can you see it in your thoughts
So tell them all I'm on my way
In this days' modern times,
When you act like a man who is cross with every woman he's never had
Music is power, let it flow through your mind
One fine day we'll fly away
That the one who falls from grace
Your eyes, they never looked so good at me
Childlike, no one understands
The bullets may singe your skin
Well, look at the kid from school
But I never had the feeling I could offer that to you
She'll get what she wants
They say you have to have somebody
And I began to smile and I said
It will turn around
With a fool
She wears a new dress everyday
My world's getting clearer
Then I gotta get, right back on the block
Got my dreams, got my life, got my love
Still stuck on the line
When its hot baby uh
You are never ahead of, never behind us
And we're alright though
If you wanna get with me
I went to the market to fill up my heart
Four of fish and finger pies in summer
We're making moves so blind
Eternally it will always be
I shoot at a full moon  what's my line
I call my dad; I call my dad
Meeting a team from history
Well you got so much more than I figured was in store,
To take it to the top
To see through super human vision
It's true, everyday I stumble
"You'd think the world was ending
And the dream that you dare to, why, oh why can't I
Then we'll take a long walk through the cornfield 
Ooh, woo, ooh I gotta get my feet back on the ground
Watching a film with a talking dog
Sun is in the sky, oh why, oh why
I picked up a seashell
This June Erica and myself are gonna have a little baby
You can bathe me in your finest wine but I'll never give you mine
And then this one never really understood the s is over and done
I kissed you goodbye at the airport
Boy do you hear me say
Rid my head of this pretense
Oooooh weee, ooh wee, lalalala, lalalalalala
Begin to feel rather sad
Look around see what you do Blue
Struck another shot up to  hours in June
You take your girl
That was one lonely night
Kiss up and rub up and feel up
But it felt like handcuffs
The beavers are so cute 
To do the things that will break his heart
Happiness, how do you get to be
Fails to mention I still hate you
I want somebody new
Another day to sing about the magic that was you and me
Know, my own electricity
But you can't quit cause Jackie needs the benefits
I knew I had to make my, decision
An incredible eight foot heap
Every day we just
Living our life
You don't need this
Maybe losing my mind
On the way to Venus
Hey You know my name
But that's what you do to earn your daily wage
But I'll be back all around the way
And they way they stand
All the doubts I had have gone away
If you are confused, check with the sun
I'm a child 
I almost dropped out to move to LA
When I Google I only get depressed
The next location is mine
Said, "Where you going man, you know the world is headed for hell"
So what if your friends think I'm crazy, well
And smell the ocean in your hair Ocean in your hair, ocean in your hair
And there's something
Then you moved on Woe oh oh oh
Besame Cuando Estes Bailando 
All right maybe gonna find him today
To crawl inside you
'Cause I told you a thousand times
Want me girlie to come give me some sweet lovn'
Over and over Started my rock 'n' roll fantasy
I almost wished you would have loved me, too
Everything you could need
Said little women with your pretty red dress on
And we always lack suspense
Oh baby, I do, I do, I do, do do do do do
We dug for money, we shoveled four tons
'Cause I'll be there, wherever you are
Oh, just fooling around
Gonna try, try, try 'til the morning comes
It makes me smile and it keeps my teeth clean
Is this the last time my dear
Oohwayooh
I, I can remember I remember
Oh I dream of yesterday
And goodbye
And flash right through the scene
I want something else
Uh, come on, come on, Come on jump a little higher
Oh, see you and me, we lay awake in lust and rust in the rain 
Only time, only time
Had a boy once who loved me
Well, I need you to tell me what to wear 
Whooooh
Say a few spells and baby, there you go
Choose it tonight
Excuse Me  Did I Do Something Wrong
I'm in love I'm in love
But I feel no pain
How do I get myself back to the place where you said
And it starts in my toes
He got where he was going at the age of sixty two
The singalong songs will be our scriptures
And carry the hope that stings all night long,
To the thoughts of my imagination
Saint Jerome, I don't ever ever wanna be alone
Can't get no love without sacrifice
So don't you worry your pretty little mind
Shake your coconuts, come on, coco boys
When I saw you getting down, well, I hope it was you
Wonderin' Wonder why the girls don't look at me when I walk
Oh, kiss me beneath the milky twilight
That makes you feel so new
The road outside my house is paved with good intentions
Walking 'round London town
So dry and lonely 
With a little help from my friends
His only catch all day
Past infidelities please do not send
I break tradition
When you do things like that 
That's why we have come to collect you bodies
But you don't bode, you don't pay, you got everything you need
Everything laid out for you
Then you turn your back and they're gone so fast
She's kinda hot though
A dream that has come true
Forty grand, looked into her eyes, I saw tears falling
Well, I feel just like a child 
When you're donex
On each street is a tree
They say candy is sweet, but it just can't compete with you, baby
I'm gonna make your life so sweet Yeah, yeah, yeah
Such a wonderful plaything
Okay I'll tell you why I never look back
If you pull them all together
The world's turning 'round for you 
In the middle of a dream
But darlin' I'll find a way
When your beating heart explodes
We're goin' where the wind is blowin'
I've seen a lot of joy and I've seen a lot of pain
Well you didn't stop
The old are getting older, watch a young man die
Well if you've gots the poison, I've gots the remedy 
I'm walking on sunshine, whoa
Thier watchin us walk
But they'll drop you without hesitation if you try changing the station
I let in the light
Well, all right Well, all right
I won't worry my life away
Sing, sing along, along any song you want to
Here she comes, wooh
Wrap this child in mercy  heal her
It's getting better since you've been mine
Lala, how the life goes on
When chandeliers light up the engine room
I've never been the type to call
The world is everlasting
I tried, I'll try to start again and find somebody
Oh, Thursday doesn't even start
Just my imagination
Call a man
No you can't control it
But all their words and actions come entirely from you
Do you remember when the only thing that mattered was
I was lying on the grass of Sunday morning of last week
She was looking kinda dumb
Sent afishing for a whalebone corset frame
Till the angels hung around
And you say I'm such a cliche,
Followed where you walked, dad
But I will bend the light pretending
And the sun is unrelenting
How do I live for the moment
Here's a little song I wrote
Todo lo que todo lo que todo lo que sé repeated til end
So far away from here
That's what they say
And I feel better
It's been a year or more since they shipped me to this foreign shore
Staring at the dark
Maybe we were born to love
We're holdin' hands in the rain
The doctor's not in
Tell me my name, tell me my name
And you light me up
It seems, for years and years
Daydreaming bed scenes in
Pretending that no one is there
Yeah we shut our eyes though we're in doubt
From movin' on with an Oregon girl
All my time is in half life
I'm just trying to make you mine
You can hop on down and stay warm by the fire
Sand beneath our feet, big blue sky above our heads,
We danced in Leeds with Brit Pop Haley
It seems the cost of dreaming's left me in the red
Better than a chick that say yes too soon
I'm here darling to enjoy the party 
I can't feel
We've been on the same boat since day one
Up from the basement to my best friend's farm
You didn't RSVP
And watch this life pass me by
What a glorious feeling
I got depraved chimps
And without the day
I got stung by a sweet honey bee
Your lips on my lips
Now, there are mountains and rivers
We'll leave the light of day
You better come back to Earth again
Been getting too hard not to mention 
The spotlight's on
Still, the fire of love is true
This ain't fair uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh
Still it's fine from afar, 
Your antarctic hair, off with the crown
I work hard cause at the end of the day
It's okay It's okay
Don't tell me 'cause you know it's gotten worse
Sugar, shake it, shshake it Oh
Want to go for a ride
A world of possibilities
Oh yeah, oh yeah, what's that ya see
From what I heard with skin you'll win
And you were looking so cold
'Cause uptown funk gon' give it to you woo
Ain't no stopping us
I want love in the afternoon
So hold my hand
Say you will, say you won't
Is it from the baby Jesus glow
Everyone from the place
And so I drew a new face and I laughed
I need to believe
Another road where maybe I
I got friends locked in boxes, that's no way to live
Colours are where my brain finds glue
And put your feet back on higher ground
Praying like a fool that's been on the run
For you to get up
It's a phone with appeal
Your cigarette cuts to the inside
I duck and I sway  what's my line
You're gonna win it for yourself and us today
And there are things you can't avoid, you have to face them when you're not prepared to face them
Remember the look upon her face
"Time to put the earphones on"
We are reflections
Surely there's some walls out there that you can go and spray
But Abraham Lincoln was the great emancipator
Is anyone listening Are we listening
And will you remember me
Aurélie, die Männer mögen dich hier sehr
The way your words keep me in line
Everybody's playing in the Heart of Gold Band, Heart of Gold Band
Of money
How do you do Welcome to the human race You're a mess
The nursery rhymes that helped us out in making sense of our lives
Stop crying like a child
Now you're living in my house
Yeah if I lived in Ireland, I'd have some Chinese children
Well, you're really cool and you always say the right things to me
So let the people talk
Because you tore down the walls that the world that has put inside my head
And watching the evening news
Especially when she came and spread her wings
And I'll stare off through the darkness
Best things are green now pimpin' get your paper
Friends are the ones who are there at the end
I raise my head and whisper
There's so much I need to say
Your embrace was my air
But I'm not asking for a storm
Anything that say anymore
I took a right, I took a right turning yesterday
Yours sincerely wasting away
And love, just like blood, will always stain
This is the part where you leave me
Well they work in both ways
My hands tied up around these words
Your girlfriend says it's time to sell,
And I don't know whose land were on
Blondie, Blondie
Some days I wake up dreaming
There were moments I lived without lying on my side
In the place that you had it last,
Crack it open, let me outta here
I feel positively filthy standing next to you
It's drinking away the summer days
And speak my point of view, but it's not sane
Woahohoh, come on, ohohoh, all you party people
Some people change lovers like they change their sheets
When nobody understands
Can you feel my heartbeat when I'm close to you, ohoh, ohoh
Or around the bonfire in Nailors' cove
Come and get it, such a big day come and get it now
Half of them won't know until you're gone
Imagine all the things I could do
And I hope you'll miss me too
I'd chase you for a day
You will find those lingering voices
Dancin' in the moonlight
Oh, this is the greatest peace I've ever known x
It's Lovely day, lovely day
Now so much I know that things just don't grow
And let's love loud
As your friends complain
Now's the chance to choose what you'll regret
Come on, baby, let's get away ooh
I'm living for the light
As sure as though it always seems to stay the same
She can't be dumb enough to dream so big
Here I'll be driving, you look the other way
And I just can't wait to be there
Yeah I wanna show anybody who wants to see it
Every moment that will get you by
I don't think straight with nothing to prove
Keep my love going lifting me higher and higher
Very clever people know we all need a chance
Enter sideways, reaching all around
So put your arms around me 
The more I can feel my antenna just sensing you up
Can you wait
Dancing downtown
I'm like workin with a bird, I got long product
To carve my own stone
I'm in love
There's someone else in line
The sweetness flies to her
And lick your lips
See, I'm gonna draw up my lipstick wider than my mouth
I thought I'd known love before
The more you are with me, the more that I'm alone
Now you're really givin' everything
Can really break it down Together
Of staying out sleeping in and getting drunk with my friends
I've a smile on my face
All our senses come alive, so happy I could die
My love is always on the grind
so let's get out of here 
Come on, come on, move a little closer
And your mind don't work the way you want it to
This place that I now call my home today
And it be Love love love all over her face
Is the old magic still there
Remember the foggy window
I think you'll understand
I'll make sure you get home safely
Do you believe in magic in a young girl's heart
In another place, other space and time
Somebody wants to hear you say Oh they want you to say
Não há paz  There's no peace
It's such a perfect day
Why should I follow that beat being that I'm
Everybody was for fighting
'Cause now you got me missing you
Oh she should've had more time
Got something if you only, only, only stay
Tries to tell you life has just begun Just begun
Who gives a damn about the family you come from
Of your rentcontrol apartment
I don't know why I go walking at night
For my head for my heart for it's true
In the misty morning fog
And seats are getting fewer, space is losing place
Neither one was able to hold it in, hold it in
Saying I'm one, no no these pictures of us,
Surprise and make it right
She didn't have money, she didn't have cash
And this is my brain
Can't take away those times we stayed up and we talked all night
Take it slow, oh yeah you never know
You better turn to god
Won't worry my life away
Because I I am open
You know I hate to fly
Making her feel like there's gonna be a war, oh
I guess we got off to a bad start
Hanging up there in the sky as though a balloon
Because the remedy is the experience, this is a dangerous liaison 
Started crying and I couldn't stop myself
Are you gonna waste your time
To end
It's Friday night and I ain't got nobody
It's better if you say you hate it, that's the truth exactly
I tried not to let you down
If it's still alive be gone to sleep
So overjoyed at the love that's so alive
Just 'cause she dances go go
From the time I fall asleep till the morning comes I dream about you baby
Run up at you hot footed, catch me if you can
When will the weather ever let us go
Come on, baby, let's get away ooh Baby, c'mon now
Skinny kid, no, friends with bout everyone
When we're sleeping in daily
Is that a punishment
'Cause I'm having a good time
Oh we are reaching 
Can I call you just to hear you would you care
Well, maybe I'm in love Love
The simple life honey is good
I'm beside myself for the touch of your lips
Now, honey pie
There's a good wind to blow me home
You say, you say to everybody that you hate me
And all that glitters is gold
Shelltops is on
Desperate times, get desperate mesure
All all I need,
But he just wants so skin Up
Forget about your sin
Off the mountainside
You're stuck in a world of makebelieve and I can see it
And there's water in wine
You got a dangerous obsession
From the comet's cradle
Wish I knew how you do it to me, 
Sell me on a silver sun 
Huh, come on
Not everyone
She had the grace of an eel, sleek and stark
She's got a heart that will never melt
But till then this is all I can say
Even after all these years
Get on the bus, it's time to go
We all got our stories but please tell me
But with your little, middle, index and ring fingers
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Here's hoping all the days ahead 
Let's go away for a while, you and I
And you accept me like nobody
My bright and brilliant spy
Yeah, yeah, yeah
And sneak off to this island
And we played in the sun as the curtain was tumbling
I'm around when your hands aren't steady
But that's okay, that's okay
So I live my life like every day is the last, last, last
Chance would have it that way
If you live the life you love
I just seem so lonely 
Though the days are counting backwards ohohoh, ohohoh
Friday, Friday several times throughout the song
Something inching past the edge of reserve
We're tripping all over ourselves and pulling each other down
Just clap your hands But I just look funny
Don't you know I'm in love with an uptown girl
I almost forgot to say something else
Slammed your fingers in the door
I don't care about tomorrow
The Rhumb Line is waiting there too
Maybe just a little letter
When it wasn't once Knew Nevers,
I'll be thinking 'bout them as I'm lying in bed
Bub boo bub bow ka rrah ka duk ka koong gung
And washed it away down the kitchen sink
How much is required to set things right
Your talk is all the talk, sister you've got it all
Stop treating me like I was just a child
And I pretend it's you by my side
For that searchlight come shining and finds me under a cloud
Let's get down, we've been waiting a long time
I say, "Woof"
Should I address all my letters to the well to be
She tells the same old story to everyone that she knows
But I still want your love
Today is, where your book begins
Till what I want and what I need
Oh, you're standing there, look tired as your singing
Look around, see what you do
But someone picked you from the bunch
I got, I got, I got, I got
Oh, somewhere over the rainbow way up high
I never start my homework till its already too late
Says as long as we're here everything is all right
'Cause you wouldn't understand the suburbs
You know me name you know me number three
Someone please say that it's okay now
I admit it's getting better Better
Oh every time I close my eyes
In your message say my name
And you're really gettin' all you gave
But I wanna talk to you
And so I went and let you blow my mind
No hope, no love, no glory
"Do you feel alone in that way"
You made a wish and I fell out of time
Let's stop the world I'll stop the world and melt with you
I wanna feel this way
You know your love your love keeps lifting me
There's no resting in my heart
I waved my hands and I shouted to you
Across a dead end street
I was high from playing shows
Headtripping on the sadness as it passes
You got it all wrong
And I will hope for the best
From the moment I arise 
Everybody gonna dance around
I can't wait, wanna see
It's cold and heaven surround you from every direction
Once clear together now one's passing
Then how come all the other unicorns are dead
Birds fly over the rainbow
Every limb is empty, robbed of pleasant memories
Stop the rain from falling
Is love x
I didn't rest, I didn't stop
And the stars are shining brighter
And if you just look around man
For all my pals who live in the oceans and the seas
Love, when I get that dust, hit 'em up, recock then I get back up
Wash the blues away
Your heart is broken
Then you could lend a helping hand
Though nothing will keep us together
Oh c'mon, what's a boy to do
I'm still here
That night I felt it again
We got to love
If only you would take a vacation from this thing you have created
But I would walk five hundred miles
To do some lovin' and hold you tight
We could dance till our feet turn red
If you gotta run, run from hope
Come on, come on, turn the radio on
I'm a legionnaire, camel in disrepair
Love don't come so easily
Step into the night
Leave the novelist in his daydream tune
And fish them from the sky, my darling, she and I
I was a boy at an open door
I can see clearly now, the rain has gone
Be of something his own make
Turn around, go back and lose her pound for pound
Everybody gonna to say you, K
It is an empty fear inside you
And your love next to mine
Pretending the echoes belong to someone
My air hostess
It comes back to you your gonna get what you deserve
Is there a hand to take hold of the scene"
You, you are the thing
The next day came but not a beam of light
If you wanna be comn' and makn' sweet love to me
But it's so hard when you're shallow as a shower
I think I'm falling in love with you
Run from your cover, run to the other side of your head and I'll stand right by you
You have a tendency to rush back into your past
And it feels so good, so good I'm on top of the world
Hot love on a platter
Two steps to the finish line 
Hunting you down Bringing you round
There's got to be something else
Try my fruit and taste my seed
Rock is dead, they say
Then I'm the worm, I know the part is such a bummer
Well it's about the patience and getting revenge
Ikea selling furniture for college kids and divorced men
And our plastic swords stab our olive hearts
Like a tiny bobbing head
And every one is addressed to me
Just because we use cheats doesn't mean we're not smart
I'd feel for certain I was bedroom dancing
It's gonna hit me with a big wave
Final word has been said
Echoes who don't answer back
Tomorrow I'll pay the dues for dropping my load
And I feel her gaze on me during sleeping hours and when I shower
Total strangers feel my eyes,
It kind of makes me very happy
We've been passing you around
No need to be alarmed, 
I plan to feed it with a heart
You've got the attic window looking out on the cathedral 
That ghost just stop
With a song of pure romance
Við spilum endalaust
It fuels the lies, it feeds the curse
In my arms, in my head, in my eyes, in my heart
I can't stop the tape machine
Bombs away
You took care of your skin
As dirt becomes the butterflies
Or just a letter
Und, pfeifst du selbst, die Flucht ergreifen
Lose your heart, I lose my mind
I'm not trying to write a love song just a sad, pathetic moan
Then Billy Brown fell in love with another man
History
Rocking in the dance hall moving with you
We shall walk again
The numbers over the dam,
Soul black vinyl to stop your tears
Komm mit  Spartanern aus dem Leichenlager
Put your arms around me baby 
But just a minute too late
There must be many ways to ask her to my room
Do ya feel it's in your bones
The wind circles among the trees
be nothing
Homeless, homeless
Are only taking space up in our heads
I got someone waiting for me
You're so scene, listening,
Don't let this moment slip away
'Cause summer girls come and summer girls go
I know there's a light inside
It's always more than a slight reminder 
I'm not a threat to nobody
It's a work of art our giant golden arch
There's no last week now
Somebody wants to hear you say
My shrink is telling me I got crazy dreams
My parents say think about your future and my teachers say the same
Know that I been waiting for so long
But it's got on for so long, for so long
Especially when some of you so called "poor kids" have got the money for a digital camcorder
Of better nights and better days
What are we waiting for What are we waiting for
More than anything 
Du genießt den Gang über brennende Kohlen
Look at, look at, look at what we're doing
I'm the scarecrow in disguise
Found eighteen reasons I can't pick up on the phone 
History begins with you and I
Don't stop me
Well the first time that I went out on my own
Love for the single parent's that's workin' through the struggle
Some days I feel like singing
Now your ears are ringing
And we held our head up high
I'm Jesse Jackson on the balcony when King got killed
Catch my disease
We gonna party like, like it's 
One two one, two, three, four
My hopes and dreams and memories
And I'm feelin' like Mike at his baddest
I can't listen to all your reasons
Are you ready to hit it running
Sing rainwater, sea water
Oh, there'll be love love love wherever you go
It's funny being funny,
My feet they're paying tribute to
We're believing everything that we have heard
There's every good reason
Can you wait for the sidewalk
Like swimmers do, I'll call on you
Try hard to commit to a girl 
Bonsoir Jacqueline, bonsoir à toutes et à tous Pour toutes les zones de la mer du Nord et de la Manche
Without you around I couldn't be
Only happened in your mind
Don't act a fool now, now"
We're flying
Their jewlry is thrown into the air
Ain't nothing new, now, now
Showed no fear, she'd seen the thing
Come on, sister have a drink
We were darting from the place where we just couldn't fit,
Tazer mic fiend 
She's got a heart that will never never melt
I can't coerce you into this one
Sweetheart, bitterheart now I can't tell you apart
Until the end of timeI, I, we can make it last
Woooohwoooohwoooohooh
For the brightest
It's summer time fun, relax and stay young
But I know one thing
The pain it won't end, even if she falls in love
In your fire below
He's got a brand new car
Song and melodies change and change
We just need some time apart
And hold on to love
But I opened my eyes and walked out the door
What hurts but feels so fine
I don't need a new love or a new life
You make the whole world wanna dance,
Lights dimmed but she shone like mythology
Eat our chips, come on, we've got loads
Whenever you're gone I get lonely
Know little girl that Denver Max will always be the only one
Nothing's gonna drag me down
Cause the sights that I'm seeing are priceless
If they knew just how lazy you'd been
Neon black future charging like a bull with a funeral bouqet ready to explode
And I have sins Lord, but not today
Bring, bring, bring your flowered hat
Makes me wanna turn around and face me
Yeah holy as our father
Little deuce coupe, you don't know what I got
Well, I don't want a thing to do with you kind
Models and magazines a striking runway entrance
If we're gonna show you how
He kept floating past my eyes
Closer, way up high
Life was good now death's all wrong
Talking to the songbird yesterday
A walk on hayes
And have the pleasure of saying what you mean
Money got no hold on me
Don't stop me Heyhi
You must make your own shoes
But I think this time we spoiled it all
On a moonbeam
King of the South, every hood's head honcho
If you could find a reason, a reason to stay
It's the taste of the chase, I do confess
Sheepdog standing in the rain
While I'm just contemplating sounds
Remember the time we talked about everlastings
They say it's your birthday
And if you like them, yeah
But I've been singing all night
So, come on over
When I wake up in the mornin' love
In every single place that has ever, ever been
You are go to continue descent
I gotta lotta old friends that are gettin' back in touch
And I'm singing "oh oh" on a Friday night, and I hope everything's gonna be alright
Just a place to call your own
Don't believe a word he says
On a tear, far from home by a thread, Anna Lee
Be the fool, I don't know where the sunbeams end and the starlights begin, it's all a mystery
What did he spend it all on
Rambling rose Mushaboom, mushaboom
See I was born thinking under the sky 
And there's nothing to prove
From a book of old psalms
As the years they pass us by 
We don't need no secret code
Now I'm too good at letting go
I used to be your girl, girl
I wonder if you ever get to say what's on your mind
And even when truth doesn't help with the sting
The only girl to take it seriously
Leave the horses hair on the slanted bow
Nigga prolly thought, man, I had
Like I did for you
I lose track of time
Now you know our names and you've been to the show
Got a feeling this is something strong
'Cause this is all in my head
This isn't happening, stop this now
In later hours when the packed
If everybody had an ocean
Said look at the clouds
'Cause your heart has a lack of color
With a pretty girl that I met at the pharmacy
We won't let the sun go down
So we tell some lies 
Ooh, and every time I think of you
And two shapes in the dark across the way
Stepping to the beat
Oh, I'll be there, yeah,
Beat of the song song
About you, girl
Till we run on empty
It's hard to let the miles pass me by
Get free from the middleman
A tragic event I must admit but let's not be overblown
Skies burned, eyes turned
I don't care what the people may say 
And now I'm back in the city, I'm counting frick frick frick
Composing their songs of love 
And I'll send all my loving to you
Same old twelvebar blues
But her destiny got us so intertwined 
You appeared right in front of me
Here in this diary I write you visions of my summer
You'll never forget it
My heart is bound to beat right out my untrimmed chest
Don't gotta tell me where this is going
Oh, the country road is a boulevard
I hang on to what I got
If it's not now then tell me when would be the time that you would stand up and be a man
They say she's left a letter up the stairs for everyone
And say
And this time I know it's real
Chase another heart that was up in doubt
Even if things get heavy, we'll all float on alright
Write me a storm, just tape the letter to the door
The sister is naughty
A girl named Cathy wants a little of my time
Perfect in so many ways
You got a gnome in the backyard
But the snake it bit me
Leave all your love and your longing behind
Sooner or later, I swear we'll make it there
His greasy fingers strung together and stretching cross the sky
All things grow, all things grow
Or do you give yourself things to do
Of this I'm fairly clear
Just 'cause you think it,
This ground of mine keeps shaking
But I was far away
Playing a victim of the time
And this'll turn into something else, something else
I'd take all your hope and yearning 
Some people
I'm going to die with a twinkle in my eye
'Cause everybody knows he pumps you for your money
She's pulling at me saying "Dad I need you
With a five year reunion hanging over my head
Oh, oh, yeah, oh
Frenemies, who, when you're down, ain't your friend
Not a thing can stop us now
Our bodies became one and then we so really turned on
Waiting for the roads to be late
A text message she sent to me and her girlfriend, inviting us round for tea
As our lights look down the road
You had to find it I made a lot of mistakes
Someone who needs me Hey, somebody that needs me
Stop by
I'm hypnotized by this world we live in
Swallowed into space
Tied around her little finger
It's a hideous trait on her mother's side
I've gotta find my way to your heart
He looks for clues and finds
But in the first moment of her waking up
But into every life a little rain must fall
And let your love grow
I do love my Ma and Pa
And when you need to change the light bulb
I'm back, back in the New York Groove
It's our favorite part of the story 
Past the Thames River, glistening like gold
I'm going away
everything we've become, you're all that I need
Can't get no sleep tonight, feels so good tonight
And singing his songs
I heard that Cali never rains and New York's all awake
Finesse an innocent, from her partying
They wanna wake up with you everyday They wanna wake up with you
The sun is rising up on the east side, a chance for everyone
She made her Father worry till he was sick
Oh, and if there's any love in me
Just lookin' at the pies
'Cause I know that you feel alone
I put him right on the X mark
When I can't move 
Colours are one to hold in my head
You can be my head
Just give me moments
In five years time, you might just prove me wrong
Work, work, work, Senora
But somebody's sending me stationary filled with chimpanzees
When you were young, you never thought you'd die
My high heels are clicking towards your door
The cats are out to play, to play
But you'll find those lingering voices
Baby, we're aging with time
We will be living for the love we have
Now you tell her that you love her and she cuts you slack
We've never danced like this before
They give us the greens of summers
Dragging names through the mud, instead of biting his tongue
If you ain't got the doremi, boys
Bring your dancing shoes and something to tie your hair Hair
Would make my dream come true, yeah, yeah, yeah for once in my life
And if I die today
This is love so we'll survive
Tootootoodooroo
Freight train rattled through my head 
In an octopus's garden near a cave
And they told me I don't need to worry
This is not my life or maybe it is
So many trips in it
You are my jetstream lover
They seem to like my face
All right, kick it
And I won't get by if you take that light away
If I had to choose a moment in time
Please, point me in the right direction
If you're a friend of any sort
I'm the worst in the world
As they try to teach me how to dance
And I mean it when I tell you that I need you
It's the mines, in Africa 
And I woke up beside the ocean
So I went back to where I belong
Know you'll get me through
And if you wait a little my pretty friend
TIP Pimp quad Clique, you understand that Grand Hustle, pimp
Squinched up your face and did a dance
Why'd you have to get so hysterical
All these dreams inside of me
Don't mistake for a party of jokes
Jane, I've seen the pain you've dealt
Can I bring my friend to tea
And I am breathless without you
If we just don't get it our own way 
You touch my inner smile
Whoa, brainstorm brainstorm
Will you get over it this time
Let's go today, in a heartbeat
You're every minute of my every day
I watch her as she runs
When you look at it
Simon No more riding on my love
I don't want to be your rock in hard times
And got in my Renault
Lie, I know there's a reason for superstar
Forever could even start today 
Instead as a way of getting us to move
And true love never has to hide
So dance, yeah let's dance, come on and dance
I'm enchanted by your smile
Let's take a chance and try love baby
Never did, never did I ever love anyone other than you
It's the greatest thing from the man above
Put on your dancing shoes
It's one thing that I plan to learn to do
I'm moved, man, I'm wigged
Since I've heard your voice
If you fall down
I think I see you coming to town, just dragging you down
Says he don't care anymore
Now to the other side
I sat down right there and I stretched my bones
I'm regretting letting you fly
See how I would do, if I could do I'd do most anything spontaneously
I've been watching stars coming out of the sky
Sun is out and it feels like it's always gonna stay
You say you keep them close by
Phase One, in which Doris gets her oats
Hit the finish line
Hell is my heaven
And you're someone who knows someone
Those days when you were happy
The happy times together we've been spending
I'm too stoned to write this song
And I give a finger to my step father for beating me
I fall out of love with you
Your hands in the pocket
You've got pollen on your nose
The stars in the sky, illuminate below
And we will run, we will, we will crawl, we will
'Cause you smile with your eyes
Your feelings you shouldn't
Shake my arms, shake my head
Strange powers
For once in my life
Life is a trip and the roadmap leads you
To get it right
He's had many of those
I can't stop, can't stop can't stop the beat
Is all I need, 
Fighting tears just to carry on
Ablaze with wondrous things
And do what you've got to do
The bluebirds fly so high
And it's hard to breathe when you're not near
I said goodbye to someone that I love
She gonna steal my money
Run a lot, do a lot, never be lazy boy
Daydreaming, daydreaming all the time
Oh happy happy day
I will learn to love
Du kan sova på min arm tills det blir ljust
I can swear I feel the beating of a cold cold heart
Forgive and then forgone and on and on and on and on
Easy going ways,
Red pullover
Spoken Oh, let's hear it  Go on, Denis, let's hear it for Denis O'Bell
Hey man, now you're really living
Because people are very very special
Twisting burning, my thoughts turning, back to you again
Making the storm clouds cry
I spent the summer wasting
But the truth is I only have myself to blame
Some hear a call
Come on, break it up
If I'm your boy, let's take a shortcut we remember
About the house packed with people and their loneliness
I wear your golden heart in mine
With whom you're spending your today
Though we didn't make a sound
I went to war last night
All I'd want is you to be my sweet honey bee
And people speak I hear them saying
And your toes creepin' around
Said you know the world is big and got a loose heart
I saw you walking on the sidewalk
Yeah They're calling out our marriage
Turn around
Ache in my leg from a broken seat
O'Malley, fun
I wanna go there and never come back home
Come right back
While shooting in the dark
Tonight I'm gonna have myself a real good time,
Little white clouds like gambolling lambs
Talk about your childhood wishes
Where are you I need someone to be my lover
Don't it feel like sunshine after all Don't it feel like sunshine after all
It's okay, as long as I got you, baby 
They can change the locks, don't let them change your mind
I guess I ain't the great romantic
The dog days are over, oh
Ready or not, I think I'll give this a shot
There's no time for fighting
If you don't have a song
Cheers to the miles it took to get here
Locking eyes, holding hands
I give thanks for this hollow chest of mine
That�s my life, nothing is sacred
Now you're a storyteller you might think you are without responsibility
I got no deeds to do, no promises to keep
For rainquenched golden days
Long bird, short road
And all the people that come and go
Your love
Didn't I tell you everything is possible in this déjà vu
And, in just  year, the straight world can pay to see 
Well there's none so blind as them that don't agree 
Feel into the city
There ain't nothin' that I need
I'll try, I'll try to build it all around you
Then the sweetness in the air
We can break blue laws with our skin and bones
Take a chance with the woman that lets you
And unhappiness is treason
Well, creeping's just my way
If it's not what you thought it was, legs are for discovering
No One's Perfect, I've Got Baggage
Your Slayer Tshirt, fit the scene just right
And I've sung all I have to sing
Tone zodiac in tune, with the fossil of our themepark
They make me feel that I'm only all I see sometimes
With the eagle eye
Please don't lose hold of me, out there
And when they tell you they love ya
Praying like a fool just shy of a gun
Is dying to take you away
Just looking for a place to stay
Love the way that you move
I'll stay if you're gonna keep me in line
Be there if I fall but
Heartbeat, and kisses so sweet,
One settles a score with a trip to the floor look what we've found
A pair of Dutch chimps
Creepy clowns from onehorse towns 
Sometimes I get my head in a dilly
All my life, I've been waiting
With a freaky kinda music, you can't understand
Who give into romance like hands give into gloves
But you don't need to waste your time
Give me a shot at the night 
You talk about me and talk about you
This man, makin' money,
Gave me back my feelings
But now I know I want to win the war
When the half light makes for a clearer view 
Tonight, I'm seein' stars
Clever little guys
Seeing you combing your hair
Go ahead with your dreamin'
I'm so happy that I fell in love
And what's new, pussycat, is that you were once a lioness; 
And carry you off eastward,
You do love me I decree it
But there's one thing I know
But later you'll pretend you did and you'll mean it
Cold to the touch, right
Who cares that it is shining
For Jade is the girl of the hour
Cold wind whipping through the windows
Some folks are on blankets, slowly daydreaming and reaching for their food
Girl you give me reason to come question your love
And I'm looking like a fool again, whoa oh
Won't you just step into the car little girl;
Let us stop
And I'd let you crush me
Yeah baby come on
Freaky dicky star speckles and pink butterflies
The old bastard had a paradigm arrest
     ooooh
No matter where you are
He said I gotta get up, life is more than suicide
If we fall dow
Summer girls come and summer girls go
No room for make up
They play bingo and let their engines run
And life is very fine
But I wonder what goes on behind doors
Or else my heart is going to pop
Enough to wrap tight in ricepaper string"
Why is my only amusement
Some kind of solitude is measured out in you
She danced close to me like I hoped she would
Blue canary in the outlet by the light switch While you're at it
Why would anyone need a map or a compass
You've got that old map out now and you found the farthest town
Everyone's watching
Could be blue
I'm outta rhymes I've gotta say
Was it all in my head
You are looking at the working week through the eyes of a gigolo
Step back and here comes the night time
My record would be number one
Threaten with the rep of their big boy brother
Let the music play
Tired dogs rest their paws
I wanna hold you but you're out of reach
C'mon people we're making it now if only you could be with us, oh
Run like you really wanna be at the top
I'm wasting my time
Do you remember
I knew right away she was not like other girls, other girls
When I look up in the darkest night
And it's the moment you remember you're alive
Ariella, , I don't want to get up yet
And which I could never outrun
You lead a fairy tale existence
There's this one word, it's called comfort
And I really love the way you wear
But the tears from the heart of my love won't change
Dom akta vi backar dom vi ger dom karlek
For all the niggas who keep askin, when CNN gonna do a joint with Premier
Tears land on a hand on a chest
I look down below serenade the world
But a whole lot smarter
In the middle of a cloud
C'est ci, baby
They are getting closer now
Now I don't wanna argue, no I don't wanna fight
One fine day we'll run away
Burning through the night
It's a beautiful day 
Because you're gorgeous
And true, you might run away with it
Notice how her hair curls
Three more weeks, and we could say
'Cause if the rain starts falling
On the street
I didn't know I was lonely till I saw your face
I got so saddened
You can give me a call whenever you like to
But you're nothing like you seem
He looked just like all the cool kids
Marry the man and then spend a long, sweet night
Can you feel a silk embrace
You don't believe anyone, but most of all, don't believe me
He's been fighting all his life
Trynna get our head rights, get this money right
Well, I didn't mean to do it
Throwing beams of bright light
David won't you stop writing songs 
We sewed the day above LA
Do your thing, make
It all comes back to common sense, I guess that's what you're looking for
And it just kills me how they get away with murder
That I'm a little bit wrong
The curtain falls before you know it
Don't worry talk they will
And feel the shine feel the shine
Worried 'bout no rainy weather
Come on over, borrow my clover
Seven weeks of staying up all night
And what you done with your time
The candles light dances across the table
We can do this all night
I can't see me loving nobody but you
The finer things I feel in me
Who loves the rain
And I'm lovin' every step I take
Man I know you wanna let yourself go
They'll suppress you of your spirit and rinse you dry of smiles
Oh, I love you Ken
A kicking in the nightshifts
Tell me I look stunning and cadaverous
Start up the car with the sun
You know I gonna be right there behind you
Now listen to the beat
We are bound and marching to an ever static distance
Come on, come on, the world will follow after
We can beat them just for one day
The electric bills are staggering
Machiavelli owns a machine gun now,
Bitter after all these years
Still it's just that I don't feel like it much these days
I'm having a daydream, we're getting somewhere
First thing they teach us, not to give a fuck How I got over
Your eyes, your lips, your hair,
I fall on the floor and I laughing
Well I've been doin' my homework all week long
But I can tell you for the money
Everyone trips, everyone falls
Looked at the pad and pen, fell, and jotted what I feel
Because it had become vile to its creator
Everything I've learned
We seek out the taciturn
Ain't gonna ride that yellow bus 
God saw fit to put this kiss inside
The manager arrived with two guards, that's an insult
A kind of love that will break my heart
Baby your electric love
Baby, I've been waiting on you
Turn everything red and the dream is complete
All I need is somewhere I feel the grass beneath my feet 
And all the music seeping through
The competition show their teeth
You've changed my life
Where they ride horses, no cars
If it takes years to be any more than a jellyfish
Trying to feel the high
We are diamonds taking shape
She's got super human lips, for super suction
Our love does run, it's your reflection
We only get one chance at this
He likes to keep his fire engine clean
Walking in circles around the core
deep in a mine, ohno
We'd get so drunk that we can hardly see
Pulls my train
When your lights have gone
You cut your eyes so you could finally see
You're starting to discover it's a great big lie
Taught me how to stand, dad
Uhhuh, goddamn right, it's a beautiful day 
It is her hour so let it be hers
Words they're all gone
You know, you come from nothing, you're going back to nothing
Soldiers and the stevedores
It makes my baby seem so far
Saw the bright colors, bright future
I turned away from all the others
Can you tell me who will still care 
Don't stop don't stop don't stop the beat
Cause' you don't understand
I was on my back staring at stars 
And I'm back here quick as lightning 
We always have the rhythm here,
And they'll be calling you baby
What made me behave that way
The last time we talked, Mr Smith, you reduced me to tears I promise you it won't happen again
Come back and stay
Around the clock  Yes you are around the clock
I've come to watch your flowers growin'
Good time to roll on
Its only 'cause the sun shines once again
I've tried to indicate that she could be someone for me
Oh yeah yeah, oh yeah yeah, oh yeah
And all the pretty people party while the petty people fight
Tryin' to trip me up, tryin' to wear me down
At least start pacing
My little blue baby sung
'Cause uptown funk gon' give it to you
Baby I just want you back and I want you to stay
Run fast for your mother, run fast for your father
con ese fuego ardiente,
Ooh there was the night we
Born and raised on the wrong side of town
Heavy like a loaded gun
You gotta do it different J
Is in your room
You might have to close your eyes
Bitch, say my name you know who I am
Build yourself around me
Bad mind, let me put on good habits
I took the road that brought me to your home town
Well what if I was one of them
Dear your name here
You look a little better, each day to me
To keep you by my side
He just woke and dreamt and ate and died
So I just did me some talking to the sun
'Cause you gimme just one little peck
This time he will break down
There's nothing to give no more
And the good one's were all wrong  
Back to the place, hey
I'm an ocean
Now painting rainbows on my ugly face
I wasn't looking hard enough
I can't get enough of you, baby 
Her skin is cinnamon
Oh I've tried boy
Is where you spend your daylight
We've got a reason to keep holding on, tomorrow has become today
On our trip to England I noticed something obscene
We live in a free world
Well, I'm on my way
Gulf stream through the open door
Sleep tight, baby
It's a shot in the dark but I'll make it 
Sample  So hard to say goodbye
Huddled up with fear and hate because we know our fate and it's a lot to put us through
It's gonna take atime
But I was so embarressed that I missed your party
And I'm looking through the glass
There are some squirrels jumping in the trees
Uh, call the police and the fireman
Kind of hope your Pops don't hear me right
And there is no end
My mouth it's got a great big smile
And I cried myself to sleep last night
What if you choose to use turn me round,
Just jacks, jokers, and a queen of hearts
Through the door, someone says,
'Cause every time before it's been like maybe yes and maybe no
Why don't we, sleep all, sleep all day, we sleep all day, we sleep all day over and over and over and over again
That type of thinking can't get you nowhere Somebody, somewhere
The love that's shining all around you 
Oh yeah, that's where the money is
And we still hear the echoes of abandon
You no get my life 'cause I don't have a side, and I
Shaking off a heavy one
And as they pull me from the wreckage,
Honey, I ain't never had nobody like you
I know that you have the right words ohohoh, ohohoh
All the way home
K  I  A I'm in love
You are my girl and you don't even know it
You'll never see my eyes
Helping with your alarms,
Headed north on the Arabian sea
When there's a basketball game in the park
When your shutters open all the way
Far away, far away, far away
I've been heading home
Me, I write the book that's sifting in the sand,
Can't read my mind
I just wanna be happy, yeah
Oh yeah
Got holes in my new jeans for you
You've never been so nuts about a guy
Oh, when I look to the shape of my heart
And I never felt as good as how I do right now
Late nights, all entwined
Hot topic
Everything ends
Here comes the mapinguari singing awww
There's a restlessness in me
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah
No matter what you say
And this deep secret that hasn't come out yet
He said to never look down
How could you forget what we had,
Evil came down on earth
I thought, "I'll just step aside and that the time would prove you wrong"
We always have to wait
At our still lives posed
I've got a feeling you could use a little smile
And it don't hurt like anything I've ever felt before
Don't end up in the gutter
There's something there and it�s showing
My love, my love, my love, my love is
Love goes ahead
Girl you blow my mind, you do
To put my head in a mess
I dreamt you found me out in a field
In sickness and in health baby always be yourself
Come downdowndown, my love is calling
I peeked to see if you were way back when
We used to rock some tunes with a guy named lloyd
Holiday, far away
Hearing them coming back
Break your heart
And the only thing constant was the constant reminder she'd never change
As I wake in bed
Derramar no céu, se purificar
Now we're finally standing up to the sky
Uptown funk you up say what
Take a walk outside in the heavy weather
I fell or you and nobody else
You love hip hop and rock 'n' roll
We almost had a baby
Want to share it with you
Now everybody wants some presto magic, magic, magic
You I will Will rise Will rise Above above The room
I'm willing to go on, but not alone, not now I believe in me
Oh, Monday rowing
Is somebody to you
And if you need to tell me something once
I could stand it if I just keep breathin' oh
One ocean to another, waves come crashing down
Now it's your turn
Gonna cry myself to sleep at night
And all the pretty people party while the petty people pout
I have lost my mouth organ
Someday we'll meet beyond the land that you call miles away
It's been a perfect day
He doesn't have a thing to say
'Cause I spy something red
The night's young and we raise our glass
It's pure in a sense 
We are okay, we are alright
I'd rather waste our time together
And the world will smile with you
Heyla, heybahelloah whoohoo
And you gave up so many just to make a livin'
You know we all shine on
And that's at least a start to get inside your heart
I got to start to thinking, and seeing things so clear
Oh I'm moved and I'm wigged
Oh yeah, dirtbag
And my parents
In the morning call from a roadside telephone
There is no thing that makes wanna settle down
So all your fashion sense aware, the sweaters unfold themselves
And I am a beating rhythm
I've been talking to myself
Bitter words under my breath
They are smoke
Do a turn or return the twentyfive
Just forget it, it's the same old runaround,
Feel trapped in your own skin
And two chicks in the parking lot
She holds you captivated in her palm
Shake shake shimmy shimmy
If I could tell the truth
She is love
I talk to you, understand
People throw rocks at things that shine
Your thoughts I can't ignore
Happy Bring me down, the love is too high
And everyday, it's changed since then
But if you're not ready for love
I woke up filled with fear
And the dreams that you dare to dream
But even fools know here they're far and few between
Through the mud and the rain,
Your coffee sure is getting colder
I've got to take this opportunity before I miss it
Somewhere searching for your inner peace
And their lives seem complete
We took our first pill when the music was shit
They wanna wake up with you everyday
Babe, I couldn't even find the door
Scheiße man, ich hab noch keine, sammel weiter Pfandflaschen
He drove his chair in the cavalcade
Avoid eye contact at all costs
For the turn
It sang of being nobody's baby
I would die for you
He showed me the low, showed me the down
If I could hold ya,
No matter where we go
And reaching for the stars to hold on a little bit closer to
Well I saw fireworks from the freeway 
Where I almost made out with the homecoming queen
She'll understand what kind of guy I've been I've been
'Cause boy I feel that men are meant to be
Kill tonight
That someday it would lead me back to you 
She's looking excellent, totally excellent
Your fly was drownin in some bitter tea
Oh, will there be dancing in the hall tonight
Here comes my baby, here she comes now
I can see her eyes looking from the page of a magazine
But I say go, go, go
Your last stroll down the block was in the trunk of a car
Early PM can't remember what time
This life is a beautiful one,
Or should we wait and see 
Of all the numbers you end up calling mine
I feel little things falling in today such a big day
I'm a child
You pin both the wings on us
But when she turns her back on the boy 
You'd still enjoy it with your foot on Masada
Well, it's all right, everything'll work out fine
I gotta figure out what I'm finna wear
It's this one thing that caught me slippin'
We're gonna be alright Hey
Can't get over your love,
A good, good life
My hand still shiver from the very thought of it
She's given you everything she has
Will you be pulled from the ocean
Leaving him alone in the broad daylight
The wind is a gentle breeze
And we've all got something to say
Don't need money when it's sunny,
We'll write a song
The story started and it ended so quick
And you've been the talk of my town
Now, it's all covered with flowers
I like the way you dress
They give us those nice bright colors
Sometimes your path is marked in the sky
And showed me how to be a bigger man, dad
The dance of the cosmos shows, as above, so below
I told you I can't listen, baby, about the th time you were a lady, 
To let you trouble me
Brown eyes and lungs are filled up with smoke
The countless ways you thought to die no hesitation
They'll search the buildings, collect gold fillings, wallets, and rings Oh yeah
You can't respect me 'cause I've done so much for you"
She'd deserted on the previous morning
If he looks within he finds beauty and power
That's when you gave me a call
You get right down to the bottom of the barrel and float back on top
And you're feeling so proud
Takes it back to Molly waiting at the door
With the one that they adore
Would you be my love, my love would you be mine
Somethin' without warnin' love
Me to the night  say goodbye, time is up, fight the time
You can't hold it in your hand
All trying to understand
Be gone your olden ways, be gone
I'd pop myself in your body
O take a little time, take a little time
Hanging out always till this starts
There is no way to return
Hold my hand
She sees these visions, she feels emotion
Repeating history
And we'll keep working on the problem
And the fairy lights
Give up acting unaware
Pacific Palisades Inside, outside, USA
Not a matter of choice, just a matter of time
Oh yeah yeah, oh yeah yeah, oh yeah yeah
While the sun hangs high up above
Let the painted horse on the carousel remain
You're no sweetheart baby
Well I'm on the couch when you come back home
You come in
Oh, it could start again
Yeah that's where mine go
It's happening all the time
You're only brave till you're scared
If you don't love me to
I'm as nervous as you 'bout making it right
A little place like Kokomo
JFK's head is a puzzle and your woman needs a muzzle
No, it will never stop
Come on, come on, turn a little faster
Ranches and ranch hands are bowing too
So baby don't hold back, go with the flow
And when you make it back to Nashville
No staring out windows now 
When I needed sunshine I got rain
Attack those around 'cause you're
Had hope in its ring
Such a cruel world
That hides with your clothes
Ham me up or send me down
My moneys gonna find my hand one day and
So black and blue, ooh
And take it all, take it all back
Every time I touch that track it turns into gold
I'm never short of new inspiration 
But can't stand to see me walk out the door Ah
How I lost my boy
Sitting alone, with the TV on
I hope we're floating
I could if you can try to fix what I've undone
Oh, what's the use of making a bed
I'd go the whole wide world just to find her
Sing it out loud and let yourself free x
Yeah, girl, I gotta tell you, I'm feelin' much better
I found his business card in the mud
Depends on how far out you go
A heart so big it hurts like hell
Wishing all the things could still be the same 
We're on our way, way, way 
I can tell that you have got the same for me
Oh, yeah, I'm on sunshine, baby 
All the big kids going to school
Summer's on the way
Now all my moves are flawed
Hey, come on, yeah
That you'll find somebody else like me
He likes to remember when
'Cause you're my everything
We're living the life
I remember us alone
I've got sense to hold it
It felt as if you'd returned
Always surprised to find more
Come inside and pour a drink, here it comes
Eating at Welcome Breaks daily
It's now wonderful to see beautiful views
There's one thing you should know
It's not an easy road
They don't think what to say
Uh, haven't really talked to him, but he looks pretty, uh, down
I think it would be funny
Hey, man
That I've yet to have kissed
You cannot run or ever hide it away
So get yourself into a ranchstyle home
I'm gonna call the police
Maybe I'm just lucky, 'cause it's hard to believe
Hold it up, hold it strong,
And you get so high on the highlife pills
She sits around like a vintage queen,
'Cause I'm just a teenage dirtbag, baby
Similes, metaphors, and we pop pills
Joining together and still faster x
Oh, the songs it spoke for me when I couldn't speak
All together now
We slept in parking lots
God, the way she moves moves me
High in the sky, the song that I'm singing
All I know is sometimes things can be hard
Just let your love flow like a mountain stream
When you kiss someone,
What's a matter
So I think I should get up and call you
Then you moved on Woah oh oh oh
Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
And I hope it, hope it stays that way
Cherrycherry boomboom
No longer needed to be seated on a sinking ship just waiting there to drown
Life is a flower Is a flower
Where'd you find all that time,
This is the best one yet
I'm coming clean, please don't let it go
I understand why you're looking for tears in my eyes
Oh taking your advice and I'm looking on the bright side
Who's got the brains
Walking waking on a crowded street
And the neighbourhood, bored, started buzzing with joy
Like lipstick traces on pillow cases
There's nothing for the kids to do
Yesterday you told me 'bout the blue blue sky
Girl, you've been my best friend
But until that day that we depart
And at the end of all your knees fall down to me
And I just can't wait till the day when you knock on my door
One more song for the radio station
'Cause music is the power, power, submit to the sound
Of lovin' and a cheatin' the snake gon' bite 
They start in my toes
Twist and shout my way out
For a safety dance, ohoho
Ain't gonna need any more advice
Where freedom makes the world go round
They all get run over in petrol stations but they rock
Saturday night and we in the spot
Boy now you are really, really bugging
I'll let you borrow my four leaf clover
The only one who's really judging you is yourself
Like the Longines Symphonette it doesn't rest
Somewhere back there I left my worries all behind
And feel it, feel it, feel it babe
And curves in all the right places
It is such a fine and natural sight
And wake up where the clouds are far
I suppose that's just the way the cookie crumbles
Moving on to better things
It's true that you are touched by something
I get pushed out of shape and it's hard to steer
One day you're out, you give up the fight
Until your breathing stops forever, forever
So I'll sleep out in the gutter
Ride wit' me, nigga, let me show you where we kick it at
And get nicked by the strobe light
Lets just bend the invitation
Let's see what we've got
Still fixed inside your fantasy
At least that's what people say, mmhhmm
She put me on meds, she won't get out of my head
You're drowned aways Drowned aways
And kiss you on the mouth
When it's Toddophonic time
Allt gleymist í smá smá stund og rætist það
Until you know how it feels to die
I never tried to hold you tight until you left me now and
She says he's a nice guy and I'd be impressed
Than just sit down at the piano and a write this tune
What's the matter with me
Why would you wanna break, would you wanna break a
A clean shave in the morning
Can we put this to bed then
But I think about you everyday
Left to right is the tempo
Life is short but your here to flower
But we are young
She needs a wild heart
And we fall hardest better worst than best
Could you first pull out a book and 
I don't wanna be the reason,
When the night falls
Now you're really giving everything
And my band 'bout that money
I'll do anything for you
That's our new princess of hiphop and r&b
Never wanna say I wish that I'd been there
All you need is love, love
I can't let go
It's my turn
You hold a candle in your heart,
But there's a few things more beautiful than Fall
I cradled the crow, always shooed off the dove
I am the only one
Making excuses for his dodgy holiday
You been gettin' what you want from me
And cold nights make staying alert so hard
I play my guitar like lightning
What's in your heart
I visit hell on a daily basis
I'd not be so scared of falling
If you ever need me
I can see all obstacles in my way
'Cause we're going going gone
Whistle as the girls walk by if the cops roll up so what
Meet me in the middle 
Diet Coke and a pizza, please
We never ever made it down to Nashville in the end,
Sad minion of mine
Never could be sweeter than with you
You keep me blushing all the time
It's a whole lot brighter
You are amazing
Andy would bicycle across town 
I realize this is my last chance
I want to crashland
When I look into your eyes 
Don't you know they ain't never going to but I feel okay
Dreaming of the Osaka sun
Boy you really got it goin' on
Walking on sunshine
Here comes the sun
I know you're losing sleep over me
I'm gonna reach the top
The Girlshapedlovedrug
Eh, yeah
You gave every song to me 
But it's something I'll never do
Take the sky
If it's not now then tell me when would be the time that you would stand up and be a man
Things say 
When they say grow up
She said, "Oh my sweet goodness wish you could be here every time
Oh please, don't ask me how I've been
We're still boys on the inside
She's everything I've been dreamin' of
And are you mine
Out where the waves wrestle with the dirty brine
There's something taking over my heart
I shall always want you until my love runs dry
Why am I scared of people in a room
Yeah, you wet through and me headfirst
Won't you give me some, baby
Hey, boy, I push it out
In the magazines they talk about weight loss
You'll never be a burden and my love for you will never die
Night drains just to wake in the end, it's always fake
Forget what I said, you're only good in bed or on your knees
From my girlfriend so far away
It always seems to be a flowing
Keep clappin our hands to the songs and
Everybody gonna dance around tonight
We saw the first signs of summer and springtime change,
You get to the next one
But I'm listening as it evolved in my head
Remember you have still got a friend
They walk in new shoes
Just follow the day
You remind me of a former love that I once knew
I think I see you coming to town,
But I know what I don't, don't want to rot in my room
The world moves faster than I knew, not fast enough
With a ticktock rhythm, a bump for the drop
What did you want to see
Let us shine for what it's worth
To my heart or to my mind
Here comes the zoo
Pay no mind to the clown
You don't respect me, no girl
Real sugar, that's what I want and what I need
Your going to scream along to every song we sing to you
It's Friday I'm in love
There's ice on the road
People are gonna ask, "Is it brilliant or plain"
Someone to be
And I wonder, wonder which one of us
Cleveland city grinding man stay afloat the kids hope
This is the last time that I'll hold your hand
Or you can break somebody's heart in two
Checking out the latest books about outer space
Chad, come here, come here, come here
How you gonna find out what she had in mind
All my friends are going out but I've been thinking
I need to
Took me by the hand, dad
Shorter nights and longer days
There were people from the city having lunch in the park
Tongues flapping I can't make out your tone,
Made you feel like it's not such a bad world
But as it is I'll dream of her tonight
What are you waiting
The week's not yet begun
The position of the northern star
Coming home again
If you're a storyteller you might think you're without responsibility
Higher, higher, high on love
On a subway train before the dawn
Subtle patterns in the sky
Therefore we are
All the colors fade
We sit sidebyside in every class
Out on the weekend when I'm just havin' some fun
We have lost our way 
Come on and show,
Ah You're tender and you're tired
We beat 'em up
I had a drink the other day
I'm standing in Brooklyn just waiting for something to happen
I'm loving life
And take off both your shoes"
And I shouldn't have wasted those days
So come on, Davey, sing me something that I know
And I thought I would let you know
Yeah, we're going on and on and on and on and on and on yeah, yeah
Grand view was hilarious
In the same city
Till you tell me that you'll be in my life
This is the kind of place I know
Call it reach it get some words and get some timin'
Oh, anyway, it's looking like a beautiful day
She's got a boyfriend
You walked out when I asked you to stay
You watched as the caravan took your sweetheart away
Dead weight to carry around
The only one for me is you
Bottles poppin' till we can't stand
But I was asleep
Into oblivion through sticks and stones
Feel the air moving, moving, submit to the sound
And the music's seeping through
I lie in my bed, totally still
The city looked wonderful that way
Look what you've done to me
From this dream where she was trying to show me
I'm not the boy that will fall to his knees 
Fling on an Adidas hoodie and just boogie woogie with me
The last word on your breath
I want a smile like a glistening shard
Feeling good, on top of the pops
Do you dream or do you sleep
Who knows you can't be replaced
Somebody stop me
It's a fact printed stain
Is that I'm feeling strong
When I'm in your arms it turns me on
It's only been a week
But never knew how much illusions hide a torture
I'm beginnin' to see a, er, point of light on the horizon
I've got you to propel me 
And I am a mating rhythm
You won't have to strain to look into my eyes
And now it's two o'clock on the dancefloor,
And do everything that I need you to do
It's been a long time comin' since I seen your face
Darling, what you gonna say now
Here comes the sun, and I say
Oooooooooh weee lalalala, lalalalalala
Eleven different reasons for fists in fights,
Sometimes I can be up like that, when I don't cross myself with you
I'm in, I can't get off, I'm so soft
Then you should share it round
But I meant every word I said
I want the people in the country to be open and kind
You might think it's all in your head but you're not certain anymore
No nothing can change us, no nothing can keep us from falling, from falling
Just wanna shout "What the fuck"
Empty homes, plastic combs
Please just let me go
And I'm not supposed to let it bother me
And this is my body 
Meet me downstairs Stairs
Well I'm afraid I'm not qualified to do any of these things for you
Ain't no one afraid
And there's nothing wrong with the look that's in her eyes
And I'm afraid I'm not gonna give you back any of those kilojoules
I'm falling all over myself
Where the boys go with boys and the girls with girls
When the angels hung around
Throw the phone out the window
Always take a big bite, it's such a gorgeous sight
This is the island of the honest man
Anything to keep you away
When you love without desire
What have you done
We'll always be this free
I've seen your scars and kissed your crime, oh
You don't like my point of view, you think that I'm insane
You were nowhere at home
Ooh, and every time I heard you breathe
And maybe be your baby tonight
And from what I've heard with skin you'll win
Meet me in the crowd, people, people
And with your bitter words you kick me in the gutter
And yeah it's sad that you think that we're all just scenesters
My dear, oh dear
They got their own share of plate and a seat 
I don't want to start without you
About a boy and a girl
Unifying fact however we act
No way to say and there's nothing I can do,
Well okay, it's settled
This is the head, this is the head 
You just do your part, form a line lets march under the golden arch
Dancing on a Friday night
Oh yeah a shooting star
I'm Looking For Baggage That Goes
Ordinary thoughts
But sister, it's the opposite of hallelujah
You know I would, and I could prove it That I'll do anything spontaneously
Well, shake it, shake it, shake it, baby, now shake it up, baby
And I just want to be a part of this
If you're vaguely attracted to rooftops
Though it seems like every time I get a little bit closer
I don't need, I don't eat, I don't sleep
It's not that I won't remember where I'm from
I should run away and think of those
You live by the sword but you die by the knife
From fields of white flowers
You're just not the girl for me
Would you turn me down if I'm not what you're looking for
Dance dance dance right there on the spot
I'm gonna kiss up and rub up and feel up
Still I can't say it
All you need is a voice now
But when we broke up, I got back a part of me I really missed
My reflection just blends in to roads of gold
Mr Pooostman wait a minute, wait a minute
But when the wind is in your hair you laugh like a little girl 
I can do anything, anything, anything
And what l feel
I'm gonna live till I die, I'm gonna live to get high
Before I head for home
I know sometimes we all wanna give in
It's gonna be good to have you back again with me,
I'm so alone without you
I'll go along with all she needs 
But I've been sleepwalking down to the lake
You've got it all
Behind the facade is a lonely fountain here
But, we are okay, we are alright
And try your luck again, be strong, don't bend
Drop it to the floor
Then you lay me down in clover
Where the air is rarefied
Inside a paper napkin
The world's turning 'round for you
Hostility explodes in the mess, now your arm got blood all over the wall,
The colors
But you could be waiting for a day that won't come
She said what would your mother think and how would your father react
You'd sleep here, I'd sleep there
View in there, a pitied pair
When clouds up above
They paint the grasses green
Pay the piggy back
Too much of your line made me blind
Loose at their seams
But I don't know nothing 'bout love, uh
Just the way that you dance
Scary moment, lovin' every moment
And I'm not only among but I invite you all to come
Follow the day and reach for the sun
Walk by the man who sings a song to the street lights
She wants a man that's got his game locked tight
No fact or fiction or storyline
And have walked bitter streets alone
Go grab a cup I dunno what people waitin' on
I wish you were here my dear Yoko
In every day and any hour
I'll get 'em back in a few more tries
You make me feel much better
You need attention, I can see you're sulking
We can be a whole group of friends
You've been kicked around,
I remember thinkin'
Is to separate my blood from bone, it will all fail
A movement with no leaders
Here comes the deputy head with the bark of a bulldog
When the sun goes down into the water
They don't say what they mean
I guess we'll have to wait until the trade winds blow
As we lay them on the granite counter top
Might leave yo face down in the dirt because hurtin's not an option
Tell me, is it only me, do you feel the same
Love has placed a seed
Where's the fun in doing what you're told
You can see me, don't go away
We got a whole big, fat world to see
That I'm growing up to be a better man, dad
But has gone across the canvas to the
Morning, where am I this morning
But I'll break them too
So start giving in, yeah you better get down
I started thinking of you
It's time that we rocked three daunting nouns
Staring at the blank page before you
Looking for a bottle to hold it in, hold it in
Thrown down your ladder, make a room for me
If I was a flower growing wild and free
A foxtrot above my head
On a first name basis
Do ya, do ya, do ya want me Do ya love me 'cause I wanna know
Fabrications complicate the world in a web
So hold on to my hands
You will know that it will show the way the ocean always knows
Left with nothing but a picture
Of love to the desert 
If there's a letter, a letter for mee
Like it's lived in these nights, holding your hatred tight like a sign that you're right or you're strong
'Cause after all this time
And then the sun came crashing in 
She's been living in her uptown world
Ride to Harlem, Hollywood
People are hateful, and people are rude
You're gonna walk backwards
Come on baby, let me tell you 
And find what you are here for
When you're feeling in the dumps
Please don't lose your faith in me
The dog days are done
Don't you Feel your dreams lie right 
And if I fall asleep
Same old faces make me shudder
My phone number, the way I dance
No matter how they toss the dice, it has to be
I'm getting tired of living my life like nothing's happening
My heart is on my sleeve
It's been a year and now we find
Oh God, cause now you got me missing you
Bandages, bandages have advantages too
Of good and bad men all around
Hush hush the world is quiet
Point the finger, place the blame
You're the kind of guy whose hand's in mine
Hoo boy
To shut it all off and make a run for the door
Nighttime is mine, and my eyes are wide at night
Everyone in queue, in costume
Sickheart
It started straight off, "Coming here is hell"
Join the voices of our soul
So let's spend
All this noise that you remove just
I would have liked you anyway Would have liked you anyway
And can I get, yeah, what I ordered
Hey, nothing serious, we still have our fun, or we had it once
Felt the blushing blood run through my cheeks
Then I start to feel trapped in, people greet me, I'm polite
Stranded in the fog of words
To meet your friend the star of stage and local press
He's never had so much fun
There's no one on the corner and there's no one at home
Held me flat on my back, taught me how to give in
Long ago in days of yore
Watching you's the only drug I need
Let me through, paper in fist
They wanna say there's a war outside and a bomb in the street
Some kind of mysterious Give me one shot at the night
I'm on the edge of something shattering
Crush high, don't want it to stop
A mnemonic game on the arc of a journey
Walk out the door
It's always the issue
Whisky that came from Twickenham
To blow against the wind
So don't pretend that you don't feel the pull
Everything you are to me
Oh that I, was the fool
A walk on sand 
She got the power to be
You've got to take what's due
This is the way you left me Oh, I feel as if I'm wastin'
Got a tattoo that said, 'together through life'
Woah, I say so
I starting sending you a note
How will I get there
Nice day for your shop to get busy
The first time staying out all night
I'm traveling at the speed of light
I'm not feelin' so good
I want to make you mine
Ba, bababababy, don't blow me away
I love, I love, in the rain, oh
I need to be high 
And do you ever feel like you're alone
You can hear the waves in underwater caves
I listened in through hallways and thin doors 
Be careful you might kill him
I will always love you, baby
I will kiss you soft so you know
I keep calling your name Keep calling your name
An apple falls on his head
So the summer is eternity for you
And look out the window with you
Or lick a rock, or both"
I know it seems like the same old guy
I'm done dreaming that we can fly
Gone
This world has a warm, sunny heart
And I shouldn't sleep all day
Running from running
Stay mine shut, I don't mind
For us to dance, dance, dance till the break of dawn
Silver lining and golden seams
You can try to hold the breeze
And even with the lights down real low
How did it come to be
That seep down from the bitter sky tonight
Pack up and leave all our things behind
Been there a half an hour, I wanna come home soon
Hanginaround this town on the corner
We bluff our souls on canteen patios
My, my the kindest truths are often spoke but never heard
I wrote the kinds of papers teachers hang up on their walls
Naked kids, running wild, and free
I'm losing sleep and it's gonna be keeping me up all night
All poor people from all over
'Cause we wasted all our free time alone
I ain't no fireman 
I lost my edge on things when I lost my head
She is famous, she is funny
I'm gonna stand guard like a postcard of a golden retriever
So let's start it right here right now
I've got the magic in me I got the magic, baby
I hope it's me and love, love, love
It wasn't 'til I looked into the mirror
And it's wonderful, baby
I'm waiting, waiting for nothing
It's a sure fine way to ruin my day
This time, we should be starting again
Don't act right when you know you're dead wrong
Oh there's nothing left just you and I,
Can you feel it
I know it's rough when all you have is my word
Bite your face to spite your nose,
I just love what you've done with your hair oh yeah
Each time we have a quarrel
I have to admit it's getting better Better
And in every way, you know I just want you to stay
And honestly I'm way too tired to fight
Every street you walk on
But you just try to stop me now
And letting love blaze like, fire
Give in my friend
The end is never the end
Wind is cold all right back in Dallas
But not you, you still wear boots and your hair is too long
I'm on fire and now I think I'm ready to bust a move
Is written in books from long ago
And in your nose, blood decadence
One waving out the window
To the brujo's door
Don't understand how one can watch so much TV
It's so magical feeling, that no one's got a hold
I am out here looking for you
Ariella, , I don't want to go to sleep
Every time you passed out
Maybe I think you're cute and funny 
Don't want to meet your mama Hey ya
Let the children act like furniture
Maybe we can talk about it
Said pretend it's whales
Another day to give you all my love
And there's nothing that
When they say wake up
There's no need to worry
Know my own electricity
The night is still and cold but this desert can turn
He whispers his goodbye
Do ya need a little time Do ya love me 'cause I wanna know
We all wanna know how it ends
Right down the bone
Lisa knows a girl who's been abused
You're the ocean
Till we go sleep at night 
And now that I don't want for anything
Who's always sure of where you are
And swiftly ran the other way
I walked the streets to find the one I'd looked for
Crimson and clover
And it's time for something never knowing, oh
You'd see it with your own two eyes
But what am I gonna say,
I don't believe this, I'm in love again
I am floating away floating away
That I'll make you forget her
Can't seem to get where we're going
Yeah you held my hand
I'm gonna fix tomorrow when 
Tuesday afternoon is never ending
I drive , miles an hour
Would you be my love, my love could you be mine
Because I'm free
Who knows soon your spit will land on Mars
And now the trip to the supermarket
Look up the number 
I was so crazy about you, I didn't mind
And I will soon be put to rest now Ooh ooh
It feels like years since it's been here
Eu já lavei o meu carro, regulei o som
And never need a doctor
Always look on the right side of life
All the games that we play
When all the pretty girls can't measure to you
Learn to spit up towards the stars
Under more stars than
I still got all my love to give,
Bad boy rock, bad boy roll
And it don't get me down, don't come around
Well I guess I've been in love before
He said "Where you from" we told him our lot
She couldn't seem to make up her mind
Learned who to fight with and pray to
There's a light inside of me
I figured out her number
They want you in the front line
The Theodore Unit, we controllin' the club
So stand up
Something going on around here 
Go night swimming, leave your clothes on the ground
Sun is shinin' in the sky,
Do you remember, do you remember
I'd give anything for you to call me
And so my soul collapsed into a big guilt wad
I'm so proud to know that she is mine
I danced around your folk and soul
Sweet chocolate Chocolate walnut candy
We all have teeth that can bite underneath
Late nights all alone with a test tube 
Hmmmm, yeah
I'll only end up losing you
For us to shout, shout, shout these words out
If I'd been out till quarter to three
I get up
If life seems jolly rotten
I wanna get better
The more you know you know you don't know shit
The California girls and a beautiful coastline
But there's a heavy cloud inside my head
And all of the grief we never even knew
I'm not too proud to say that I'm okay with
And I got more balls than the daily lottery
I want everyone
You've got to be good to yourself
Still I think I'm doin' fine You're doin' fine
'Cause I've been too long a lonely man
Tossed aside the mirrored life
Kiss the tears that stain my neck
They get me nowhere
But I'm a prisoner of this moment with you in my arms
In peace
I am never lonely
Oh but at often times those words get tangled up in lines
Heyla, heybahelloah cha uhcha uhcha
You're the one for me, you make me so very happy
All by myself, waking up at twelve I'm my clothes again
In your mind
The feelings that I feel when I feel
You'll make a sharp one being so kind
Such a big day waiting for you
Say love, say love
Buy all of the things I never had
You gambled your soul away
Or a little upset all inside
Jinga jangler, tinga lingle, picture on a bricky wall
Can put back together
'Til they get the best of the night
There's a town I know called Nevers
I can't see the landscape
Love in this town  it's like a joke
No more sun, why's it always night
Yeah, I only feel all right when the VU is flashing
City fog and brave dialog converge on the frontier
One foot in your bedroom, and one foot out the door
The sound of fear
Don't brag about it, come show me
'Fore they make you feel a man
Your love
Let's go back to simplicity
While the players at United get a hundred grand a week
Will I set the sun
You walk like an ace now, you walk like an ace
I don�t want no savior baby, I just wanna have a good time
You won't forsake me, your mother won't hate me
Now I'm locked inside a stall at the cantina
Life indeed can be fun,
Got love for the thug nigga's who get' it on tha ave
Like open minds for us
To the lonely beat
You got me goin' crazy
Dance with me pretty boy tonight pull shapes,
The cancan such a pretty show
Everything is looking up, everybody up now
To get away from it all
'Cause you're a friend,
There's a bad reason
I just ask let me be
The tunnels all around me
When the grand scheme plan keeps all these people wondering
Muck around 'til the end
Anything you want in the world
In and out of the blue this cruise is losing altitude, all we need
I'll throw a party and greet my undersea friends it depends
My feelings for the girl
Of air
Some nights kept me awake, I thought that I was stronger
I never thought that I'd be living on your floor
Well, it's all right, even when push comes to shove
Forget what happened then
And it's the time we waste
Oh, we were bound to get together
It's the word, love 
Said it's puts berries in my heart bread
'Cause it's used all its better days
And lick the light
You see, every time Ra didn't show
Till we skip through the towns to the bright, sweet, past on
You just can't go back no more
Took my gum in your hand
You might lose your faith in Jesus,
I'm flipping with a coin that's got a tail on either side
Royal familys don't have time for that shit
Well there's a light on
Begging, begging you please 
Don't panic, panic, Mutya, just look ahead now >
And everybody knows
Different window would the
I said, "I'm gonna get that girl no matter what I do"
No one else can feel it for you
I used to go to see on the landing in the summer
And bring it all back
I will play awhile here
Crossed the line, didn't mean to
I love you, baby
We keep it rocking till  am
You might get away with it
K  I  A in love, I'm your target
What are you whining about
She said she'd had enough of playing games
But it's a different tune that's stuck in my head
Hard to find the words to tell ohoohoh
And I can't see you or breathe you, 'cause there's trouble right beneath you, it's all in the night,
They carry the dust of the failing wisdom
Never ever ender all this love
They love me, but I can't say
Don't come up to me and say you like it
In the palm of your hand 
Always bold and wise and unsettling
Well your arrows are soaring through my chest
You'd be on your way to better things
Ah ah ah ah dialetto è bellissimo non
And you threw it away
And the world's alright with me
There's really nothing much to it
God knows I've never been a spiritual man
Ready for the bad things to come
I wish that I could fly
I've got your letter, you've got my song
Where, where have they gone
What did you want to be when you grew up
Clothes of many colors lying on the bedside,
Midday Past The Three
I'd come all over your party, but I'm soft
Take it down, propeller, she winding, winding, wind
I'm coming out and I'll tell you the truth
Said, 'There's no sex in the champagne room'
Oh Yoko, oh Yoko, my love will turn you on
Disappear in the world she brought
Remember through colors, remember through towns
Well life's a train that goes from February on day by day
I mean, what have you got to lose
I said fuck dancing all night but then that's just what we did
Remember it's for you, for helvede we are proud
Come on out, make romance
Everyday, I'm so happy, baby
Just one more box of cheapo wine
Oh, Billy Brown had lived an ordinary life
If you don't leave the world behind
Each night I ask the stars up above 
Who makes love to the flower bed
I cut class in school, yeah
In honor of the death of bohemia and impromtu
So dark up above
He's out of luck, I'm with you
I heard you sell the truth but I don't buy it
Well, he says he's got a big boat
The world is our dance floor now 
Seein' stars I'm seein' stars
Tonight, tonight and we're dancing on the edge of the Hollywood Sign
Keep ya toes on the lively side
I blame myself Feel my head explode from a night of gin
Hold the line
Steeple with its people spewing angels out their mouths and letting tables turn to charcoal in the lipstick and the lipstick in the evening oh no
I say, hey poppa, hey poppa, close to you
You take all my pain away from me
On a business trip one day
Where everything's fine, if I can keep my mouth shut tight tight tight
I just want to sparkle for a moment
I don�t understand
Ooh There's nowhere else to go, I hope that you'll stay the night
The only one I want on my back
Over ten years have gone by
That right now is all that matters
What you got
I feel a cold flush going through my hair
But got it just don't get it
I only feel all right when the VU is flashing
That you cannot comprehend
I have everything right
Everybody's got a secret to hide
Someone I used to know
I really can't see where it ends
You'll come down, come down
Walk up and down that lonely treble clef
The radio and the bones we found frozen
On your way to the best years of your life
Avant de perdre prise et d'abandonner
It shouldn't feel like it is ending
There is a map in my room on the wall of my room and I've got big, big plans
But I love her and I'm sorry
Pay the monkey back, back,
When I'm bored, I, kinda drift away
Agonic lines, ascendances and amatory tendencies
'Cause I don't like you 'cause you're not like me
I'm letting it go
Aurélies Akzent ist ohne Frage sehr charmant
See what I've done
If you were here we'd laugh about their vacant stares
It's all love
Tttttthings are never gonna be quite what you want
As I was walkin' by
And the next night I see you sitting over there with girl 
Well, it's all right, you still got something to say
It twists and turns in colorful subplots and sunburns and fake out endings
And gave a wink and smile
Were in love
These streets have got a rhythm
They play Sleepy Jackson on the radio
If I jumped from the top of the parachute"
'Cause love only gets you down
Enjoy the good times love can bring
See the tears standing in my eye
Wake up to show me what I could not find
Got to love, well we got to love, yeah
And if you see him out tonight
And you fall in the same routine
Just one more
Unkissed boys and girls of paradise
It's in your head it might look grenner
Get it, get it 
Building walls and an old pay phone
When every single second of my waking day
He can't be bothered 'cause he's high on THC
Is sitting right next to me
Did I ever tell you my uncle's monkey ran away from the zoo
To wake you all from bed, from bed
I know you wanna dance
I'm a shooting star leaping through the sky
In the land of summer sun we have just begun
You're the kind of friend
And when the money comes in for the work I do
This is the only place for me
Lie in my arms, sleep secure
There's some things you gotta know
We sent ourselves in on the gray card scale
And everything looks worse in black and white
Just to feel a little better about myself
You've got the spark I've been lookin' for
Goin' faster than a roller coaster
This time you're not homecoming king
I'm off to the west, it's blinding my eyes
Life is yours alone
Just a better place to die
Read my lips
You don't help me none
Cracked and devoid of rain
Started something
'Cause Lisa learned a lot from putting on a blindfold
We won't look back,
Stay beside me, stay beside me 
Now I'm gonna try this old microphone light
It's all love, you know
Ooh, woo, oh It's the reason why my heart's been racing
Holding onto a package
Her moods are swinging on the swingset almost everyday
I just want to write a song about a boy and a girl
And mountains and the sky 
Turn your magic on
You're the one that keeps me coming
So let me see you Yeah Yeah
We took the floor, and she said
Before the cool done run out I'll be giving it my bestest
My heels are high, my eyes cast low
From the dark end of the street
I count the days, the Great Frontier
And one of those is you and I Hey
Yesterday's still a mess
And I could never understand
And I feel like walking the world
Grow and grow till tall
One day when I'm gone
I check my bed for bugs and spiders
Oh language is dead,
Dreams become a screamer
I'm folding it all tonight
We gotta stay positive
Bent crooked in the light around you
Why must the children play in the streets
Running around before it corners you
You're my love
Cause some things have changed
But still the bank's gotta break
So I could steal into the night
I wonder what you're dreaming of, lands rare and far
She's always screamin' when she's calling her friend
Second floorliving without a yard
She got lips like a sofa
To all the punk ass fucks that just want to talk shit
Ash his heart onto the ground
O comet come down
 hindsight, but how did they know then
You're back so late
Could you picture Russell needing a check, man
I'll take your far away
To the jungle through the night forever, uh
I am a vampire and I'm walking in the city
Oh darling, I was blind to let you go
In the darkest part of you that you have ever seen
You don't know what it's like to listen to your fears
All of her possessions gonna make her feel fine
It's fine with me, I'm just taking in the scenery
Like athletes of the afternoon 
Where's the love It's not enough
We'll pour another round and come back to life
I'm ready for this, so darling, hold my hand
And if somebody's going to make it
It's such a mystery my, my philosophy
I want to just hold you
Drivin' away, and leaving it all behind
Well, I ain't often right but I've never been wrong
But it's not supposed to feel this good
Get down, get down, get down
I promise, sugar, I wasn't trying to steal
You've got to kick it out of me gently
And the world is electricity
And maybe you'll understand, 
But now I can't seem to pretend 
And I'll run naked through the streets without my mask on
Maybe we gotta try
It's cold in the keep
There is only one thing
Now, it's turned into a cornfield
It's the shape of her legs
All of the subatomic pieces come together and
And somehow it made sense
Oh Great Illinois It can only start with you
Just for tonight,
All my troubles, went away
They have built a home sweet home home HOME
Girls are my girls when it comes to the fellas then
Now I'll tell you something for my heart beats for you deep inside
Oh please, just don't ask me how I've been
Struck a sparkling tone like a xylophone
Tonight I'm gonna have myself a real good time
And I scramble down the stairwell with my baby, cradle and all
In suspended animation, we ain't tryin' to go nowhere
Why did you leave me alone
Now everybody knows
No, I never heard you callin' from the moon
Sir all I want is a chance to amend
And I've been there before, I held up the door
a calcium mine
And I don't know why but with you I dance
Tell me I'm the only one
It didn't have to daunt her
Don't break down, let's go forget about yourself
See my eyes they're full of water
And I dreamed we were dancing in the dark
His hat is a funny shape, his heart is a brick
From our mouths
That no one could ever look at me like you do
In love with a girl who lives
Now it's coming back
Out of breath and out of cash
You hold the white light much better
We're gonna to crash around, till we wake this whole damn town
The more things seems to change, the more they stay the same
You're thinking that it's me you're fooling
Now you're shit out of luck, yeah
Well it's guys like me who get somewhere
As we drift into the zone
The world requires no audience
With the blue skies ahead
Now through the lines of the cheap Venetian blinds
And she stares at the fire all day, mumbling to herself
Not a trace of doubt in my mind
Speaking on the themes of stolen virtue missing from the radio, radio
It's safety dance
Back then, she was like the star in the movie
Filling in the ticket in her little white book
And say it's so much fun out here
When I'm making up my mind
You're oh oh oh like air
Let the beat control your body,
Ninetynine percent an embarrassment 
Pay the camel back
You can't say no to hope, can't say no to happiness
Don't stop talkin'
I'm hanging around
You've been with all my friends
But c'mon get back up
I could move town
You got some money do you right
I've been in the tall grass all my life
You kept on dancing underneath the burning floor
The rumble strip clack
I'm juggling and my fears are on fire
If you could only see the love that you're wasting
And we go where the money goes
And considered it odd
Covered with paint
You might be lucky if you try 
In a distant hellhole room
That's if you crash and spend the night
And I need you to help me count my toes 
I look up to the sun, it only hurts my eyes
That's okay, don't worry 'bout it baby
Just give me one more chance one more chance
I be filmin' her friends too, hit 'em back on that
And they're singing the same goddamn refrain
Underneath the stars
Chord shapes in air
Like a melancholy song
Hoy pensaste en mi y mi mente exploto 
Called up my mama, said I'm in love with a stripper, yo
But I can't get out of it
Maybe sometimes, we feel afraid, but it's all right
Night night
Askin for the next together
I am trying to say
Sing it to the world
Fireflies and the stars in the sky
This thing of ours is dead, but don't you grieve
Anchored by an astronaut's patriot tune
Fuck it, fight it, it's all the same
We took the tourist route, the nights are light until midnight Light until midnight
Knowing, as we're falling under, what was right
'Cause I'm about to break it down,
And there's this one episode, closeup cameras are showing him crying
I can feel your feet touching mine 
But if you don't listen to the voices then my friend
It all went to my heart, yeah some rainbows in the dark
Learn to forgive, learn to let go
When you look at me
From a word that means only not a thing
Is this band makin' money, I don't know
Both alone in the dark
And for a fraction of a second you can't remember where you are
Is a queen formed out of flaws, with her eyes all gone odd and a rod bolted into her spine
Tu Mirada Me Tiene En Descontrol Mundial Ooh oh oh Daddy
It's not the same honey, with you not around
Then I started adding figures up in my head
The end to all my
I can feel it
Look at you shaking you can't find his plight
Is right there now in her home
Another one about a babe from back in the day
Take me by the hand and stand by my side
Then it's a beautiful thing 
If you want to be the one that he's thinking of
One night doesn't mean the rest of my life
All day and everyday 
That's how you know that your best friend's all strung out
And Jackie wasn't perfect but she did her best
Meanwhile back
I'm in love but it's only temporary, temporary
And with the radio blasting
She's in love with me and I feel fine, mmm
I already forgot
Here's the time I took the blame
Rabbit or a habit
Close your eyes, crystal eyes
All I want is you, will you be my bride
"Sorry, boy, to leave you high and dry,
I have another glass of wine
Like the darkness around me
Late nights and weekends our hearts only walk slowly on the local track
Com seu carro esporte
Lift up your head and keep moving Keep moving
The kids flip their lids when their heads hear that crazy sound
Can someone tell me how long
Yeah, oh come on
Once I had a love to show
She's got a doll with one eye, 
No one's ever gonna take my life from me
Play it through okay
Looking for a ticket to take me away from here
German Wine, Turpentine, Gertrude Stein
And it's starting to show
Every time I touch that track it turns into gold Yes, it turns to gold
Yeah, it's been fun but now I've got to go
Down to the nigga's chasin' million, their dreams' servin' nickels
I've got a crummy job
A talking fish comes as she moves
You'll be strong and you'll turn me on
Everybody here is out of sight
The princess in her flower bed
So when you sing this song out loud
People around you
But I make the morning dew glisten
You've been all my thoughts of passion
And you keep saying you keep saying
What you're calling a sin, isn't up to them
In a sea of perfect stripes it's hard to stay afloat
You gave me love babe, gave me love babe
Midnight shadows 
When you walk by every night
'Cause we gotta a lot of things to do now
But your body language is telling me that you're worth the pain
Never lets go, never lets me grow old
But I didn't feel them change
I guess that's how the future's done, oh, ohon
It's early in the morning
Let's get out of here
And drift, into water
We're on our way
I gotta stop sipping on the sweet nectar
The sun will shine till eternity
Why did we hate her It's the great I Am
I hate lesbian feminists 'cause they're all so damn ugly
Burn down the street
I got something I think I really wanna tell ya
Now boy, you know me well
I am walking in my sleep
Watch and wonder as they come alive
Another long quiet, lonely night spent at your side
Well, I go to bed
It goes ooh la la, I see stars
And as my mind begins to spread its wings
I'll be the one to keep you one disaster less
Remember feelin'
Ooh I feel like I'm gonna sweat
To the rock and roll to the boom boom beat
And we'll go dancing, baby, then you'll see
That type of thinking can't get you nowhere How I got over
'Cause we're the kings and the queens of the new broken scene
I saw my friend and he couldn't believe that
It's just because I'm crazy in love
Keep you trapped inside your room there all alone
And when they told me what I did I burst into laughter
Take you home, and then they'll rape you
Time has fooled me into thinking it's a part of me
I duck these gold faces, post up feefifofum basis
Love, when I get that gig, get a crib, get a car when tha grip stack up
She's got medals
Those years never came
Oh baby baby, I'll beg I'll beg
Do you ever get lonely playing with your toys
Let's sneak out of this party
While my friends were getting high and chasing girls
So I will dance with Cinderella
Of emptiness are moving to the sound
Suspicious for the winter with your
What is scaring you
If you believe a hand on your faith
When the lush hangs off the chron, I know that you're gone, ya feel me feel me
Oh baby girl in those baby pants
Make our break to our star bodies go
Well when you hear the music and you can't sit still
The solemn warmth you feel inside
And if you didn't know about us then get into the flow
Go home and bury your love tonight
You'll always smile upon me and I'll smile upon you too
Because I pitied all mankind
And your life has come undone
'Cause you're there when you talk and you're there not to stop
Does anybody know
One more time for me
The lies that tied your tongue in knots
I'll move on
Why you never sleep
I'm looking for a nice way to say I'm out
Love will never ever be lost on me, oh not tonight
Nothing could be further from the cold hard truth
Imagination, life is your creation
Crumb by crumb in this big black forest
Away we go Away
My feet are buried in the sand
I remember the time I knew a girl from Mars
Molly stays at home and does her pretty face
Ooh Then what we've got is gold
To the light
And the feeling of the wind in your face can lift your heart
Gone too far, yea I'm gone again
I keep you with me in my heart
Yeah yeah yeah You know you're made in heaven
Anyway you can
But the quarry don't share his taste for Anne McCaffrey
Dear Dominique well I hope you're feeling better
You're never gonna understand what you're seeing
Walked to your house on my lunch break, here it comes
Think about the place where you live
True to color, a town, a time, or a place
Nouns and books and show and tell
Y aunque parezcas despistado con ese caminar pausado 
To have a real good time
But I tend to know exactly all the things you keep on moving
And if you wanna lose the rest of the night
Nothing you can see that isn't shown
Now what would you say if I told you that
Forgetmenot eyes
I'm the cashier I change girls
And you don't know what's up the bend
There's no stopping us, no
Don't let me rush you please
I like girls that wear Abercrombie and Fitch
Now I've got nothing to lose
And life is nice, so nice
That's not my name
I gotta have you, like abracadabra
'Cause I just can't wait till you write me
Ain't got no mother, ain't got no culture
Now, she's hit the big time
But you're still runnin' just as fast as the man says
Of course I'll put my arm around you
But he doesn't care
No happy ending
You say you've never seen America, I really think you'll like it there
May we never go, go mental may we always stay, stay gentle
It's getting harder to give
But out of my thumbs my little red baby runs
The things we left unsaid
Oh these nights out alone
Around, around, around, around, around, around, around
You promised me a dream home
Infact I feel like I just
Dance, yeah let's dance, come on and dance
Please don't leave me alone
Of an emotional landslide,
Who once saved you your day
I know you'll do things you would never dare
This is the way you left me
Don't give in, don't give up, don't pack it up, stop cracking up
Party like like it's the end of the World
And I felt the green was blacker and the blue was darker still
Spend all your spare time trying to escape
I'm not alone anymore I'm not alone anymore
Built well, you're a strong letter "I"
Hold me close, we're losing time
Our aspirations, wrapped up in books
Turn the TV off already, Curse the hours we have to keep
Only a pound a word 
'Cause I'm sure that some day it's gonna start
I started smiling
Go baby, go baby, yeah we're looking at you
But our destiny got us intertwined 
You say stop
I ran my mouth off a bit too much, oh, what did I say
Never start static gots to get it off my chest
You'll fall forward because
On dark and stormy days, somewhere it's glowing
You'll hear the music, fill the air
I thought if I succeeded I'd be happy and they'd go away
All I've got to say is there ain't no fucking way
So I can be the beacon of hope that you'd always expected
Dance dance dance now the beat's really hot
Hey, girl, I said, ooh
Don't hide the pleasures you've found in your rolling around
We were living for the love we had
Ach, die Medizin ist ungenießbar
I fall asleep in hospital parking lots
When tomorrow's too much
Jessica numbers give me this
I know everything
You got me in the mood
Everything you know
And back and forth we sway like branches in a storm 
I said I have faith in my fellow man
And then I sit with you now, I can remember
Today I said the time was right for me to follow you
One thing for certain,
I knock you off ya feet, put holes in ya 'til ya clothes leak
Butterfly, I don't know how it is you got inside of me
This will be a better year
Something of an anomaly
That I needed to prove
The only one I want to see is you
I know a nigga seen me and how my change is laning kid
I jump over the seat
People say men are just like kids
On my own two feet
You never know what the night it may bring
I had a funny dream and you were wearing funny shoes
And like a bitch you already spent
Please, please, Mr Pooostman
The kid in the mall works at Hawt Dawg on a Stick
What was a stinging's now a sharp pain in my chest
Today I know I feel OK
It's nothing else but us right now
When I get you home
Girl, you know that I'll be back again
Cause all my feelings
And there's a lot to be said and to be done today
The time was passed so easily
It won't stop, I won't come down, I keep stock
With the ghosts at bay
Can I get get get to know knknow know you better better, baby
Seven days of torture, seven days of bitter
So reach deep and release your inner child Yeah Yeah
Eh, eh, I wish he never looked at me that way
Sometimes they make me sorry
I got the hifi high and the lights down low
You need to be careful
Just come and open up your folding chair next to me
And I play songs back to back until I got to bed
Trying to turn me off
Did you think that I've been foolin' around
Dance all night, we gonna dance all night, dance all night to this DJ
To get to know the world
Maybe, you're gone
Goat's head in the deli case
Ooh somebody loves you
All crop tops and testosterone passion
And we'll stop fighting once your circuit board's igniting
I feel like I'm part of a book I've read
Just one more time please
Music is my kingsize bed
I can see you're new, awake
Mark Cohen will preview his new documentary about
I left my baby on the side of the highway 
Whenever you're around, yeah
Transforms a grumpy look into a smiling face
You know that boom boom pow
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I was there from the moment that you were born
So alone all the time and I lock myself away
I've got a lot over here without you
You was staring at me like to say I was Ginger
And the sun always shines down on your shoes
A palm tree in Christmas lights
So I put a bullet where I shoulda put a helmet
Oh babe, I said oh lord, babe
I could get used to this
It's Saturday Morning
Don't believe me just watch, come on
You're so evil baby
And I need you to hide it when it shows 
Lace up your shoes
We get down, get down
Let's go together
Proud that you are my, dad
And the air hangs heavy like a dulling wine
With the sinking of the sun
The birds have stopped their singing
Fall falling  falling again
That works for  wait a minute, wait a minute
You represent saying "I'm real"
Hold your head up, you silly girl
I want to get along with you
And we wanna get caught
Get these mutts away from me
Don't ever think you're the only one
Gotta cut these ropes around my hands,
Well I wait so long
Let me tell you something else
We'll dance until morning till there's just you and me
Yo respect it, the legacy'll never end
Godgiven grace and a holy Heaven face
Because of the things you told me
You ain't never gonna feel this way
When the ride gets rough you got to carry on
And all of the things we had
Yes, Honestly
In a couple of days they come and take me away
Tye dye O'er, I roll the dye, I coast, I dose, I
I fell behind on my nightly fourcourse meal of rainbow pills
If you stop, you'll end up somewhere
Two of a kind, baby
Until I find what it is that I've been looking for
If you're ever really gunna know
I don't need an alibi or for you to realize
But just right now
For something new
A dozen point the other way
Or am I just a roadblock in your way
This winter is much like all the rest
I'm trying to hide behind tired eyes, I sigh
We still have to take it slow
I know that you need help
Should we pretend
And why do you fear that no one will hear
As I walk my feet on the cold concrete
You never seem to see me standin' there
Time's too short, right and wrong
Who's one of my kind
So you say, "Yeah I'm all right"
You like the sun
Broad daylight, in the broad day
How the wind went and pulled you into the hurricane
And I'm not bummed, some works not fun then we crawl in the carpet like bugs
We'll defuse bombs, walk marathons
This could really be a good life
This room don't smell like you and me
I wanna hold your hand
All my life I've been on my own
I walked her home and she held my hand
And still the wheel turning's all I'll be
I flow some round in my bedroom turn around see myself in the mirror
Hey show some love
I've got to, got to get to some place I've not been
Now the party's on
Forget about yourself and all your plans
So nothing ever made it right Aaah
What did he say
Everybody, everybody just wanna play the lead
And it looks good to me
Every touch becomes infectious
See me and Julio down by the schoolyard
Now you're really livin' what this life is all about
You wanna find peace of mind
I only wanna wonder why when I don't die
I'd give to ya, world, and then
You got my heart unlocked,
They have the nerve to let their weapon shine
Who cares that it makes flowers
A dying cigarette in the rain
Where I was almost famous for almost a day
I play centerfield for the home team
Rabbit or a habit Habit or a rib
I never thought that you'd find out I did it
Through fields of white flowers
The mother, the child, the tame and the wild
Sweet damage
I know that you can hold me down
You bought all those lovely things, yeah
Kinda like an Injun without his fire water wine
And your Sailing into hell
Headed where the voices are
Needs a fireman to rescue it,
The sounds of bells are ringing out
Wake up where the clouds are far behind me
Do you remember when we first met I sure do
And find out where she got her wings
Got nothing to say I got nothing to say
Good Time, Good Time Don't stop me, don't stop me
River water, holy water
Keep my ocean calm
And can I skip this thing I ordered
Bones
'Cause then she might be happy, and no longer lonely
C'mon we gotta get that shit
Now I'm getting calls just for product placement
If I could see you I'd take off your clothes,
She is super woman
And the way they get loved and the way they get loved
By the boat that swept and swayed
To get it right tonight
Feels like the world's at stake yeaaaaa
Well, there's nothing more to add before I leave
When my world's been turned and overthrown
Why must I be a teenager in love 
Tonight we're gonna shine with the power of a thousand suns
I'll never let you go
Just like the Stones and Manu Chao
I simply cannot forget
Oh I keep feeling older
from its work making light from the night
I must admit it took a while
All the nights we stayed up talking
Ain't nobody gonna take your place
Hands they start to shake now
I was bone white, dry, and scaly
If you're messing with a good heart
If it gets to be too much
So come on
Love experiments and face burning
You come from Georgia where the peaches grow
Just my imagination My imagination
There's a lot to be said and to be done today
We are the chaseups of the night
And people are impatient, they don't know how to wait
I miss yellow lines in my roads
Hastily sold for nothing
It's you that I've been waiting to find
Corporal Bradley of regiment five
Yeah, she's ugly, but she sure can cook, baby
Express yourself, come on now, yeah, come on, now,
I thumb through the pictures
The words on the tip of your tongue
Hold me close, we're falling to the ground
Happy ever after in the market place
Every single one
And then we'll walk on you
So I'm calling your ass up at like
Is country music what your life is for
Instrumental Until End
To my breath or to my words
Let's bump the beats 'til beddybye
While neighbors talk and talk and talk
Writing fifty times "I must not be so, ohoh, oh"
I'm just a shell empty as can be
I can't even see him 'cause his room is so smoky
I see your colours, and I'm dying of thirst
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
And all those ugly days
You deserve everything
My shrink says I'm witty
'Cause there'll be sun and snow and a horse Jethro
The sound of happiness
A ceremony comes An exponential fate
I threw away my candy bar and I ate the wrapper wink, wink
To put your troubles aside
Looks are deceiving
Yeah All right
We danced the junkies in the shadows of bad modern art
I want you to To fill my little world,
The writin's on the wall
'Cause I don't wanna walk on my own anymore
Her phone is ringing straight to
Pretty soon you'll be an old bastard too
This is to my name
'Cause we're lovers, and that is a fact
I guess we'll never know why sparrows love the snow
A thousand miles from the tide
Dear Valerie Plame, if that really is your name
Take a look at yourself
If I could do it again I'd climb more trees
And we were in love
I shake loose of your laces
No matter how things go
Make a dragon wanna retire, man
In the dark we are without a light
I'm holding your hand by the shore
First let's see the West End, I'll show you to my brethren
I've got the goodies baked
We both got fired on exactly the same day
And the windmill's perfect for movies and such
I don't even care, no, I don't even care, no
Now the city blocks out the sun that you know is rising
Let me take you away
We let the movies play
As you go into my head
And the land was hot
piece band all dressed up like me
You blow a fuse, zing, boom
When one falls in, another came out
Before I met you I wasn't terribly lucky
I can tell that we are gonna be friends
Here's a tulip to match your eyes
I see myself on my deathbed saying
You're too wonderful to die
To think about the girl you love, and hold her tight
Cause you are the only one I love
But they tryin' to pull me back
And dry up all your tears
And rage
Now every time I go for the mailbox
I am the wizard of ooh's and ah's and falala's and
When it's a straight line baby, a straight line down
Nothing else matters anymore 'cause you're in my arms again
Chatting on the phone
The colors are beautiful
He's sleeping on the job
Weightless, mindless, homeless Vacuum state of peace
To shield me to disguise that my heart has a secret
Yes she want a lover with the sensativity ya
I'm everything a girl could need
When I am with you, there's no place I'd rather be 
Say a prayer to the man above
Are seeming more and more worth fighting for
For the people write me off like I'm a onehit wonder
Thank god the band's doing well
You get me every time
Could we live together and agree on the same wares
Let the sun illuminate the words
Is it the last time
The mattress, the floozies Run from yourself, from your friends
I'm all tan and smiling and running from rd base
Reach for the bright side
That magic walk that's in your sky
Baddaboombaddabing, he the glorious king
There's a picture of you both sixteen years old just kissing
Like walking down ChampsÉlysées
I have to put your picture down
And when you're holding me
And I been in love only once
Straight from the Philly burbs, feel me pretty sure
You're kissing your elbow
Like heaven needs more to come in
But it's alright now
So we stepped back, but it was drawing near
And there'll be no time for any lies
The cornerstone, the baker Run for your life, for your friends, for ya
They don't believe in lights, they don't believe it's a confusing situation
I'm feeling better ever since you know me
You're like a shot of pure gold
This is the head of the black death
When I get down, I get so down
I know, you'll say
I believe the world is burning to the ground
Good morning to you, I hope you're feeling better baby
And if you do then you're my friend
The blue lighting
My lady on the water, lead me from the wilderness
The dogs barked long days, not dark
Doling out the garland to five 
Cold cold water, whatcha say
They steal the money from your pockets almost viciously 
They conspire trying to keep us apart
I swear that I'm not kidding
Wash away Sin City
What's the matter, matter
They say your pushing thirty
This thing is your mission
We come down
Everybody, everybody just wanna fall in love
Leave the bird you killed at your father's feet
And the deep was dark
I knew we were bound to be together
My nigga flippin' buildin's better than he was flippin' birds
Give you something good to celebrate
Hey, wouldcha say
Me and we'll always be together
My discothèque Juliet, teenage dream
Oh, just one more chance
Who thinks that you're one of a kind
In the suits that you got him, he looks more Italian
It�s here, baby
To see a girl that's sweeter than an apple picked from Adam's tree
But we are young, we get by
I got it all on the back of my hand
I'm takin' it back , takin' it back
Who is a girl and
And I don't understand why I sleep all day
World, what you got for me
Just a kiss, he won't miss
You should start treating me like I was just the same as you
And I'll open my eyes and walk out the door Aaah
The fantastic kids are so nasty Say what
Just like the gold around your finger and the silver in his hair
There's really nothing you can do 
Dairy Queens and Elevens
You fell down the stairs into my arms
Who turned into a killer
Who watches over you Keep the nightlight on inside the birdhouse in your soul
We could talk if days weren't so fast
Make this dream the best I've ever known
They fill my heart with little things
And it will be a long time before shit
I've only ever dreamt of this
When the desert ends, I ask the dust
If you stop staring straight through me
I've got my own secrets though, say what
And I read it to the man 'cause he couldn't read so well
Because you're just so rock 'n' roll"
Have you seen her all in gold
Fish tank this thang along with four more shots Potron
She will always seem exotic and aloof
Don't wanna go to work again ever no more, boy
And tell my friends I'll be around 
The tears this side of heaven
Should've read the writing on the wall
Feeling better than I ever felt before today If you feelin' good
Ruby red slippers and a bunch of trees
It feels so peaceful
Like a pair of black wizards
Something I couldn't over look
Maestro, as you paint this picture would you
My broken house behind me and good things ahead
The world is in a crazy, hazy hue
I'm coming back but will you show
And everything looks so complete
Time that I take you home girl
Look straight ahead, there's nothing but blue skies
And that's another fact, an unchanging fact
Don't get too excited 'cause that's all you get from me 
All of his money is gone
I'm alive  and the dawn breaks across the sky
Life plays such silly games inside of me
What a thing to do
Adopt another lifestyle
Ever kind
I know that it's always something 
Unplugged the phone
And you know, it's Friday too
We can make it last forever, baby
Why am I scarred from what she did to me
I'm sitting on my empty bed
The blue air is up there
I stomp with my right foot,
And get away from here
I'm going to cure your mourning soul 
You took my heart
Leave the sad guitar in its hardshell case
And above the clouds she said to herself
You know I won't be happy till you've won
With the lights all on around us
Been hurrying along, no meal is ever done
Love cleans the mind
I wish that I could swim and sleep like a shark does
States that keep us far apart
I can pluck my own mustache
Don't you worry, it could be so sweet
Think back, think back, to the summertime
Dear, dear friend
You should start realising that I'm just as wild as you
And look at all the bugs we've found
We laughed waiting for a train
In lama land, there's a one man band
And night falls
Do you need it 
We'll make it better make it better, we're here to welcome you
And you'd swear those words couldn't heal, and
We never did get famous,
Cause you and I we're good together, oh
Come tomorrow I'll be on my way back home
Reaching for something in the distance
Don't roll up when they're playing my song
And take on whatever together
California, Florida, Detroit, they all gon' ride wit' a G
Dance with me and we'll be all right pull shapes,
On things we never said
And it's byebye, goodbye I tried Aaah
You can get it any time so yes but unless
She's got a love like woe Woe oh oh oh
Hanging out at truck stops
I'm in love again
Won't you come strap yourself to my side
And everything is gonna be alright
'Cause I've been waiting for
That if one day in paradise
And I'm gone, gone, gone, gone
At my door, at my door, at my door
The world is in your palm now
I wanna tell you something
I don't mind, no
Shaking at the sight
Are the people close to you
Big hits, big hats, yeah give me the ball 
Shake my head dizzy so I'll never know
Well I'm buried in my bedroom
Now I'm happy in the head
Grinding your teeth in the middle of the night
And when the radical priest come to get me released
I been bummin' around this old town so long
Get on your feet now baby dance
Dee Dee, he left home
Could you back me up
Been running a blender in a lightning storm
My feet were lead
I don't care for walkin' downtown
Back to school, ring the bell
There's more of those tunnels in your home town
Say the word I'm thinking of 
All the things that you loathe
Do you know the game croquet
We are here to make you feel
And we know we're not alone anymore
Something's broken in the way we smile
In the bank of a million dreams
All you ever do is run and hide
I wanna get satisfaction
And kissle me some more
Thinking things could not improve
I was never young, even as a child
I know you feel it too
Aim high when the target is low
Dirty talk talk talk louder
The girl's a fool, she broke the rule, she hurt him hard
If I got my piano, then I know I'll be okay, baby
I take you on a trip 
Makes nothing else feel good enough
You tell me that you heard every sound there is 
Haven't you noticed I've been shedding all of mine
As you know, I've never been a praying man
You can go there fishing for the moon
Roam through the streets
I can be a warrior Indian, I can be a helicopter
A merry Christams, honey
A man can never dream these kind of things
What are you gonna do
What I have inside me it's enough to fill a house
I can call you Betty
Leave the secret talks on the trundle bed
You're all I think about, baby
Shines them out by day
Oh how does it feel to be you right now, dear
K  I  A baby, let's get this started
There's too many questions to why I love you 
You carved
You love fun dip and cherry coke
Ah, she wants money, money, money, money, money
And love for the fine stripper's who get it poppin' ass
And I'll lay next to you in that grave side by side
Came down upon his head dodo dodoodoo
Oh but it's gone
I don't want to say goodnight to records I love
In the summertime when the weather is high
I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else
Lost in the ether with no one to blame
Let the hot winds howl
Became procurer of young girls
At the altar of someone else's love for me
So let the beat control you now,
The swallowed flames
When it's candlelight I see I go insane
What's a matter babe, are you feelin' blue Oh
Baby, thank you for the second chances
When the fellas, talk to my girl I ain't with it 
Say goodnight to gravity
Asked the reverend was the strip clubs cool
Six months of our lives are at a red light
Oh, I'll be dreaming every night of you
You've got to let it go
This time it's not personal
Can you feel my love
For the right hand takes what it can,
Here I am still stumbling down a darkened street
You're gonna say you love me too, oh
There's no time to think 'bout the starting or the end
Weatherwise it's such a lovely day
A little better all the time It can't get no worse
Where's the right in all of our fighting
And one day we'll get nostalgic for disaster
The spirit, the carpenter
I was biding my time
Time for me to look at you
Cause a scene
For my emotional stunts
Who crippled birch mares now briars replace their old cotton limbs
What a wonderful world
Then again I'm always sad
But I gotta know
You might say
But that's okay
Tonight, to the stars
Anyone I find intrusive
Oh, whatcha want, whatcha need, whatcha come here for
Gonna try, try, try 'til the morning
The view from here is getting better with you by my side
Barcelona  How can I forget
We will buy a ship and fly
Well I watched as my weeks bleed right into them
Baptize your tears and dry your eyes, oh
You are a book for me to read
But it feels okay
Love is all you need Yahoo
Just leave alone the Geminis
I'll spread my wings and fly
You can't spend the night
Too late to think about it anyway
All our insides in, and that's when we'll explode
I kept a bottle by the foot of the bed
You won't come back
I've always put my cards upon the table
We only danced for a minute or two
Well, if I did, you made me
Somewhere it's not dark, dark, dark, dark
Come on, come out of the rain
And for some reason I think that I attributed this story
Finally held up her fists, said "I'm done being coy"
Floating up into the sky
With someone who loves me too
I'm watching all the clouds drift by below me
When all our friends were there
And I would have called you
It's pointing at nothing
I will not hold it in
I'll say nothing on your microphone
And do you ever feel things here aren't right
Dancin' the night away it's like the party never ends
And all the life about to go is in my mind,
If I lay my head down on you
Our lips blue from cotton candy
Whatever don't break me amake me stronger 
A feather in the sunshine
With the one that you want
You got it, you're wow wow wow wow
As the best time ever
The first thing I remember when you came into my life
To Going Against The Grain
Like driving a padiddle with a burntout fuse 
Now the house is empty and my folks are gone
I'm looking forward to this life I live
Yeah, no one will ever notice if I keep my mouth shut tight tight tight
I guess you think it's funny now,
There's too much sky, not enough blue 
I had a lot to say
You won't be stopping
This world is of no empty part
Now I'm feeling left so dead
Away above the chimney tops
Pay the monkey back
I'd rather hit it road hard than go hustle a check
She's a rock 'n' roll survivor with pendulum hips
I said "So here we are now and I can't stop from crying Lilly"
But the river is wide
They all got a sales pitch I ain't buyin' 
You've got it all, you've got it all, you've got it all
But soon they released me 'cause the cops were sad
You've got to lose control most every night
Extend contractual period
'Cause a real woman
I feel good
Is one long sleepless night
Work is over but I can't stay to work late
Tell me, how does it feel in my arms
One fine day one fine day we'll run away
Where them suckas get it at and hustlers keep them chickens at
I feel alive
But now they've brought you away from me
Well I'm not braggin' babe, so don't put me down
Please don't despair my dear mon frère
From I and I to everyone
So he waits behind 
You'd better dig and take a look inside yourself
Well I don't know what I am looking for
And strange how clouds that look like mountains
And being by your side is the only thing on my mind So
Know that I will always run to greet you
'Cause I'm on top of the world, 'ay
I caught them barking at the moon
Awake to take in the view
I'll do everything I can
Let's just pray for our fates and then give it a rest
I never felt so much life
But I'm looking for hills to roll, 
Tiny breaks for every day
And if you say the word
Then me gotta be waitn' till the day turns to night
Oh but baby you can turn it round
Is this the way to get us back
You look down on me, but you don't look down on me at all
Heard of milk great things, speaking soft and thick
Stop climaxing, you got your fight
And don't sit crying over good times you had
Sunday morning rain is falling, and I'm calling out to you
And Molly says this as she takes him by the hand
Under the moon and with the girl that's in your place
See I notice nothing makes you shatter, no, no
Lloyd still got them polaroids
It's a perfect place above full of everlasting love
Since I made you smile
Moving forward through the flaming doors
And the angels hung around
'Cause we're way too wiseassed for that
I'll let them fight it out
All bananas make a split so do many more
Because you cannot know yourself or what you'd really do 
And let's mood the lights and finally make it right
Until I'm just knocked right off of my feet
We don't notice any time pass
You can't stop it
Once holy, now lonely
But anyway
I choose to lose my skin in the dirt
I've never met a girl that likes to drink with horses, knows her Chinese ballet
In a late basement seance that brought us to tears
Round and round your loving winds me up
Hey can we go by walking
Who says those bastards don't deserve to pay 
I can't change the world
Always and forevermore
You sat in the sun on a hot afternoon
And we walked out of the castle
But now since I see you in his arms
I'm here to show everybody the light 
It's our world, girl
Yeah, clap your hands Are you up to something
"'Cause people are just people
Ping pong ping pong ping pong ping panana phone
But they only play for money, you better not run 
Its gone with the wind
She says how she's so much better than you,
They've a million ways to kill you
I gotta get someone to call my lover
A hand over the window
Go baby, go go, oh we're right behind you,
Some days I feel like crying
Yeah yeah Mmm
Is that what you'd want to view
But forever seems so far away
You came to rain a flood
Now I count the hours until you wake
That surrounds us and we get stuck between the places I messed up
Back in the pub the governor stops the clock
So don't you tell me that you 'just don't get it'
It may only be a wish away 
Why won't you wrap your life around
And it's the shakeup
Oh, I just never smiled, but you have a glow, a glow from an inner sense I'll never know
It looks like the end of history as we know
I'm going home alone
Fix your mask, girl
Messes with your mind
Well I've been making some cold calculations regarding our body heat
All together now
To the rhythm of a steel drum band
That'd be spent in sweet content, just dreaming away
Through silver clouds,
Is all I need
Everyone loves you
Hey, Alabama, Mississippi, come and ride wit' a G
I never ever stop wondering, wondering if you still think of us
And it's sunny in the park
Sometimes you hear me when others they can't hear me, Hallelujah
I was on the wagon, I thought I was done
In my imagination
One day when I'm gone adieu and so long
I'm weak and you are my medicine
Don't try and tell me you've been looking at me
Until I've gone bitter on every word that you've spoken
I say soda
But I might move in" and
It's gone on too long, tell you how it ends
From coast to coast I got them things
So I will say,
I'm a racing car passing by
You're lookin' at me
You don't need tricks
Perfect system I am fallin'
People in love get scared and stupid
We could drift all night until the new sun rise
I got my sex
And I'm going straight to hell
Are also on the faces of people passing by
There is no end to what I'm saying
To take your girl and spend a bit of your cash for me
Draper Street caught me believin'
In the back of my head
I am my voice
You're only unique until compared
And to the moon's delight,
We're not talking like we used to
Oh no, oh no, you've got it all wrong
That should turn into something
Looked at my insides clicking
Sometimes you got to fight
Rock my world until the sunlight
Potions, lotion, perfume to find you
So I'm turning, turning a deaf ear,
'Cause it's what we needed to have a good time
Brickbrack, if you don't wind me up,
I want to be a lilikoi boy  You
Faster you're done
Listen closely to the words I say
Oh, a heart that functions at all
Since I left you I found the world so new
Tasting like postage stamps
A friend who was a foe
'Cause now he's telling me I'm the girl that he likes most
Oh, baby, I love your face Baby, I love your face
His inability to hold an erection on high holy days
Leute fragen mich, ob soviel Swag eigentlich weh tut
Two sips from the cup of human kindness
Kiss me down by the broken treehouse
There's so much I wanna say
You know me number
You know my girl get the keys with the em's on it
Hair grows even after you're dead"
Oh what a lovely time 
'Cause I know you're the only one
Grab your booty and you're on the run
And we find a country home
Bucket seats have all got to go
We waste away the days with nicotine and television samples
You always thought she had a chance and it was somewhere hidden
She had to press her nose on the refectory wall
A cros comes down from the top left hand
We'll break seeds, we'll grow
A lotta guys try to catch her
You've been a teenage runaway
Nothing's on the television, on the networks
But she'll always be his girl
Your heart is just as long as mine
"But it's not the same," you say
Shake it shake it
And hope that my dreams will come true
I kiss you on the brain in the shadow of a train
I know you're workin' for the CIA
'Cause all you really need are a few good friends
I know a place where it's warm and it's dry, dear
I love the way you soften my life with your love
Yes, but I, I'm a boy
Honestly, all the weather storms I bring
Yeah, I've got nothing at all
Where fire and ice collide
Never really knowing it was always mesh and lace
You can work this out if you both try
You kissed me on the forehead, now this kiss is giving me a concussion
Can I get a little Goose in my OJ
What you gonna do when she turns around
True love never has to hide
Easy girl
How could you ever let go
Well, it makes me happy to see you walkin' 
Look out, Sunshine, here's the punchline 
Time to take a chance here
And years of resentment
And it ain't nobody's business
Stomach sick, dizzy head
Butterfly, baby I still have my doubts about you cause
Who's around when you're losing your mind
And episodes left out to make it all go our way
Some people ride a cat for riding a cat's sake
Got my blood pumping
Hey, remember that other time when you OD'ed
Can you recognize my thoughts
Spilt their eyes on
And there's no one there to comfort you
Bright
And we can dance
I sing along when I hear it on the radio now
About  years from now
I found the cause
Nico, come back home
It starts in my soul
The way we might on movie night
Yo tengo pila y loco haciendo cola
Just as soon as I'm on top of my life, there you are again
You're lookin' at me positivity
You see, it's easy when I'm stomping on a beat
You're coming around
Though I did release you
Instead of singalong, this song is monotone
Come and stroke the air
Nothing to fear, nothing to hide
I guess I'm not coming back
Shut up and forget it
Oh yeah Well
They will always hold in the sea
It lets me know just where I've been
I would rather stand if you stay
I keep a rabbit's tail
You'd think the world was ending
He taught me how to watch, fight and pray
Yeah something
Got my eyes on the controls
And still be friends, still be friends
They don't bark and they don't bite
And when we come yeah we sure do shine
A few pairs of socks and a door with a lock
Through the park and by the tree
Come on sweet catastrophe
Pay back the chicken back,
But did I know what I was talking about
And after having spent the day together
It's the truth we all been wrong
While the rubbernecks all get their fill
I'm so aware of everything, but nothing seems for real
Light up the sky with your prayers of gladness and rejoice for the darkness is gone
Yeah, premonitions smiling in the dark
I'll clear your doubts away
Yeah, we're alright though We're alright though
To take a second look
She's a little pilot in my mind
Like walking the world
I'm a little ashamed for asking
It all began with a god named Thor
Come go with me, we've got it made ooh Baby, c'mon, yeah
And besides it is gone
Maybe I'll fly
And go all the way up to heaven
I've got a cure for your crimes
And just enjoy the show
I'm so embarrassed for mankind
So infact, real fast, we wrote this song
Here's a little heart for you
Much too dumb for school and much too lazy for a job
Oh, I keep feeling older
You're just another song and dance"
Oh, it seems like she can be anything
It becomes a progression I won't let regret manifest
Your boyfriend is mad
I love myself
If you dig her recent work
Beneath the seven different reasons for satellites,
Nothing to believe in
And when they flashed your picture cross the screen
I have been lonely
I can see the day unfold in front of me
Stomp your feet and clap your hands
We're lost behind enemy lines
Remember when it rained all day
Before you came around
The road is long and winding like a good mystery unfolding
For some time I went to school
To bend and to breathe on
And I ain't need nothing else,
I'll work on the limbs if
I don't believe what they say
Been practiced for millions of years
No no no baby music cannot last
Sometimes you're quiet and sometimes I'm quiet, Hallelujah
I can't feel it right now
We lied in so many words
But I don't care
But you don't stop, you keep climbing
Then the cameras click then we are stars
Finna run into a building, lay my body in the street
Now I messed up it's not the first time
We can bring it on the floor
The secret on your lips
You can trust I've never felt it like I feel it now
Where they speak no word of truth
Every one is
I don't mind
I've forgotten what to do
Oh darkness can be difficult like needles in the hay
This is our song now
Come out where you are
The words from you ring on and on
Hot day, midJune
So heads down, thumbs up
Of the whole ghetto, the bootstomped meadows, but we ignore that yeah
And I had tangles in my hair
Even music music music will not last
Runnin' round in circles all day long
I'm just a teenage dirtbag, baby, like you, ooh"
And I'm wastin' everyday
Big strong tower, yeah
Please say you'll never leave me
But I still need so much
And I needed his help
I kept on falling short of something
Walk away
You'll get your money, you'll get your night
Underground, Underground
Day turns to night
To hold us back
We sat there looking at the faces
I waited all winter
But things just get so crazy, living life gets hard to do 
And then you say you'd rahter see me dead
Yeah all we need so here we go
'Cause the ASBO generation make this a terror nation full of loathing and fear
Hungry humans
Do I slowly get erased
Headless guru in the night show me what you mean
Ensured that we wouldn't sleep for long
To seek my fortune Nanna thank you for this mob
Come on, come on, and the world's a little brighter
Just to get a little closer to you
Well, it's all right, as long as you got somewhere to lay
You're sensitive to light
Walking down a sunny street to the library
Martha, my dear
Walk on the water with a friend
For we are all breathless without you
And not to those who'd plan out his life
Keep the nightlight on inside the birdhouse in your soul
It's all right, oh it's all right
Reign of love
She got wonderful eyes and a risque mouth
The clock up on the wall was tickin'
There's nothing to say that hasn't been heard
And everything you don't baby
It's a bright June afternoon, it never gets dark
Now I've been hangin' around you for days
And the way they move and the way move and the way move their hands
And touch my inner smile
With your lover
Been a long time coming for the working man
I try so many times
Dip it in a dream
Maryanne, do you remember
Hey baby
I'll share this love I find with everyone
Let you go, baby
Let's count the days until winter comes our way
You're all about to lie down for your cause
And that's got to be, because I never even think of making it
I don't need no reason,
She was in her mindset
There's no stopping me
Uh did you see me falling
I can feel a change of fortune
So many reasons to be happy
Payback the piggy
'Cause we takin' these motherfuckers back to school
Just yell out my name baby
Here is heaven and earth and the brilliant sky inbetween
And let me live again
Says he's got a fast boat, but it's just a fairy boat it ain't to faster than a goldfish
From when her hair was sweet blonde till the day it turned gray
She said you're like a disease without any cure
I've got your photograph
I can't get enough
But in every way you know I just want you to say
The place is really jumping to the highwatt amps
My laughing boyfriend
When you on the corners, there's too much drama 
It's so hard to look away
And my heads up in the clouds
And a breath is a melody
To be stranded, drifting all alone
Just to keep you around 
I may see you, I may tell you to run On my way, on my way
I'm a lie for my dunn, take it in blood
Hold me secure in flight
It's all about the wordplay
Why on Earth are you there
Is it OK if I speak to you today
If you were the wood, I'd be the fire
It took a car crash to turn it around,
The chorus girls in neon were his closest things to friends
And I've got a plan, we walk out the door
For you, there's not any warning
Stare into the sun, stare into the sun
Yesterday it rained in Tennessee
Left his house at midnight
And heavy rains descend
I can't look at the rocket launch
You didn't stop to make me feel better
Wait for me, wait for me, wait for me
You make the call to make my day
I just can't get enough of you
But Fly Ty didn't have the contract we wanted
Here we are on a perfect night
I've been hurting again, a cold black diamond
You'll let me be your man
I reached out tried to love but I feel nothing
Somebody shows me how
Thought I was sleeping, it was just a dream
Fall off the deep end
Making you feel like there's gonna be a war
Happy ending's gone forever more
There's no stopping us
And the angels are fake
But when the sun comes out 
Complete your name in accents I can't place
If I knew hate, I'd call it love for you, man
Too late for you to say
Now I'm watching wrestling
And I've trained myself to give up on the past
Furthest away from any condition
Baby let's blast off
Streets filled with people
Yo, bitch
And you are not alone
You'd think the world is ending
Staring at the stars on your ceiling
Don't blow me, baby
Heavenly, that's what you are
I died and was reborn again today
While my father was slaving, my mother explained it
Yeah, girl just tell me what I want to hear
Nobody told you
Here's the brand new me
I climbed up your front porch
He woke up at nights, he thought he was twice, he was moving away
Now it's day, I've been trying to get that taste off my tongue
Our carpet falls on a dewfresh daffil plain
Just me in a room sunk down in a house in a town
O my dear you're a threat to the bad in us all
So I called up danger, my friends and some strangers
Sometimes even the right is wrong
Carry me through the night
Sometimes I want to disappear
There my life was bound and tethered on a porch by the shore 
Mott's in the corner of the room 
The sooner you leave the sooner you're home
And we're flying
And beyond that is anybody's guess
Do you hear me say now
Their sentiment is just as hard to pluck from the vine
Oh and this year's for the brakemen
And I give my money to the bank for safe keeping
I look at the sky
Dear I forgot your name again
I cccan't control the feet
I speak a different language but I still hear your call
Do you need anybody
Monday, I'm all high
Soon before you die
Monday's gone
But I can feel, I can feel, I can feel it's beginning to end
What a time of right and reason
And there'll be sun sun sun all over our faces
Although I'm faded as a ghost
And parallel tracks of our tears
In my lungs, in my lungs, in my lungs, in my lungs
And now together we're alone
'Cause she didn't have time
And From what I've heard with skin you'll win
Now I've got to ask you one more thing
She spins and she sways to whatever song plays
Stayed out those tunnels that pull people down
Everything must belong somewhere
And I still buy two pairs of everything
And I remember the time my balance was fine
Oh, awake, my lady on the water, share my bread and share my drink
To ease every fear
And the eagle flies with the dove
When the fellas, talk to my girl I ain't with it
Now I'm letting silence do the walking
And I was on a lot of shit too, but what I saw, man, I tell you, was
Waiting for the end
I've found the cure for a broken heart
I miss you and it don't feel right
San Onofre and Sunset Inside, outside, USA
We like our fun and we never fight
Now the heart you hold is somebody else's, baby
They swallowed it whole, they went for the gold for the gold
So wipe the tears from your eyes
That I would be the one to fall
And when I get off at Tennebrook Farm
Gives a feeling from your bottled little part
Even though your skies are blue
Maybe I should learn to shut my mouth
Check it out, I'm rocking steady to the beat in my head
When I consider what you put up with I'm amazed you still have skin
Those teenage hopes who have tears in their eyes
'Cause the best luck I had was you
Alive tonight
Close your eyes and I'll kiss you
The bottoms of barrels, let us be free
The dressing rooms are grey
'Cause most kids give me credit for being down with it
We go on every dream in my, in my city, eh eh eh
So you tell me that there's nothing left to say
I've got style
And no matter where you go
I love you always know the way,
And she's strung out on soda
I feel so happy these days
Mr Pleasant's okay
And later on, when it's gone,
And a full beard with no warning
I'm gonna make it mine
Don't point that thing at me
Blind to the evils you give them no sight
I'm a racing car passing by like Lady Godiva
Who finds the money
This modern romance
We could drive your car through the east end streets to the city
So tell me nothing matters less or more
I haven't slept a single night in over a month
Me and the ocean, me and the sea
You're on my mind, all the time We are not wasting this
Don't you give me them blues
Hier ist man nach Tagen erst zum ersten Schritt bereit
I will not call you back
I says the comedy is that it's serious
A cottage in the country built with real wood beams
But I guess that's the way that things go
Don't you know your heart's in danger
But your love, would not care for my love
Yeah you give me exactly what I need
Twisting its secret course all through the city's heart 
So you send So you send
It's the best of world's feeling, like nothing can go wrong
You better get yourself together
I see the fur ground
And all I need is to be struck by your electric love
You bought a new bag of pot, said let's make a new start
I saw you in the corner of my eye on the sidelines
I want the sea all lined up into me
You could lose faith in music,
I might get hurt
"How you been and what's been new with you lately"
You could eat off the floor,
Meant for someone else but not for me
As you sit down to pray into the river I will wade
Leave the homeless man out in that cardboard cell
She's giving me looks, I can't help it
II, I wanna be the pear tree
'Cause I'm a huskin' a huskin' a huskin' your corn
A little sunshine
I've got the cure for you
I have walked this earth and watched people
Gum drops Anything you want
A king who's still in the news
And in the pockets of the tide, a meeting place by night
Express yourself, come on,
One of those was someone who knew you
All those wasted days
Stayed all summer then went back home
Fall falling falling again
To see the stars and heaven's journey flashing 'cross the sky
To feel the shadow and cry
You're so hot get me into the shade
I take a driving pill and head to my car
The horses are coming
But I can see it in your eyes
What have you become
How does it feel in my arms 
Then show me right where your heart is
I feel happy inside when I see your face
And you say
The night is coming out of the dark
Oh my crush, I've gotta crush
Can't say it's been there once and for all
My shattered mind across the borderline
I was the boss of you and I loved you
Wreck all the things that I know
But this place is getting crowded and my house is two blocks away
Have you no name
We're all tired and ready to breathe
If you have a hard time getting there
I said God I love some people sometimes
Things aren't always just what they seem
I help you up to brush your teeth and then I kiss your stomach
I'm gonna have a party
So many people that I know, they're just tryna touch ya
Right, left, right, c'mon
And he woke me up again to say
Do what you want, there is no need to impress us
She wants everyone to sit around, talk about her life
Misunderstood
The speed slow me down but I'm still smartest in my class, boy
And would you make sure my mother gets half my weight in gold
A little wiser now from what you showed me
How can you be ready for life
And if I get caught
She likes you Wednesday, but now it's Friday
Curses to this mirage, a bottle of ancient Shiraz
Rollin' on, strollin' on
Come on there's a big day such a big day
Father, I will always bealways be
And bend their heads all adown
It just makes much more sense with my hand in your hand
Oh this life is so confusing
Yesterday's not quite the same let's make it plain
So I pulled up to the red light, sittin' here in my car
It's the way I see
I've had the deepest rivers
Reminds me of something else
When you're passing on your way
And if I lived in Greeceland, they'd still be Chinese children
So it's over before beginning the good part
So wouldn't you like to come with me
It's everything
Feel the rain on your skin
Won't let you get in dans ma vie
On sugar maple wings
All the colorful days my friend
You'll be going to bed soon
Riding out with my friends in a Mercedes Benz
Hey, soul sister, ain't that Mr Mister on the radio, stereo
Party like, like it's the end of the world
Everybody's gone surfin'
Well you can keep on laughing behind my back
Happy unites and feelings take flight
And stay awhile
Hey, now, you're a rock star
Things that we did
She was tired of fighting and feeling frustrated
I'm never gonna look back, whoa
Whoa yeah, well, well, well you Ooh, ooh, ooh ooh ooh
And now you're kicking me out again
Oh, yeah in your bag
Now the plain blondes are playing along with you
But you, you have a mind full of wonderment I'll never find 'cause I was never young
And since you are my friend
Let's meet in Kristiana next summer
Covers and covers and covers in colours
The sun's got my pride
Don't fix my smile, life is long enough
With rap dudes, thinking wow she moved me
Tropical drink melting in your hand
Get like me, get on the dance floor
Then live the rest of our life
Christ, I'm out of my mind
It's getting boring
And Sara told the friendly salesman that
The moon was shinin', on the lake that night
If you've got a special interest
Leave the dead starlet on her pedestal
Ooh oh oh yeah
This house is falling apart
I shook 'em up, the walls came crumbling
Are you the one to be blamed
Spinning around, trying not to look down 
Yeah, can't forget about me, stupid
Separated from the rest
No ates el flotador
Declare myself of faith
Strings on my fathers old guitar
So you'll always know
But youth�s taken over by rock and roll
So what do you need, what do you need, what do you need
Sometimes there's bullshit that don't work now
Love's talking to me
Brought me back to thinking you were mine, all those times
Ya estoy decidida
You don't need no Hallows Eve
Right on the foyer, on this dark day, right in plain view Oh yeah
So from my personal point of view
Honestly
I'm all dressed up in your words today
That's why I'm standing here today
Baby, not a day goes by that I'm not into you
Standing there with your smile blinding your eyes from seeing
Erase what's on your mind
C'mon there you are
Go to sleep, it's just another day
If we've only got this life
Somewhere in the back of my mind
Written in the air
Cloak of night unravelling
If your friends like a certain you, that's who you've got to be
Lost in a silent ballet silent ballet
I got you on
Let's dance to Joy Division
When the world was young
And I can't sleep
And when you got no time
But you're all out of tune
But you only want what everybody else says you should want
What fills up this space in your life 
To keep this boat afloat, there are things you can't afford to know
Lay back down I told myself
Just feel the power put your hands in the air, hey
We used to climb but no one tries to go up that far now yeah
I won't stop till I am under your skin
You look away, you're speaking with your back turned
The deal between the legs of mankind
My joy will be complete
Whenever you're around
Some things in life are undeniable
Cause there's someone behind every hand that you've made a connection
Reflect what is around my pool
I swear I love you
And I know this place like the back of my hands
My dreams will match up with my pay
Scatterlings and orphanages
Bbbbbbbbandits
Us to be together
Many dead, tonight it could be you
It's fearless
Nothing inside
Yeah let's dance, c'mon and dance
And in the jazz of squalls and impassioned brawls she danced
Hey Hey don't pay no mind,
Now her dogs are alone and there's no one to watch her TV
'Cause we'll never know unless we try it someday
Is it true what they say  You can't behave
You're still the one
Oh you will run
I'll just do this one more time
So I tried a little Freddie
And your love is so pure and so clean
Cell phones clenched along
Lookin' at the sky Wonderin' if there's clouds and stuff in hell
And the only word is love 
Shake it like a Polaroid picture
Money's got no hold on me
But she can't be what you need if she's ,
Well I shouldn't sleep all day
I can't forget all the things we did
Now I'm asleep in a car
Yeah, I feel so down
Her mind and bring me back to her place
I wanna go there and never come back home, yeah
Opinions were like kittens, I was giving 'em away
You're a mystery
President Bush doing takeover
Oh, someone warm like you
I'm in the mood to take a chance
Slip and slide on subway grates
Every man has been broken
Come on and show that energy
We're so burnt out; we're a shell now
Set on you I got my mind on you
Picture a scene in your mind
There's gonna come a time when she's gonna have to go
I almost wrote a song about you today
Is now it's getting so much clearer
And you say, and you say
She's in love with me and I feel fine
Shining down on your face
This is the last night of the fair
Fall through like change in the daylight
By three we are thinking of the love we lost
Why does it always happen
Cattle in the marketplace
Fill your heart with love today   
Headfirst the motor runs, the motor must run
You're so alone today
You're such a pretty, pretty, pretty little girl
A backseat sofa in the dark
That I wouldn't be without you babe
Because you know that I will
So we'll just get it with no Edison
And everything you did to help advance at this
'Cause it's one thing to remember
But fairness she don't see
Our hopes become a starting pistol
I ain't got cash
Watch it go and let the damage run
With two cracks along both sides
River, river, river, river
So it's really me I want you to count the ways you can make it up to me
Tonight we'll dance
Yes, the Candy Man can 'cause he mixes it with love
When I worry about smoke 'stead of putting out the fire
I'm already out of foolproof ideas
But first thing in the morning I'd still wake up and I'd hear them say
But look at me shuffling through the stack until I finally find
Close your eyes, close your ears young man
I don't care what the whisperers say
Her bone structures screams I want someone
Here comes the sun again
And the sun will come to shine on you again
The Candy Man makes everything he bakes
Ways of calculating, ways of catapulting you and me
Lying like a flower with no more time
In love with the electric sound
And holding back our tears
Thanks for the time of my life
I'm gonna pack up my troubles in my old kitbag, I'm gonna run a mile from here
You keep on saying the past is not even past you keep saying
Come fly with me, let's float down to Peru
It will keep you up all night
Swore upon the stars I'd keep you till the night was day
Some feelings never seem to let go 
When your tyres are flat
Some people get up at the break of day
Let's get happy
And then Cathy showed up and we hung out
I've landed
It's a new world, It's a new start
So stand Stand
Who You baby, you Baby, yeah
I'm leaving this time
Happy boys and happy girls, we'll be
The last three years of wondering what I should do
Just to pass the time
And maybe, if the music is right
Her CD changer's full of singers that are mad at their dad
I had a dream we were running from some blazing arrows yesterday
Go baby, go go, yeah we're looking at you,
I don't care 'cause I'm by myself
I only wanna go where my wheels roll
All the bitterness has passed
And lead you through the dance floor
Jump in the line, rock your body in time OK, I believe you
Well I'd like to spread your perfume around the old apartment
That the devil is walking around
Dye my eyes and call me pretty
When I stand
Into a room where it's nine in the afternoon
I could be handy mending a fuse
Comes a time when a man loses his mind
Whoo~ ooh~
Spit gutter on a Premo beat, for the love of the street
Are coming around again
Today we show our flaws
Heartache, heartbreak, all over town
Watch the fingers of my hands,
With a starry brush
So ignore the bad and know the good is to come
And I think about how long it will take them to blow us away
And cut out a door
If that's the way it is
She's a frozen fire
Ain't nobody gonna replace it
You are the anchor that holds me
My heart's aflame, I'll love you till Tuesday
Give it all you've got
I just can't sit back and watch you waste your life away
Then that's just something that makes me more attracted to you You
You say I don't want to pray no
I throw my fear around
Wouldn't want to change a thing
Ain't a story without it
On everybody's stereo
It's "Charles" and you are shit outta luck
The unavoidable kiss, with a minty fresh deathbreath 
Whatever gets you through your life, it's alright, it's alright
Be back again
I was very lonely till I met you on Sunday
And Houston, we've got a problem
No I never made the time
I once used to be your girl
For everything that you give me
Well, open up your mind and see like me
You'd go way back when
I'm a band in a show about a boy being buried alive
With good friendly homes
I cannot fall in love
Is coming back to take me home
Since I heard from that girl of mine
And that's all there is to say
We tripped on the urge to feel alive
The rhythm hit, it got my movement off the ground
He drives her round the bend
Happy birthday to you
Icy Cola Coca, Sprite I love the mosta
It's eating you down to the bone
You cannot find a friend Friend
Hold me secure in flight I fall asleep in hospital parking lots
Trete hinein, du bist herzlich willkommen
Tell you if you've got food on you're face
But giving up just makes no sense
Playing dead was just no fun
It's the bough we break to blow
So please try to understand that if I could, I'd call and I would be there
I could stand to do without
Ooh, I'll be the one who'll break my heart
Hey I keep my head down but I keep on swingin'
It's pumping blood
On the old left bank, my baby in a charàbanc
Well, I just saw the sun rise over the hill
Ain't got no love, ain't got no name
That could rock your world
Held together, holding each other with no one else in mind
Just enjoy the show
I hear it call in the center of it all
If you were a river in the mountains tall,
A man walks out of his apartment
I'm gonna be the man who's growing old with you
And looking so mysterious honey
And they all go wild, but they walk instead
Inevitably, well it still exists, pale and fine
Spilling out across your room
I see a happy ending if I stand up tall
Crying's not for me, 'cause,
'Cause you're my only friend
I'll steal your honey like I stole your bike
'Cause I'm tryin' to get to Providence I lost my way
Now, I don't want you back for the weekend, not back for a day, no, no, no
Now that you know who you are
My problems fell out of the back of my mind
The girl with the curls and the sweet pink ribbon in her hair
They lock the devil in the basement, threw God up into the air
Weeping in a tropical moonlit night
Forget the things you've left behind
Ticktock, this clockwork will stop, 
To the place where I fell asleep inside you
A king to sing you the blues
I just want to get 'em wrong
We live this life 
When there's nothing in her bed at night
I love cheap thrills
Something's been going on and I don't know what it is
Now that the dreams are all coming true
Don't look back to that messedup scene
'Cause now I feel it all
Wake up by myself inside an empty room
Change is on the cards, but this time it will be hard
We get farther away in the blink of an eye
And the whole wide world is whistling
So they left the place for another school
Ah, la, la, la, life goes full circle
My mind is set, I walk the line
Goddamn, I'm glad that I survived
It's gonna be a beautiful day
Met in the Prelude Park at midnight
Try not to worry 'bout a thing
To find the place you can breathe
Always have to steal my kisses from you
They ride in your suit
That it's okay now
Far and wide, sweet and simple Jehovah knows that I've been sinful
That you wind up next to me
And I can't control it, I can't hold it, it's so nuts
Well, it terrifies the life from out of me
This means you really love me
The song about the river
From Jamaica to the world
Jump in the line, rock your body in time Up the chimney
And he'd simply kick my ass if he knew the truth
And wear these lucky socks until they fade away
I wanted to be everything for you
I can't get enough of you
It's gonna be all right ah huh yeah
That's the way to live
The bright lights might say your name
They say I'm all about the wordplay
We've got things to say
That the morning star of a prince
Your footsteps in the leaves
Everyday would be a holiday from real
You're only good when you're on your back
Keep on money makin'
Through the valley of fear
You make things all right when I'm feeling blue
Angels "do you really think she will wait for you"
I wonder, wonder which one of us
I'll stay here with my beer and fish and chips till it gets dark
Another day is done,
Bandages, bandages, bandages
I like the way you laugh when I tell a joke
Every time her temper flares
Another love note no one got
Some chimps who love cats
This whole life is just overrated now
An attic in a basement
Then we could be heroes just for one day
Turned on let's go
Many years since I was here
I woke him up, broke the news, after everything was sewn
I was not looking for arty farty love
As I take your hand
In fact nothing really mattered at all
Singing when you feel alone
All kinds of names
You take in everything with a certainty I envy
Woke up on the floor
Baby look what you've done, done
Because nobody's told her 'bout you
Trifling the slack, no head gating
And no, she don't know what we do in our spare time
Perpetual feeling in the grown up world that's all 
And I won't sit back and take this anymore
I've carried more than I can
Knowing things I know I cannot be, not now
You know that there are
And it should be where it ends,
I go on too many dates hehheh
Dated some stars but respect their privacy
I said "Nothing is gonna be alright, but thank you anyway"
You oughta know, that I'm here no matter where you go
We're spending what we haven't made
I know you're looking for salvation in the secular age,
Oh you can be your own god if you want to
Maybe I don't know how to treat you right
And to your favorite song
A teenage vow in a parking lot, till tonight do us part
God damn you movie star, can't you just play a minute more
Cause you never told me your name
She's perfect as she seems, lifts me right out the mezzanine
All the colors of the street signs 
Well, baby, I surrender to the strawberry ice cream
Voy sonriendo junto a ti somos dos 
If you touch me you could never go back
And when you notice that your mind is fleeting
What part of no
This has become a weakness
There you are, see, it's the end of the film
We'll get down, to pass the time
Give away a few Mercedes like, "Here lady, have this"
Memphis, ride wit' a G, Chicago, ride wit' a G
The angels in heaven look down where he lay
And then you're kicking me out again
However much I loved you, you will always love me more
If you still don't know the way we roll
Will the whole world be warm as this
What you're here for, I don't need it
Hey, it's the right feeling
There is not enough love to offer
From all the shit the one I gotta buy is music
We can dance if we want to
And I'll put my hands over your eyes, but you'll peep through
If you need a little money keep working alright
Look at the beat
How did it drown our love
Everything was ready but he had to run away
And I will wrap my arms around you
Who cares that it makes showers since you broke my heart
Oh darlin', I was blind to let you go
I've come alone
And an eerieness surrounded
But I feel much better
What have you become
So come one, come all, and see the show tonight
You oughta know that I'm here no matter where you go
I feel it all, I feel it all
We've got all your life and mine
You showed me a sunset overflowing
It takes a toll to make you care
How's your father, how's your mother 
And I act like a child and I'm insecure
I know your eyes are just for me but
Who can take a sunrise
Nothing ever mattered to me more than this
I try to do what is right,
Have you landed yet and, if so, would you let me know
I recall only nights that we built
And if you are the ghost of Christmas past
And it's a long way up when you hit the ground
Here they come
The city is a million miles away
I'm around when your head is heavy
Are more than I can let by
They are turning my head out
I just want your kiss 
But I was up in the velvet goldmine
From now on wear my love for you loose
Oh, California in the summer
In your place
Should they catch us, and dispatch us to those separate work camps
Pick up the phone  listen to me moan
Sun rising, still asleep
And we'll have fun fun fun now that daddy took the TBird away
Clap your hands y'all it's alright
And I'm giggling again for no reason
You've got it, you've got it
Oohoohooh Hello hello
'Cause I always have to steal my kisses from you
And I take the world
'Cause I can shine my light on
We're on to something good here, and we're gonna make it after all
Betty can't quit carving question marks in my wrist
I didn't like their schemes, I couldn't buy their rules
And their parents did
Can you tell me what was ever really special about me all this time
Try to show some class
Feel the cold air all around
And descend inside of you
And I can't help feeling something's wrong
Looking like the winter bird
Let alone you won't forget my name
I know we are prisoners
And the headiness howls
And you should follow through to make it alright
I said, when I arrived in my own set of clothes
You can see her ghost, but that's a lie, because the naughty woman isn't dead
We both need you here
He feels lucky to have you here
By the infinite parade of punk rock tshirts on
Nice day for a walk in the dark
Dark years brought endless rain
I was backstage in Pomona
And yes, your mind was wound so tightly
And I need you to help me blow my nose 
I'm feeling blue 'cause love is gone
My room is darker
We'll wake up your mothers, we'll start a commotion
Straight from a dreamy castle in the air
I threw away my reputation
It's so much fun out here
Outlining wet sidewalks in halogen
For a ride I'm escaping, you're escaping
I fell asleep on the passenger seat
In life, it ain't easy
And my ears are wearing head phones
If the world were to die, the light will guide you True love
There's no way
Keep your lips closed,
Just don't stop lets keep the beat pumpin'
And watch the sun rise
A clothespin hanging on the line
Everyday seems a little longer
Couldn't relax, couldn't sit back
But back to the matter at hand
It knows no time, it knows no bounds
These are the days you might fill with laughter until you break
And I'm wastin' everyday, hey, hey, hey
My name is Denver Max, I eat heart attacks
I'm not a , baby
Yeah, I'm sure you're right
You make me runaway,
Blow a kiss and change the world, yeah
Enjoy the moment
Who sings for women of great virtue
Just the way that we do
Don't make me play pretend
Please say she'll break,
Who You baby, you I'm talking about my baby yeah
And so does a table whose name is Ingo
Yeah got my stash
Oh whoa, whoa I don't wanna fight
Your beauty will last for a while
To go ahead and change your life
Safety pins holding up the things
With your ear to a seashell
Will come alive
Ooh ooh
Ooh, Tonight the stars are oh so bright
Then that girl sure is me
Windows down as the night blows in
Within the rocks hard and cold
The sun is getting dim
But I don't need to go to that spot
Put the windows down, scream in doubt, really tune it out
Yeah, oh yeah
Darling, if you only knew
Kate Moss in ads for mascara
I'm down on my knees
Too closely in the book
I can get a record player, and a generator
You see the boygirl's at the bar
Sweet love, secret love
I hate Spin magazine 'cause they never ever plug me
So what do you say hey hey
If anything should happen, I guess I wish you well
And I'm shitfaced
Just, please, please,
'Cause you can't put the life back into this hospital ward
Deer die with their eyes wide open, eyes wide open, eyes wide open
I'm turning turning turning turning turning around
Our lips can touch 
I call you
Maybe I, had too little love to realise
You give me wings to fly
Oh, Billy Brown needed a place, somewhere to go
'Cause I think you're too outta sight
We come running
And the tiny chefs they waved their giant knives
Well every hour I try to get somethin' done
It takes us back to a time when we didn't care, we didn't care
Payback the camel
I need love
Which way the wind blows
There are those who understand
And come morning
It just isn't the same on radio 
Time goes flying by 
And my thumbs inside your mouth
Shut up and dance with me"
'Cause I can't see through my tears anymore
Oh, I'm finally feeling the stitching of beautiful seams
Of your mouth and mind
Someday your secret will be revealed
Sooner or later
They left a strange impression in my head
Be it true, you ain't got nothin' to do
Let it echo in time just to get it
In and out somewhere else right now
We used to share the summers nights riding our stolen bikes
Protectors of this band  oh oh oh oh
And I can't stop
Have shattered its own pride
What if I can't see mine
I'm tired of the fork in the road 
Full of twists and turns
If my dreams get real bizarre
I get lost inside the sound
Looking out on Coney Island
I've barely been gone
But oh there comes a tide
And if we worked it out
And if you need me
Unless it eases your mind
I try to cross to the opposite side
It would come to this
Thank goodness for the good souls
Knew they were some millionaires, their ropes were dookie
Gathered around the quiet earth
Old dirt road Mushaboom, mushaboom
Somewhere backstage with Sean and Lars
Now it's your time to shine
If you're the bird whenever we pretend it's summer
You burn through my mind
And please, say to me
Pack up your troubles, get your old kit bag
And I know it's late, I know it's cold
Your baby blues would flash and suddenly a spell was cast
Now that half your life is over, if you're lucky
Out in the cold I lost my way
I'm going to get a treat from the ice cream man
I was frightened, but I held fast
I got something I think I really wanna do right now
Follow your heart
And true, you might get away with it
Come in knowing everything
And my body became so light
My head like a bumdum
Me, a family, a house, a family
I could tell she liked me from the way she stared way she stared
For you, ooh
Here it comes
And every page and every paper
And you could get back down, you could get back down,
Somebody came and took your bed
Boom, boom, boom
Sink a fortune
And when I give birth to our children
See you gettin' down till the break of dawn
I say only if it's better
Never had a battle with my bulletproof vest
To see your shoes and your spirits rise
Hey, remember that time when my favorite colors was
One step back you're leaving it, jumping at the wall
Ills, man
In my bed I watch TV I'm drunk by noon,
Kiss that girl and I will shrink up
I'll be there when close your eyes
We used to microwave
Spread the facts on the floor like a fan
What I care to see
Is there anything that I can do
From Falsterbo to Kiruna, from Göteborg to Djursholm
A reconstruction of where you've always been
Sleep all, we sleep all day, sleep all, we sleep all day over
Time to pick up a gun
Though I'd be drunk as I could be
We're gonna take your breath away
When I'm working, yes, I know I'm gonna be
It looks like we got what we wished
A picture with a past, a future so vast
Alright, lift me up woman your love keeps lifting me
And we talked a lot, 
'Cause you've got all my love, love, love
It's ok with me if you don't have that much to say 
I hold you in my heart
Everything you want is not free
Wigwam frightened of the dark
I'm getting restless looking at you
And you'll come running home
You just need to understand
Become a moving target,
And you can be anyone
We walk to school all by ourselves
I always think now when I'm with you
We have got to leave all that behind
Melted away like I was free
Let me feel you upside down, slide in, slide out
Or upsidedown
With the one that they abhor
We're running out
But then you're standing in my doorway 
In focus but at miles away
We could ride, we could ride
Just hold me together
I'm sure you don't remember me
You've been lonely, you don't even know me,
Pulling back the covers, her heart will start to shudder when she realizes how deep it all went
And as he speaks his last line, a thought falls from his mind, and I pick it up right through the TV
All over Manhattan Inside, outside, USA
One dance left; This world is gonna pull through
I play tough as nails with my heart on my sleeve
Don Quixote was a steeldriving man
Open your eyes
We are falling straight down, so turn us up
I'll get it on with you
So I'll just live on wine and water my vines
I've gone identity mad
Load the box and then pump that shit
Oh I need your love, I need your love,
Took apart his old life
I want to forget how conviction fits
An Alsatian barking for the stars to go
Just sit back and hold on, but hold on tight
Just for one day
The bottom of the bottle is my only friend
You set me free, baby
So sing while you still can
You can Scoop out my brain 
Can you feel it overloading
Way we get by
You'll be there remembering your old toy boy
You'll probably tell me everything you think, here it comes
Shake, shake, shake, Senora, shake your body line, whoa
Oh, short on money
But he's gotta have the qualities
Tell your boss that you've gone away
I'm just a little girl lost in the moment
Pick me up at three, send me off to sea
Will perform her famous lawn chairhandcuff
Laughing and a running, hey hey hey
I forget but I won't feel bad about it
I've a heart of gold in the smallest size
We can do it all, just don't let the music stop
Give me a cigarette
Ooh The morning's on it's way
Searching for the words to say
You see, well I'm feeling lucky 
Semiauto and Marlboros in the bottle, 'til I hit the lotto
I will send to you
And suddenly everything is right
Calling Doctor Jones
In fact there's nothing at all
Treblinka alive with glory of love yeah
Molly is the singer in a band
Take some time to realize
I need to freeze, I need direction, aww please
But I have, I just hate the band
Let them have their way with us
And drink our daydreams away
When the days are long
Now there's war, all the time,
And I feel so alive
'Cause I'm on my way now
Wheeling, dealing, joking things will change, girl
Mr Pleasant is kind 
My heart is beatin' like a jungle drum
Kelly says she could have
Thanks for everything
You gotta get rid of the more conservative habits of your mind Get rid of the mourning, you've got to have a real good time
And when you're down, girl, you got to know this
And I will wear a badge to show my delight
Yeah, he found a sixshooter gun
I'm spinning in circles I can't stop
Then you been high 'cause you got sad 
About the good things I found
Counts the waves that somehow didn't hit her
Looking like you're upside down
It grows in bunches, I've got my hunches,
With my cars keys hidden in the kitchen
And they're entwined between the night and sun beams
The breath is daffodil
We fell in fits across the floor
Grow ourselves new skin
Then show time and now they're making rock 'n' roll
Bursts are colour till I'm sick
You need a guardian
It's been done before
Hello, goodbye
I like the way that you turn the wheel
Bermuda, Bahama, come on pretty mama
So I'll be hanging by the phone,
A tape recording of the sound
I think I'll get a job receiving people's thunder
Already, we'll all float on alright
With only the wind whispering
High above the chimney tops, that's where you'll find me
So I can finally find out what I've been looking for
Remember you now you are gone
A higher, higher power
I feel like a sailboat
Oh, something
But the story is mine
Then again I couldn't have 'cause
But it's Chris that you kissed after school
Ghost in the world, ghost with no home
You'll be okay
I sit and think about the day that you're gonna die
Yeah, after all this time
I'm not doing it right
Leave the great indoors
Yeah, and I wish we could run to the sun
All the things I couldn't mend without escaping
I said something that I never intended to say
Was all that I needed
So long as they're around, 
And truly I don't think you'll find a happier man
They frightened the babies and you know they've got two
Inside they keep on
Tuesday, Wednesday, stay in bed
I take a hit of that chronic, it got me stuck
They be doin' the same thing y'all be doin'
You sit on the bed in the dark changing places
And the way you kiss keeps me hanging on
Little sips of the Hollywood bowl
But I don't want to fight
So say Geronimo
Why won't these bees leave me alone
You are a star I mean a starlet,
And if ever you find your love,
Sensitive heart, you're doomed from the start
Lay down your guns
It's it's just the trials and tribulations you go through in life
I shiver with the look you gave
If it wasn't for the good souls
Said that you couldn't stay and wait for me
Ah, and the postcard's gonna read
It's how I do but not everybody knows it
And I gave it to you in a paper bag
I wanna Kung Fu kick you in your Fourwheel drive
I knew I'd find you in a day or two
His heart is full of perfect joy
Tell me that you've got me and you're never gonna leave
Banana phone, ring ring ring
Such a lovely cup
Shook her head to see him snoring in his sleep
The house might burn down, and it's all my fault if that puddle doesn't get me wet
I like my beats fast
I think of life without pain
Who on Earth d'you think you are
Is still
This, this could be, the summer the summer of love
Ooh wee ooh, I look just like Buddy Holly
Our Treblinka is alive with the glory of love
Take what you need till your body is numb
We'll come dancing and we'll make you sweat
The fear inside the hills we've climbed
As I was walking 'round Grosvenor Square
Ooh baby, oh oh, oh oh
Baya jabula abasi thanda
Pass them forward with a foreword they won't mean a thing
Oh, oh when you say it
Should I tear up the letters signed signed from my black knight who thrills me
My neighbor told me that I got bad brains
I'm seein' stars, I'm seein' stars
Would you stand up and walk out on me
A slight figure of speech
'Cause I have lost my mouth organ
With a big black dog to bite your behind
Lots of fun for everyone
Do, yeah
I knew when you first said hello,
Good, good life
In the page of the Lord
There's no last thing now
The native has returned
Hey Annie, well look at you
And if you are a deity of any sort
Why we still runnin' in place frustrated
She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah
Where they'll do absolutely nothing 
Where's it gonna get you, acting serious
Unless I was holding Taiyeh chainRest In Peace
You can't cry 'cause you're laughing at me
It's been a long time, a very long time
Changing your name
I still think of you
Is that I love you so
Oh yeah, but things just get so crazy, living life gets hard to do
Well, you stood there with me in the doorway
To stop you falling
I remember the stupid things
Dark canyon road, I was coy in the halfmoon
Some phrases were shot, pretty roses got tossed
To warm  you and kiss you, my love
Man buys ring, woman throws it away
I know life is long but it goes so fast
Now I'm home for less than twentyfour hours
I see them and I understand
Go put your last £ on the lottery
It could all be a waste of time 
Fourteenth street, booze and swallow
When I feel alive
So she said, "What's the problem, baby"
Oh, I can feel my heart beating
See all our younglife friends that we made again
Chose to push it aside
No one could not agree
You know each drop of blood I need
Sugar, shake it, susugar
To stay on a holiday
We are the kings and the queens of the new broken scene
There's plenty there for everybody
However much you use me baby, come on use me more
Dressed up as bubblegum, I'm stuck to your shoe, let's run
The more you give, the more you get
Silver hours, silver hours
But everything seemed different
There's a river in my mind that's never still
Then we've got nothing to lose
Something gains its place now
Working at a nightclub that was called The Avenue
But you hit my heart with a harpoon
We're taking no part in your cracked antique life
I'll forget what I've done
Making due is a thing, a thing I will do no more
You're gone
Got the shake of the grass roots beat
Lady on the water, make me rich, make me poor
Another partner must be found
Leave the paperwork for other days, just go
And a piece of paper in my pocket deep
Better get to the table, get to the table on time
They remind me of the pickup truck out in front of your neighbor's house
Because it won't
Yes, I understand I cannot live on this land
When the money is high, we can start to spend
If you want some more, come and get some more
Are you holding me down
Starry eyed
Send out a battalion
Get your game on, go play
She's got the devil in her heart
And when you notice all your stars are in line
Just one look at you
And way out there, it is the same old place that it always has been
You look so good in the clothes of a poser
When I found you dear, what it meant to me
The sound of the engines and the smell of the grain
I've been poking a voodoo doll that you do not know I made
Out of macaroni pieces
Came down upon her head dodo dodoodoo
Then I will never get away
We mirrored the world
Sitting in a car and driving down the road
The girls were holding hands
Well something on the surface it stinks
Listen, I'm your friend don't quote me
I'm walking till the break of dawn
Mymymy heart like a kick drum
They can't wait to grow up so they can kiss some ass
You're such a rush, the rush is never ending
It's a perfect day for kiss and swell
And it turns off and goes again 
And don't you feel it's all the same,
These are the days we won't regret
We all end in the ocean
Are we so out of line
Sweet, sweet fantasy baby
Look all around, there's nothing but blue sky
Lets forget about the rain  x
With words
No more destination, no more pain
The way that she let
All right, all right
Ooh, but that girl don't pay no mind
I used to go see on the landing in the summer
People tell me not to lose my self control
If the world were to die, the light will guide you
Now the night has fled
But the stars are feeling colder
Shed your love, shed your love
Shake, shake, shake, Senora, shake your body line
Just waiting for you
When the sun only shines as if it's giving a warning
I got a nice guitar and tyres on my car
I've got to admit it's getting better Better
You can't see my eyes
She got out first  away from me
But everyone I ever cared about remained
O'Hara blinks and fights
Oh, I see what the world can't show me can't show me
Stacy can I come over after school, oohhoo oohhoo after school
Don't blow me away
Say man
Now clap your hands high, no need to be shy
In the middle of the summer, or even twenty below
You'd better watch that you don't cut your hands
Warning out of something
I heard you turned a new leaf
Yitho omanqoba  ih hih ih hih ih yitho omanqoba
You will come down too soon
Remember when your mother found us
Clouds of birds are covering her sky
Someone more than weekly
It's gonna be ecstacy, this place was meant for me
The women and the men who dance when they're in love
For it is breathless without you
If I loved you
Ohoh, ohoh everybody 
And round and round, around, around, around, around
Oh yeah, 'cause there's a cloud
We come back to heal ya, janglin soul
And adopt a bunch of babies that ain't never had shit
But you did, and you fell, hard on the ground 
First thing I remember, I was lying in my bed
But that's just all right, all right
Because you tend to take them turns just a little too fast
I'm always looking away
Over and over again you promise that it won't end
Ooh, and just like the ocean Just like the ocean, baby lays right there behind me,
And god I'm good at it, I'm so spot on
Until there's nothing left of you
This is a world premiere
Who knows how long I've loved you
This wellknown flow, man I got this shit from Simpson Road
We are young
It didn't used to be like this
Who's that been sneakin' out the window
Judging by the hole in the satellite picture
He said, "Well I hate that it's come to this
And if I tell you something
Oh, the bitter winds are coming in
And I feel like
Tea and a toast to yesterday's capers
One night of love
If not for you, my sky would fall
The stars align
You blew me off, but I don't mind
I'll let you get naked too
Just don't stop let's keep the beat pumpin'
We gonna wash away
Under green moons
Illuminate the main streets
You're never coming back again, oh no
They go you're just as boring as everyone else
How could we ever forget OhOhWiOh
I replay in the back of my mind
Counting the days until they set you free again,
All European, once again with feeling
We couldn't speak anyway
I try but I can't let go of it
Ba ba ba ba da ba, it was always
Lonely
You and your sister finally severed the line
And in the top of the canopy of the trees I am climbing
Giving other people my despair
Well what's my name, well what's my name
To watch the colors change
This one for them hood girls
Fun, fun now that daddy took the TBird away
You'll always be my friend,
Where the rivers unwind, the rivers unwind so easy 
To call my lover
I can't remember it went straight to my head
Fade from your eyes
You're gonna hit me with a big wave
Where you will sit and contemplate your day
Hands to tear apart
So baby open your mind while I close the door
Shimmy down and show us part of in the meantime
And you say
To tell you how I feel about everything
Who says we have cold hearts
You watered me down till I drifted abound
Why do you make a start
On the bright side of the road
Let the orange embers in the fireplace remain
'Cause I'm a better man
Love was out to get me
Sometimes I am overcome just thinking about it
I'll safety pin these clothes all cool
I'm outside the house and not thinking right today
While shooting in the dark 
That feeling when I'm all alone
Because there ain't no party like the party going on in my house
Funny how it seems like yesterday
And it kinda looks just like you
Another day to do it all again
Well, now I'm back at home and
Know if words could say
'Cause, baby, I can love you, baby, I can love you
They gonna throw me out when the morning comes
She knows no time, she knows no bounds
And I could take her out the next day for pretty much free
Baby, I feel so alone
Dug a hole in southern Carolina, took me straight to China safe and sound
I just want to be feeling free
Skipping and a jumping, yeah yeah
In the shape of an L on her forehead
But you still took me home
You get me
And dies in the first freeze
Disturbed real sad
In the light of day
She calls my name
There are so many things I can do, just like falling in love with you
I just met this foot guy who's just my type
Just a boy and a girl gonna take on the world
Headed for the open door
I locked you out, you cut a hole in the wall
Of the rusty fire escape
You'd better stop STOP
And the sight
Parisians all gone
I didn't know what I would find there
But my love's too pure to watch it chip away chipa, chipa, chip away
And two to three minutes don't seem that long
Focus looking forward the Colosseum
Don't worry 'cause it will all turn around
We have the right combination
"Oh, do you remember me is your mind that worn
I really don't like the way you smile
So let it all go by
This weekend to relax and unwind
Do you pick and choose amongst the jewels for one to keep
You're bringin' up times I can't recall
We can take tonight,
Uptown funk you up woo, come on
I gotta know, when can I see you again
Now with your hand in mine
Oh, you gentlemen and ladies
Never felt this love from anyone
'Cause all this time is wasted on
'Cause I don't mind it when you whistles
A little bit of Rita is all I need
Till the end of the day 
Through the door, someone says,
But I feel alive and I feel it in me
Let me be a blue raft
So when you gonna phone me
You can laugh this one off but it's not funny
But Jesus, when it rains, how it pours
All I have, all I know, drive all night go anywhere you wanna go
Let the sun shine baby
Laugh until we think we'll die we'll die
I'm too weak to fight you
I haven't been there for years
I'm not your only friend
Well, he'd better get out of my way
Can I tell you that you are the purple in me
I broke free on a Saturday morning
I'm gonna hand you a dime
You're just talkin'
I was the youngest son of a congressman
Leaving his lover and his family behind
Like a popping sin call
My ears are blank
Then came high school
About the time they called me "Jacky"
See I would if I could I would do anything spontaneously
I can't help from cryin', I wish you were mine
They are just fossils now
Miles and miles of English garden stretching past the willow tree
Come over here with your heart
Very simple and dumb, like I always have done
Get yourself to the Butterfly Lounge
She turns a lonely room into a happy place
Don't need quarters, don't need dimes,
I'm a blond, bimbo girl, in a fantasy world
I'm getting to the point
Caught a train to Poughkeepsie
In case the shit goes down, yeah
Oh tonight he's not gonna come back home
She hid inside the attic of the sculpture building
We gonna chase the demons out of town
We got scribbes, Anthony Acid, rockin' the show
You can wear my shoes
We can pretend that they don't know our name
All the ducks are swimming in the water
I would like to reach out my hand
You said fight fire with fire, fire with fire, fire with fire
If it's drama you want, then look no further
With friends like these, well who needs enemies
I just want your kiss, boy kiss boy, kiss boy
As long as I got you 
All of the subatomic pieces come together and unfold
Are you writing from the heart, are you writing from the heart
Climb up the fire escape
Oh my soul has never had this feeling
Yeah if I lived in Ireland, if I lived in Ireland, uh huh
And life makes love look hard
Work it out baby
Oh you slay me baby
Another long quiet night
Put it in your hands, take it, take it
Un p'tit air un air d'amour
I just might walk home alone
Feeling as good as love, you could, you can
Surround me
Sooner or later, I know, I swear we're gonna make it
I be seeing y'all up in there late at night
And we'll get chased by the moon
And all the sadness inside me
Out of mind, out of state
And with no lifesaver you try your best to float
I will never miss your phonecall
We havin' fun partying till the break of dawn
Follow the shouting, I am longing for you
But my troops are bigger than yours
Still, I've got miles to walk from the cape along the coast
A world where fear will always win
And I don't know how a man decides what's right for his own life, it's all a mystery
Guilty feelings
But life is good and "It's always worth living at least
I'm coming clean, please don't let go
Well he's watching all the wealthy folk on his way to work
I told the gang we weren't welcome
I just want to stand and stare
At least that's what we say we are doing
Just a boy, just an ordinary boy, but
No, I ain't got cash
And we are broken
Fool everyone
You look like the songs that I've heard my whole life coming true
It's silent down here, maybe I want to get loud again
Of a man who is young and able
And the brightness of day, I like the dark 
Tropical island somewhere sunny every day
Oh shit
And the flowers that I gave you
Love love love love
I couldn't say what I was thinking
I need you near me
Talkin' 'about my baby
Set 'em all on fire
Here we are again
Marea a todo aquel
It's all in my mind
I'm having the blues
It's a serious thing in a grownup world
Where you wring your hands
What you believe and what you dream 
In our hearts in our minds
Here it comes, here we go 
I'll drop kick Russell Stover, move into the starting over house
Invisible people doing the wave
We can dance, we can dance, everything's out of control
That took  years in the make
When I step into the party, all the ladies wanna know
Get your gaze off tomorrow
I'll be buzzin' 'round your hive
I listen to my juddering bones
I wanna get a flat I know I can afford it
I feel so tired
You need to get a job because the bills need to get paid
When your best friend's all strung out
Till the day you turn three"
With going places
To take your girl, and spend a bit of your cash for me
Heyla, heybahelloah heyla
No you're not mine at all
And I've never went back trying to replace
You might lose your faith in science
It's a perfect day for dreams come true
The only plans of mine might sound to you cliché
What we are, what we see
So put your foot in the door because it's free admission
Hey girl come with me and let yourself go
Come fly with me
Oh yeah it burns
Met my match today
And I can stare into the sun
We're accidentally in love
If I had the chance I'd do it over again
With whoever's gonna get her the highest
Makes you feel warmer when you're trying to remember
I'm coming home
Oh yeah yeah yeah
The falcon calls
Yes I'm havin' a good time
But you don't care, oh care yeah
And family in free verse
I said how tiny we are Girl how tiny we are
Oh, it is love
I'll admit I was short on luck
Sunday morning and it's time to go 
I really don't think it gets any better than this
But this time, it's just time
They got a ticket to the show
Have you degraded or forgot us
When we go from the darkness into the light
Some say I don't the play the right kind of game
Today I feel like laughing
As I lay me back to sleep 
You know my name and you know me number four
Since the day you've been gone I cannot keep from crying
Out there amongst the waves and inside your lover's head
Though I respect that a lot
Drawing the pictures of our lives
Friends say I'm crazy cause
What's the matter with
Well hey, how's tricks man
You would be happy not to change your mind
I feel it now, I hope you feel it too
Bringin' us to life
There is no more water to stop the fire
About the man that you'd become and the positions you'd hold
Singing, screaming, kissing, tugging
Quiet till it fall, fall, falls
I think the air is finally safe to breathe again
Jumping out of someone's tent and I don't recongnize a face
But I still froze when I saw the ghost
She fell in love
Throw your hands in the air 'cause we'll shake it up tonight
We're the only ones who do
And only now I see the light
And you comb your hair, grab your coat and hat
I'm trying to beat is hiding in me, oh 
And your ties are made of things that shouldn't make ties
And in my room its gotta be at least a hundred
We made our way home on the bikes we had borrowed
We go riding on the abolition grain train
I'd like you to fall for me but it would soon turn lousy and wrong
And they didn't know how to prove it
But you are always looking out for me because
Ain't got no place to lay your head
But I ascend and serve my feverish need
Just don't stop, let's keep the beat pumpin'
Bury it in the ground
I wouldn't let you leave me 'cause it's true
Go on believe, if it turns you on
I've got time for a chat
See the French kids by the door
Leave everything behind
The game I used to play
For blue eyes
The mountain top
I had a golden ring
Because I got my gods but in the end
Tunak tunak tun, tunak tunak tun, tunak tunak tun, da da da
Is this an island that plots like a villain
But I'm a garbage man tonight
Stop selling what you know, suddenly you're so sure
Saw you hanging out with your eyes looking down 
You talk of freedom don't you see talk of freedom
You know I loved you
You hold me right here right now
It's kicked me down and left me for dead
And I don't wanna let go
So what's my line  shake it shake it baby
Check my email write a song and make a few phone calls
I do this every day, hocus pocus is my steelo
But now since I see you in his arms, uh huh
What's a matter, what's a matter, what's a matter you
I wanted to walk through the empty streets
Stay on the road, so I call my mama when I got time
Sits beside a stinging nettle
I don't care if its right
We're on a bender when it's  degrees
How I needed you there
I'd get to see you again
That's the life I choose
Five years, she fears to hold my broken head
Oh, gee, the way you kiss
Ah, just one look at you
Into the waves I stared
Let me in your love, that's all that I want
Only you make me feel the same
And carried away
It was like fire around the brim
But she only cares when she's got the time 
Done living like a runaway, break those hearts so carefully
Holds my hair back when I'm drunk and get sick 
All of our feelings, 
Staring at the ceiling here tonight
All I have, all I know, I changed the station and our song is on the radio
The beat goes on
Kick that shit
Anywhere with you girl is where I belong
I was feeling good
No one else, no one else
Then you get high 
We'll make the clock stop
Kiss my petals and weave me through a dream
Out in the street
Now I found my feet
And you shout out loud
He's got to keep his nerve
We'll leave it by the phone, 
Than just sit down at the piano and write this tune
It's that desire over love I have to turn around
Without saying goodbye
Guess I'm a little bit shy
Down with abandon and no understanding 
Make a little love in the moonlight
Your water's deep
In the grey, there's still colors,
Don't hide yourself inside till I'm old
You feel it, you want it, the way I want you babe
Sweet nothing I made it up
At your Christmas party, I hold your hair when you vomit
If your friends like a certain you, that's who you have to be
The flowers on the blankets on your bedroom floor
From your lips, a precipice
We're stumbling, tripping home again
To the days I've tried to lose
All I can remember was the brake lights flashing,
It was like there was nothing left on my mind
If love is just a game how come I've never won
I'm putting guitars on hold when my multitrack comes around
Gotta make a move or you'll miss out
Not withstanding provisions
You make me wanna say I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do
Rules are rules
Yeah, all the time
She's mighty fine and says she's all mine
O comet come, comet come down
Invincible, lyrical, miracle man, huh
Work, work, work, Senora, work your body line Yep
My heart beats out of time
Just remember that death is not the end
They play Good Charlotte on the radio
We will write a postcard to our friends
Me and your cold, driving in the snow
I'm a hot air balloon that could go to space
Yeah and you can tell them your story
Woke up with rain on my head
These walls don't talk,
I don't need the answer, I already know
There must be enough love ooh
Who's out of this world
Doesn't that make you shiver; the way things could have gone
And only one has the time right
From all the things and the thoughts and assumptions that I had wrong
Cigarette Barbie
Lying in wait at the Birmingham Mall
And if I die well at least I tried 
Plainly the words love and your name
And if one day I should become
They take shape and they tend
I'm finally looking around
And we work hard for our living wage
The last person in the world right now she wants to see
Tell him the story of a boy like me
And you are mine
With loving all the time
You're the one, that's making me crazy
You talk about life, you talk about death
This bed is on fire with passionate love
A handful of pills
We are racing to the break of dawn
Nothing else but us right now
Inside every man lives the seed of a flower
Seeking stars in its other side
You never know what people have up their sleeves
They say it's gonna stay bone dry
The moon is in the sky
To the ballots and their brides
I find in this town that it's hard to see
It was in a dream, it was in a dream
And it's okay
If you keep holding me this way
Oh, Valerie Plame, if that really is your name
If you were the floor, I'd wanna be the rug
It just existed in your head, the reflection used wasn't you
Überdosis überheblich, überroll dich wie ein DZug
I got ping pong Wednesday
You can go up my crain girl
But you're gonna say what you wanna say
 What do you say
When you make me feel this way
She loves to weave them in her hair
And if you don't know anyone
But now that I've been through that hell I got a story to tell
Not one seat belt on
A breeze whips through the trees
The Candy Man can 'cause he mixes it with love
This is your moment
You came just one dream ago,
Sssssomeone's gonna ask you what it's all about
I hope to God you feel the way I feel
Sugar, sugar Honey, honey, sugar, sugar
Pay the piggy back,
That just might change your mind
I am the black in the book
You make my heart beat like the rain
Not doing anything here
But don't say a word, till they teach you the way
Alongside my innocence I laid in bed awake
You're 'bout to miss, winding to this, don't make me start without you
That I've been desdesperately alone
In a dream that I had
Playing football with a can, Mr J lost his shoe
Yeah make it feel good
We got it everywhere
Now that we can hear that sound
All those stupid little cigarettes and drink stupid wine
It's gone, gone, baby it's all gone
Those happy thoughts in my head I'm feeling like I'm Peter Pan minus the tights and the fairies
Our lives are fractions of a whole
I get to record demos at attempts to blow
Because you could be better than that
Holding the flowers he picked from the ridge
And in the middle of the night
In the morning when the day is new
Oh, falling apart, is anyone watching
You left me for a drummer 'cause you said I couldn't sing
To burst grin giggle bliss skip jump sing and shout
The rich get money but never what they want
If you like them, yeah
Nothing really holds a candle to
But gold is just a trick of light
Let's drive to Brighton on the weekend
She didn't enrol, but she wiped the floor with all the arseholes
Leave a song no one has sung
I say hey, I'll be gone today
Walking on the milky way
Yeah I was just following a Friday
'Cause somewhere along the line all the decades align
And she's got the curse of curves
And you're all working in a submarine"
And we're walking and talking
Dansa for blanget Dansa till musiken
You can try to swim the sea
Come on, come on, Come on spin a little tighter
And lovers try
By the sea
And nights of together are where
You look as strong as you did before;
Outta control
For, for the teenage boys
I took my hits on a dumb road trip to Nashville, Tennessee,
You're my love come till empty
Hey, it's 'cause of you
In all of the action will tumble away with the years
You walked right in and brought the gift
I want to run and hide
Do what you've got to do,
I miss the power
Oh, take me to your best friend's house
Oh I would die for you
Just walk on down this road with me
Crimson and clover Our house in the middle of the street, why did we ever meet
Yes I could live in this town
You're past the point of holding up to your words,
On a highway 
And you'll always tape the football
So much dissing at the side and
Writing you a love letter
As long as you're open to the possibility, yeah 
We will not write a new one
On the good days
Erm, I'm gettin' some pretty good oscillations
'Cause baby, I've been lightly drinking
'Cause I know nothing ever falls apart
And the last one tore a picture
You are bankrupted because
But I can't stand with these jellybones
You'll let me hold your hand
With the hella good hair
But you were just some silly girl
You wore a dark grey Tshirt
For what could be the very last time
Not the end, not the end
You to feel Mine to feel
Nervous walks in a park
And I was wishing I'd break down your walls
I could feel the alcohol inside of me hum
Maybe I should come down
Some blades will cut you right to the bone
Who's the boy you like the most
The courage to let them down is something I've still got
Call a taxi, pack the back seat
But I hear the call of a lifetime ring
Everybody in the car, so come on let's ride
And I will waste no time
From the first time I set my eyes up on yours
It's the word I'm thinking of 
The opportunity's on
Come on with the rain
But as I looked to the door 
Do you remember that"
Ah, baby, I'm upsidedown down
One day, left me for dead
That you are on my mind
Wanna have some fun
Damaging my soul
Gonna paint a sign
We've been dancin round the moment now we're doin' it
Remember that I love you
It's been hardly a moment
She says I remind her of her father,
At Haggerty's and Swami's Inside, outside, USA
Morning Today's forecast calls for blue skies
Yeah, sing it 'cause we're all
I care that you feel at home
Everyone you forgot
Little bit of love, little bit of love, little bit of love, little bit of love
Or has your life shut down
'Cause we can't hear a thing
Because I know you love me
It started with a low light
Sing your life
The lights
Dadada dundiddle undiddle undiddle uh dada
And so our truths wait patiently
I'm the center of attention in the walls inside my head
Gentle in your eyes
We going down town, oh yeah x
Loose lips might sink ships but loose gooses take trips
Sunday mornings, go for a ride
But hug my flower with your eyes"
I know that God shines his light on me
You did This one thing my soul may be feeling
She decided that she better check in at home
Hit the door Hit the floor, it's the dawn of the day
My arms will keep me warm on cold and lonely nights
Nothing means I gotta gotta
I just wanna be happy here sometime 
Makes me wanna shake and shout
I lost the signal and put you away
We can settle by the sea
I might walk home alone
How it all comes to an end only to begin again 
I knew this would be the part
But every time the tide
My best friend Kimi wants to go with you 
Spend your days asking why
Man, oh man, you're my best friend
Say you're mine
To see it come to and end
My lifeahahahahahife
You know I would, if I could I would do anything spontaneously
I lay praying to a saint that nobody has heard of
Falling asleep together holding your body, close to mine
I'm sleeping to dream about you 
Can't buy you no snow cone
If I could be for just one little hour
No, please don't let me go
And how my heart's about to burst
But as she's getting ready to go 
One wave can pull me under
And smile real wide for the papapapapaparazzi
Love's what I got, don't start a riot
You're gonna see the reason why
Hello, goodbye, hello, goodbye
If all is grounded you should go make a mountain out of it
I am riding all alone, I am writing all alone
But out there the world is a beautiful place
Just like the song on the* radio said
We'll drive, one thousand miles an hour
It's built on, built on words
You give me a feeling in my heart, 
Attack We keep it on the dance floor
I cried picking up pride
But I've got the fastest set of wheels in town
From now on let the risk lead me to
That your fathers set before you
But I will forgive you, the yolk is in the middle
Got my head tied to the sun
Forget about it, don't let it get you down
Side by side, dream bigger
But there's nothing to be sad about
Was anything enough to kiss the ground
Is a child of god
Oh no it's not the life that I chose
I'll never let you down
Cause your wrinkled eyes betray the joy with which you smile
Trying to outrun your fear
For to steal the secrets of the heavens
Images of rapture
Every time we say goodbye
Don't let your day grow long before it comes a week
Now stand in the place where you work
So I call your name, cross my fingers
But I awake each day with the new sunrise
Oh, I love
There is only one thing x
Come jump in, bimbo friend, let us do it again
I've read the same books again & again
I'm alright, I'm alright
And I feel it's time that you should know
In the colors
You, you know, you know my name 
There's something on the line
You are not my typewriter
An old maroon hot air balloon
Go baby, go go
And don't tell me it's "just because"
You know I need my shepherd here tonight
It just can lead back to her door
Yeah I know what I should get this time
Oh my god
When you look with your eyes
You could love
Tonight I will sleep in my car,
The whole town is laughing
In the end I'll be all right
Have a drink and shake some hands
The citrus drawing out the scene in stains
Sun coming to shine on the occasion
I remember, I remember the days
Probably has nothing to
Dance, dance, dance
Lights on, some distraction, so I won't move
Mum and Daddy would be so proud Time is taking lies
I was a young man almost  right down to the day
Only you can let it in
I never let you go
I have been poisoned from all the things I take
I don't understand
I hope you feel just like I feel
Lover's bonds they hold so fast 
It's like I'm on the moon 
Slightly where the night gets colder
The fortress, the faker Run for your life, for your friends
Indicate precisely what you mean to say
I'd ask my friends to come and see
The bells are ringing out
Whenever you stop
Being grown up isn't half as fun as growing up
It would just bring so many tears
Attic in a basement with a knife serrated, I'll protect you
You slow down heartrate
Oh when you smile at me
And I keep on forgetting myself where did you go
Well, it comes in waves, but it's hardest from the start
And I tell you all too much, girl But I want you to know what you got is a natural gift
And everything will happen and you wonder
'Cause aI ain't the way you found me
No way to say and there's nothying I can do"
Who's that hiding in the apple tree, clinging to a branch
When you come around
Everybody just hold hands
Shine shattered shine 
He will be twenty in a week
Go baby, go baby, yeah we're right behind you
A sore sight
For heaven's sake, keep me awake so I won't be caught off guard
The mistake you don't make or the rain cloud covers above your house
And her ways are high and steep
Everybody's feeling warm and bright
I'm just the same baby
It's a weakness in your knees
The poison then could reach your heart from a vein
Lover's on the phone but they got none 
Singin', don't worry about a thing
In a village in the hills
No looking back you know the past will stay
From dreams I've had, the dream is all I have
There are prostitues in Thailand
I'm happy if you're happy but it breaks my heart,
 o'clock, Monday night and I'm waiting
To keep, keepin', sleepin', dreamin' on
In the land where the furniture folds to a much smaller size
Why some are born
There's flowers in my house and I bought them myself
The river and the rock that fell there
What is on your mind
And he dresses alright but the conversation is wrong, all wrong
Sad hopes I'd hidden under
There is no one else around
Blood, blood, blood; blood and fire
Hanging out on the hooks next to the window displays
Stand in the place where you are
ih hih ih hih ih Yitho omanqoba ih hih ih hih ih
He is surrounded by the sound, sound
The crust of the tan man imbibed by the sand
And wherever you are, land on another star
While you're waiting for that sound
Just let it go, don't let it bring you down now
Baby, you're a rich man baby
And I need you to please explain the war 
With your topic of conversation
Oh remember sitting on that beach
That I kept it beneath my bed
Trying to keep my eyes closed
Say you mean it, seal it up, say you wanna try
And I'll fight their doubt and give you faith with this song for you
But I'll take the chance and tell you what I'm thinking
They'll hold a double funeral
It stands for hero, and the hero is me not
Where we roast all the dreams
Hands together
My sisters and my brothers there for one another
But I never really thought it would feel this fine Yeah
Restaurant man
The love that's shining all around here
Dance uptown right down to the gutter
I've prepared a light show
Can't stand when I disappear
And we go back to where
Gotta get it back to
Just sneak out and don't tell a soul goodbye
You can see it's all lies
Chasing the lampcords back to the wall
Two souls, one heart
Bad news comes, don't you worry, even when it lands
You're an openminded lady, you've got it all
I have seen no one brighter than you
I've been searching for something
Then there's no hurry I'm a patient man
I got a steel machine 
I must've done something right
Don't let your friends say you have no taste
If'n you should say goodbye 
Every day we're getting closer
It's gonna be a bright bright
Milk and honey till we get our fill
After the rain
How does it feel in my arms
Together, like we were something more
No more nights in this weed and thorn infested meadow
I can't wait
I heard the Eskimos remove obstructions with tongues, dear
Smiling, throwing kisses, busy making lazy sounds
Can't justify it still
If you got the money,
Hold your fire
This room is a, a fluorescent tomb it's brazen bulbs mimic death's heina croon
Oh, that sleepwalk should be over by now, I know
We would be friends if we tried again
I've been awake for a while now
We can take it slow, stop me if you want
And set this whole place under water
And there are things you can't avoid, you have to face them when you're not prepared to face them
To go end lead a separate life
Give me all your love now
Jumpstart my kaleidoscope heart
All the wind blows and the angels sing
Good buddies, mau, mau, mau
These bandages cover more than scrapes
And where dreams are found
I'll wake up in strawberry fields every day
Already, we'll all float on okay
'Cause tonight's the night it goes
Then she and the books and the oranges go back to her place
Forgot to shine on you you'll see,
No need to fantasize Big girl, you are beautiful
I can't help but feeling
'Cause your daddy thinks I'm lazy your mama thinks I'm crazy
You put your life on hold as we interest one another
It would be great, right
We're gonna be alright, yeah We're gonna be alright, boy Ah, yeah, ah yeah
Oh yes we're rolling
We used to laugh till we cry
Lord how can a heart
As I lay me down tonight, 
This road is finally standing up to the sky
Stop, wait a minute
Open hearts, empty spaces, dusty roads to distant places
Break away your ties and find a new squeeze
But you loved and built a house with my love,
Ooh ooh, I've been trapped by love
Not Tonight Please No
And you don't need tricks
I got something that I really want to let you know
I could sleep
So what if I see the sunshine 
For better or for worse I will always put you first
I didn't know, 'cause you didn't say
All I know is to take my medicine I always take my medicine
A collage of senselessness
So you'd get away with it
For we spent the summer in your birthday
Standing by the wall by the wall
'Cause life here in the states has escaped
That's right, look up the number
Take a good look around you
Nothing else but you and I you and I
So keep your wick in the air and your feet in the fetters
Throw those curtains wide  'Cause holy cow, I love your eyes
Their boats are full of flames
You're sure you wanna talk to me
I seen ya, I seen ya, I seen ya 'round for a long, long time
Lovelife, Shifty rolls the dice snake eyes surprise
What happens if I go through that door
She did brass rubbings, she learned you never had to press hard
No wonder your heart feels it's flying, your head feels it's spinning 
We dress the same ways only our accents change"
Watching the fire as we grow Mushaboom, mushaboom
You've been looking up to him
Memories don't go away; I remember every day
Óró mo churaichín ó You were one inch from the edge of this bed
I'm covered in rain but it feels just like it's the sun
So don't stop me now
That's why I'm asking you to wait, wait for me
I, I needed, I, I, I needed someone to talk to
Hours on the phone making pointless calls
I turn myself out, outside and in
I'll dream about you, I will not doubt you with the passing of time, oh yeah
Who knew my luck would change
Payback the monkey,
Don't cut no corners when you're talking to me
Have sun clear blue skies
Ladies and gentlemen, this is Mambo Number 
All that I ask is that I know where you are 
There was a little old lady who was walking down the road
That's the way I like it and I'll never get bored
I am going to make it through this year
And let me hold my broken parts
And I never forget a face
Everywhere and every time I am yours and you are mine
Always be my boy
Reluctantly, cause most of this press don't fuck wit me
It's too much lyin', and too much fightin'
Coming up for air
I'll be your winter coat, buttoned and zipped straight to the throat
And you'll get nowhere
I never miss a beat, ah
That to live you let go of me with each step
Dark times Gotta let it go because I got my stash
Off the floor, where the other brothers leave it be
I know it's love that's got me feeling OK
Each wanting the next one
You'll feel better
There's nothing true and nothing's real
Oh, you make me happy in my everyday life
And I know it's hard when you're falling down
So bleakly all the time
I like watchin' the puddles gather rain
Let's have bizarre celebrations let's forget when, forget what, forget how
Out Of Nothing, The Need
Is something I'll get used to, oh
Either way, my change came like Sam Cooke
Oh and I have returned to the somber greens
An' all the boys they go
He turned to squeeze the lemon juice to rain
They say, you learn from your mistakes
Make a move, you'll get that mac
Then you're gone before you know it;
Trading swigs from a bottle, all bitter and clean
And your heart, your heart went missin'
The city is my jungle gym
Shoulders ache for want of wings
Wake up it's a beautiful morning It's a beautiful morning
I finally fell in love, I've been waiting forever
Take a long walk down a short block
Oohoohhoooohooh oohoohoohoohoohoohooh
I didn't mean to scare you
When you sleep next to me
Promoter's in the pay box wondering where the band's gone
Set the clock back twice or once upon a time,
And turn that sadness into something that feels right
Trippin' trip trip it now
Headed out to god knows where
I'd travel 'round the world if you would let me
Tomorrow at breakfast you may prick up your ears
You keep on searchin'
I want to feel
I suppose that's just the way the cookie crumbles
On a cool summer night
Makeup eaten up by crocodile tears
Come on and lead the way
I know I won't be alone
So my beer now taste so bitter
Just say oui si sim da ja yow igen kylla
Shake it like a Polaroid picture
When I'm feeling oriental I gotta rub my chin
And in times before that, well, I was crazy
Give me moments
We're off to new lands
I wandered all night, I wondered all night about you
I'm crying late now, the sun is gone
And I've been holding this microphone
Your sweet moonbeam
Spend a lazy Sunday in my arms
You're gon' be my girl My girl
The beach gives a feeling, an earthy feeling
Suddenly came the dawn from the night, suddenly I was born into light
There is a part in every day when I lie to myself and say that it's okay
And the atrocities of school I can forgive
She says, "Where have you been I've been lying right here on the floor"
Is it a woman that you see
I can't sleep these days
You be a fighter of fires
Will you still be sending me a Valentine
I was one of those
And let it wet your lips
Just by self tonight, all by myself
I won't look back anymore
I'm a man in a dream and there, dancing in front of my eyes
You're every song
I never wanted to be anybody's other half
Giving me the feeling of a lightning strike
And both got stomach aches
Give her all the love she gives to me
Into tiny parcels are you hoping it's tense, girl
I'm a legend in my spare time
And stumbling through the street they say
El maximo lider, comandando en la brea
I feel better
Ohooh
Am I the one you're thinking of
Un p'tit air et le jour
Who appeared in quite poor health
There's a time to
It comes down to me and you
Every single day
I was in love with the place
I dream it all the time, girl
Well they are time bombs and they are ticking
I was feeling like champ then, in summer
'Cause no one's really watching
Get dirty, get clean
You're alright but I'm here darling to enjoy the party 
Let's get it on, yeah, y'all can come along
The more I try the less I care about it
And this, this could be the summer when I grow up
I was dishing out the same dirty looks
I live in the middle of a combat zone
I'm looking up
Should we move to the UK
But if the world could remain within a frame
Can we please take this hour and talk about me
Right before your, right before your eyes
I can't stop awondering
Only for people with no real ambition in their life
The neighbours complain but that's the kind of girl I like
So play that sweet tune
That was the time I used to pray
I've got a big, big, big heartbeat, yeah, I think you are the sweetest thing
Will I catch the moon
Make a little birdhouse in your soul
I do this everyday
You been on too many catalogue sprees
Clap your hands y'all it's alright 
And awake in your mouth
Yeah, I need you to come and keep me amused 
The train leaves at half past ten
When something's wrong,
I've been corrupted 'cause
Talking sweet and looking fine
And let your love grow with the smallest of dreams
But I never heard you callin' from the sun
Your love is like a city that burnt me good
And when she dances, oh brother
Classical music blasting masks the ringing in my ears
And your hands are tough but they are where mine belong
Out on the midnight the wild ones howl
Four, three, two, one
Yeah, my heart is numb
Step out in a crazy world
For figure eights in the ice in your stare, 
I said it that's the way it is
One of the beautiful people
And so that I do remember to never go that far,
You said you hate the sound
'Cause you got my heart unlocked,
And says you broke another heart that was broken down
If I had blood in my eyes
And I move slow
When I open my eyes
Because you've never seen a Redwood and you've never touched a deer
And in my hand it spins so gently
But right then the clouds parted in the sky
When you can't sleep, well you can't dream
I got a gnome in the backyard
She's driving away with the dim lights on
So let's drive through the night
Pay the chicken back,
Oh in your eyes there's a sadness enough to kill the both of us
Crazy auto car gonna mow me down
From where I stand I see
Or are you just a decoy dream in my head
When the night comes
My heart plays a rhythm in my head
And I have left the warmth of the sun
All the dough you promised your friends
And of course I can't forget all the beautiful colors on the day that we first met
Be alone, I am beside you beside you
Fix your mask girl
Just like we're dear old friends, like she already knows me
But I made a promise to hold it in, hold it in
Down a long road I stumbled
Oh girl,
Everything will be fine
Why don't you come on over
Who the hottest in the world right now
I can't forget the time or place where we just met
If you could watch everybody work while you just lay on your back 
Watch your step
Big wave
No sense, hiding away when you're already gone, I want you to stay
Maybe when my eyes were closed
There she goes with a twinkle in her eye,
'Cause I don't care if I ever talk to you again
And it just feels good when you're coming home
Oh, have you ever been to heaven at night
I was looking for a decent boy
"There's no time for looking down
I'm windin' up with none, just zeroes, no 's, just space with no air
I wanna roll in the hay
All about the dangling possibilities that keep turning in and turning out
Dreams of realities peace
What's right and wrong
I ain't even know what a record advance was
Yes, I'm on my way
That thing can bring the tides, hey
I was thinking about singin' this song for you
And It's you that I've been waiting to find
See if the news was all okay"
She puts her hands against
You gotta wait a minute, wait a minute
But you've nothing new to show me
Now don't that feel like sunshine after all Don't it feel like sunshine after all
On a riptide, freak's ride
I love you more
Corre o que correr, custe o que custar
We could have wild, wild parties in that big old lodge
Rise above, gonna start the war
It's only one part of the story
The sun will heat the grounds under our bare feet
And when the light has let
Lift your open hand
Bounce bounce, baby, bounce back to me
But with my careless words I tread upon your vision
We have dropped right out of
Oh why For me I'm always looking for a way out
I know what I should get this time
Why should we all be alone
Let the wind blow through your hair, be nice to the big blue sea
Papa's gone
Waiting on a phone that never calls, at all
It's the summer, full of color, baby
I'm sticking to the wordplay
I promise I'll show you heart, heart, heart, heart
Oh my starry eyed surprise, sundown to sunrise
You're allowed to stare it out
Served on a leafy bed of sixteen military wives
If you work all night you keep the rhythm through the day
To hell with Sydney girls 
What does it matter if I lie to you
Now everybody's gone, you pick me up for a long drive Pick me up for a long drive
Hold music hold music hold
The trumpets call out now
Love started making sense
As we're sucking down that funny, funny weed
While nothing ever happens and I wonder
When we come running
Would ooh, baby, baby, build up these walls of mine
I could say
By morning watered down again
So your ex's got a mansion, where you kick it on the hill
'Cause people are strange and you can never second guess
Take a look, take a look
And my little band is kickin some ass
I did me very best to impress him
It's a warm summer breeze
Bring your bottle, wear your bright clothes 'cause it will soon be summertime
The suns that rise
I know your eyes are just for my but t
I used to worry I would wake up all day
You blinked and closed your eyes
Sometimes it ain't no simple drop in the ocean 
All that seemed like luck
Everyday I sit down and I feel like I'm waiting
You'll always make me feel best even when I'm blue
Someday you'll miss every single day we spent
To be mine
Harder you get
And it's a little bit you too
Baby, there's a shark in the water
And suddenly struggles to take flight
Firecrackers in the east, my car parked south
Love can make you hostage, wanna do it again
I got cars, I got cribs among other things
You're running back to me
I'll keep chasing it, I always will
Waited for your kiss,
For still, the fare of love is true
I had made up my mind that there must be a higher power
Walk with me, crimson day
And I hope, your majesty,
If you missed it the first time
You could love without desire
Out of which only seven really even care
Now I gots the balloons,
Or lose faith in yourself
We gotta party like
Knocked a stranger's door
Wegotta get that shit
Think I'm glass I think I'm breaking it
Say the word
I can't wait until you fall asleep
I will be alright, I will be alright 
Leave my door open just a crack
and not above letting a love song disappear 
It's like a fairy from the ancient time
Then I'll wear you for the night
You can't because you're working
And it beholds more than you love, more than you love
It's because I'm ghosting your dreams
Now I'm not a highly metaphysical man
De mémoire de guitare
Well I think the time has come
I almost wished you would've loved me, too
'Cause I'll remember everything you sang
To go and lead a separate life
There ain't a cloud in sight
To rent a display home
Nothing you can sing that can't be sung
This towns skipping like a record
Stupid but it made you smile
Your folks were next to you, and you were right there next to me
I don't care 'bout that
I downshifted as I pulled into the driveway
Oh yes, I started wondering
I was feelin' on top of the world, and I just got a hunch
Curl your upper lip up and let me look around
Big brother
And wine on my breath
No don't kick it around 
I must've had fun 'cause now I'm broke
Just last night I woke from some unconscionable dream
Everybody knows that he is gonna steal the show
The world keeps spinning around
Peep how we movin' the rocks and wit' pounds of dro before I double my shit
That I shoulda been sleepin', been sleepin', been sleepin'
Without fade, inside lovers
I had to leave you and go away
You could be waiting for your life to begin
So pick up your pace and go away from here
Child  the child
Shake it, shshake it, shake it Okay
Will you say goodnight
From anything we could call loving 
It's not a lot, it's just enough to matter
Keeps on running through my head
Take a bite of my heart tonight
I was walking, like I said, by myself
I kinda, I kinda, I kinda like to be the president
Oh, yeah, now I'm walking on sunshine, whoa
But then you told me you would move away
Give me good good times around the bend
The boy, the boy's in love
Rivers and playgrounds 
Back on my feet
When the moon glows yellow in the riptide
But she didn't care, and I didn't mind
I can't believe I forgot your name
We're going home
Oh yeah, you're my little girl
Got to find the reason, the reason things went wrong
And there'll be love in the bodies of the elephants too
I put my hand across my gut 
There's plenty space to encase
Winter legs give me heart attacks so take it off with laser, so it never comes back
Ah, la, la, la, life is wonderful
A hundred different ways to cause hysteria
I tried to do handstands for you but every time I fell for you
Whoa, shades of gold displayed naturally
I think it's all just a peculiar game
Next thing I knew they ripped me from my bed
Your only fear is possibility
But to have your love is such a thrill
Then she flew away into the night
You are just another white boy
Pull myself back together just to fall once more
Goodbyeeeeye
"Yourself and tourists, yeah that's what I hate"
Let's go away, let's go away To stay, on a holiday, far away
Jump into that water and see for yourself
Sun is out while I'm walkin' home,
If you ever make it back to Nashville
I'd fall to the bottom and I'd hide 'til the end of time
And you to look at me
I can feel so swollen when I'm in good shape
You're the love of my life
You better be cool at the time
On buildings, buses, streets, trees, rain and friends 
A fear that I cannot shape
Every wonder why they kill the weak ones, baby
One day, the sun will come out
Tonight's the night
As we're really not together at all
I don't know why I feel so skinned alive, oh, oh
Yeah it's something in you always ask for someone real
And I'm sorry I sound glad, but why always be so sad
The food supply has been depleted
I'm so mad at you cause now you got me missing you
We lifted this house, we lifted this house
You always look so beautiful
Do I end up, do I end up happy
Take your dreams where nobody can find them
Let your legs loll on the lino
Her friend the stars dripping from the jewelled sky
Sugar, ah, honey, honey
That you give me no reason, you know you're making me work so hard
And now it's time that you should know
Cause girl we're good together, oh
Could make things matter that much
'Cause we're seeing other people
She had several hours to find a place to stay
A weekend from the holiday
Didn't want you sleeping with a boy too long
Coldest winter for me
Holy, holy is the sound
The sun came out and brought you through
Love the one you're with
Friends until the end
He's got a rolled cigarette
Music is the question to things unsaid
There's nothing I could say or do
And down along the avenue some guys are shootin' pool
Back in the old days, tight like a fight,
All shrunk down in a twofoot tube
No traces of civilized living eating the earth
I'll huff, I'll puff, I'll huff, I'll puff and blow you away
Get an ugly girl to marry you
Today its replenished
I understand why they say
So what went wrong, it was a lie, it crumbled apart
What religion or reason could drive a man to forsake his lover
And she's just waiting for something to do
Come and kick it with me for a minute, you know what I'm sayin' King of the South
Just hiding from daylight, watching TV
My day just got misted, 
What a day for a daydream
'Cause this life is a beautiful one,
Where people like me are found by people like you
Ramones
Yeah, everybody's gone surfin'
Just lemme go dance and give me no blues tonight
Yeah, okay, cool, so we're not that far off So that'ssee, butyeah, we're done there
Liars turn me on
But it was fun fun fun when we were drinking
Safely walk to school without a sound
Whenever we kiss, I get a feeling like this
Paint the dusk venetian blue
The TV is your window pane
Now you're away, you write home everyday
One's a bottle of pills, and one's a bottle of gin
It's this one thing you did ohoh, ohoh, oh
And you looked
I used to hover outside my truth
So I'ma let you do the leading,
The fast child is gonna have a dead hand
And the leaves on the trees they all call out your name
And I wish I could get back there
I've never loved you
I got everything
Who cares what it does since you broke my heart
And the colors are going to be 
I could have read of your mind
We can see your troubled soul, give us all your money
Now if I lived in Ireland, I'd have some Chinese children
Whether I'm right or wrong, I know that you're gone, I know ya feel me feel me
Leaves you twinkling with the stars
Paper dreams honey
Please have faith in if you feel me
'Cause they gon' judge me anyway so whatever
Music is my dead end
Cold and alone, it suits you well
For the Earth, and materials, they may sound just right to me
Water shines like tiny bells
Hey, boy, way that I move
She's good to me, oh yeah x
With green removed
If you play the painted lady
Well I take two a day to make my brain behave
Your dark mascara bids me to historical deeds
Don't want to meet your daddy Hey ya
Kick your shoes to the floor and
As I dove into the waterfall
Ooh, let's see how far that we have run
Not so keen to show me anything,
Girl I like your body Body
It's a joke, nobody knows
Sunshine it's all I wanted
The people in town now just wake up to see her for
You love to win, I dare to lose 
Sunset at the shoreline, we are laughing, breaking up,
Is everybody ready for the single and it goes
Is there anyway to find
Are you my curse or are you my friend
But it almost feels okay
One to the front and one to the side
In the slats of light which creep across the room
You were always on my mind
Phony grabs with the manicured hands
But don't take those pills your boyfriend gave you 
Drench yourself in words unspoken
A glass of apple cider just waiting for you
Such were the grounds, such were the grounds for divorce I know
Place to silent sleep now
Where everything will change, we'll give ourselves new names
Alone in our pad on Saturday night
Everybody's wondering where'd he go
Dancing to the beat of rain
A canvas of a billion suns
You'd better run, better run, faster than my bullet
Boy toy, sure needs to sing
I knew it couldn't be just a onenight stand
Lucky we're in love in every way
I ain't got no home, ain't got no shoes
That can make a storm cloud break
I'll never fall in love
So come go with me
I see the walls, then see them fall
Not my imagination My imagination
You got that beep, that beep, that bopbopbop
You got it
My left hand was wearing fake plastic teeth, all winter
A watering hole Big girl, you are beautiful
'Cause it's too much, yeah, it's a lot
Ride it on out like a bird in the skyways
Við spilum endalaust saman
Behind the movie scenes
Your body was warm when I laid by your side
I gotta know, till then,
Of the living people living their lives away
So I take a Calminex and just chill
So take a breath and calm down
With your back against the wall
Or you'll be alone in a quick
Won't you come around and play for me
And if you don't reach for the moon you can't fall on the stars
I'm hardly getting thinner
They just may run away from you
In the city, in the city tonight
Which was slightly unnerving
Clean it out to the side
To make the room more natural
A whole new world to live in
He holds no currency
We could steal time just for one day
And can I skip, yeah, what I ordered
'Cause it doesn't matter anyway, yeah woo hoo
 I heard you got to the top this year
You could 'cause you can so you do
It's just love, ahy
Purple striped,
Put your arms around me, tell me everything's OK
Cause all I wanna be, yeah all I ever wanna be, yeah, yeah
We're all tired, and I wonder one,
We'll rise up ourselves, thanks for nothing at all
There's a wideeyed boy with a red balloon
This is the summer
I'll understand it's true
The way for us to change
Welcome swallows dip and swing 
And I can't help but back up when I think of what happens inside
Can you help me hurl me the game, Oh Starlight Has what you need
She said, "Shut up and dance with me"
If I were her I'd paint my body
Oh, you're tender and you're tired
That really reminds me of money
But now it's my turn
So close you can almost taste it
Don't talk about it, don't let it get you down
She says, "I like the nightlife, baby"
Cause love is the answer
I would give my life to make it okay, yeah
I think yore saying that you will make me mad,
Put your fingers in a mouth, and kiss it if it wants
You look inside me wild mind
So I can see if I'm inside
And everything around her is a silver pool of light
And we all needed something real we all need proof
Wouldn't want to waste a thing
I love you so much
And I can't stop thinking how wonderful this is
And you walk all over me
I couldn't wait to meet
If you wanted to be my friend
Seems she forgot all about the library
And as I look to the stars
I am a child, it's too soon
I gotta find a way to find her
All I wanna know is do you wanna come with me
And fought the shadows back
So come on everybody, let's rock this place
Hanging on to the one you love
Our time is borrowed and spent too freely
I just wanna be the one to make you fall
If I know one thing that's true
Going back to where I've been
We're flying through the night way up high
For all the other boys caught in your bleach job hair
We stay together out of fear of dying alone
But she'll walk a Thunderbird like she's standin' still
And all I can do is read a book to stay awake
It's all right baby, it's all right baby girl
Oh man I feel it in the streets
Makes time go slow, slow, slow
Go to a show, you hope she goes
Don't let go; I feel the music in you
Does it worry you to be alone
'Cause the reasons for your tears aren't worth crying
'Cause baby you start and then you stop
To me she'd say
Never change the way you are
Paper dreams honey, yeah
Well I packed up all my things
The music shaped our lives
Can you knit the stiletto back into the bloodstain
Boy just stop what your doin' and come and follow me around
There ain't nothing left to prove
It can't all be boiled away
When will I get my chance to make the lilacs bloom
Then someone falls in love
And they said, "Hey Nate, yeah, it�s been a while,
And why they even said that I had war beneath flatters
In a heartbeat
The times we had were so and so
Go ahead with schemin'
She's just the girl for me
You've got so much to live for, little sister
Picture yourself when you're getting old
When you're on a holiday
And one new watch
So say all right
Cart off and sell my vegetables
Oh baby, give me one more chance
Just as long as you were with me, let the cold winds blow
Il ne s�en rend même pas compte à croire qu�il est bête
Run until your lungs are sore until you cannot feel it anymore
The Earth is heating up, I still want you
Before I sold records, no promotion
This is an alarmcall so wakeup wakeup now
Maybe we'll get it right You know I'll get it right
They will come from me
Yes, that one in a million girls
You headbutt me,
Who is the fairest of them all
Cut it to the left and I rock
Uptown funk you up
Your precious love, uhhuhhuh
Good time to make an annoucnement
Maybe you need more time to decide
We gonna party like like it's 
Send me an IM, I'll be your friend
Just let it go, and I will throw you a lifeline
And He'll rejoice in things we say
I know the world's not fair to you
Dress me up, make me talk, I'm your dollie
Well pushing thirty stone
Your ever ever after, yeah
Why do they gotta front
I have something that I love longlong
There is no space in our hearts
Dressed to the nines, with hair to match Shiny jewels, casino cash
If love doesn't kill me I'll be lonely as a king with everything
When that light's gonna shine
I don't need a photograph 'cause you've never left my mind
Cruising down the highway with my friends, top down
I wouldn't call it a sophomore slump 
Well, you might be a bit confused 
And just so y'all know everyone else is not
From all the junks the one I need more is music
Hey, if I smile with my teeth
There's nothing left to talk about but there's plenty left to do
Só gastando grana
I gotta go
You are what you lean on
Call me Willy Whistle 'cause I can't speak, baby
Your all mine
And you were bleeding all over the place and I rushed you off to the hospital
All the good times my friend
Don't touch the laughter and away we go
Forget all those places that you've never really been
But ooh, baby, baby, come pick me up in your ride
When the radio just plays on anyway
Them good girls, straight masterpieces
Armed with every precious failure and amateur cartography
Spray paint verses on a cold blue wall
Sending the message through telepathy
Pink, brown, yellow, orange, and blue
Archery on Thursday
Will the wind that blew her boat across the sea
There's no one here to care
The way you dip
Will you share them with me
I will get by
Your heart is too strong anyway
So follow me I'll show you how
I'm feeling a déjà vu
All sung by many other fellows
The men started working
Or love's gonna get you down
They come on strong and it ain't too long
Why am I soft in the middle
That loving is all about doors unlocking
You talk of them as your friends,
I was young, I was surviving the times
Why must you keep me in your prison at night
Finds a nice cliff to drop off
While she is here in my arms
Waiting on this for a while now
When you return to me
Don't stop don't stop don't stop, the beat
Sometimes I'd like to stand
I hear Beyoncé on the radio
My money's in copper
And I know they love it
I am livin' out the life of a poet
Of your two shoes sitting in the bathtub
You've been pissed off for a week now
Who you are, are, are, are
Better hope I don't blink
It's already in my mind
Redondo Beach, LA Inside, outside, USA
Everybody is dying for
On my way
As in people that mean everything
Time stops too when you've lost love, ahah
On cracks and close my eyes
Can't stop, won't stop groovin'
On and on and on and on and on yeah, yeah
Don't panic, panic, Mutya, just look ahead now
In our bed
And of thoughts unkind
And while awake submerged
The open road is still miles away
Something I could get used to
And she's got the curse, the curse of I want someone
You look like an ace now, you look like an ace
For your therapeutic smile
Oh life, oh life, oh life
I'll join 'em talking 'bout the people everybody talk about
Should we take the chance
See the eyes fare in the dark
Goodnight and go
Said I can't go on, not in this way
Then I saw her face
All die Jungs zu deinen Füßen wollen dich küssen, auch die Süßen
Now, it's a peaceful oasis
That was the moment that you lost your charm
Senora's dance has more title
It takes an axe sometimes
I want to see your sunshine
You can make the blue sky blush
I don't want you back for the weekend
You make me laugh one thousand ways
Lines thicker than ground
That�s all, I�m gone
May we never go, go mental may we always stay, stay gentle
So I'm gonna tell you one more time
When there's girls all over the world
From now on somewhere I never knew
That changed this little boy's brain
Now that you are gone, I'll never see here for tech repair
'Cause now I got your back
She's like a sunburn
You always brought it among dreams
Hello buddies
I don't know why I feel so skinned alive, oh
I guess dreams do come true
In the strangest of places if you look at it right
Even if he didn't I wouldn't be offended
Getting so much better all the time
I'm always in love
You just say what's on your mind
Self righteous me, it's so wrong and
Put my suits right on the guest list
When I kissed you, girl, I knew how sweet a kiss could be
Until the day that I win against them
It snowed in Texas but you missed first time since '
Away
It really kicks, yeah
When I have, drifted off in sleep
You just roll your window down and place your bets
You sure look fine You sure look fine
And you are the dreamer, and we are the dream
There is room for me
Even at , you gotta start sometime
And we can dance Come see
That nobody knows
We're walking on sunshine
I feel like I've been missing me
Tuesday's fadin'
Where all the constellations shine to pave the way
He would never cut his heart out for you
Look at the ground
Life's your life
I met somebody cute and funny
Just lace up your shoes while I'm fetching a sleeping bag, a tent 
That we're dangerously surrounded
Higher, higher power
You come in, I can read you
And if I die today I'll be the happy phantom
I can't stop if you can't start
Any friends, I've got one two three
Gonna' fly this place so high that I won't know what's real
You heard the birds sing
But you don't bode and you don't pay, you got everything you need
Like the way that you drive your car
Yeah you're a bitch but I love you anyway
They say Confucius does his crossword with a pen
And they are offering eternal suffering
And I can't lift you up 'cause my mind is tired
It takes some cold to know the sun
Now some people ride the cat when asleep or when awake,
Someone above has seen me do alright
Let's love now
'Cause it's getting so complicated
Listen to the morning music, cursing the alarm you set
My way with words
Monday, back from the dead
Single in his bed someday
You can't take a fall
And the guns shot above our heads over our heads
Oh twisted me, I came to eat at the hall where we danced to some duds
Hey, remember the time when I found a human tooth
Fly away
Armed with this small butterfly net
In view of wan wordless crowds that chase waifs to spires with fiery plumes,
We're two, we're one
Sipping on the sweet nectar of your memories
But I don't have any messages
Single Mom I wanna get that number;
My friends say I'm crazy, and I agree
And I can see them falling through, almost feel them slipping through
I knew there come a day when our paths would cross
Why are you so far away from me
I wanna be someone new,
With everything I ever wrote
And I turned my amp up loud and I began to play
It's just a matter of time before we learn how to fly
I'll give you my street address
Butt's getting bigger, do you think he'll notice, maybe
Verschwommene Bilder wirken wie Nervengift
Lovely day, lovely day
Waiting for a bit of you baby
If he were President now
But that clock up on the wall was tickin'
When your heart is hard
Your're the one
Feels like we've already waited to long
"Well it's the numbers, it's the numbers;
If this nightmare can't be stopped
I know that you did 'cause you said it and you wrote it down
Escapade Let me take you on an escapade on an escapade, baby
You're not around this old town
When the night always ends with a fight I'm excited
Home for the weekend,
And the feeling goes but my hair keeps growing
And every time you look that way
Just over a day and a night
I'll be dreaming every night of you
And that's another fact
To keep his girls alive
Maybe I could carry on
To not let this play with my mind 
Oh drinking cheap wine to bossa nova
Better things are coming
Take me above your light Hello Seattle, I am a mountaineer
But it was all in your head
Den enda regeln är att du ska ha sa javla kul och du ska
You are the light
The sky is way bigger than I ever thought it could be
Dare to be one of us, girl
Thinking once there was a power that you were wielding
But somehow ended all washed up
I'm in heaven
She comes 'round and she goes down on me
He's keeping us warm
Others stopped where we'd begin
A map of the roads they go down
Here comes success here comes success
With our drunken hearts and our tired bones
Of melodies pure and true
Oohoohoohooh
Out of car, I don't know how I'm gonna go
Music is my beach house
You have always been my inspiration, please
Shot shot to the
Oh, I got a rocket
On an unfamiliar building on the rooftop where we lay
If we make it to the final scene fake flowers
Now my feet won't touch the ground
All the ways you devastate me
Trying to get to Providence I know what for
And find a handsome young mate for you to love
I sit back and just groove the day away
Ba duba dop ba do, oh yeah
While a girl on the floor singing RIP
Got something, got something to say
Underneath your stars
And there'll be no search for time
And my life with change
I drove home in the California dusk
Threw it out the window
Well our mamas, they left us
Oh what fun
I'm seeking girls 
My head is spinning
He is accustomed to hiding from people
From now on call me Royal Blue
Russell said I sounded like G, the nigga fronted
And that's to laugh and smile and dance and sing
There's no need to complicate
Carrying just me, Aunt Stephanie, she held my hand
So don't ask me how to get started, oh
Just a dream, just an ordinary dream
I stay game, stay game, stay game
Baby's got a praise like a lover, like a friend
I love hard with everything
Run along with your new boy
I was a lonely soul
I'm retracing every step in my head
You can call me Travie Claus, minus the ho ho
Some of us get covered up by the world
From thinking all the time
Yeah yeah Such angelic motion
Closer to the sky 
You've got soul, you know what to do to turn me on until I write a song about you
Oh, I'm walking on sunshine, whoa
Tonight can we be free to be who we really are
Light bolts hover over you all day
She just couldn't see things my way 
Every time my name gets mentioned
'Cause I'm becoming someone else
Don't say maybe 
I never was lying when we talked in bed
And we're so cold
Next to mine
Humanity has no blame in this case, this big game of chess for us all,
So the next one came with a bag of treats,
Bleak church on a cold tundra
This boy is cracking up
Under cover stayin' dry and warm
Never saw a kid behave like this
If I could do just one near perfect thing I'd be happy
I'll sit back and relax
Le garage, le garagerage
And dispatches from the back of my mind
She's winding 'em down on her clock machine
No, I was never young; kindness seemed no ploy to temper or annoy
If you are the ghost of New York City
Getting angry doesn't solve anything
To rise up from the dead and take up to the sky 
I'll be back with a capital H
And I never wanted anything from you
Just boogie woogie with me
I just want you closer is that all right,
It's nobody's fault but I'm so low
Come fly with me, let's fly let's fly away
Everyone is leaving, I'm still with you
All of her boyfriends gonna make her feel fine
If you've got things on your mind
I want to stop, but I don't dare
A long time coming home
There is a game I like to play
Before I do something stupid
But just a little helps, it gets me straight again
I'm the luckiest guy 
'Cause out of all the people I've known
And spread around his advice
'Cause I really don't care
That show the singer lost an eye
Soaking up the thirst of the land
I get to wishing that there were two of you
I'd love to let you go
I'm gonna make it all mine
Ain't got no money, ain't got no class
Oh, when this life just gets so grating
That's why you get tired so fast of everyone
Our big break
When I look at you, you're so ashamed
Put your hands on my heart
I've been trapped by love
When I'm swallowed up in feelings
Dancing girls at the Candybox Night
Just because I can
First dancer takes the floor
Oh, the summertime
Reef and Matty C offered me a little money
It'd make me sick, sick, sick, to kiss you and I think that I would vomit
OohDo your thing
Floating down the Pontchartrain
Hemmed in by the room
And I think I don't really get it
These flights connect through Arizona
I say, hey poppa, hey poppa
And free the human race from suffering
What's left's so rare
Whenever you came near the clouds would disappear,
Nothing but gospel in my mind
And I may never find the meaning of life
I get up early when the sleeping pill wakes me
But I've got a conscience too
I'll be the one to hold the gun
You get all my lovin'
You even might wind up being glad to be you 
Can't stop, won't stop movin'
Everybody's life rolls by
And showed me Spain or somewhere
Different names
And girls better beware
One thought has me turning back
The only thing that he has left
It feels so nice
Singin', don't worry don't worry 'bout a thing
And if we're near or far from our city by the seaside
And see the talent you always hide
Except for cigarettes and wine
The way that it is, oh
We're Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
For homes that she had loved
After all that's what you're looking for
I go walking in the middle of the
Step right this way
Now the sun glows soft and red
I feel like the piñata
The feeling of screaming out
Tear up the stairs and tear up the floors
And I look at their babies
But I'll push all my inhibitions aside
Yes, all will come
And she should've played the part
Let it all go baby
The time we waste
Seven days a week, every minute of the day
And the four right chords can make me cry
You've been watching me for a while
Gotta save for rainy days
Who take the subway from their homes to their lonely nights
Out run it
Like the time you said could you buy it for me
I'd do anything for you
Sailing silver waves, through the skies and round your eyes
Gonna let it all roll right past me
Now I'm walking on downtown in a town that is not my home
In the back of my Cadillac 
I'll take second place just to end the race
Just think while you've been getting down and out about the liars and the dirty, dirty cheats of the world
Since I let your love keep me warm
She's got her jaws now locked down in a smile
To show you that I love you
No, no, 'cause I can't go on without you
If it was up to y'all I would never get discover
Now I'm crawling towards the sun
Now we're so high it can't rain
Even though it never lets you down
Tapping feet, wanna take the lead A trip back in time is all I need
So please forgive the words I use, my mind it tends to run
Go ahead and do your worst then
And all the girls walk by, dressed up for each other
Two of them and four of eyes
And you're such a great kisser and I know that you agree 
To the bright side of the road
Goodbye today
It's five minutes to midnight
It's just a little a lullaby to keep myself from crying myself to sleep at night
Cause the money
Nothing is wicked, everything's fun
And the night she looked so fine to me
Met a group of likely girls
Won't you help me share my load
I'm still into you
'Cause honey, I've got nothing to lose
Just one of those days, had a blue, perfect wave
Hoodoo voodoo, seven twenty one two
Up in the sky Honolulu bound
"Love is funny you will laugh
This is a classic bluff because it always works on you
I'm letting go of the thoughts
Well, we all shine on
The velvet, it rips in the city
You got everybody acting crazy
It's the one and the only place we control
But does something skip inside you
Don't come back anytime
I'll enjoy the still for a while 
And think of all the things I'm going to do
This is my heaven at night
I want to see you rock to the piano, the piano
And now I'm glad I hitched my apple wagon to your star,
You are my candy girl
The machine in the ghost within
Do the whirlwind,
You were always meant to walk out that job
Sooner or later, we're gonna make it
To the light
Oh if only I knew the key
They either lost my math or I miss they call
Let's enjoy it while we can
Dirty, trying to come clean, but every thought I have is obscene
Away the key, are you coming with me
We got no money but we got hheart
Will I wait here on ya
All your dreams are about to happen now
This boy you chance, this man you'll find
Won't you understand 'Cause I don't wanna walk alone
Whenever you call
All this love melting under blue skies
Is that you on the phone
Just a touch, away
Show me some positivity all right
Boy, we'll find how to make it with the rain
His back it might brake
One of us is gonna be running
But it's feeling just like every other morning before
And she'll be gone
In this moment, now capture it, remember it
And you know we're all tied, and it's tied at one
"High school never stops"
Our little place
Sukie was a kid, and she liked to hang out in the graveyard
Like a bat out of hell, time has come for you
I've got the life
More soul than I ever had
Some things in life are bad
Martha, my love
She's got Superman's smile
Playing Sarawithnoh's favourite song
Dying to take you away
I love what you've done with your hair oh yeah
Love is all you need
And I'm not saying that I know what I want
The fabric over the lonely
The sloppy guitar, it was shooting out stars
Thursday, never looking back
I'm leaving you tomorrow, but she already left, she already left
This song itself is living proof
I need you love
Bailando Es que uno Sabe Que Sera Buena Amante
I'll tell you how to do it my way
Yeah, we all shine on
Coming from the room next door
I'll make it to the show
I'd rather sit back,
No one will surprise me unless you do
Meaning it today
And my eyes are on you
Ain't nobody else
On a highway
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep 
But it all coincides in some way
Made you feel like it's not such a bad world hey
Can't seem to get enough
Oooh
The pen's in my hand
Accept my loss and head back to the mound
Baby, you're a rich whoo man
Come and let this man go
I'm letting myself off the hook for things I've done
No one there to tell us what to do
Would it take a bakers dozen to get my point to you
To show myself to you
Someone who needs me Ooh baby, for once in my life
And when you use your lips they better be on me
I've got music on my radio, oh, oh, oh
Eyes closed and shouting right now
Gonna' take this boat and drive it out into the sea
I hope you can forgive me for that time 
I've been waiting Waiting
Wherever it goes, I always know
Once you drove away
You've got to start somewhere
Those pretty eyes that watch you sympathize
In the dark we are without her empress light
A house fit for two
You have a hammer baby we can break down the wall
I wanna hold you close, I just never wanna hold you tight
Who said it was time, time to take, take love
But they're the only friends that I have
Something showing
I've been waiting for you, girl
I can feel a change in everything
We don't care
If you say, I'm always yours,
And it's a Get together to tear it apart
You run around
He came, he came to my bedroom
Never been a better time
People walk in sideways pretending that they're leaving
Music is my boyfriend
Come in to take me home
Put your hands over your eyes
I've got the adequate committee
On a highway, unpaved, going my way 
Ffffor sometime
My boy MC Serch nevertheless
I'm gonna stare into the sun, stare into the sun
Medicating in the sun, pinched doses of laudanum
Won't you show me some, baby
I'm gonna keep well my vegetables
If I could be for only an hour
And they put you in the ground
Amanaemonesia
Feel the air moving, moving
Not way over in a bucket seat
Girl, your love's so cheap
The sky will lie upon me like a passedout drunk
Oh say I love you so
Woke up next to you in your bed
Baby your magic is working
PreChorus 'Cause I would go the distance for you, baby I'd travel 'round the world if you would let me
Peeling away everything she had
You say that there's a thousand like you
It's a feel
Once again, I find myself with my friends
I heard the beat and I ain't know what to write
To kiss the ground
No, I can't sleep
Sit back and wave through the daylight
But I've got wheels 
Somebody needs to know the time, glad that I'm here
And so there's no need even going,
After six hours of school I've had enough for the day
Are you trying to stop it
The view won't let you down
And as you feel it you'll know it's true
You might not roll back my direction real soon
All our senses come alive, let the music take me
And the way you love keeps me hanging on
An octopus's garden with me
It doesn't cost any money
Yeah yeah
Blue canary in the outlet by the light switch
To be etched upon my mind
Two fools in love
You had a chance and you took it on me
My time will fade away 
No need to leave
Makes the world taste good
To when they lay my tomb to rest 
I was a better honey, so I did it again
And in the morning time she makes me feel all right
And the dreams don't lie
And before I knew I had shiny skin and it felt easy being clean like him
Your heart grows cold
Thank him for every day you pass
Too heavy we'll all float on alright
And I can't control it you've got me all over the road
Stuck in my seat from the turbulence
A new home with a place to breathe
I'm liking this American Boy, American boy
Where all of my flowers grow
Next in line, it's late
Tou get right down to the bottom of the barrel and float back on top
Broken bluesy whisper sing to me tonight
And every single day it getting harder to give
I knew it'd work
You're gonna say you love me too
Damn right you, landed on my ear and then you crawled inside
And I'm leaving with goodbye
And as the surface breaks reflections fade
No going back now
Pay the camel back,
Gonna hold my water in like I'm Gunga Din
He made you smile so easy, so make a smile for me
Well there ain't nothing wrong with the way she moves
Get in my rocketship
Can you put the bite back into the beast you've broke, and tied and tamed
I'd understand it
And everything is plastic
I'm gonna be who you need
So if I die today I'll be the happy phantom
Monday cycling
Till the end of the day
Don't go away we're so near
Sometimes I catch myself staring into space
Just wait for me the night through make it on over
Do it all the time, I know that we should
Making love in the green grass
And I know that it's so cliche to tell you that everyday
Your love makes me feel like oh, oh, oh
Back mask, spinning wax, the record had a heart attack
But I don't even know if we're still friends 
Fuck all you bitches and I'll never call
And the house will be shakin' from the bare feet
Say what you want, what you say, say anything
Everybody's screaming "hold it in, hold it in"
You stole my heart when Eddie Vedder was king
Strolling so casually
Underwater breathing burns your lungs and breaks your back
Under the tree where the grass don't grow
There's nothing to see, show's over
This is a strange enough new play on words 
Like seasons, just move on
I got a feeling you could use a little smile
We'll never be ready if we keep waiting
Everything we've been through lately
We don't need it
You're back so late Where did you go that you were gone so long
There are times every now and then
So open up your eyes, 'cause seein' is believin
Take the greenbelt to your house
When I was a young boy, I got a stereo and I taped all the songs straight off the radio
You lucky, ho, a couple years ago I'd have probably cut your throat
Though the hero for hire's forever the same one
Your spirit's watching over me dear Yoko
So hello, good friend, I wanna be next to you
Then she pulled at my stitches one by one,
I'll believe when I see the view
This wrinkle in time, can't give it no credit Credit
Hell no no, whoa no, I won't let them take you, won't let them take you
Her skirt ascends for a watching eye
And it's sunning, we're still running
So just get out while you can
When the neighbor's never more than a stone's throw
Yeah, it's safety dance
I just wonder Louie  have you got room for me
You know I'd like to keep my cheeks dry today
LA parties and the vodka fizz
When I can work out how it was
Life is a drink, your love's about
'Cause the kids at the shows, they'll have kids of their own
Yesterday I turned 
I hate killin' people 'cause I hate to keep score
Of the living people breathing the air today
Am I a fool
I'm begging I'm begging I'm begging you please now
You can hide around the corner
Stardust and high class scenes of popular teens
Cold hands, warm heart
The lantern, the lotion Run for your life, for your friends
Because here it comes in incredible yellows 
It was randy described eternity
Woo, you get that woo
We're living at night trying to pull out the light
Drinkin' in sunshine
There's a house on the block that's empty now that Dominique's gone
Just wait for me to show you
Can't stop thinking 'bout it
Better look up my number 
I'm not afraid to fall
Everything is yours to lose
Is with us every night
And all my kisses when we huggin'
I don't ever ever wanna be alone, oh Saint Jerome
Sleeping to dream about you 
I gave you mouth to mouth like Resuscitation Annie
Do it for the monsters under your bed
And I've felt how a heart melts down
Let's go for a ride
Of the Velvet Underground
We are a pair of apples
A daydream, I'm caught up in limbo
We're talking kinda funny from helium 
We see the star of wonder
Explain to me how you're so damn naive
But look, I'm only human
I won't make noises in your stairs
I've been here for years just wandering around the neighbourhood
Granted, they never quite knew what they had
The one that lies close to me
Watch out for late phone calls
I've said goodbye before
This song is for all the ones who's singing out loud
Waiting patiently to die
Keep kicking myself in the nuts
She stuck her voodoo pins where my eyes used to be
I'll be the one who'll break my heart
Head is swirling with the scene of you and him embraced in rapture
Do you think, everything, everyone, is going mental
That's who has replaced me, what a diss
For hours there's no doubt
And I said I'd never seen anyone look so dumb before 
Are bright
You got on the TV
Come back to me
Well, I might be able to stretch it till Wednesday
It's family beaches that I desire
They got the drugs I could use but then I don't want any
The catalog and the catastrophic smile
People should smile more
Be it true you ain't got nothing to do
Travel the seaside Michigan
So hard to say goodbye
But time ran out and I, I let you down
And so I won't play the part I played before, oh no
And it bangs about the newmade leaves
Friday night at the drivein bingo
The moment that you get there go baby
I'm doing what I really like and getting paid for it
The whole time 
I ain't never had nobody like you
Don't abandon,
Baby you'd be saving mine,
Downy feathers kiss your face
And you can't be close enough unless I'm feeling your heart beat
So can we say
All in the after hours of some Greenpoint bar, 
We were the first band to vomit in the bar
I found a letter that describes
I'm gonna try for an uptown girl uptown girl
Ransacks with the mad man
I see my name in shining lights, oh yeah
Pretending that everythings cool
No matter what has ever come to me
Had you stuck around or come out to a show
Gave you a minute
Then you come and I feel better
With loving all around me,
With lips and teeth to ask how my day went
That I've got so much 
That whole thing just really seemed too bizarre
A brown box, moth balls and bowling shoes
I'm feeling guiltier for leading you astray
They say that this is where the fun begins
Well, you just laughed it off, it was all okay
I've been hungry but not enough to kill, boy
Leave the city for an open highway
Baby baby, baby baby, baby baby
I'll always be there when you wake, and ayeahhea
So this ones goes out to the reds and yellows and blues
Rattle the cage and slam that door
I couldn't care anymore
Past our muscles and our bones
But my faith in love is still devout
Where the air was so clear
You would probably die before you shot up  miles high, 
So let that beat control your body baby
Come around to this fine town
Soft, yeah, I'll be all right
So I headed way down to the big pier
Have you even considered
I'm so in love with you, I'll be forever blue
When I am lonely as I can be
Tell them put the money in my hand right now yes
I always dreamed it would be
You might be lucky if you try
The power to see
Shake shake it
For this land is not yours or mine to have
That you can't decide all the ways to say
Gave me a push and he started singing
I'm already gone
Snapped me till it hurt
The dance of the cosmos shows
One moment I was tearing off your blouse,
There beneath the blue suburban skies
There's a car
Our hearts beat in slow motion
This is the fifth time straight in a year I've ended up in here
I hate to be honest but I'd hate to be you
Joined at the hip, yeah your sidekick needs you
This is a happy end 
My heart cries out more, baby
Oh love
So to hell with all that rubbish
Just time to leave it all behind
I thought we were all your children
A chauffeurdriven dream, 
They tell themselves that each word from your lips
I know I'm searching for something
The feeling of letting go, I guess we'll never know
I got peace in my heart
Left you with nothing but they want some more
Ooh, I will drive a thousand miles or I'll meet you at the station
You talkin' double
A new challenge awaits
Do you start to panic
Ooh Who cares about tomorrow
Oh, love's gonna get you down
I love
Give up repeating the facts
'Cause I'm lettin' off steam like a Chinese laundromat
And when I take these winds to home
My fans stuck with me, my shit still went gold
Just a day, just an ordinary day
And I'm running late
Birthday greetings, bottle of wine
Just to move around
To the music of drunken beatings
'Cause I've been saving up for something we need, 
Don't be stressin', send them in my direction please
How many times our potential was anonymous
But I'll do that on Mondays, I don't have to work away
Give me something to dream about
You can see that we don't have to get along
Oh oh oh oh, sing it right back, I like it like that
I'll stay inside and find a pitch that sounds right
Some songs see us sailing away
And tell me bout your song  
When love came and hit me in the eye
Will a lady pin me in her hair 
We skip inside of the store
Cherry Pez, Cold Crush, rock star Boogie
You have a hammer baby break down the wall,
Umi she'd say
Your children have grown
I'm tired of the books and I'm tired of the tables
I'm staying at home tonight 'cause I don't want to know
By the winding stream
When we all cried together
Not back for a day
I heard he wrote you a song
But you're always on the run
Got nothing but funny money, man New York Dogs
Wednesday's gone
We've never had a fight
Knowing there ain't no sucker in the world
A melody is like a pretty girl 
Now face north
I've had a hard time, very hard time
When you're tossing, when you turn in your sleep
And with this gift I compose words
I have a love for this world
Everything's happy underground, everything's happy underground
You're inside
And as the howling winds subsided, the locals ran out, all waving their hands and singing
They saddled the horses in cobblestone yards
But we are okay, we are alright
Hopelessness got some by the throat you can see it in their eyes
Everybody knows you are a liar
Don't it mean a thing
And drinking a beverage
Everybody has to get their hands on gold
So I can stop running and the air can hum
There's no one quite so perfect
Oh, how I need a hand in mine to feel
We are the stars of your sexy dream
And you gave me wings and I used them
To wait for you, yeah
With a girl I really don't like
It's too late to phone her now
Then I met a man with a fist for a hand
And I've forgotten what food tastes like
Thinking of you like a movie star
And everything that makes you cry
That when I tell you that I love you, oh
But you know she's getting something other
Well I know when you're around 'cause I know the sound
Pay the monkey back,
She got very tired of picking up girls,
And we're outta space and you're out of space
Going up in the fire
Oh yeah boy you can always count on me
You don't need that soul, well that's fine, alright
I got nothing to say but the things I know
'Cause you make me feel wild
More words than I had ever heard
Let your body sink into me
Oh she's so southern so she feels the cold
Mass romantic fool wears Foster Grants, his books on tape ring true,
I know where to go but I don't know where to stand
I was raised in a Catholic school
A pretty girl is like 
I need you here like you've always been
You know you really gonna wet my dream;
And if you do, then you're my friend
And you looked so cute there, rainbow styling
And then I saw your face in the airplane window
This is your heart, it's alive
Something so beautiful and chilled to the bone
I said something on the surface 
Some things last a life time
I was frying on the bench slide in the park across the street
We ain't gonna go it alone no more So let's get on
Oh baby Don't stop me now I'm having a good time
'Cause when the sun always shines down on your shoes
To live in the moment
Landslide, rocks are falling
Can't forget
"What's the day What's you doing How's your mood How's that song"
Get your green green tambourine, let's play in the park
There's no stopping me
Well, I ain't wanting to shed no blood, that's your crime
It's something I will never do without you
Dddon't stop the beat
I feel the weight of it all, can't brace myself for the fall
The water's gettin' warm, so you might as well swim
And have a baby boy
The time has come for me to be someone, a rich man, a superstar
Two peas from the same pod, yes we are
Far away
But I'm alright though We're alright though
I'm a gallery of broken hearts
We all have a story of adolescence and all its glory
An infinity of dancing white light
It's okay if you don't know everything
To get me through till the end of May
Above the sky, I, I, I
But if you're a friend of any sort
It's  o'clock on a Friday morning,
Try to help the human race
This feeling treats me so strange
Flowers grow through my window and I love you again
I always knew you were a fraud
And when I come home When I come home, yes, I know I'm gonna be
So save me here 'cause I can barely stand
They want to see your sun shine
You want my love
You never knew what I could find
By the time we hit Tucson your parents little girl,
And the time to film a girl whilst you spitroast her
We're solid gold
Dive straight in at the deep end
You can ride downtown and stay warm by the fire
Home with items in my bag from your house
If you wanna be happy for the rest of your life
And when we're making love
'Cause I've got nothing real, just empty space to fill
Call on the man
Friends walk together, la la la la
The monkey on your back is the latest trend
And all the children I have fathered
Kneel to condition all the feelings that you feel
If we could both find a way
Not falsified to say that I found god, so 
Clap along if you feel like happiness is the truth
Trying to get around
To go away and not look back
But then you came and it soon departed
I see no reason
And I use mouthwash  Sometimes I floss;
You fall in love, zing, boom
They are like emeralds
I wanna be the one you shield
The words you long to hear
We, we are alone 
Out on the streets, where I grew up How I got over 
It's only us, it's us right now
I am the white in the walls
It's a perfect day for getting wild
Still I try to be good to you,
Mister Blue, you did it right
A walk on sand, a fire I can warm my hands 
I know you never felt romance
That's OK, that's the way I like to be
'Cause I found some kind of fairy tale
She laughs as she dances, her feet wake the flowers
It is the soundtrack of your everflowing life
But nothing happened every time I tried
Open hydrant rolled down windows
I didn't mind what I did
And as the doors fly open even the promoter smiles
I know how to make you forget her
I send you flowers but you don't care
Suntanned bodies and waves of sunshine
He picks up the mail from the slot
I'm breathing new air
Oh little brother please refrain from doing that
I liked you from the start
List of your charms
And she's looking at me
Blue eyes, blue eyes
Eh, eh eh, eh Wish he'd never looked at me that way
Still waiting for someone at the station
When everything is wrong I'll come talk to you
His girl Friday
I'll give her anything she want if it look good on her
You've gotta hold, hold open my eyelids
Make room we're taking over here
When I'm all alone
She passed out before we even got to talk
My heart shrinking
I'd go from door to door
Hey, it's all on your head
I'm gonna break the spell she's got on you
I was just stumbling around, around
Lives which have played a part
I'm gonna be the man who gets drunk next to you
Ain't got no God
Just open your window and follow your memory upstream
A kind of love that reconstructs and remodels the past
Long before I knew
How I'm barely breathin'
Down your way
Oh yeah, I tell you something
'Cause I'm sleeping in the back of a taxi
Bring me what I need so
One, two, one, two, three, four
When I fold the cold in my jetlag palm
Baby, you're sailing today
It's only words
Destination didn't even ask
Yes I admit it's getting better Better
We are the tourists in the cafes
"Hey, I wanna get better"
Composing their songs of love
To make some dreams come true
You don't need in reserve
I remember what I had
Ooh, woo, ooh It's the reason why my heart's been racing
You are on my mind
It's not my imagination My imagination
So when the shit came down why she was nowhere to be found
I've seen a half a dozen ghosts but I don't believe 
Oh I want to learn such simple things
Ooh I'm in the mood for dancing, romancing
By the name of Rosie May
But they were promised more from this life
But after last night we're through
I let my guard down
But you wouldn't even come around to see me
We've got our feet on the wire, talking 'bout flying
But you're waiting at the door
Ghost figures of past, present, future haunting the heart
Cause there's nothing like seeing each other again
Oh yeah, they're gone so fast, yeah
I was a lonely soul but that's the old me
Let's kill tonight
Some things in life are unforgettable
But there was nobody to answer
Ebony and ivory and dancin' in the street
Ooh, woo, ooh I've found what I've been missin' lately
How are you doing
You tell me that you've got that type of lovn' here to stay
It's always been about me, myself, and I
In the van we dubbed the Gary Glitter
But I promise you that I will always try
Hold me now, don't start shaking
All of this will end
Hey, hey, what'd you say
I feel it all, I feel it all, ha
Nothing to say but "What a day, how's your boy been"
Well look out, Sunshine, here they go
But I wish you'd let me be 
Say it out loud it'll be okay 
They say love is a stream that will find its own course
Where the Caribbean Sea is blue
And the first one tore a picture
I did once before, but this is pretty bad
I guess I'm stuck in this mad mad world
Hey, I live for that look
But now I've got it
And do you dwell upon the thoughts that I occupy
And quoting lines from all those movies that we love
You got to weigh what you say to help you shape the way you play
I'm never gonna stop the rain by complaining
Carry ooheehooheehooheehooheehooh
I see the place that we belong together
You love the danger in the night
We been holding it so long the wait was killing me
Something tells me I'm into something good
And the sea is just a wetter version of the skies
And there's no other place I'd ever wanna go
Meanwhile it's getting late at ten o'clock
I think that this life is darker than the view
C'mon, c'mon wegotta kick that gangster shit
Won't you come home
You better look it over
War is there a war
I'm a dream that died by light of day
Sick of playing my part
You've got your mother's cheekbones and your father's crooked smile
No need to keep stressing from our everyday life on our minds
The only thing that I can do is hold it in, hold it in
When they're messing with the dreamer
Where is the father, Son
Another one lost to the winds of change,
Of the leafless trees
Planet earth presents you
Sell your soul, like we did, tto Rock & Roll
You mother
One day these could be the days but who could have known 
And all this time I've watched it change
Wake up it's a beautiful morning
 years off in this game, still nuttin changed, feel me feel me
On the radio
Just you and me let's break it down,
Eeer, wooh
I left my heart in San Fransisco 
And we're rolling up to sand
When you stepped out into the world to start your day
People are people regardless of gender
She's the one that keeps the dream alive
I be rollin' on up
For the rest of your days
And I told her that I'd be back someday
Oh I'm searching
'Cause I'm a man, not a boy
You can let somebody know on the 
And if I knew what we'd go through 
For the ladies of the lawn
Ain't bein' done to you
Someday
Making love in my bed
And I never want to be your little friend, the abject failure
Plenty of girls and boys in love
Oh, this time
You'd get a seven inches
Darling, all of these awkward jump start stalling conversations
Somethin' in your eyes went and drove me crazy
Clap along if you feel like that's what you wanna do
There was a game we used to play
You're changing your heart
We can't see quite right
Huddled up with fear and hate because they know their fate and it's a lot to put them through
Couldn't keep your love from me
Asleep inside, a parasite's appetite
Boredom murders the heart of our age while sanguinary creeps take the stage
Rock is dead they say
She likes to sleep and I love to stay up all night
She will still moan, "Keep your hands to yourself"
Yeah, that's where mine go
No girl, oh yeah
Because the blinds were shut
I ain't scared uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh
You know we're sure to please you no matter what you do
Sometimes you make me feel so high
Tell me something, do you love him, does he love you too
You make me restless
And the shame was on the other side
Not called for weeks now
But now you got to make it on your own
No playtime locked away
If yer always tryin' to get to the top
Look at all the people and take note of the setting behind
and how your forthrightness betrayed a secret shyness, 
And let time, all of that time, all of that time, all of that time go
I stand outside under broken leaves
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off
Well do you want to fall apart
Every day is ice cream and chocolate cake
I tried to hide behind tired eyes, I sigh
I'll carry it all
'Cause we are just seconds 
Like a pen needs a page, to learn right you need a mistake
I wouldn't be so scared of dying
What do you want from me and my scars
First time in the backyard
We want the new temptations woh oh, oooh
What's the glue that holds us in
Oh yes I can make it now the pain is gone
But she only cums when she's on top
Heartbreak
So doctor won't you pull the fucking plug Won't you cut the cord
And know Matt Rouse and Jest are watching me achieve my dreams
I've already had your kind
Through someone else's eyes
Got to remember to fight
I'm seeing a thousand stars
Being gentle with the people who were knockkneed from the fall
If you see a woman dressed in black
Love is the greatest thing our heart can know
I'll take my chances
And fight back the undertow
Put a mistletoe upon your mother's blouse
You found a girl that you could truly love again
I can only love you
But I'm holding back, that's the strength that I lack
You could swap or lend me
I'm not a child I know, we're not going steady
They're in the car on the highway
I'm caught in the crossfire why can't we get along
And she purrs like a kitten till the lake pipes roar
Woman, I don't need it
But you never let me fall
Dressed me up in womens clothes
And no one will ever know it if I keep my mouth shut tight
But ooh, Mr DJ, baby, can you meet me outside
The sky was yellow and the sun was blue
I wanna make you feel alive
You'll be mine to hold each day
I've been waiting a long, long time
Seattle, ride wit' a G, Jersey, ride wit' a G
Don't let it go
They're people, you're not like them
You're just trying to be cool in front of your mates
Rurururun
The lights go on
Good life
This phenomenon
And opens the canvas and out comes twelve
If you leap awake in the mirror of a bad dream
I'm taking my time, but I don't know where
Which means you and me, my love
They're not gonna make their money back, you know
So I take the stairs and hit the gym
The policeman
Oh, oh, one more drink and I should go,
I'm feeling blue, 
I woke up today with this feeling
Saying, I'm looking now at pictures of us
I put my hand dans ton panier
Oohoohooh
Get it, get it, 
About the people we see
You hold my arm and wait forever and look me in the eye
Just love the way that you move
One I handed an apple
Want to fall in love tonight
I've fallen for you
Girl you're out of your mind, you're my partner in crime
We just can't stop it
But I noticed that I didn't really feel
I think about you every day
Please take my hand, here where I stand
'Cause it's kinda funny to me
Yeah such a big day
Oh I hope I'm not alone
'Cause he don't feel right
It's got me wondering if you ever dream of me
If it is, then this might just work
He is a foreign man
The moon rise up and turn to silver
Oohdo your thing
Maybe you got something to prove
Yeah, we're alright though We're gonna be OK
Oh, I need what the world can't give me can't give me
There's a system of symbols that no one can vouch for
I guess it really depends
I've got the gift of one liners
City city won't you calm down
With roses round the door
Can we get away
You are the cover of my magazine
I wanna be the one you steal
And wash this world away
Die die die
I made history, honey and got "Please do it again"
Hey won't you show me where the money is
I've been a bad, bad boy
Almost everybody died
With the air, like I don't care baby by the way
And the lighting is fine
Cause all your wrongs are wrong and you can't make em' right
But you stopped yourself and kissed me
'Cause your friends don't dance
Into a torch and hope that it stears you home
Yeah, I don't fit the shoes
Said, I'm a believer, yeah
You'd come to the conclusion
And all the pretty people party while the petty people shout
Give me a moment Give me one shot
You go tie a string around us
Do ya, do ya, do ya, love me
Get comfortable, get unfrustrated
Miles and miles
Someone once told me
I'm on my feet, I'm on the floor, I'm good to go
I've got a red belt around my mind
I'm pacing, waiting anxiously
Restless future burning bright 
The numbers come like a revelation
With the roar of cars and the lolling of the café bars
I never knew there was someone
Do ya, do ya dream about me
You gotta realize that
But don't tell me he could look good if he tried
So fancy free, hey, but you say
I'm thinking baby you and I are undeniable
When you wake up shouting "Idea"
But now I wake each day
It's a dance floor now 
If I could part
Man shot to the moon
But I'm not a roll of Charmin so don't give me no crap
Now when it came to bells and whistles, Jackie did not lack
I can feel again
In search of lost time, with the magic of true light
For the perfect time to come
Your folks told me you should be left alone,
You know you love me and it shows
To get your attention
A dream transmigrates its way in the dark 
The night is young and so am I
Match the curtains and the floors
When I'm so far away
Lets you know you're home
They didn't know that his faith was earthly bound
And if it no work we do a stickup and whipup a concoction
Open your eyes look around you
It's gone on long enough
She feels good she does
And go get us a loan
Better get to the table, get to the table on time
Payback the donkey, payback,
I wouldn't be offended
I like the sound of his voice
And it don't have to make no sense to you at all
I'm gonna make a supersonic woman of you
Now I'm blue as I can be
Do I start to feel like I'm losing myself
I see you hidden in the night I found you
We hit the streets with all we had
When I am full with endeavor
Look up the number
Driving slow on Sunday morning 
Aaaaaa, for you, ba ba ba ba babaaaa, yeah yeah yeah
Mama, someday you'll be so proud of me
And nothing but good times to show
Into yesterday
You sure know how to control me
My heart is crammed in my cranium, and it still knows how to pound
If you put in the time
Are just a picture of my needs
Yeah we sailed through all the sleazy scenes
It's gonna be everything and everything we're meant to be
You won't hand me the chair
Hey, now, hear what I say
you're deep in a mine
Can drive to big family
But she threw it all away
Walking barefoot along the sand,
For so many nights now
You spit it out when all the flavor has gone
You could cut all the telephone wires
If you sell that soul, that's fine, alright
I don�t keep friends, I keep acquainted
Even just for a while
Before I go back to the Heavenly Father 
Je ne comprends pas
And he started the investigation
And you're holding on to me like an old love
And everyone keeps laughing at those cars we are passing,
The frozen city starts to glow, and
You're like some kind of wonderful
I wish I was a sea monster
That there's nothing for the kids to do today
Because there's only so many places you're guaranteed of getting a hug when you leave
Summertime love in the moonlight
There was people that she knew, at least she thought she did
I think we can fly and swallow fire
The most I have to say isn't really that revealing at all
Yeah, my heart needs a polygraph
However much she loves me I will always love her more
Any fool can think up words that rhyme
Is a little more elevation, take me back to where I can breathe
I say ya kill your heroes and
And, I thought, These shoes just don't suit me
Me, I write the song that ends right when it starts,
Ooh I'm dancing, dancing I'm in the groove, babe
But that don't mean we're not still family
My family's not rich by any means
Ain't no rhythm on the street
It's only right
Let the sun shine down from above
Some people are very kind
Buhhuhbuh waoohuh bo bo
From movin' on with an Oregon girl
Come over here with your heart Come over here with your
Just watching the world
Taking out the trash and the pictures that I stashed
We livin' in a war zone like Rwanda 
Like you wanna say "hi"
I'm coming back for more
You wear those shoes and I will wear that dress
What are you worrying about
I breathe in every particle
Nothing's ever gonna happen 'round here
And as my steps echo echo,
Cross the ocean way
That we could be fallin'
At a church rummage sale
Yeah, I feel just like a child 
Gonna knock you 'round the head
Some are worth while and some are so so
Any kind of creature she wants to be
You're out of line, out of line tonight
Where did you go while I was out
I gotta let you know
People running 'round, it's five o'clock
Hurricanes and floods, I still want you
Yea, a part of me 
You're so restless, it must be special there
Am I asleep or awake
When the worlds gone quiet
Denoted by a scene unfair
Millions of sunsets, but the one I'll remember
She's always running from something
A hazy day
Wash that sugar down
If you stay for a weekend
I hear the warning sign
But don't react now, you can't go back now
Was what I was waitin' for
I got nothing to do
Lovin' is what I got, I said remember that
I can weep through my own midnights
Ich weiß nicht, denn es ist mir irgendwie so peinlich
I'm fireyou're the ocean 
Only in your mind, ah, forget your mind
Nothing else but you and I
Turntables in my eyes
Written in blood and in your own handwriting
I'm done leaving if we can try
Forget about me when I'm on that plane"
To make babies crawl to windowsills and all
Holy Moses our hearts are screaming
Yours is the kind of love
So we packed our things, made tracks,
All the wild night breezes in your mem'ry ever
And break my back  tombstoned
Doin' the boogie all night long
Let our dreams grow out together
Listening to a sound
I thought about my space, and I really got me down Got me down
Kick kick shuffle shuffle back to the beach with a
To cover up the pain in us
I wasn't trying to impress those girls anyway
But you just say that we're all spinning
That you and I will walk together again
Today's a day to celebrate
And when I wake up in the morning
I get tired and upset
Your New Boyfriend Doesn't Know
I didn't even see it, then another one
Just like the dollar's gonna make everybody scream
I wouldn't have it any other way
Something's not right with these smiles and tantrums
It's time for tea and Meet the Wife
Blood and fire
But I know that I just wanna look some more
And the flower 
But my friends keep on telling me that something's wrong
Now, we got something for dinner
Well I don't wanna wait no more
Stop bein' a bad joke
As I focused on the time
"I woke up this morning out the door
I might add, its black paint and gold paint on
Are Don't it feel like sunshine after all
Creeped out into the sun
Would you be my American boy, American boy
Oh, I knew when you first said hello,
And when we're tired of the city
Stealing our thoughts with the force of their non sequiturs
Four days of the week
You make me bleed when I look up and you're not around
I don't believe in truth
Tell lies, tell diggory lies, tell chiggery lies, until you're lying in his bed
And I was just walking on one fine wire
Your eyes are the size of the moon
Oh, just when you think that you're in control
Just your lower lip on the floor
Baby, give me time
The canvas and the photographers are
If i ask 'how do you say' Colombian Accent 
All the baggage and dreams
Well, they bite
Tonight, tonight there's a party on the rooftop, top of the world
Something is about to be born
You know what I'm talking about
Well, then the search is through
I'm this natural wonder, yeah
No shit, I was cool, I had plenty fun
And I took the book, I lit the page
These shoes are poor man's ice skates
From sucking on my mother's breast 
He said oh yes you can, just hold my hand, I think that that would help
Do you know what it's like to fall on the floor
Below the Northern Lights, I spend my coldest nights
But I remember counting days down till the year could be done
You just wanna dance
And it ain't me, it ain't you, it's only us, it's us right now
The boy in the corner
Everybody gonna make it to the cemetery
These are the hymns that today we've ignored
Fill your life with something else baby
You kneel to condition all the feelings that you feel
Now, it's nothing but flowers
And this world seems a better place
I'm going home,
How it feels
But tonight I made sure that I sharpened it twice
But I've got my doubts and what if I'm right
It's all I ever done, so give me a reason to stay
Headed west to get the best of what we all knew then
Anything fly, it's all good, let me dump it
You paint my fingers and you paint my toes
With your job and with your life 
When I'm driving around, you are a radar detector
Well, we can do it better, yeah, I'm talking to you
Now the fuzzy stare from not being there on a confusing morning week
There must be enough love love love
And Warren Campbell on the keys right now
A little child
Because a sun burns what I needed
Don't want it to be over, move move slower
The way you move ain't fair, you know
Just can't let it go
Backwards through her vocoder, while
Junkies on the corner always calling my name
I love that everything you say is so funny
Although maybe all these moments are just in my head
If there's no parking on the street pull up on the front yard
And if the sword is hidden among you
I know that there might come a day my life is through
They call me Stacey
And if I ever had a wish in the whole world
If you wanna dance
I just wanna burn up hard and bright
Touch the fingers of my hand and tell me if it's me
Bravely I look further than I see,
Blue as the sky, sunburnt and lonely,
And don't you ever give away our underground location,
It's a real live mama and papa phone,
Pushed back her fringe, see her birthmark
The sun was out 'til midnight 
I told you a thousand times
With my I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming of age
Everything's always better
And saw you in the low light
And I gave water to all I thought were thirsty
Stand in the place where you live
When our tellies are six hours away
It's gonna hit you with a big wave
It's not a change, it's just a slight vacation
The one I'd better lead
I'm a good guy for a gal
A pretty woman makes her husband feel small
When you gonna do some damage, little brother
And on his journey and his travels on the way
With a new portfolio
Your trigger finger's cocked, and I'm feeling weak
Back to the room where it all began
Squeeze me baby all through the night
Won't you whisper your blues as heartfelt as you can
I want you here inside me,
Ist da etwa jemand
I want it all to be gone tomorrow
Who send their love from Amsterdam
The radar's got it wrong
Yeah we make a lot of noise
I wish you the best on your way, eh
And my eyes they've got some vision
Except everything you had and what was left after that, too, oh
Can I say
Melt me with your eyes
We all know someone,
Lala, how the life goes on ha ha ha ha
I was  years young
She had rings on her fingers and bells on her shoes
In this day and age it's so easy to stress
I could see into your window although you're far away
Berries in my heart bread
And though the road has got some steep climbs
Hide behind your half smile
Let's crash at your place tonight
Summertime, summertime
It's time to bring out the big balloons
So now I'm fallin', fallin' into the sublime
What you get is exactly what you give
Balleyes and their lipmouths in the night
It blooms to spread love and joy faith and hope to people forlorn
Until a god with a broom came and swept them away
Celebrate your side to a new division
Topic of the discussion, but beat it like a percussion
Won't you come on over, baby
My surprise, I woke up one morn
You said I never ever thought that I'd be messing 'round
I'll be president someday
Maybe I'll never die, I'll just keep growing younger with you, and you'll grow younger, too
Won't feel the same
And you told me that I would forget you eventually
Singing helps all right
Tryin' to guess which shell living hell sleeps under
Or inside out
They say "get to the table, get to the table on time"
For my head for my heart for it's true x
Hush hush yeah I knew why
I took a picture that I don't like to look at
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
And two to three minutes doesn't seem that long
And no one back at home
You're kissing your reflection
Dancing in the rain
This has been my hardest year
In this dangerous world
And I pull myself together
And say, "Your hair's on fire, you must have lost your wits," yeah
Nice day for a talk with your girl
And the day is rising
He doesn't need a house
Any traces of that other place
Nothing can push the feeling away
I've got my freedom
Just let it go
There exists a star above
I feel like I can't take too much longer
First we run, and then we laugh till we cry
Show me your ocean red
But she'll cry and never die
Remember when you moved to Nashville
Out for this girl
So bored to death you held your breath
But still he'd rather have his time than a bob or two
C'mon we gotta get that
Should quit their waiting on the divine
That is, unless they look right in, and
I'm telling the truth, said it don't win with pretend 
Well I don't cry when my dog runs away
Far out of my view
You got so much love in you
Dressed up in awomens underwear
Come on to my side you will define me with a knife
With an automatic weapon, don't nobody call a medic
Beautiful colors that came from you
Something going on but I don't know where
Your picture on my wall so gentle and modest
I want your arms to wrap around me twice
I don't feel like I'm fallin' 'Cause I'm so high that
A little bit of heaven but a little bit of hell
You swept my feet right off the ground, you're the love I found
Feels like I'm always losing
Johanna drove slowly into the city
How the moonlight will lead me
And some water for my throat
So they ask me, why you call it "Late Registration" Ye
To find our way home
And your hopes 
Billy the bookcase says hello
That are to blame 
Paper maché parade on at night
Why hello, hello, HELLO
The Neverending Story with Atreyu
'Cause here they come
If only I could always feel just as I do right now
The postman
It's like a thousand decibel punch in the face
You can feel but you won't sing
The bad rich, God's flying in for your trial
Woahohoh, come on, ohohoh, it doesn't matter, woahohoh, everybody now, ohohoh
It's all right, the camera's talking
I believe the love you talk about with me
I know I'll always be here
Can you inject love's tender touch back into the gang bang
"If he really loved me," she said
I can't stand the fact that this extremity is the center of my day
Never makes a sound
But the right words don't come my way
And out my toes my little blue baby grows
You know you're some kind of wonderful
And I will keep you company for those days so long and black
And never leave 'til I leave you with a sweet dream in your head
Or on an island by myself
Just leap don't look 
And a pretty pair of blueeyed birds
I know you'll relive every moment
I'm in love, I'm in love
Going to the fruit stand to buy a dozen oranges
I'd like to change my point of view
In the darkness I will not be found
These sidewalks liquid then stone
We give them the games we play, she said
I couldn't tell the truth
And if you don't have a home you can buy one there
A look, a laugh, a smile, a second passes by and I regret it
You gave me love then took it away
Stay in bed until Sunday
I'm closing up inside and I was only just started,
Free the mayhem in your mind, release the need inside of you You're gonna suffer
You have shining eyes
I can see it in your stars
Trying all the time to find something that would make you mine
So baby, you'd better believe 
Pick up the phone  my jacks are all blown
I would go along with someone like you
Show me all the rules girl,
We'll never feel bad anymore
That can see through many lies
This is mine, you can't take it
Like a hundred souls escaping
I'm nothing but a sandcastle  Baby, don't blow me away away
The dancer, the fisher American, 'Merica
So say what's on your mind
That I'm not doubling back cause
In a tree
I built this cardboard neighborhoods disgrace
Spread your arms and fly
All of the money that you owe"
I won't be a fool for you no more my dear
Me hiding me head in the sand
And don't you take this the wrong way
Got my brains, I got my ears
Colours are where my old makes new
You're just a storyteller
Whip away the sickness
For fear of it falling harder
Yeah, I need you to help tie my shoes 
And I will flail under these lights
Teenage dreams in a teenage circus
It almost breaks my heart 
An argument for consciousness
Don't go dragging your name,
Boohoo I'm dying
Stealing our hearts with the force of the new evidence
If ever there's a girl
Now I wish you all the luck
Of the scene, as she turns
He said 'oh my dear listen here
But I know now that we were not the people that we turned out to be
The flower said "I wish I was a tree"
I just say I'm in it for the long run
There's a place I passed called OnceUponaTime,
What makes you feel alive
The ceiling's spinning 'round like I've been drinking
Walk a direction, see where we get
And is the base sweet pull shapes,
Everybody's gonna feel the beat
If only songs were sung to guide the doubtful ones
Hey, I'm in love
Somebody misses you when you're away
A whirlwind came into my life and he tried to rescue me
She knows when things are happening
And no, she don't know what I do in my spare time
Deep beneath the blue waves
And stay in bed until Sunday
Is I'm alone and consequently
I know that better things are on the way
Soon the sky will clear
And I say
Go tell sis I'm out the door
Yeah yeah yeah you know you're made in heaven
And time seems to go by so fast
Electronic world for every boy and every girl
Because you're not done
And incite the firmament's portrait of a drowning in Styx that gives impotents kicks
Watch your step along the arch of
Ça commence à faire froid ici
We mix up your guts, your insides xrayed
Please call to say that you miss me, feel me or whatever
The hint of alcohol and nicotine it keeps us warm inside
She saw the lights, she saw the pale English face
That the top floor is just an illusion
Nadie nos mira esta noche es nuestra
This world keeps spinning
He's the only of his friends not shot down dead
That when the sun comes up, there'll be nothing wrong,
And I'm like "The sooner the better"
But when the night is falling
There is an empty space in the chair tonight
Shape shifting city stretches and bends the night 
I really got a good excuse to complain
And touch me in the dark
He's got to keep his chin up
Well I guess it's just the way that things go
To know my stories I told are not true
I hope that you see through your picket
Didn't get that TV show
That we all, well we all, well we all are still family
Waiting for the light to go
I say my legs they're wearing baggy pants
This boy has broke down, yeah yeah yeah
In its love
The voices of the canopy singers
I'm kissing your lips and running fingers through your hair
was im Drink war
But did I ask too much
So we can start right now,
On a highway, on a highway
One thing
I'm here, I'm calling out your name
To get the first bread of the morning
Kiss up and rub up and feel up on you
See the sky in front of you
Just today
That you work you have no face
Once you get the feeling it, wants you back for more
Oh you cut out the middleman
Of things that I miss
A light that is fine and is filling the cryingest eyes
Home and away
I need high heels just to stand up
We gotta hurry in our worry to get done today
Will you come, will you go
There has been no one brighter than you
Just look to the rainbow, you will see
But you're gone
That stone that's locked you up in your blues
A chorus of car alarms, shoes on the powerlines
But my baby, you have grown
Does it rain where you are Does it snow
Then go out with a fight
Where did you go
For life is quite absurd
And now the smell of these wood frames
I hear the music all the time
Since I surrendered
Wonderful night falls
Everybody knows I've got the magic in me
One day I feel so happy 
And I bought a restaurant for his son named Alice
But I'd like to skip the small talk and romance, girl
And I will love your heart with mine, with mine
Look all around, there's nothing but blue skies
It's a place that we call home
Stepping out tonight, flying so high
It's all so safe and sound
Will steal your heart away
Another year and the job was done
Let me show you, girl
Everybody just hold hands
your eyes dilated as light plays upon the sight 
I like to hit the town on Friday night
Or its just vacation and we'll soon be friends
Oh badumday oh dum do dum de dooby do
It's you against the world
Must be something strange I kissed
You'd better run, better run, outrun my gun
'Cause I am losing my mind
Everything's gonna get lighter, even if it never gets better
Well I got Chinese children
When you and I are alone, I've never felt so at home
When you wind up next to me
Play it back in slow motion
Keeps me shaking up all night
I gotta find my place
I'll place a call around the world, operator get me Bejingjingjingjing
At the dance club
I see a rainbow, purple and gold
Of the churches still in style
So shave their legs, and make them look like movie stars
Lining up around the block
Oh I'm gonna try with a little help from my friends
Thunder's getting louder and louder
So, always look on the bright side of death
From the crowds mouth is perfect
'Cause I was never young, even as a boy
I'm making out tonight, with my computer
Soon, you will see the sun shine 
For no one's better sake
You know it only takes two words 
'Cause I say one word and then you're gone
Come and show me the magic
You my brown eyed girl
One as stunning and bold as Scarlet used to be
Small town hearts of the New Year
The picture was an old collage of something classical
Get together to tear it apart
Come and get your share
The TV man is too loud
I take it back, fullblown attack 
Make a little money, take a lot of shit
So c'mon try try Baby baby won't you try
Don't you know I feel heaven in you
You bite, it's all right
Anything goes
I get by
You have a fancy ride
If you find yourself out of love
When I rang that doorbell forever
It's said and done
I put my hands on a cellular phone
Sometimes I fake that I hate you and make up
What a golden age,
I love all the things that are wrong with you
All work, no play
Custommade for a daydreamin' boy
Just to keep her out of mind
Jessica numbers to the wall slip through
I thought it better not to fight, I thought there was a virtue in always being cool
It makes the world go 'round and 'round and 
Nothing else is love
You can see she's a beautiful girl
And turns out everybody claps, they don't believe in cabs
Its torturous analytical thoughts make me go insane
One day some day you'll miss me
But not for me, it shines for others
Not like in a book or the leaves and trees that shook
And I know you made your point but I just don't want to remember, yeah
Waste my days Whoaoh
Get the feel
The party's over, what was your favorite gift
I see the birds, they fly on something
Look at the sky
That I love you
Was it you who spoke the words that things would happen but not to me
We will rest upon the ground
And if you think you see with just your eyes you're mad
All you can think about is breaking free
'Round and 'round drama every time
Skates around and floats on air
Te lembr'o                     		        I remind you
Time comes and goes
Witchcraft, voodoo
Oh, I saw your face in front of me
Got you scared of ghosts in the dead of night
And don't worry 'bout it girls 'cause I like it like
Through rhinestone glass, all I see
I blame myself, Feel my head explode from a night of gin
I won't let you down
He knows his lover lies south in the city
Islands and cities I have looked
For dancing like you can't hear the beat
What did he spend it all on
We all know the girls that I am talking about
Love like a river, a river, it flows
That I'm tired of hanging around
And then I'm back coming at you with a biggity bop
We fell apart in the parties of the empty heart
Your head is there to move you around, so stand
It's like I didn't need to say anything or do much, I could tell
Down where the walls started shaking
Landlord's knocking at my door 
I wear your golden ring inside
I feel your whisper across the sea
I say, we can dance, we can dance, everything's out of control Out of control
I'll be here holding you high above it all
Við syngjum öll saman
Sometimes you get so low, you don't know why,
Holiday sun, OPQ
I only wanna find a way
Oh I'm away with the fairies now
Than tonight
Waking up to the green of your eyes
You'll have to shout even louder
I got my own brand of company
In an index looked up WhereitWas
I'd turn it off for this
Find a partner 
Abrígame en tu sol
It's not too late now to change your mind
I'm in love with the ordinary
It brought me back to life
And it's gone
When the one from our dream
To await and confront my big fear
They conspire in trying to keep us apart
Was there a second of time I looked around
How do you describe a feeling 
What would you give me for a trip behind your steering wheel
I'm alive  suddenly I am here today
The one that is warmed by sunshine every day
Got pink and black and blue
All I wanna do is move on
I won't go sinking this houseboat, it's so hard to believe
Mystery's a beautiful thing
But just until the fish start to smell
I got a, clip full of hollows, money makin's my motto
Hologram or telephone 
To win me some of your love
I'm still afraid to get lost, in a city I might explore
Sing me to sleep tonight and awake
But I never made the time
Is it me, or are they younger every night
And it's magic if the music is groovy
You got my heart beat pumping
It's time to roll down the windows
And then in a year or maybe not quite
And you will never touch my hand
I don't want to give you away
Hey, hey you, yeah you gotta be leaving,
Hearts need a mind, like a clock needs the time
And something without warning, love
He says, Why am I short of attention
Oh, to find truth in all my lies
This girl he thought she was,
Just smile and let it go
I need you now, I need you
It won't bow to your demands
Lucky to be coming home again
God made me, yeah
Give in, my friend
To smile, laugh and flirt
They're not demands, they're just the plans
Should I choose to stay here now all depends 
Livin' with Louie Dog's the only way to stay sane
I was a lonely soul, but that's the old me
No need to worry 'cause
You could've been getting down to this sick beat
We can get crazy let it all out
Completely out of reach
But she was young and dumb, she'd just turned twentyone
Slot machines, dingdingdingdingding, when they ring off
Standing in the pouring rain
I like this kind of, hot kind of music
Oh oh oh oh everybody, sing it right back, I like it like that
Walking free walking free in harmony in harmony
I'm comfortable enough to feel your warmth
Get a house in Devon
I take you on a trip
I hallucinated I could read your mind
Merry Christmas baby
You'll never believe the view
Oh my heart is numb
But I can't blame you, baby
That I know wrong from right
Which has not only hit me in the face
If you do it wrong you could do time 
All seemed to vanish into thin air
There's sweet fluorescent enemies that live inside of me
When my pass came in, you dropped the ball
And hear your favorite songs
I spin around the door to make sure that it's locked
As if you've forgotten of your own life, forgotten of your own face
Waiting for the day you're not looking for something else
The sweetly sleeping sweeping of the Seine
Gonna' paint the sky so red that I won't wanna feel
Yeah if I lived in Oakland, they'd still be Chinese children
Wherever I lay my head
When I'm falling down
C'mon get up and just follow the tempo
I got my mind set on you
No doubling back
To step out of your cradle is like coming down
Or was it in my head
Thinking of me while you are far away
All things go, all things go I made a lot of mistakes
Oh, for that I'd say it's worth it, just use a blade that's short and sharp on me
We let the runners win
On the pretty waves
Come on like a freak show takes the stage
Snow banks and drifts down the hillside for you
Form a line through here
Just grab the stuff and hit the door
Sometimes I'm naked and thank god sometimes you're naked, well, hello
It will always be like this
My heart is bbbbeating double time, yeah
Your mouth, it moves but fails to speak
My heart is crammed in my cranium, and it still knows how to pound How to pound
And oh if you knew what it meant to me
You jumped into my heart, now I couldn't start
Two sad sparks blinking in the sun
Yesterday
Are summarised from the very start
There ain't a cloud in the sky, no nothing
It's in your blood but not in mine
Falling, yes, I am falling
'Cause if I had a set of wings, man, I know she could fly
Big boy, come on 'round Big girl, you are beautiful
I used to see you every day
And I have found my feet,  weeks
When we walk along the shoreline
I'm gonna watch you shine
The strong men, the children and even the cowards 
They keep things loose they keep it tight
Everything is all right, now My computer
Knowing ahead, there comes a fork in the road
And I just can't, can't get over you
Lead me out on the moonlit floor
And when I finally kissed him
I can buy my own cigarettes
It's the times we say
I always wished the night was twice as long
Music is my sister
You took me southwards on a plane,
"Send your heart out for repair"
Well then I hate to say it, but it's obvious
It's a precious child
Everything you do is all I need to know
So do you want to go to the plage with me
And the world is so much meaner,
To rid yourself of vanities and just go with the seasons
Watching all tha lightning fill up the sky
Yeah, we shut our eyes though we're in doubt
And so it goes another lonely day
Wasn't alive back in the sixties
And everybody's features have somehow started blending
Give me a shot at the night
But all you say is we're all spinning
But you counted all the seconds and it made you feel worse, 
Into a blushing romantic
It's like I never had to see it in your eyes or feel it
It might seem like a dream
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep
I say soda, soda
To my friends in New York I say hello
Eyes bright, uptight, just girls
To the floor
'Cause you're my air hostess
I didn't think much of it till I took it apart,
Cars have run on gasoline
Well maybe I'm a little bit slow
Said if you want to get with me
So, I can call
Lie around all day have a drink to chase
And there we're gonna do baby
Your love, lifting me higher
'Man about the house' with Paula Wilcox
We want to give you the bbbeat beat back
That you fear, what makes you withdraw
Out of this town
Don't be so unkind
Didn't have a camera by my side this time
Like everything happens for a reason
So please don't let go
God made love
Some people ride the wave of mediocrity
Lazy sunny day
And I'm juggling all the thoughts in my head
Your hair down to your legs and your legs down to the floor
You act like there's nothing wrong, you laugh when I call on the phone
Leaving you alone
That I'm about to lose my mind, mind, mind
I sat on feelings that I buried deep down
Don't let the moment slip away
Ba, bada, baba, oohooh
A little sunshine sympathy
Till it's time to go
You know you twist, little girl twist, little girl
Instant Karma's gonna get you
Get on the dance floor
And you saw it in my eyes
And now I'm having more fun
Go ahead and take the town
You gotta be brave
But not a drop fell on little old me
Come on baby, let me tell you
All around I see raining
All night they're playing
I know I'm getting nowhere when I only sit and stare like
It makes the world go 'round and 'round and 'round
Just mine and my baby
Frightened cornered Gemini tactics and
, people think I'm something I'm not
I take my time, there's no need to hurry 
Beautiful songs of love
We'll give you shakes and we'll make you sweat
And I can't understand what I'm after
And when the summer's here, the waves are crashing
It wasn't nothing for 'Quence
You'll alway know you got someone
I know you've got a lot of good things happening up ahead
Ask me what I did with my life 
That I'm passing you by, so fill your little world,
Wondering will you call
If you have a broken heart or a battered soul
You can put some money on it, you can place a little bet
And I know that I'm never alone
Six pounds and seven ounces A ball of bones and flesh and tears were you
Don't want to be spun around
In time I'd find
They're sent by some teenager and kid whoever you are
I promise I've always been like this
Pictures of your mama
I'll end it, don't you start it
We're one in a million
You'll never stand my fight
But don't say victim
Timbaland
But you're still mine
Were we just making time
Baby's got a worship like a river on the cusp
I just wanted to talk to you
That's been around for centuries
I'm everything you s'posed to be, boy, ain't no runnin' over me
You're my heaven, you're my spaceman in your shiny shiny suit
Lost in another world far away, never another word till today
We All have teeth that can bite underneath
If your romance is
Could it be anybody
It's just the bureaucrats that won't give me a mortgage
We clean up and now it's time to learn
Oh I got so much I'd like to give
Don't let your white dress wear you out
We can't be wrong, so say 'solong'
'Cause I made this bed
Then I look at you
The only child, my little brother was he
Beat beat of the song song
I fear I won't see surprise
Today seems like a good day
So at my show on Monday
There's nothing threatening controlling me
Please come home
The bayonets clamor on all night, hemming scars into the hillside
How are you today
Don't you know they ain't never going to help you anyway
You in my arms
You're never gonna bring me down, don't come around
Flew to my heart
But really I'm not actually your friend
Come and ride with your boy, man Hey
The dream maker's gonna make you mad
Above her dying mind were fossilfied memory imprints of her favorite day
They never sleep, they never will
There's gonna come a time when the scene'll seem less sunny
Making a lot of noise up there, throw your hands up in the air
Ashes to ashes and funks to funky
The things that I know I should do 
Measure worn out epigrams for signs of change with age
'Cause love's gonna get you down
Óró mo churaichín ó Of your eyes, but you're disguised like a sleepyhead 
This shit's making me feel bad
I'm sick of slow rock, I'm sick of quick quips
The waves are crashing by
And I will make a lovely
Hush hush we both can't fight it
And forget my English
One night in October,
We walked along lonely streets and got to know ourselves
The fields are throbbing fresh cut bruises
Where troubles melt like lemon drops
About everything
Don't let the sun be the one
That we don't dare sing
She's been with every girl in town she's been with every girl in town
Bitching because Steven booked us
It's just a matter of time, before we learn how to fly
People are just people
If you should say we're through
Where they always have belonged
So have a taste of my bass 'cause the girlies got smiles
You took your love babe, took your love babe
It might seem crazy what I'm 'bout to say
Não há paz  There is no peace
Keeping their voices down
But it won't be long before my turn is next, to express
Oh girl
The ringmaster's Telecaster sings on an empty stage
And out below the streetlamp like an orphan with a halo
And threw him out that window, he went
Hits the bottle and goes right to the rocks
Would you lock the door
The morning's on it's way, our friends all say goodbye
Here we are, no one else
A different kind of tree"
Pitch black in my room I need some
Hawaiian air
Because tonight we're singing these here songs to everyone
Shake it, shshake it
All the lovers I take
Do the chicken payback
Still wears the locket 'round her neck
You'd be damned to be one of us, girl
Caught up in the things that you could do without
When I felt the way that I do right now, right now
Third time they called me was cold as ice,
You got everybody listening
And know everything's okay
I got my arms, got my hands
I shake it off, I shake it off
It's war zone baby do you want to survive
Giant heart, down in this dust
That I'm unstoppable and that no one can bring me down
But I got something that I gotta do
I'll stop the world and melt with you I'll stop the world and melt with you
Run run over the hills, can't feel the bouncing balls around me
'Cause on my feet are shoes for dancing
Got stung all over
Twisting, turning bodies burning look up from where they lie
Oh, say can't you see  The chemistry
Could see another kind of mind there
And are their actions hand in hand with what you want to portray
'Cause I've been here a million times before
It's been fun but now I've got to go
I sang along while I was swinging
Some chimps that wish they could be mine
You know that it doesn't matter as long as we got each other
Wanna make love show you what I can do
North of England way
Into the arms Of anyone
Time to think of something new
Tap the beat on the wheel as the tires spin
I turn myself in, turn turn turn
I love you so, baby, love me the most, baby
I'm laughing at the sun
We are born forgiven and forgotten of our sins
calcium mines are buried deep in your chest 
It starts in my toes
Pressed up to the window
Ain't going nowhere, like froze baby
Out of no numbers, some harsh looking colour
And I got stripped of my soul, standing in my shoes
Below, the country rolls like a mighty boiling sea
And the answer's is not the one he was looking for
Neighborhoods under the lights
Oh please, Daddy, please"
You're in your head, you're all turned around with it
You let me get in dans ton lit
I see that raincloud coming right for me
I don't always tell the truth
So ride it all and don�t forget you got to tell us your story
Hello we're back
Jessica numbers tell me if we're clear
Oh, with a whimper in the place of a bang
They beat themselves on the backs with chains
I don't care, whoa oh oh oh
Run the lip off sunshine shore
Here I am in the graveyard waiting for a war
It always works out the way it's meant to be
I used to have to stay in this locked up basement
Lo and behold; she's walking over to me
I don't know her name,
Whatever it is it's alright
Shake shimmy shake shimmy shimmy
But my breath fogged up the glass
Losing her lover
Well I just take one last look around
In the middle of a shave I call your name
Oh, oh yeah
I don't think she'll know that I'm saying goodbye
Behind the shelter in the middle of the roundabout
Felt the need to get up for it
And we're riding through the night
So I go driving all around and I'm denying all the sounds that hit my ear
Albums back as you're lying there
To save my soul from all these troubled times
We take back everything we said to
We are here to take the blame
The channel numbers change
I know it's dumb to say
We can hear it in the back of our minds
Words are found too close to the edge
Did I sail through or drop my anchor down
And no I haven't got a clue
You torture each other from day to day and then one day you part
Everything will go, it's all right baby
You are now the king, and you will be a truly great king
I can watch a sunset
In and out of love
Watch your step along the arch of glass
And no one wants a tune about the th luftballoon 
This is my sound 
Just go and listen, and it'll start with a smile
You're lost in your mind
I watched my old habits die and it was painful
It seems I'm less afraid of life itself than of what you see
The people there where dancin' on it 
More housing developments go up named after the things they replace
I'll still go on loving you 
Moved out of the house, so you moved next door
We're struck by the still of the moon
Take off your shoes and socks
Oh yeah gotta make your way to the top
But you'll turn into something
Ikea plywood, brushed steel
And maybe you'll understand 
Will you wait until tomorrow Will you wait until
What, you think I'm up all night
Winter's cold is too much to handle
Goodness gracious I can't seem to stop
So shake it, shake it
That would be my two feet
And when it's clear it means she's completely emotionless
I found you sleeping next to me, I thought I was alone
It's always say goodnight and go
'Cause I want to pick peaches off of a cherry tree
Just 'cause he can't hear what you say
It's far too early in the morning,
Oh intensive care,
Icy Cola Cokea, Sprite I love the mosta
No one else, nothing else but you and I
No, in fact, I'm sure of it
You're no fun at all
Throw it away
And our mouths  In tune
There's nothing left but shadows on the wall
Every sunshine hides a cancerous chime
Till the light was absorbed by the night
Keeping my head down
'Cause I'm the ugliest guy 
Woahohoh, all you singletons, ohohoh, even the white kids
And time stood still
When all fires are fanned, when we're shucking our plans, when we're too weak to stand on our two feet
Today is where your book begins
Your coffee's warm but your milk is sour
Keep the beat up, lets drop the beat down
It's gonna hurt but I'll have to say goodbye say goodbye
I feel so lonely
You stand on your own
My head's been lying dormant like a sleepy little mouse
This familiar environment
Why must I be a teenager in love
With neon lights and nightopen bars
To The Village Voice
Anything you want me to
Paint a picture with my hands 
At the place where lost is found
Would I get up off the floor
But every time I look at you I just don't care
The satisfaction of your love
Cute in a stupid ass way
You got yourself a job cleaning hospital floors
You humble people everywhere I don't mean to hurt you
The walls the walls are coming down, the here and now is coming round
I'd wait all night
'Cause I broke the skies that shined above
We shared a cigarette somewhere
You're walking down that Pensacola beach
You've got your bad apples to ruin your bunch
And the stars in their cars roll their tops down for you, singin'
You must try to understand try to understand
As word across the window frosting out
Do the chicken payback,
Keep my head way down
I've got emotion dripping out my pores
Or is there isn't a war anymore
And you haven't got a friend
Stumbling ahead of me
On the street I was passin' my time away
How nothing in the world seems to be
Little brother
As his smiling face just shines away
We walk
'Cause I'm done
Whatever you do, whatever you say
Anywhere you looked was
And you walk wet streets, tryin' to remember
And you say you belong to me, and ease my mind
Love it love it 
Love stands beside
, the heart was not your master
You turn the dial, I'll try and smile
On finding a new planet and naming it right after her
And, I'm seeing stars as I'm rubbing my eyes
The tribal wars
And I wonder if she's been pressed against an unfamiliar wall
I'm feeling alive again
If you're single, but looking out
Holding on to his words but baby
The way she say she never give her lovn' for free
Only my tears satisfy the real need of my heart
I'm half drunk and I can't see straight
I've been an evil tenor, I filled the innocent's doeeyes with glue
If you could make everybody poor just so you could be rich 
I like the way he's speaking, his confidence is peaking
So afraid of getting bored
Care to put your life in mine
Throw all on your clothes, the second side of Surfer Rosa
Just enjoy the show, oh, oh
And your shape on the dance floor
You give to the next on down the line
All the blondes are fantasies
But I'll break them to
I see your sun is shining
Lovin' is what I got, and remember that
To stop our clever busyness and let go and dance
I'm walking down this road of mine, this road that I call home
Are we done
Silly girl
Now I've got these chores and I'm never going to hurt no one
You make my heart go boomboomboom
So go home
I knew when we collided, you're the one I have decided
Used to love me, now you hate me
With faith we would not fade away
Or an old ghost friend we don't believe in
Yeah well I believe it all is coming to an end
And then it's time for lunch again
And I've got you to propel me, but I still need so much
Big man yeah walking in the park
'Cause I'm gonna ride it till it hits the ground
And sometimes it takes more than a lifetime to know
And the Sublime style's still straight from Long Beach
The taste of scotch rich on my tongue
Trying to catch your eye
The stakes are high, the waters rough
Burning up the homeland
That we're nothing at all
I've got a mild fascination for collectors
And all of your kind words amounting to naught but a token
Because I have been sleeping badly lately
Shimmering, travellin' light, echoing love at first sight
Whatever gets you through the night, it's alright, it's alright
With Tom the astronomer, who'd name a star for you
I can't wait to hit the stage
Throw it on the fire
Reruns get me so bored
Let it all go by Looking at the sky
Why won't you believe in it, till it's gone
I might find the one
And I wonder what the boy was thinking
Use it tonight
Kulumani, Kulumani sizwe
Nobody's ever gonna,
And you have nothing left to lose
Cheers to the husbands that tag along for good luck
Over hill and highway the banana buggies go
He's got me runnin' around the office like a gerbil on a wheel
As long as we're together
I left my homework in the launderette
Whenever you touch me baby
When times are tough in your new age
More than just a toy in a patchblue suit
You got everybody going
In uniform lines
Summer, summer, summer time to help us forget, nine to fives
The world can be yours if you let your heart 
Been mine since I was a child
That may be all I need 
All summer long
Right at the front door I recognised the perfume
Every single night ends up the same
I'd let you know all along I was
I wake up in a town that never sleeps 
I can laugh it in the face
Didn't understand
I hit the stage, go insane, then jump into that crowd
Spread some love
Sweet, sweet fantasy baby x
Before the regret you hold in your heart,
Like it means nothing
And you said "Hey hey ho, you know this is the way to go
Summer's gone
Tonight I might sleep in the car,
It's the bough we break to blow away
There's a cow and an ostrich just waiting for you
It's so hard not to bite it
And waiting for some high times to come again
The bluebirds fly
The prairie, the frontier Run from yourself, from your friends
But that's the way I like it
Sometimes I'd like the rain to end
Barefoot, naked, don't you let me go
Live live live live right now
It's Jade, the girl of the hour
Would you believe in a love at first sight
And I'm on a roll, don't you be late
I was picked up and then dropped off in a culture counterclockwise turned around
And stumbling through the street
By the time you get on the bus
Round and round
And someone's beaten up
Only in your head
All things know, all things know I made a lot of mistakes
But your time's coming around
Accidents and stars for everyone
So much I wanna say
He ducked back down the alley
Right in the prescription line
You should see the canals are freezing
And I've become just like a chemical stress
Till they know where they stand once they've reached the end
When I'm coming down to hit the ground again
This is the only place
If you knew all the answers and could give it to the masses 
'Cause listen kid everybody knows you can fit good company up your nose
And I love you
Don't call on your brother, odds are he's here and all
Give me your heart and I'll love you till Tuesday
A place for everything in the house
My ribs that show through tshirts and these shoes I got for free
You won't hear me, still you endear me now
The way it tastes right
Taking a ride to another clime
I had a million things to do baby
Some of the time
Trying to be a tough guy
Some day they will be forgotten and die one by one
Like she told her old man now
It feels less important when you want to wait it out
And you, you gots the stuff
Buy a house, settle down, do our thing
In the broad daylight
On my wall
They're gunning for us oh
Back to the middle of no where
hopelandic
And we blow away
In tired paths of light
It's time to masquerade
Cause I'll be in my own country, good and dead and gone to rest
I cry, mmmm, hello, little girl
How 'bout the tree back your house where the owls go
And leave our worries in the corner
But her eyes they tantalise
All our thoughts were coming in so clear beyond the myopic mirror
It's been too long since I've tried to take the time
You, you know, you know my name, baby Okay
Oh reckless, a boy wonder, so quiet, nose broken
But summer's free
And I can't see the woods for the trees
Well you know we all sometimes, say things we don't mean
In search of something greater
Me dicen que paseabas
Drive all night, go anywhere you want to
And will you call my phone out of regret
Taken out of my soul
That people should smile more
And even if we were it's not the scene you're thinking of
I heard a knock at the door
The golden years are meant to leave a gleam in your eye
It's separated only by scars
No me, no world, no mind, no face
And they just took her to the sea for the first time
For setting fire to bridges boats
All the things I wanna say
It's shaking the sky and I'm following lightning
Oh if you knew what it meant to me
I need to know, darling
And we both have to get it on before the summer's gone
It's more than you've got
Lightning, rain pouring down
Be quiet, the weather's on the night news
Oh home, let me come home
Everything good always would remain
Some people wear their history like a map on their face
The city we live in
For the loneliness you foster I suggest Paul Auster
Or are you, looking away
And don't say you won't
To see what it feels like now
The power to give
We will escape from the south to the west side
And through the dust the reels start turning
Yeah, I don't wanna run away
In the cold wet ground
To buy bread, milk and better homes and gardens
But it's makin' a stop on April first
All these beats
What happened to just messing around
Write our names in the burning sand
If I lived in China I'd have some Chinese children
We take a walk
You're wastin' all your time with someone else
Find someone, she's never coming back
No sticks, no stones could break my bones like you can 
It's so fine, it's sunshine
But there is always so much distance can't but feel it somehow,
So the sun always shines in the magazines
Yeah, every Friday I'm getting ready to roll
When you feel too much,
If I said "I love you"
That my life ain't living hell
She'd walk through the door and she'd set up the drinks on the house
Up in my air balloon, air balloon, air balloon, air balloon ha
Real sugar, that's what I want or none at all
I tried to chase things I couldn't get
There's a story in which my eyes shut
When the world seems to get too tough
My name would be Antonio
I wouldn't put much stock in fact 'cause the fact is
Because the last thing that I need is somebody like you
He's got a heart that will never never melt
Come on, come on, come on, come on, baby now come on, baby
Let true genius in the padded room remain
Come around, we'll kick your ass in
But that's OK, that the way I like to be
With the collar up so you won't catch a cold
I just wanna be your girl, yeah
These are days you'll remember
leaving its scars
I meant every word I said
I wish you were here today dear Yoko
All the time while you're looking away
She got a shack
Fading out the light, softly say, Get it out my mind, any way
Take it into town, happy, happy
Changing your ways 'cause you don't know what to do
In your eyes I see the eyes of somebody
Take a deep breath and hold it in, hold it in
Who is the one that leads me on through
Take off your overcoat, you're staying for the weekend
Do it for the money
I said from the start, that you could take it or leave it
I need some shit of my own, I need a throne
And times before that I was cruel
The neighbors can't complain, 'cause I've got my headphones on
Would he take it all back what they've done
You know you wanna go go baby
It's like I got this music
Seeing butterflies melting on the wall
I'm missing the moments as they pass
Da doo dada da, yeah, we're happappy
You mentioned in the letter
Town the line
Through countless deserts, dreams and jests
Still wrapped inside your rubber as I wriggle at your feet
She's so pretty but she doesn't always act that way
It's not you it's just all of the times I missed out
And for a moment I don't even care
It's not my imagination
Don't start without me, I just got in the club
To show me you understand
You motherfuckers better do your job and roll up, and watch how we roll up
When love and understanding are the ultimate crimes
You tell me guard my heart,
And now we're free to be number one, the morning isn't far away
It's a clear day
And everything seems to be
As I step into the night
This dream was me and you
I know if it's never coming back, it has to go
Nobody else, nobody else
We both have shiny happy fits of rage
To the space man movies I'd call my life
It's not what I say, it's what I do
Oh, nothing real can be threatened
Things are sent to try you
And I'm always pretty happy when I'm just kicking back with you
Make believe is much too fun
If our ever after ever had a chance to grow
Getting in the car again
The biggest group of friends the world has ever seen
My mind rejects the frequency
Moon people going to the stratosphere
There's nothing at all
And the way we were the day we climbed to the top of the
Looking at the trends of men down through your family
Do you wanna dance
So we trucked on down to try our luck along the Rio Grande,
You got me running around in circles 
Will shine for us as love sweeps over the room 'cause we tend to
The pockets in the air
I got love for them all, they'll
Now take the glitz back, I want the soul instead
There'll be no more movies for a week or two
You call this painting
So I'll take that train and ride
I look into your eyes, 
Hygiene boy, oh what am I to do
Shake it, shake it
To the whole human race
Everything that I broke till my feet went numb
Remember that tanktop you bought me
Stickin' with the wordplay
But it turns me on
I used to ride around
Live without your light
We walk the city,
I had my fill, and I know how bad it feels
I'm a little out of tune
And then these seven little men get up to dance
I just want to know today, know today, know today
Well, everything I've done
And there's nowhere else in the world I'd rather be
Relaxed as hell and locked up in cell , 
Oh say Wouldn't you like to be older and married with me
Cause there is no point in standing in the past cause it's over
This is not the way
For the good thing tonight
The fool, the drunk, the child, and his wife
Gonna make you a lover
My eyes on your eyes
Moved out of the house so you moved next door
Took a trip on a houseboat, it was fun, you and me
Monday, you can fall apart
Put it in the ground where the flowers grow
When my face is chamois creased
They'll work you like a dog 'til you quit or you die
From the low road
I want more fans, you want more stage
Hired a construction crew 'cause it's hell on the engine
What I want to say
'Cause I never knew what I wanted till I looked into your eyes
I knew I wouldn't forget ya
Brush my hair
You don't gotta keep no other man down
There's no need to cryah
What kind of candy do you want
Listen the night we met I fell in love with you
Feelin' better than some head on a Sunday afternoon
I can be sincere and say I like them
Baby, I've been waiting for you
Cause all the loudest voices in the world whenever I
They say that song Spaceship gave my career a facelift
Can't get enough of you, baby
Sometimes there's airplanes I can't jump out
It's up to you, now make your move
'Cause I got my friends
Into a place, where thoughts can bloom
Now, now there's no need to swear
Let the wild rumpus start
Where's the love
And hope that nobody does get through
Beep beep
Throw in the brittle skeleton fake tomb
You keep all your money in a big brown bag
This life is so confusing
What you have in mind
Walk a little line
You know me well enough to know that I'm not playing games
With a girl who lives
No way to build it up again
Don't need anything
He waves goodbye, to the town he grew up in
They've all got loaded guns
Hold me in your arms I'm just a boy like you
I think dreamy things as I'm waving goodbye
She wrote my name on a red telephone box
This moment will be gone
So let your arrow fly and sing
Nothing's gonna change there's no need to complain 
You'll never shine if you don't glow
I'm energyyou're the rhythm 
So why you gotta act like you know when you don't know
You missed my eye, I wonder why, please do it again
Rain is falling down on the sidewalk
Follow the wind that pushes me west
Out the blue or out of sight, it's alright, it's alright
Yeah, something that I want to let you know
Yeah but what you got, I don't need it
Stick and stones won't take his course
I got my smile
Can always get me cryin'
Turn tomorrow into yesterday
It's like a power
Well I'm shrinking bones in the sun 
I try to compensate her lack of love with coffee cake
As I looked up into those eyes 
 years asleep before we sleep forever
Wait 'til your mother and your papa's gone
Honey I think you're just right
Killing man
And stumble your way through the night
Honey, I'm afraid to say
Lay beside you, hear you breathing
Good, good, good, all right now
I get carried away, carried away, from you
Drivin' away
You say what you want to
Eric B man looking like touchitheshootme
I can see the ground approaching now
An opportune in a world of dreams
Alarms going off in my head
Wild beam, wild boy, you burn so bright
Baby, I don't need dollar bills to have fun tonight
Than a bit of advice
I danced to all your fucking soul
I knew it couldn't last
Then you take a shower
And asked what the damage was
Sans tricher, je vous le promets
I need to know your lips
You gotta take it in
Been thinking 'bout the way you'll leave me right, here
Tudo vai permanecer igual, afinal
If I ever talk to you again
The light is the sign, that love will guide you home
A tone that was taken before
It's got me running around in circles 
You've caused all this pain
The dark metal shape
The sun is up, I'm so fizzy I could burst
When seven flies swarm together
And that would be all right, all right
But your mind was wound so tightly
I want to be your baby You'll always be my baby
And we made a lovely three
Nearly brought me to my knees
It's you to me  gentle face, overdue, worth the wait
And you're the one I want to know
'Cause your a pretty little windstorm
Away from here
Losersbite it
All the while
Oh right now tell me where your heart is
Always made the front page,
And other dreary worlds you know
Hold me in your arms and sway me like the sea
So vexed to find evidently there's still so much that hides
Please just let me go now
Don't wanna go on this way
Oh what a world we live in
And it's long enough to put the best of us on our backs
Everything that I wanted in you
Soldiers, you've got to soldier on
By the way she looked, I should've calmed down
And he knows it's time to make a change here and time to get away
And I will break it for you now
I'd choose this moment with you in my arms
Their pretty girls and their burning men
Oh dance
Guess what happened to my coat of arms
Oh, please say to me
And I've been flying high all night
All rejoice we are in her hands
Don't tell me baby you gotta go
Then we will always know
But can you feel this magic in the air
If we show up, we gon' show out
You run, you're free, you climb endless trees, you reignite
Of the clouds begin to flow
All my friends begin to weep
To the second hand and its accuracy
And the people in my head still visit me sometimes
Nothing's the matter
Still never get enough
And patience isn't worth the wait
We're so pleased to be with you Sky
And you held this letter probably got excited,
The rest don't really matter now anyway honey
Sitting in silence in bars after work
I'm going to get you out of my head  get out
Once I have found the words
Messed around with gender roles
In an aeroplane high above the place
The fact is, it's you who've got it all to make my day
Du erwartest viel zu viel
Well, I see skies of blue, and I see clouds of white
You taste like sweet wine
Starting to feel the kicking here at last
And lose myself in waves 
I know it sounds stupid but it sounds about it
When we kiss it feels
Now you return in a rain coat, riverboat
Hey friends, break in the back door
It's a casual goodbye, goodbye
Stole and sold and ripped to part
I'm ready for this, I need you all in
Magical waves just under the sky
Because you know
Saint Jerome
All night
Lend me some sugar, I am your neighbor
When you want her lips, you get her cheek
Wait for summertime
So that I never feel alone again
I think back on that kiss
You left, for your duty call
We'll till the land and duck our debts
The meek shall inherit your love now
I'd go the whole wide world
But it's a while since you shut that door
Running around again
So I was up in this trendy bar mingling
I still can't believe
Don't give up, let's go forget about yourself
Someday you're going to realise
With the light
Couldn't this be the moment you discover my intentions
Watching how you feel
Walking a straight line, copping a plea as they went
That you were sat behind my back, didn't need to turn 'round
I need you more now than ever
Colours are what keep me alive
No one might
I will be your lifeline,
Well, ISharon I love you
'Cause I'm one of a kind and kinda hard to find
If you hear us say "come USA"
Maybe we should just stay friends
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
And half a soul to go
My dear, I went for the steal
She keeps the neighbors up all night
But no one's ever listening
Anywhere you looked was right 
Some postman
And they're shining down their light to bring you back again
Well I got mine, you got yours babe
'Cause you're the one who showed me
But I'm staring at you now 
And wash all around you
And then while I'm away
Tell me baby I'm your lover man
I must be looking for something
I'll say okay if you insist
Hey yeah, oh yeah, yeah
Don't be a fool
Better believe that it's gonna be the biggest night of the year,
A song about
I need love 
I need you, ONO
Que faire quand on a tout fait, tout lu, tout bu, tout mangé
Find an ocean, sell your soul
When you say you never
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
I'm telling you now that you got me good
You could seem a wasted affair
Rhythm bandits
Why won't you give love
Don't you worry there, my honey 
I would like to think that you'd know your way
He says, "Let's get crossed out and come to harm"
Now in the dirt where I put my feet, and in the trunk of my body
Don't you worry, we'll all float on alright
We laid by a river, we looked at the stars
Soon as I get up it's just another day, another dollar
The first two weeks turn into ten
And he doesn't give a damn about me
You want more fans, I want more stage
When I always wanna be else where
I feel like dancing
How could we ever forget
Repetiton to work
I got your days I got you on
I just want to know something today
To all the other boys caught in your bleach job hair
Was invoked on a Monday on earth
As long as I can feel the beat
And I'm staring out at endless rows of green
Bird outside the kitchen, fighting his reflection
I'm too drunk to light the bong
Look around, you see
Help me to the sun, hey I'm looking everywhere
And the voices in my head
In the water that we made
The things I do for you
With your mother
Back for another one
You might just feel the same
Wooh ooh
It's a heart attack
But daylight is so close
You lying man You'd be surprised who you see up in there man
Our aim was to break it down to the bone
Below sheets where dreams are made
They'll never realize that we have gone
Yeah yeah yeah, la la la, la la la la
Yes, fight and pray
Well, one I only keep this heap for you 
Say "it's blue
Sunshine she's here, you can take a break
To the story of how we learned how to survive
But storms won't last, they clear the air
Here in a paradise that shakes the word romantic to the bone
The sun's in my heart
Open up both your eyes
And it's words may wound my soul
Prepare to be astounded, no ghost or poltergeist
When I'm roll in my Mercedes, all the ladies wanna roll
We've got to change our point of view if we want the sky blue
Breathtaking, breathtaking
She had an A body and a face to match
Will you come and fetch me, girl
All talk, no action
And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there
As I ignite things 
I think she reminds me of my mother,
Leave your baggage behind, you won't need it tonight, enjoy your flight
To a mind consumed by brass money
Elle lui sourit légèrement avec un tas d�arrières pensées
Sneak a poem in dirty zones 
Is she right side up
I hoped that you could understand
The deadly silent kind
And get loose, can you, get loose, can you
When I soak so long I forget my mother
So you better run
She's a girl and you're a boy
I want to grab you and just kiss you
All of your love,
All you guards that I got out past
And something happens to me
And I realized all about your lies,
As your lifelines wanes
And I can get caught in the rain
Crowded floors and sleepless nights,
A habit hard to break
A pink flower on it
I will feel no pain and
Looking for fun and feeling groovy
The porch light is so bright
Get on the floor
And it's the truth you know
Long live love
All the things I do
If this life is one act
Where did you go now
So you did
Free, yeah, and you can know it all
I'm having the time of my life
Oh, oh, I just can't think of what to say,
Draw the curtains, I don't care
To have no regrets and be done with my life
Oh yeah you're the best damn friend that I'll ever have
He was apart and she was a part of it
Let's close our eyes and not our minds 
See the world unshown
Make it up and then let's move on
Are we breakin' up Breakin' up
I left my baby on the side of highway 
All I'm saying
Desde que estoy contigo la musica tiene 
So cover your eyes
Do you run from magic
One day baby, you'll realize that I know,
And getting fat
But Miss Black Eyeliner, You'd look finer, with each day in hiding, oh yeah
Every one is addressed to me
So, I've made up my mind
So we could die in it and die in it and die
Says he got a big boat but it's just a fairy boat and that makes for a short, short ride
You're a carousel
They have built a home sweet home
The luck was all before him
I'm a danger to myself, I've been starting fights
I'm not saying there's nothing to cry for
Get real drunk and ride our bikes
A comfortable three feet deep
There's times I need for you to phone oh
Take care
So let's sink another drink
They don't know about soul wine habit club
Now the rainy season reminds me of Maria
Through the sliding doors
Mutilating cat like eyes
There are too many candles in your cake
Hang up the chick habit
So I should have realised a lot of things before
Never thought I'd have an admirer from overseas
The cat calls through the night
From your head down to your toes
But nothing happens every time I take one on the chin
Now I'm sitting here alone
So come, on come on
But no one wants to see you fall down
Your moony face 
Our eyes aligned, swaddled in our civvies
It's a risk, yeah
I can't go back
Mercy's eyes are blue
You can brush my hair, undress me everywhere
I'd like to wrap my arms around you like a flesh canopy
You know he's so much more like Spiderman than you will ever, ever be
So release the dove into flight now,
But with nothin' to consider they forget my name ame, ame, ame
For us to Get together and sing Sing
Then what makes love the exception
It broke the heart of men and flowers and girls and trees
All the boys voices cracking
Won't let you go
I'll pretend that I'm kissing
And people are selfish, and people are prone to hate
I didn't wanna fall in love with you
'Cause I've been waitin' all week to feel this way
I don't want this feeling to go away
Then what we've got is gold
From when we get up 
And you can just get on down 
I hope sweet Heaven has a place for me
I never felt this love from anyone
I'll send up all my prayers and hope they're understood
Same DJ's working
Hustling the latest changes to the book that's the strangest in an attempt to multiply
Ooooohoohooooh oohoohoohoohoohoohooh
You've got nothing to lose
I close my eyes and here it comes again
We'll hope it's not for nothing at all
They sent her to the front line,
I only say it 'cause I care
I had to believe it cause that would
And when you smiled all the kids fell apart here
In the middle of the parking lot, yeah
And you think you're alone
So I took a look outside
Sancho brought a message from the Fat Man
Handwritten track listing restarted every time the pen smudged,
Hit the town, fool around, let's go party
I thought that we'd start over
On such early flights
Throw off your fears let your heart beat freely at the sign that a new time is born
I talk a lot of shh when I'm drinking, baby,
It's been a long day and there's still work to do
On second thoughts I'd rather hang around and be there
Taped it up, The Reunion, a brand new cut
Live for your just 'cause he can't hear what you say
Give me a night I'll make you
I never knew your middle name, no need to play that game 
Caressing her warm brown skin
Wish someone done me wrong 
I hate people that think that their ass don't stink
But then I woke from the dream to realize I was alone
When I delivered newspapers they said I was too slow
And gone upon your quiet way
The gentle beat of a tambourine
But you could be waiting right here for a day that won't come
Holding the last of the season
Is your doctor 
I can't get used to this lifestyle
Oh I can't stop it
Between his brain and his tail
Around my arms and began to shiver violently before
Like how you feel if you drink some bud light
And in this life we're free to dream whatever we want to
We might have our freedom, but we're still on crack
You've shaken me down
The colored stones and troop leaders
You're the only one who 
Without the rain
Óró mo churaichín ó Against the walls, against your rules, against your skin
Now I'm away, I write home everyday
But once they go, they don't come back
It's just another pointless game we play
She sat right down on the sofa
A killa for tha skrilla, Nigga, Best not be stalkin'
They big talk but they will never say what they mean
I'm just a ghost out of his grave
As my eyes begin to close
Singing, squeaking, "We built this city"
Jump in the line, rock your body in time Rock your body, child
They're picking scars
Be whatever you need
Well, they fly in the air as you comb your hair
And why I'm breathing in
It's so very obvious to everyone watching us
Ooh what did I get myself into
Will they find the solution in time
You come and hold my hand, baby
Desmond says to Molly, "Girl, I like your face"
Hello, how could I ever feel this way
And it was time for all the wrong reasons
Laughin' at fools like me
The radio waxes romantic Its lullabies fill our eyes with tears
The kids love them anyway, it don't make sense
Introducing for the first time
Built on words, built on work 
These are strange, strange vain days of living
Aeyyoh, what a night, New York City, heard it goin' down
He said "We're going wrong, we've all become the same
Know the price of flight
Yeah, I can't get it out of my head
And that's got to be the way it is
I hope it doesn't take the rest of my life
Leave go, my golden arm
You see the way I am
He is the coolest dad in dad school
And I was possessed by something quite unfriendly
I'll be waiting
Yet there's something about you that he understands
Cover your eyes, everyone is all the same
But this feels so unnatural, Peter Gabriel too
Say it's time that I try to move on that the life that we had is now gone
Now I'm lit up inside
Everybody knows I've got the magic in me I got the magic, baby
Just keep on having fun
Chrome on the freight line shines the same
In the middle of the bath
And a little bit too heavy on the thinking
So hard to leave you all alone
Here comes success hooray success
You see you got magic
Thursday, I don't care about you
On the other side, on the other side, on the other side
I love Paris in the rain
Someone hold this child up to the light
That love was so, so
How faint might that light become
I hope the world is treating you right 
For a ride
Searching the lines in my face for
You got me
As life's most precious part
Back in your heart
When I'm too busy getting down
Though you've gone away this morning, you'll be back again tonight
But green is blue, and so are you, 
Without having to say
I gotta go, gotta go
And in my room woaho its gotta be at least a hundred
It is raining, he's got no umbrella
I was beat down to a pulp, rocking back and forth somewhere 
Get a new name and cut your hair
Conflicted in these chains with the impetus of age
There are stormclouds brewing at the back of his mind
Here comes success
See the waves go down
We got all we need so here we go
I rock too fast for love, I'm footloose in my Velcro shoes
The words he knows are all obscene
And just because she is in misery
To spy and try to poke your eyes,
And all the time moves on and on
It runs so deep in you and me
Scattered in a thousand little pieces on the ground
'Cause I love you, no
I got you spinning 
Never did but I meant to, I, I, I give up
Is it true looks could kill Yeah, it's true looks could kill
But those are the breaks
Have you, ever been to heaven at night to heaven at night
But I woke up now it's time to go
To spin tales and bend truths through the evening
Oh and this years for the brakemen
Oh, oh, oh, oh, I feel fine now, oh, oh, oh, oh, I feel fine now
That's why I love you so and that's why I can't be with you"
I can't stop this feel oh no
They're trying to keep us apart
Though the world will tell you it's not smart 
You've got so much to live for
If I get home before the rain you're mine, but I won't bet
I had the blankest year
Boy down at the corner store copping some smokes
I thought he was a bitter man
Do you still think that you know
The beat The beat
Once you start to open your heart
And this time there's plenty
The paper boy's at it again, but I can't get no sleep
A thousand years go by
Start another fire
And sometimes wish your room
But I don't wanna talk about it anymore
I won't ever be gone
Take depositions from a stranger's face
Pulling the cord of mystery 
I think that this might be the day to 
I never knew a heart existed
Or recognize who you've become
It's a shot in the dark but I'll make it,
Ain't got the x factor, I'm not what they expect
Inhale, breathe steady, exhale
I found a pair of broken glasses and finally I can see clearly
He's got his knickers down
Well you got so scared
Come back stay here at my grandma's house
Let the fun begin, hey
Sweet sweet music
From a negative and letting 'em annihilate me
Neon black flowers on the mass grave
She says, "Let's go"
I got a Nikon camera
My roots are lying deeper than I ever think they will again
'Cause if I fall
You didn't sink when I sank
If you're with me let me hear you say
'Cause a dream's a lie
So you've been going out for years and I'm sure that you've been happy
Well, work it on out, honey work it on out
If you're not feeling the way that your bredgin is dressin'
But you never say them to me,
'Cause you are the light by which I travel into this and that
Sugar, shake it, shshake it
« J�adore vraiment ton style, comment tu t�habilles »
Down to the river where they caught a wild alligator
Young love dead
It's about time that you learn to share
"Hold on, hold on to your old ways
And not a single tummy around me would know what hungry was
The little target cutie
And if they don't dance
The trips reset so I'm unsure
I wanna take you away
With too much makeup round her eyes
You're underneath my skin but I'm confused
Comment ça va  Je ne sais pas 
Walking with her love, with her love, that's ohso fine
Someone has to care
Throw my hands up to the sky, let the music take me
It's the sun you need
That night I smoked a joint with my best friend, we found ourselves in bed
I know debris, it covers everything
I think it turned ten o'clock but I don't really know
They touch me, but I can't say
Don't give up your independence,
Now I found someone I really miss
Why can't I trust anyone
She's like a rainbow
So I called you home your so called father was on the phone
I packed my antihistamines and tupperware drums,
Can't you hear it all around
And if you held me, would you let me see that part of yourself
Her face so close I could taste the distant shores
Mistaken for magic
Even days a week, every minute of the day
And finally Finally I have found a way to be
The sun can't burn away our sins 
I just wanna be your girl
So go on and place your order now 
She sings and sounds off the hammer of God
Of idle days
Ooh, I know it's turning
You look so good in the shoes of an outcast
Now if I lived in my land, which I do, I'd still have Chinese children
Grass grows green, could you step away from the screen
Now turn around, it's burning down
As long as you live, when you were mine
Put my emotions on show
Just wait and see
CCCCinnamon Lips, go powder your cheeks and meet your new beau, oh
To see where it gets
I really remind you of money
Clearly I am a passerby but I'll find a place to stay
I want the sea to break through
And I am right beside you
She knows she's looking fine
I'll be back tomorrow
All around us
So out come you clowns, all you wolves, all you martyrs
I wanna break these walls,
Can I have some please of that whistles
Dreaming of the dolphin song
Any way you've got to
Doesn't mean a thing
Dirty talk talk talk quiet
I can see you standing next to me
But I hear those voices at night sometimes
And I went down on my knees for her majesty
Satisfaction's not to far away
And when the fun ends 
Watch me overcome what I'm running from and change the tune
I'll be the one to tell
Get a handle of yourself, son
Dear pacific day, won't you take me away
And no matter how old we get 
And the clouds came tumbling down Aaah
Memory tells me that these times are worth working for
Like I'm a stranger on this road
Can't take back those hours
Just purse your lips and whistle, that's the thing
Taciturn and gentle
But now I live in a house with a country gate
You're feeling instead of being
Our inclinations are hidden in looks
Let's get up on this floor and do this for real Whoo
The mama pajama rolled out of bed
I know it's only getting better
Can I get your lips to speak my name
I've been down so low people look at me and they know
Begging you baby
Makes no difference where you are 
Ride your tongue along your bottom lip and bite down
Thinking 'bout true romance
Be walking along that lonely mile
But you're with him, now I'd do no good I should've fought him but instead I let him I let him take you
Like that time I forgot to tell you about the scar 
This wrinkle in time, I can't give it no credit Credit
All the things that I relate to well,
And she doesn't give a damn about me
Jump up and down and move it all around
"Sir, do you got a light"
Tell me 'cause I don't want you to
I'd take her if I had one wish
Like everything just brings you down
If you believe a hand on your sleeve
The sun will come out wait and see
Every women too
With so much left to say
From the days in the waves
And tell me when it rains
And the sidewalk bagatelles, it's like a dream
All the people they're rhyming
Open up your window just in case
And I don't know how to love
All the dancers left but I can't dance
Hoop, Leggy Blonde, you got it goin' on
You can whistle my name 
Cuidado, cora,c~ao              	        Be careful, heart
Tomorrow I was nothing, yesterday I'll be
'Cause my heart's been keeping old
Whatever comes our way
Add just a touch of magic, it's the greatest thing since rock n' roll
As I hear your voice
People are people regardless of anything
I could be anything you like
Gonna write a song so she can see
The things you know 
We just want tomorrow to be better than today
He spoke of women's ways
Because we know you're stranger
Maybe I should move to another town
With every step we take, Kyoto to The Bay
How do I feel by the end of the day
We've got the ocean got the babes
They culled you from a cartoon
Then I'll compliment him on his political etiquette
Ancient walls of flowers tumblin' down,
What I'm saying isn't fair
That was my old man and he said
And tobacco juice rolling down his chin
Ooh, ooh, yeah
You know my name, look up the number 
People move so fast
And we'll paint the perfect picture
These are some good things that I found
Though we have missed all the minutes, we know what we've won
Oohoohoohoohooh
Tell me how you feel Feel
Flies in the air, comb your hair
"He looks pretty, uh, down" Yeah, well, maybe we should cheer him up then
So won't you please please please come back to me
Let me know, boys, let me know
So my vespa became your chariot from the green zone Marriott
Some sick game and it's not insincere
What I do, think, or say
Between the person that I was and have become
Time is passing by, I still want you
What have you lost Nothing
Do you believe like I believe Do you believe in magic
Never make a pretty woman your wife
Creep past the hours like the shorter hand on the clock
She was feeling yuletideburn
My name is Adam, I'm your biggest fan
They didn't like BB guns, or stupid archery
Take my hand 
A space where we felt free
Mean much more to me than anything
I get sad just thinking
Please don't lose hold of me out there
From now on I'll show my weak spot
And it won't be a pretty sight
Your magazines, the people at the seams
'Cause uptown funk gon' give it to you
In the living room
The night outside is five below
We go fishing or go swimming in the sea
You're holding me down Ah, turning me 'round Oh
And our hearts won't sink 'cause it's obviously nothing at all
The world is spinning too fast
You say aloud that you would have been my wife
Having a good time
Each heart to guide us
And there's a little boy in, her arms
Sunday morning creeping like a nun
I don't want nothing from you but to sweetly hold your hand
The kids keep on playing the driving game
If I live for a million years
Now you've come to the conclusion that she never did
The only one I want is you
A little bit of gravity
Hey windows down, chillin' with the radio on
Rise and shine
Racing through my brain
My father was in the first part
Time of my life
Your restless mind was born in a flash
Good times around the corner
Come on now, yeah, come on, now
You're thinking negative, nothing can go right
Great mountain remember me
But I'm still asleep
When I say that something
My gut knots up, my heart bursts like
I was a dancer all along
Where you never knew you'd go
Et le cachalot a dit
I came here with a broken heart that no one else could see
Anything goes so no time for closed minds
Everyone you see is half asleep
So y'all copped the LP's and y'all fiends got dealt
We drank our wine along the river
These are my faces
We're heading down to Half Moon Bay
If you don't say what you feel
But I can't feel it right now
Am I breakin' up Breakin' up
I can see it in your eyes
I sold it to a man
Wild and free, you've got no place to be
Please don't make me face my generation alone
Do you need it
Cause your up shit creek
I don't need no money
Racist dreams
Maureen Johnson, back from her spectacular
That you make me smile
'Cause if its ever gonna get any better
Not even money for some glue
I've tried to cut these corners
By the time we hit the ocean we'll jump little girl,
Touch my face, a hopeless embrace
Always in a foggy haze
Payback, payback the monkey
Wanting you for such a long time
No more a child
If you're gonna shake, shake, shake till the morning
Teenage, in the pace age
And I am thankful for the love
And I needed you to happen, yeah
Jerry's Kids are knockin' at my door could you be a sponsor
And oh oh, the ancient commonsense of things
My mother said gently, you can buy her a Bentley
Attending to their jobs
That better things are coming my way way
And about to reach my heart
I see you've got your list out
You try and make like this is so much fun
I'll love you more and more, I'll love you more and more and more
One night I fell asleep 
But like a phantom she crept across the floor and out the window
I recall the sun in our faces
Drunk all the time
Fumbling 'round in the dark with a flashlight 
My friends say I'm crazy and I agree
She's got you thinkin' you could never escape
But I don't wanna come on too strong 
Though there were moments
Acting out our old parts
Everyday, it's agettin' faster
I've got shackles on, my words are tied
I know this ain't the way I planned it
Well c'mon everybody and let's get together tonight
I wanna get out and build my own home
Will you come with me
Well, give me the rest of you, and I'll get the world
I said, the tragedy is how you're going to spend
A long time
Momma turned her back on me
Baby I gotta get through
I see you crawl, now you stand tall
Don't try to give me them blues
I feel you coursing through my blood
Along a path of river stone
You had to send a wrecking crew after me
When they say give up
You've got to pick me up
Its gotta get worse for a day
Must be planned out and pan out for every week to be worth
Buy everything
I've seen all kinds of strangers
Why the hell it means so much to me
But they still stay the same
Who am I to dream Dreams are for fools, they let you down
Most these niggas rappin' bout a block ain't never seen 'em
Oh no then they moved us to the sky
Just to be told that the girl I'm missing has been in London for a while
To your golden age where your crown is shining bright
For six weeks I had this job
I was feeling pretty good then
And I give my money to my landlord, he was needing it
Turn that sorrow into something that feels right
But I'm still trying to make my mind up
And paradise stars
"There's no higher ground to stand
Try not to move so fast
I'm too hot too hot, hot damn, hot damn
Your savin' time but your miles away
To the single solemn place
And it's another thing to see it all through
And I never met a Toby that I didn't like
It made you do the things that drove you crazy
Yesterday I tied two rocks together
Another day
I do love my Ma and Pa
In our little hideaway beneath the waves
Why not just cut up all your old clothes and make a quilt
Don't get sucked in for a second
I said, her skin is cinnamon, her skin is cinnamon
I flow through this feeling
Sos to your ears, the only thing I ever feared was this day
And when the seasons change again then I will too
Give me your eyes
You were calling her a lover
If I only knew
And it kicks, and it kicks like a pony
Listening to 's songs
And I wrote my girl, told her I would not return
True blue, how true
When it's you I find like a ghost in my mind
Sources say that senses are your friends
Bump into a person in the middle of the road
But he's got to have the qualities that I like
Eating good, sleeping soundly
Not just anyone
Be number one
His Honor drove southward seeking exotica
In a special way
Were sour in the summer heat 
Wishing for the time of my life
Come next in the logic's line
I'm alive  and the sun rises up so high
And I only hope that he has faith in me
And if I start a commotion
There are things you can do man
I'm love tornado struck
Strained to keep the shyness in
And II, I wanna open your door
You can trip on my synthesizer
So my hips can swing, so my head can nod
I fell asleep, I was hoping you'd call
Romance has broke down
Sometimes I can't find my good habits
Yeah, your name's on the wall but you're happy
If you don't have a point to make
Just leave the restless ghost in his old hotel
We were asked at the attitudes, they reminded us of death
So when the storm clouds dissolved into thin air
She don't like the way you look
Of doubt in my mind
I will marry you on Tuesdays
Fuckin' and fightin', it's all the same
"I'll break your heart"
Before, my face hits the floor
Look, metal flowerpetal tears do not even appear in the myopic mirror
My dreams would be constantly wilting away
In the end technology unto the world will set us free
Could've sworn that wine and one and four made two,
It could be over in a moment
So I'll spread out my wings and fly
I stand in awe of gratefulness
Got a lot of things to do 
Please please please
Everything you touch turns right
When neon light from the building
And that's the way to my heart
Couldn't figure what got in to me
Well, I fell out of bed laced in spit and sweat
I bet my momma found my letter, now she's calling the cops
She took her things and left 
She makes me feel glad
Watch this fade away
So hear me now, screaming out your name
See it's not what you look like, when you doing what you doing
I don't know why I let go
My shell may suddenly burst out will come birds
A wish could be a bad thing,
Oh c'mon, oh c'mon, what's a boy to do
To a line I'll never understand
To live my life
You glide through my head blind to fear
Sequin covered swans, that are used to make their own mosaics
So you gave me your wings
Everybody will help you
In honesty 
I've been having a sweet dream
Hard to see past the window, facing forward, looking back
I didn't drink what you drank
The boys say they want some gin and juice
Why do you wanna grow up, why do you wanna grow so fast and throw your youth away
Everybody needs a bosom
But this one's real, this one's real, this one's real
He left you out, now I'll take you home
But I don't believe that I'm wasting mine
If you get murdered I'll avenge you're death
I never saw her die 
I break all the rules like Evel Knievel
I'm getting tired of everybody talking and not doing a thing
In the broad day
Ah my chest it beating proud
I'll be the one to keep you, I'll keep you at your best
Barcelona  Like a jewel in the sun
I know you'll quiver when fingers touch your side
Girl you got me wishin' this would happen every night
But I hear those voices at night
Up in a tree
I gotta know,
And I'll make you shout
This boy really drives you mad
One day Death is going to conquer me
It is quiet here, I am powerful
From your house to my house to the Mews
I've come for you
Won't stop, won't stop the beat
You've seen the years roll on
Far in the morning light
When we are lost in the Technicolor phase
You'll be true and be faithful too
And I remember there was a radio 
Bright and loud,
Say honey baby don't you know
He found a good reason
And there's a reason for the candle lights
Watching me like you never watched no one
Oh well, in five years time we could be walking 'round a zoo
In these streets we live in and die, when it's your time
Oh, to hold you when you cry
Should I cash this check and trade in what I thought I knew
Yeah get away and bring it all back
Do ya love me 'cause I wanna know
Usually when things has gone this far
And I had friends oh, but not today
Well, she crept back in the house at half past three
You put yourself apart
I almost had an accident, age 
And I'm singing "oh oh" on a Friday night
There's a feeling that's come over me
'Cause I've got wheels 
You spend your whole life dropping nickels in the bucket, wakin' up at dawn
And the moment's flown
Hey, you were on my side
sie hat dich im Bann und entkommen geht nicht Ohh
And eventually you'll finally get it right
I got bruises on my knees for you
You make me dizzy when you play me like a kid with a crown
Pulling you back into my arms so selfishly
And all I said was "Someone get that girl a mood ring"
I try to be kind
Always look on the bright side of life
I don't always think of you
In this city
It turned out to be
And my thoughts have turned to murder thoughts have turned to murder
But you know the places I wanna go
You slept better in a sleeping train in a shed in a station
And when I woke up on your kitchen floor
But now I'm tired and I don't want to walk anymore
Everything that you need
I'm finally getting over you
We are one
I understand
Yes you will believe in love
I'm pink and black and blue
From time to time I turn around
I tell him he should get up 'cause it's nearly half past three
That we should build a city of tears
Flew into the sun
In order to love child we got to be strong
She can't always be wrong, he can't always be right
From your lovers, and pause all the suffering
And then you caught my eye
And anything I said or do
It's a beautiful new day
Everything you do now 
I said go, down to the sea
The life pulls in all direction
They love ya like a one night stand
That was our fifth song,
Just get it out
And I'm trying to care a little less
And I fell me into sleep
I was about mine, fantasize housebuying
Zak called his dad about layaway plans
I want all the world to see
I said from the start that you could take it or leave it
Come summertime, we're all the same age here
For the death of summer
There's a land that I dreamed of
Allure saw, never let you go
All you need is love Everybody
Like the Texas Chainsaw Massacre I'll get in your face
Come and get it now
I been hanginaround this town on the corner
All of the babies they can feel the world
Of the living people walking up and down the graves
Sweatbox, laser beams, flashin' lights
We feel like strangers
Been suffering the fools
It may be years until the day
Tell me 'cause I'd like to know
I left LA without telling anyone 
To fall down at your door
He can tell me what to do but he can't tell me what to feel
We don't believe in what the big people tell us
Fuzz tone, hear'em go, hear'em on
I don't know, honestly
In front of a dirty doublemirror they found me
As we hit the front door
Give the audience a grin
You realize this is not the way
Lovin' is what I got, I got, I got, I got
Won't you tell me something good
Rubber burnin,' turnin' corners, beatin' like a Congo
My brother in arms
If you were the winter, I know I'd be the snow
Feel today
We'll keep on moving anyway
In your life, expect some trouble
And you won't see tomorrow
Oh baby, I'll beg I'll beg
Well I could live in this town
Or you'll never get another fix
Oh what a perfect world
I'm so happy that I found someone
So please don't please don't please don't
We will cure this dirty old disease 
You can walk my path
In the parking lot
You take over the rhythm, take over my soul
Let me love you night
But just before we left and started kickin' it
Wait a minute, wait a minute
But windows open and close
She's got a choice
I'm seeing Hollywood stars
Bring it back
You look like the songs oh
But we're all happy cause the streets there are always there for us
All you need is love
I tell you in the kitchen about my day
I saw you just the other day
Ain't what you had in mind
The lightning over the park,
'Cause she was never one to play by the rules
You Don't Say, These currents are still killing me
I, I, I like my beats fast
Who would've known the storm of my past times,
Forgetting makes things easier
The next man he might try to cheat you
You were working on the inside
Got my heart, got my soul
But winter's cold is too much to handle
Are you ready for a day that's comin'
Kneedeep snow Mushaboom, mushaboom
That tune
Oh yeahoh yeah
Fell to the earth at a fascinating speed
I always knew you were a
Finger on the trigger, let me tell you, it is quite a scare
Through the jungle, through the dark
You revealed a world to me and I would never be
Lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles
I go to the places where we used to
Mm, yeah
And if you were an ocean, I'd learn to float
Friends do not let friends do crack
Santa Cruz and Trestle Inside, outside, USA
Running down my face, bound by tacks and paste
We lost a singer to her clothes
Betty won't stop listening to modern rock
Oh skin and bones baby
Oh baby, it's bad too bad
Is it over yet When she spent the week in bed
Or it's like finding something pretty in a jar of flies
Baby, it's like we're walking on a wire through the fear
And shop at home
She's all I want and I've waited for so long waited and waited
Hold me deep beneath your waves
Run, baby, run, forever we'll be
Oh life, with your colorful surprises
I hear it calling outside my window 
Is it very big, is there room for two
Have to contend with it all night
And the rest be sent to hell
Someone has to
And balancing the whole thing
Even when I'm miles at sea
Afternoon delight
Then I'll kiss you between the ears
I want to play, you're in the way of our sunshine
When I've lost control and I'm heading to crashland
I don't know where I'm going, I'm on my way
And if it's the one thing
A drop top, flip flop, shine as the chrome glow
He'll tell me I'm the one
But I dream as I set to scrub all the floors, the walls
And I am the gray in the ghost
Boom, da da, da da, boom
Everything'll work out right
Do you still love me
'Cause I just can't wait till you write me you're coming around
Every second is a highlight
Each wanting the next one to arrive
We hope you have enjoyed the show
It's crooked on the sides
When you're sad and when you're lonely,
I think I see you coming to town, dragging you down
Yeah, we'll be alright though We're alright though
Sometimes I'm not that sure
Tonnight we have not got on well
For atoms have gone as far as atoms will go
Anywhere your luck was right 
'Cause you got sad 
Her life revolves around all of the planets
You are the light, light
And I was there outside in green
And I know one thing
And I know that ev'rybody be happy
Say cheerio to books now
That she's seen love
If I did know one thing
Carolinas, Virginia, Philly, come and ride wit' a G
Good morning 
I hear you got some new clothes
Hey, remember that time when I would only smoke
Bad boys then, bad boys now
För bredvid ditt namn står ett namn till
And you know that I will always do the best I can I can
You think that you're the only one 
Tryin' to get his mitts in my oven
Oh, what a shame that your pockets did bleed on St Valentine's
Mm gonna try with a little help from my friends
Heart on your sleeve and your soul in your shoes
Oh come on and love it 
Here comes my face here comes my face
You don't know how far you've gone
So beat my head beat my head
Through the screen door kiss me kiss me like a queen
You are fighting for
Don't break
Loosen the noose then let go of the rope
I was a lonely soul, but that's the old me
Now back when I was just a boy, you know
She's a beautiful girl
Because there's nothing for the kids to do today
Let's go dance under the street lights
Take me in and dry the rain 
When you're hurting somebody
Still
So happy, yeah, so, so happy, yeah
I can't get enough of you, baby
'Cause I almost got popped for a fight with a thug
They know they got their heads screwed on
When we're looking for brushwood
And try to win a little love
A timeless flight to reach the stars
Now the funny glare to pay a gleaming tear in a staring under heat
How are you feeling
In love with love and lousy poetry
Let the love tear us apart
Oh, every time I close my eyes
Butterfly, baby, you've got it all
'Cause I've been waiting all my life
You don't get to the bottom of nothin'
Come fly with me, let's take off in the blue
But wait, the babies haven't been born, oh
I fell apart in your arms for the last time
Come battle two swords with a stick
Now every time I go for the mailbox, gotta hold myself down
Woo woo, you make amy dreams come true
Pay back the piggy back,
You said if you're never coming back you have to go
Because it kicks, yeah
And I'm staring at you now 
Children at your feet
I wouldn't cause you any harm, I just want you in my arms
Safe in the dawn he gets under the sheets
You're feelin' old
So hum hallelujah, just off the key of reason
You'll always be mine Mine
Your mother should know know
Friends of P
I looked like a goon
But circulating the streets in the pulsing heat
We make love to Some Weird Sin
Give it a rest, won't you
Riding through the city on my bike all day
Yeah yeah yeah Is enough to send me crazy
You didn't have to be so nice
I hope it lasts forever
It was love at first sight
Would sing my childhood song to me
Make your lifelong sweetheart your ball and chain
A shiny gun
    went out the barrel of the gun
But you left one too many times
Nothing to do to save his life, call his wife in
Must be the season when that love light shines
A single thing to say
To give you something to go on
Getting into the swing, getting into the swing 
It might be you and me oh just wait and see
And our love's a lie
And I'll never let go
People in love get special treatment
I just want you by my side
You said my clothes were sexy
In your eyes
But photos on the walls of New York shopping malls
To glue her brain and stick it back together
Then the conversation stopped, and I looked down at the ring
Man, you got me burnin'
Don't lose your faith in me
So let's make a list of who we need
The warm water took me by surprise
I hope I do my best
Fight for yours and don't let go, don't let them compare you, no
Life, oh life, oh life, oh life, oh life
And maybe I talk too fast
To the beatbox, spinning 'round
Someday you're going to realise
You can have it which way you choose
To Jupiter Ah, shit
You may not notice now, what people talk about you
Ha, we did it, we here now, y'all niggas can stop askin
She moves like an old gypsy woman but swears she's a girl
Sometimes I feel like I can't move on, nothing in life is turning me on
I'll buy an old car
Why don't you let me 
Clouds float away like iron tools on the moon
Take step outside see what's shaking in the real world
Yes I did
So every morning he wake
We hang past right and wrong
And I'm going to make this moment mine
I look at things now
And I'm sorry that it shows, but life ain't so bad you know
Through the screen door your thoughts are quarantined,
And Baby Lee I'm always watching from a distance
Nothing in this room but empty space
I tried to do headstands for you
She made from nothing Aaah
I will follow the electric lines
See the stars, won't break the bones
Underground
Is just that I've no one to cling to
And so I'm sailing through the sea
I met her on the subway, she gave me that VIP card
She smelled like sugar and spoke like the sea
After the floods have washed away
On this night we breathe air
I'm happy because I'm stupid
That adds the sunshine to the magnifying glass
I want you back
I think I'm falling in
There's so much skin to see
I been photographed and painted up
Can only get, can only get
The city is further away, and I love that I, I can't stay
It's all right, the camera is talking
Not when she hugs me and says she loves me so
Who can take tomorrow
Me far away from my wise Senorita
We are here to save your life
Have you seen her dressed in blue
I keep my life on a heavy rotation
You are so rarely
And we'll all float on okay
So give your love to me
And I didn't know it then but she put a spell on me
It's you and me and were runnin' this town
Oh, we can beat them forever and ever
Problem with saying goodbye
I'm just lonely
I got Bridge Club on Wednesday
Of love's uneven remainders
Believe in the magic of the young girl's soul
If you're friends with P
Lady on the water, whip this wind into a flame
If you come down we'll go to town
I am holdin' on
She went down on almost anyone
I'll savor the pause for a while 
You love me too
I shake it off, I shake it off whoo
"'ere mum  got any mandies"
And you're my girl I like your style just imagine all the time we could kill
Had to let the world, let it bleed me dry
Will make you wanna drop
She gets all the highlights wrapped in pearls
Her dying cigarette in the rain
And the mare in the pasture
Because I didn't think about the message
You know he's holding you down with the tips of his fingers
I see you with your friendsyou don't wanna get embarrassed 'Barrassed
Not sensible, I wanna marry a dancer
I wanna go back to the way it was
One thing that I just can't conceive
She makes my head spin around
And I hope you miss me too
All I can say is that my life is pretty plain
It's such a feeling that my love 
Go for the moon
Hey you, put your lips up close
Since everything has changed
And away you go now baby
You can find a better way
Colours and colours and colours of colours
And it takes a day to make you yawn, brother
So now you pour your heart out
Life is way too short to take it slow
So step on up to the plate get a date with Mraz
She was sunbeam wrapped in lies
Hey, who's worryin' 'bout 'cha, babe 
Was machen die Knochen da in dem Topf drin
All we forget
Why can't you understand
And I just can't wait to be home
You said you loved me you know what you said
Just slept way too much, just slept
It's just my Japanese cigarette case,
Remember lightning and wet clothes
Wanna run away, oh run away you and me
A little die
And all that I can see is just another lemontree
The sky above, zing, boom
And I remember the time my balance was fine
Discotech Meet me at the back door
Yes me got the reason to come question your love
And I could jump out of my skin
I love you more than ever, girl, I do
And sway
I'm feeling blue, 'cause love is gone
Unless it feels so right,
She says 'everyone around here's wasting my time'
It's been a long, lonely time
That's been inside my mind since the day we crossed
I'm gonna soak up the sun
Tell me all about your men
But you're still so careless with your words
That just hurts you every day
Where there's a will, there's away
I'd pretend
Sometimes suds and soda mix okay with beer
From the light that calls my name 
I hope the message made it's way down the wire
Come with me to a place no eyes have ever seen
And who believes that my wildest dreams and my craziest schemes will come true
If you sit still or if you run, well, here it comes
At the icecold water all around me
I don't pay attention to the ones who never cared
Might just lose a little faith
But before I go and hit the road
Tuesday badminton
Remember the way she loved the chase
'Cause they need a new song
If I don't make it there there'll be hell to pay
For what once was gold and once was rich and now is poor, 
And if your the type of girl that do anything me please
Charm your way across the Khyber Pass
So shout until your hear no more
So I gave my heart completely  Vaseline all over the lenses
Girl, I've got the feeling you're feeling something
You can fill me up with what you've got
We came here to rock the microphone 
Don't stop me now I'm having such a good time
And love's not just a flare on my sleeve
You were waiting
At least they're not lonely
Burnt down to the ground
'Cause they are free of thoughts unpure
Do you wanna dance and hold my hand
When guilt fills your head
All I saw was a man that had a hat that had a pompom
Slides inside sandy river before the day is through
The reasons for the tears
Huddled up in fear and hate because we know our fate and it's a lot to put us through
I would cross through these state lines
The rest of the summer was the best we ever had
When I hit the flow the girls come snappin' at me They be snappin' baby
But it's not the fall that hurts
So I walk right up to you
Hey yeah yeah
'Cause what you've got is
Mm hmm On my way
The sun is hot in the sky
I guess I'll always be 
That's what people say, mmhhmm
And on the subway
And I don't want to spend my whole life just awaiting for you
And we fight them with water that runs through the cracks
The piano took up the living room
Slow it down, make it stop
Now it's payback for the rainy days
Of the scene as she turns
It's in the eyes of the beholder
Struggling to survive its harshest night
There's a glow off the pavement, you walk me to the car
Until I found your hands
Custa o que correr, corre o que custar, ah
Of an ocean swimmer
I am such a fool
Workin' all day for a mean little man
The ferry hatches Moline
But money can't buy you love, baby that's a fact
Yeah, wouldn't you like to come with me
I feel fantastic
You said you hate the way they scrape their brakes all over town
Too scared to own up to one little lie
Well, it's all right, as long as you lend a hand
When you look me in the eyes
We can kiss and undress or if you want just talk
That I gave wasted on a nice face
I go extra miles to show
Join the human race
I'm so tired of the way the world works
I see your stars begin to shine
I'm burning through the sky, yeah
And it's you I need in the summertime
Those pretty faces always made you
You know I'm not the kind to say that it's over
That the people there aren't inviting
Gone are the dark clouds that had me blind
Desmond lets the children lend a hand arm leg
I am all alone
Not even once did you start to make sense to me
I'll be there in a while
You can't take away from me
I'm laughing at clouds
And I can't hide the tears in my eyes
Can we please take this hour
He had a sister named Erin, for sure was fine
I'm seein' stars
There are miles of hay like I've never seen
And in the evening she still sings it with the band
Packaged for sale
Do ya, do ya, do ya, do ya love me
I kiss you all starry eyed, my body's swinging from side to side
As the temperature rises all around
Is life, love, with you
And what better way to celebrate make it on over now
And the broken bones
We lie still on your bed, the room is lit only by the telly
I can't stop can't stop can't stop the beat
Já, endalausir og birtan
I was right
I been charred and I been scarred
"But it's much too late" you say
You win something
Friction sparks from metal made it look like bleeding
'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
Ooh, ooh, ooh
More ofern right than wrong
And I remember saying to her
Because seriously, this high life scenery 
Brave another road
And I make her smile like a drug for you
Wake up to show me what I could not
Big band
You're just like a flower, yeah, in the deep sunshine
It won't be long 'till happiness steps up to greet me
It's gone
Just can't let her slip away
And no one will ever know it if I keep my mouth shut tight tight tight
No words
I'm gonna need a forklift, 'cause all the baggage weighs a ton baggage weighs a ton
I've got souvenirs but yesterday can't mean too much, 
One last time let's go there, lay down beside me
The chewing gum, dream catcher Illi'
'Cause I lose my way searching for stage lights
Tonight we're gonna blast with the power of a thousand guns
Each blade of grass as it lies down
Now he's changed his mind
The ghost of somebody at his side
I need to flick the switch and show you how to hide
A homeless woman walking around in the snow
That you left your land, to trade for a place, so far away,
I came to the city
I don't believe that anything will ever be enough
Tokens of a lifetime
Heal the song, sing along
We're gonna be alright alright Hey
And you're riding through the city with a shotgun 
Because it makes no sense at all
Knocking the aeroplanes down with stones
'Cause I will be away from you
My garden's a secret compartment
We're home at last
And kiss my thighs
And it's your heart, it's alive
And when she gets the sensation
Here today and gone tomorrow
If you knew, if you saw, you'd have said it was the final straw
Our train stopped moving hours ago 
Go on, do what you've got to do
Woke up cold one Tuesday
This boy has broken down, hey yeah yeah
Thinking oh, is it love
comme si il lui appartenait un peu dans sa tête
'Cause then she might be happy, no longer lonely, uhoh
Well she blows 'em outta the water like you never seen
I guess I've always needed
And bombs going off in my head
It's getting too hard to imagine 
I guess I'll always be a child 
Listen to the music playing in your head
Won herself a pass to some far off moon
Just because I'm in love
Let the sideways rain in the crooked street remain
Or there's a chill because it's showing through your clothing
I'll meet you where the sun it always shines You're on my mind, all the time We are not wasting this
My mouth is just a mush of drool
But it was daylight outside 
Straight buzzin', Robitussin
And you looked so cute there, you were crying
When that light's gonna shine
I've waited for a long time
Running into the dark underground
'Cause I'm done with that, I've got one foot out the door
So to speak's the uncertain kind
But no, none of it's true 'cause I never knew you
Something is holding the light 
We're breaking all the rules
Do the whirlwind
Are gonna keep me from the cold
Well, how can I forget
Singin', don't worry about a thing, oh no
And do you ever feel the time slip by
The way that she does it, I can't get enough
My tears won't give in 
It's uncomfortable to see I give it away so easily
Now words can never make up for what you do
Like the orphan needs home once again
And you're a long time coming
She's got you wrapped up in her satin and lace
The times we never even thought to speak
Are you holding me up
I Got a woman, way over town
I'll break your heart so you must ask
No stopping us
And claw my way back to town
See those tears clear as we separate
Cause the other boys are queuing up behind us
Not Tonight  Can't Have A Scene
It shimmers slightly dancing in your hair
I might not have the power
Don't stop me now
Stop, adrenaline rush cause
Duck and I sway  what's my line
Well, I got all this time to be waiting for what is mine
You have to die
Oh yeah, I hate you too
Please, Mr Postman, look and see
Are, are you with me now
It was romantic
Hot is the night
You set them alight, burning the bridges as you go
They, they just roll their eyes
You show me how
She said maybe there's a bit of me
And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer
Nothing but net could ever give to me
I try to win without a fight
Her love to bury
You think you'll never get
Why don't you see it's beaming in the sunshine
You're the one I'm talking to
They didn't ask why I did it"
And I ain't got no season pass
Suddenly you started to move
Hey show some love,
"Boys like you are overrated" So save your breath
Yeah, you know what I'm talking about
Everything's just wonderful
I'll bail you out again, I've got the readies
Everywhere I go I'ma have my own theme music
I'll be the lonely one 
Better ways to say
I found what I'd been looking for in myself
I'd pay to visit you on rainy Sundays
You don't see me fly into the red  one more you're done
'Bout someone that you're never gonna get to touch
And you come back to me
I should be over all the butterflies
I don't wanna stop at all, yeah
But never made another sound of fear
And baby, baby, you're irresistible and I'm insatiable Ooohooohooohooohooo
You see me ridin' through Atlanta in a Phantom with the double door
Fears are getting stronger
So put a little bit of bitter in your pink lemonade"
Throw your hands in the air 'cause we'll shake it tonight
He don't want to sell his life to you
He's my friend, They're not my friends
The sky of daytime dies away
'Cause I just rolled and I tumbled
And watch as your heart speeds up endlessly
Like a tidal wave
She's good to me, oh, yeah x
Queuing up for something under priced
You're such a lovely cup
I hold my breath and wonder when it'll happen
Today
They're gonna buy your life's time
Out of the dark and into the light
We can't get past the how are you
When the stars are shining on you
Be my head and I'll be yours x
You're gettin' on my case like The Rockford Files
Under these white Northern skies
Get the balance right on
Somebody cry why, why, why
and land, deflated, in some neighbor state that's strewn 
Keep on rolling, never boring 
The sound of the city baby
Who sits to your side
She fell in love with the drummer
Monday, you can hold your head
No, not built, but they say drink my milk
Oh say please do not go
And it's a perfect night for feeling melancholy
So I gotta go, gotta go,
Dressed in blue
Wait one minute
I'm begging you please to come home
We're just looking to fit in
Got my blood
I want a taste of that Oregon girl
Talking to you makes me wanna shake and shout
To her head
Lose our sense of direction
Touch the rocks
I go outside, it's not so bad
'Cause I want to know everything about you
My My Time flies A man in a winter sleigh
The time is passing by, I still want you
I was next to you, and you were right there next to me
I'm an Alka Seltzer that's right you're a seagull
And all of a sudden BOOM American family
It's this one thing that got me trippin'
I hear that she likes to dance around the room
I got it set on you
Millions of sunsets but the one I'll remember
And now I spend my time
Here I go thinkin' 'bout all the things I could have done
Exhale the stress so you don't come unglued
When the streetlights are far beyond you
A faded union that won't survive the years
I keep calling you up, calling you up
You feel your tree is breaking
Gonna love today
I've got no spirit for dancing,
Oh, Spanish bands use all the echo
Better make up your mind, if you wanna get to the table on time
They've come for you and me
And then we gon' swing by Simpson Road, you know what I'm sayin'
She had a slut slave and his name was Dave
The minute before we play
What you've got to say
Got love for the corporate playas that's ballin' rollin' jags
Oh, yeah OoooooooMr Postman
No one knows just how deep it goes
Hey, read my lips
Something might last
Don't speak, no use for words
These dreams under my pillow 
I'll stand up on top of the dugout
On the fire escape now
I'll try hard not to pretend
There's plenty for the kids to do today
There's no sense in complaining 
Wish you knew how much I loved your legs and your hair
And I'm going home,
And all this love, rainbow styling
With another guy
All the people life lurking in dominions of a hot Turk dish
To the stars now baby yeah
The color after sunset
We've got strangers stopping by
It all falls apart
Just tape the numbers to the bed
Gotta paint my nails, put my high heels on
It's somehow all I need
Oregon girl I've been around the world 
Crawl into bed tonight
The plane took off and my love went with it
And posters take the walls away
And only when the sun comes out
Go on, I don't need it
We were up against the wall on the west mezzanine
And a taste that's floating
On top of everything
Move on to the next one down the line
Yeah my body's like Bugatti
Let your love fly like a bird on a wing
Tonight, to the stars
You gotta wait a minute, wait a minute, Aaaaaah
So I could see my life
And I don't wanna spend all of my life just waiting for you
I met you in the dead of winter
Then we'll stay for a weekend
Keep it clean, I didn't mean to be mean
The songs that I heard, the occasional book were the only fun I ever took
'Cause I can't do all of my dose and still feel ill
Close their eyes and open
My love, my love, my love it is
And though the saints dub us divine in ancient fading lines 
So sing while you have time
So Hannah let your roots grow
Feels like there's something broken inside
She's my little deuce coupe, you don't know what I got
We should get jerseys, 'cause we make a great team
I'm in love again 
The weekend we were in love
Don't you know it's true what they say
With a torch and a Woman's Realm to keep you warm
And the things you loathe
But one day out of nowhere, she sits down and looks over my shoulder
Listen baby
Night turns to whatever we want
You'll be my sympathetic lover and won't steal the covers
Strike up the band and make the fireflies dance
So maybe one day I'll be happy
I'm a band in a show about a man holding hands with his wife
Makes your nighttimes warm and out of sight
By living in the moment
I'm too scared to look away,
But for three whole years to end like this
My doctor says that I should take it
What are you waiting for
I'm right behind
I call to say I'm on the way
I feel heaven in you, don't you know I feel heaven in you
Put it back together
Playing games
From anything you do
Let it be and come to me with the look in your eyes
La la la la, friends friends friends friends
All skulking around
You look beautiful all of the time
Tell me what you really feel
All I wanna do is get off
You're the one that's making me crazy
Just 'cause everybody doing what they all do
Licks her lips they're something other Something other
Oh my soul has never had this feelin'
Her name is Nona, she's a rocker with a nose ring
Dance to the sounds of iced tea being stirred
Relieved and now we see the road 
On a holiday, far away
I loved you in the morning
But now I'm feeling afraid
Just then I see a twinkle twinkle in the old man's eye
Some kind of innocence is measured out in years
You know, you know, me name you know my name 
Late nights and early parades and early parades
As if it's one big joke
I'll believe when the sky is burning
Standing up like a man, like a father
The confidence is full with your faith etched in stone
What number is this, Chip
Because seriously, this high life scenery
I'm a rocket ship on my way to Mars
The spattered colors of ecstatic fright
With peace in my heart
And all the guilt will follow you in a line 
And I say too much, yeah, that's true
Another sleepless night
And I'll be waiting anxiously 
Well I hate to be the one to ruin the night
If it makes you feel good
Won't you tell me, do you love me
Sometime you feel like Moses
When you're chewing on life's gristle
When she warned me what people say
If I were king of this night,
Gggget, get a lick of this lovin'
Ride a white swan like the people of the Beltane
First thing they teach us, not to give a fuck
It must be getting early
Tell everyone that you know
Honestly, you did it to yourself
Just say no more, use your eyes, the world goes and flutter by
From time to time a little
You know I'm the girl that you should call
You won't understand all this until you're
Who's to say what's impossible and can't be found
We were having fun, there's no harm done there
I'm balancing on one fine wire
Another dollar down the drain
A one way ticket to Mars
Counting seconds through the night and got carried away
No, I'd never let you fall
You like the feeling of Saturday
Feel real bad, then get over it
The night is patient, the night's a glass dome
Lend me your ears and I'll sing you a song
And I remember, you remember when
Pharoah on the microphone Sing all hail
I've got the table set
Where the animals sleep hidden in the gloom
And nothing does me any good
And I don't wanna fall
Oh babe, I'm down down down on the ground
Sing it out loud, get away with me
But I was right and you were wrong
Three in the morning saying
Because it hurts me so bad
Baby Lee I'm only trying to remind you
Tomorrow the Jehovah's will come by
Real sugar, I don't wonna climb no walls
Come out to the west backsides of my eyes 
And the sequined girls
Then I pull myself together
So leave me where the kids are alright
I'm living in the moment
If you break a kitten's neck, you must shake it's body and check
I'll be the fire escape that's bolted to the ancient brick
It's just a dream he keeps having ooh
Every little bit goes a little of a long way
Why don't you keep it in the corners
We can talk, we can sing
You don't ever need to be lonely
That stuff makes me feel waiting for a train
Chichi parties
"All that glitters is gold"
I've got a pencil full of lead
Standing in a crowded room and I can't see your face
When I met you, I was just a kid  hadn't built up my defenses
Baby, you just gotta make up your mind
Those lips and teeth that asked how my day went
If you're my girl, swirl me around your room with feeling
I think it always will
And now we gone to Jupiter Right now
Think about it every time, I think about it
And tonight I have to leave it
Cheers to the the nerve it takes to forget who we are
I�m doing okay
When you wake up I'll be gone
You did what you said that I did when I was gone
Living like you just begun
Try and say the things you want,
You're afraid to break some bones
I was always late
And all the dreams that I awake to read like ghostly paintings
Why in the world are we here
Everything he'd do if he was president
Today could be the day you might make a change
'Til the day
There's a black rainbow upon my house
If there is one thing that's true
Yeah, yeah, yeah, who can take tomorrow
Let the sun shine yeah eh ey yeah
Anybody try to stop it
You'll hold the thunder while I bring the rain
Heart stopped beating,
Nothing can come between us
We all get there eventually
I'm spilling out the door
Helpless to the bass and the fading light
We kept him from the world's glare
I want you back
I've done everything I can
We'll find a way
Give it to me baby now
I put a pillow right on top of my head
The lights go off
I'll be excited for a week, but then excitement starts to fade
Oh, I really need one
Sittin' back in the sun
The last night of the fair
The day turns to night
And then I saw her face
Well if I lived in China, I'd have some Chinese children
That maybe we should wait
Bones in your body and you was made to be a celebrity
Get your green green tambourine, it never gets dark
If your brother won't rock, then your sister will
Dark clouds all around
In an mmm bop, they're gone
Sometimes I wish I was there with you
I am always right
And you can still hear her bawl
Now I just can't get enough
Writing this letter hoping you're okay
And it's waiting for me
Systematically go and destroy,
For awhile for awhile
Plays something familiar
Everywhere is balanced there like a rainbow above you
The seesaw of love, its rickety bounce
We might be dead by tomorrow
And we're all in this together
Falling down the river
I'm on fire and now I think ready to bust a move
Sometimes I pretend
Óró mo churaichín ó They crowd your bedroom like some thoughts wearing thin
And everybody knows its name
When they say they think they know exactly so 
With clueless guys but now it's over
I'm getting carried up by the wind
And your heart is finally mending
Back those eyes
I wouldn't even if I could pretend
Running around like a clown on purpose
Them pregnant fiends, killin' they child
When I close my eyes you come and you take me
And you're the funny little frog in my throat
I will let you be
I don't think I'll ever feel the same again
A little bit of you makes me your man
Sitting on a sofa with a sister or two
She's the midnight pick of the day, yeah, yeah
Unlock my body and move myself to dance
I've gotta get you out of my head  get out
You make me feel like dirt
We'll all be leaving with a broken heart
Revealing walks in the park
Can I say no
Just need music and sun and laughter
Of Desmond and Molly Jones ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
I've got a third upon my shoulder, 
My mama said to slow down
I'm living in a treehouse
My burning desire started on Sunday
All your friends are going 'round
Move along sad face your cover's blown
Doch ich renn lieber nackt durch die Nacht und schrei
Why can't I sleep at night
Oh, what a feeling come over me
He taught me how to watch and fight and pray
Putting my life on the brink
Now it's my time of need
I asked him time again, 
And I've sent signals and signs from the mountainsides
I took my money, I bet my life
Got this she wolf appetite that keeps me up all night
Countless times I've screamed 'oh brother'
Hey friends we'll jump the turnstiles
Well the couple with the baby and it's no secret why
You can talk to me
Your back on each other
How I know this place like the back of my hands
So, I'll drink you up my dear
Ooh so come on and hold me tight
Woo If you wanna have a good time
Where the trees I planted grow
Yeah I love you and you love her
Talking our way through March
God is with us everyday
You had a black shirt on with a big picture of Nietzsche
To a place you and I  Will call home
So lay your head on me
Steel guitar and the mele sound
And over the seas
People in love get everything wrong
The girl at the window
Clawing at my skin and bones
Focus calling
On sleeping with your roommate
C'en est assez de ces dédoublements
I'm gonna run behind you in the shadow's place
I'm a fool, out of love
The years have been turning on
How she's a "special" girl
Do whatever you want, baby
Sea Lion woman
Yes, you can build yourself around
I love, I love, in the rain, oh, oh, oh
Leave everything up to fate
But now I'm complete
Even day takes relief every day
Winter is springtime
I'm looking up, you're looking down
Two gondolas to carry us
And I wonder If I were to walk by you once more
This rage will lead us through the burning plains
I got a selfdestructo bust
Somebody misses you when you're away Somebody misses you baby
And her face is like a sail
Creaming over tough guys
When everything is falling
And when I come back to the room everybody just seemed to move
I've let you go,
You carried on
I got a letter from my mama which my stupid dog has ate
They've got us pinned terribly
You're in my heart
I was walking home alone,
He's sending me, maybe she's sending me, just to see me get irate
You got groove in your hand the way you spin those tunes
Screen falling off the door, door hanging off the hinges
And it seems like it's always so hard
But let me get paid while I make you breakfast
Embraces my insides inside
For you to come home
Is mine tonight
Try to take the easy way out
The weekend we were in love
But today I worked it out, I got something I can shout about
And bend your back and ask those hips if I can touch
From East Side niggas in Kirkwood and Li'l Vietnam
And circle round once more
This season's changed since we've been away
What's the harm in knowing one more
Et on se prend la main comme des enfants
Nonstop till the break of dawnin'
Jessica numbers are due
It left my bed in a mess
Let me go, boys, let me go
When you're young you get sad 
Love for those who gotta watch tha hater's rollin' bubbles
With an uptown girl uptown girl
The sun is shining in her sky
When your past lingers like rain clouds casting shadows below 
There's a Jenny, there's a Karen
Hasn't hollowed and swallowed you and I from inside
Some people ride the wave of generosity,
Is all me and my baby'll need
Get the show on, get paid
You cut a line, was a big mistake;
I wanna breathe in a sunlight beam
Am I dimmer every day
What is her name
I might be busy doing nothing but I've had my share
Honey for your best man
Woahohoh, let me hear you now, ohohoh
But I've never seen another Oregon girl
Straight in the picture pose, he's coming around to meet you
But my heart was still mine
Of your dramatic ways
Jesus loves her, she wants more
It's not right
So what if this world just throws me off the edge
Baby, you're a rich man, too
Must have been the first time
Welcome to the human race
And we'll fight with fire, fire with fire, fire with fire
Let's get out before we melt away
Sometimes a sigh is a song
Go on ahead and let it fade away
Chelsea was the one who's been abused
Shut the door, count to four
Well you could get back down,
They said, do you remember where you saw her last
I drew them a heart
There's nothing in this heart but me
Hey you with the pretty face
A cherry ghost
What to do when we do have some time
But you know you got it up, you gotta get that number
Big dreams we're all about 'em
We'll send them up a message
Everytime I make the round I turn around
Once in a lifetime Once in a lifetime
Been up hurting all night
This cruel world is killing you
I was never cool in school
I sold you a thousand lines
We're segregating, consciences are fading
We're sorry but it's time to go
And I can't help you until you start
You gotta focus on to your ability
To leave your house and home unhaunted
Like it's something that needs repeating
Lean out and touch the treetops over town
She lies on the border,
Until our shells simply cannot hold
I watched you through your window
The world outside created just for you
Six days without sleep means
I don't know where you come from
Our love will stand the test of time
Stacy, do you remember when I mowed your lawn mowed your lawn
And now it's been ten years
Show me a rerun on the W
We've got a fantasy affair
Sadeyed destruction built around sand and sea
Hear the beat still rocking everyone around
And, if so, remind me not to go there, the weather affects my knee
Sometimes my tries 
When I trip on my feet
Hey Hey don't pay no mind
I wanna go home
As I turn my white skin red
Friends go jogging at the track
I've been hoping you're moping around the street again
And I'm never gonna get it just 'cause of my bad credit
We cruise crippled in someone else's shoes
And some shoes on my feet
And I doorbell ditched you
If you had just looked once or twice
You dance all wack
That cried if we ever left his side
So now you're chasin' the American dream
Listen to the beat
And everything I do
And what a sweet sensation 
Sometimes all I want is one favorite song
Outside of the bureau de change in Shanghai
I know you were historical from all the books I've read
To put in my songs of love
Practice makes perfect sense
Yeah sometimes we're high and sometimes we're low
Light a candle, curse the glare
And when I wake tomorrow, I'll bet
Uh, and my band 'bout that money
Just feel the thunder as it warms your face
But homework he can wait
And let your love blaze like
Du blir de du blir vad du gor dig till
Wednesdays they are the worst
You say why, and I say I don't know
I'm makin' money off of verses when I spit 'em on tracks
Togetherness ecstasy is what I need
And cheers rolled out and I thought early of tunas in tenison's tubs
I would fall beneath your feet
No one can tear it apart, yeah
For, for us to get, get down in the after hours
Whenever we're far apart
Why don't you give love
Still my life is heaven sent
All drum rolls and applause
Where everything could change
Big girl, you are beautiful
Love like yours will surely come my way
Eager, hopeful, content to play the friend
Selling subtleties, it sickens me
I should be arrested
Rururururun run run run
Hideaway
I realized you got the car keys still
Block after block
Some people like to call me Chuck
Blow smoke and hold our breath for as long as it takes
Do you remember when Do you remember when
You can try through skin and bone
I'll put a flower in your hair
mais ton regard de braise est tellement froid
An easy girl to miss when you're gone
The ship you used to sail the sea
Hopelessly I'm taking a mental picture of you now
Whoaoaoooh
In a stairwell I seek
Hello, hello, hello
Started hearing voices sometime in June
You must always face the curtain with a bow
But I still have just one more question on my mind
Like the sunset going down
Like a story told
Your lovin' on the side
So please Please
Sie sagen ich hätt' Power und wollen alle meine Tracks loben
And it will be a long time before shit starts to give
And I'll live on in your grieving heart
Good day
But darling these days my favorite view is you
I could be violet sky
Work, work, work, Senora, work it all the time
I spend late nights trying to pick up love
I'm alive  and the world shines for me today
I weigh three times my body
I'm hangin' wit the ballers, yeah, or my nigga Ghost
And this one thing's sure I made no apologies
Could be we step out again
Seconds in a day
And all our troubles will be gone
When the night will begin
And we become silhouettes when our bodies finally go
And you are already missed
What was my number What was my number I don't care
I'm in love but its only temporary
So time be a river rolling into nowhere
And the fishes in the sea 
That's where I spend my time
I'm drunk, I'm singing, I'm happy and loud
So it's here I stand
I won't stop won't stop won't stop the beat
When we touch, don't ever let me go
Turn your left on your right
She don't love
No more stripping in bars
All seem so right
You all deserve what I am walking towards
From ocean to sky, summer and fall
Everybody's in a play
Victim of her black magic
If we ever go back there someday
That stone that's locked you up
Honey, I can stand up and face the world
Because the air outside will make
Everybody's dancin' in the moonlight
Let's perform our favorite little scene, oho
You say you see it almost every time
You got a mouth
Everybody on a shoestring
I almost wish you would have loved me, too
I'll be okay
Don't need approval tonight, tonight
Real sugar
We are strange in our worlds
Go get yourself up straight
I learn to part with a smile on my face
Hey, look, what do you see
But you still put me to sleep
I feel like I'm gonna kiss you
And you don't need me
You're from outer space
Do it for the teenagers and do it for your mom
Oh look at the lovers
Hallelujah Hallelujah here she comes
The things that I wanna say
Well the people will gauk
When I got there, she'd already rubbed it off
You know how to get along
When a kid came along to offer a hand
With a couple of kids running in the yard
Uncovering the ways to plan the next big attack 
The time will sweep
And in the end what have we learned
Held its breath so I could see
Hello partner, tell me love can't fail
And just when you've labeled us one of your types
Of a girl I used to know
You see, we just can't stop it
How things are gonna turn out now
Oh yeah I'm forever lost
I dreamt that you were on a train
So never go away
I know it's seasonal
And now I see you perfectly behind closed eyes
But you did, and you fell, hard on the ground
Cigarette daydream
When I was a young boy
You're every line
You're a sane old boy, you're much too crazy to change
But what you did, yeah
From the hard time living till the Chelsea days
I roll the dye
And I did the same
His man you love, this boy you hate
You are the only thing
Holdin' back everyday the same
You know that us feral kids love straying about
Take me by the hand 
And so much wonderful love for everyone
He said, "If life gives you lemons, then thus god bade
And the storm that you've been hiding from will end
I promise I won't turn around and I won't let you down
Hey, glad girls only want to get you high
Take your chances
It's waiting just for you
So your fireman I will be
When the street lights are far beyond you
It's alive with the beating of a young heart
I want to fall in love tonight
And talk about virility
Hush little baby don't say a word
Nobody ain't a problem, girl
From morning, till the end of the day 
Mystery trip
I could tell when you smile
Nothing you can say, but you can learn how to play the game
"Never let your fear decide your fate"
Wire up the radio
And it's such, it's such a perfect day
There's times I ask myself why
That I managed to give it flight
Do ya, do ya, do ya love me Do ya love me 'cause I wanna know
But you kept my fast to the right, I want to thank you tonight
And walk on me
I saw something beautiful
Like kerosene for dee dee scene
With your grapes and bottled rain
You know he'd rather have his time
The light that you seek just ain't in you today
To tell you the truth
I want someone provocative and talkative
It'll be sad my friend
I just wonder Louie, have you got room for me Louie
But then we'd have to rush back
Where have we gone, It's been so long 
The frightened babies poo
That's why I can't leave my house
Just where it will end
Life sometimes seems to get the best of you
And in every way, I know you still want to stay
Do ya, do ya, do ya, do ya love me Do ya love me 'cause I wanna know
Just keep on getting down
Here come bad news talkin' this and that Yeah
I'm so aware of everything, I'm still aware of where I am
You say, I like what you say
Yeah, I get up 
Long winded Cambridge medicative care
I'd be fired if that were my job
Someone just tell me that it's okay now
We'll have bizarre celebrations I'll play the Satyr in Cyprus, you the bride being stripped bare
Mister Blue Sky, please tell us why
The fire's burning, softly singing songs
And go to a place where she can't find me oh
In my dreams
Backward I brood and forward I dream for figments of existence
The tree by the river
But these days I am a man, I'm not a boy
Into the night, she's lost again
On these less than idealistic romances
You didn't run, you didn't lie
I whistle down the wind
No I'm not the only one
The way you moveit's wonderful
We've got no place to go
Head into the city  well, I guess it can't hurt
So we're going to make friends with you
Monday's child has learned to tie his bootlace
Or a simple song of hope
Yeah, never ends
I say we lose control control 
The watersbrash and dark
I'm working it out inside
Where finding love is a battle
I don't even care
Found out you could, but too scared to try
Well, sometimes I almost regret it
My stolen gold inside the emperors tomb
Ever high, never fall
She's all I want and I've waited for so long
What do I do when my love is away
Always let it get to my head
My ears fill with the sound of descent
Singing to the ones you love
I said we're solid gold
Through all the summers
I'll come back for another year
And I know we won't always be getting along
Some people think that we're running away
Oh the love that I love
My favorite food and my birthday
And you couldn't really know 'cause it's in my toes
Do you know what it's like to care too much
When the Youth of Today and the early  Seconds
Keep shutting down the power
If you wanna look like Rocky Dennis better drink your milk
Yes, I can tell that we are gonna be friends
The way you love me down
To the jungle through the night in paradise, paradise
Didn't get nowhere, switched up diet
She smokes a cigarette, yeah smokes a cigarette
We know what's up, the river will flow
Never mind I'll remember you this
I let my past go past
And I can't make a name for myself
My head's in a whirl and I'll love you till Tuesday
Let's have bizarre celebrations let's forget who, forget what, forget where
Crawling on our knees
It takes two floors to make a story
And you could be so much more than you've become
She took her winter coat from her plastic wrapper
The river looks so good tonight
If you get busted you should stand there proud
Turntables in her eyes
Don't shed no useless tears
Wake up at first light hearing you calling out
We gonna, we gonna, we gonna end up in the morning
Please turn me over
Laughing in the face of love
'Cause he quivers when he hears your song
Make a point to make no sense, well, here it comes
And I know, I know there is joy endowed"
No On Knew Her Worth
Let's go the world ends tonight
Wake up in the morning, stumble on my life
I want to see the wounded moon
Take my hand now, understand me, you can come here too
Out on the town we went 
Don't stop, don't stop don't stop, the beat
I will put the flowers on
You come and take the chance, baby
If you're lonely, you can talk to me
That feeling when you don't want to leave
First I'm gonna sing my song
More than an hour at a time
And all that I can see is just a yellow lemontree
Who always bends when I'm broken
Do ya love me 'cause I wanna know
So you share secrets with Lou, but we've got secrets too 
It's coming around again
How to love or to let love go
Two of us wearing raincoats
Except the mouth
And take the butcher's knife through my words again
You'll think of me and wonder where I am these days At the end of the line
Then we'll wait for it to pass
They never add up anyway
I'd ask the world to dance
Mistakes, heartbreak, and true love
There's a story
And everything else
You make me wanna measure stars
From here to heart arrhythmias
You growl, you howl, you show your teeth
I got yours and you got mine
So I broke into my own old car
And I'm like "The sooner the better",
When he gets to the crowded subway platform
You're gold
Oh man it's not fair
Too easy to say no
And wasted gasstation attendants
Early in the mornin' risin' to the street
Been raining all night so everybody knows 
Back on the road again
And Betty, when you call me
You'll love him till you die
Look what you do to me baby
Does it mean you're good at putting things on paper
I've got a mild fascination for collectors
Turn back to the ground
Wallets empty and we're back at start
Livin' it up in the city
Love will clean your mind
Sometimes I wanna cheat, but I don't
The sky move, the ocean shimmer
Love love me
I never knew you
And with this chance I've missed I feel remiss
Came in the door said it before
Lift up your hearts and sing me a song
Somewhere in the dark
Of all the little things
Maybe then we'll last a million years
There's no last week
I was so scared that you'd leave, so I hid it
No I can't say that I'm in love
And you'll make me smile by really getting into the swing 
And I'm too scared to pick up the phone
It stands for hero, and the hero is me
And I won't listen to their words
Came to London town
Welcome to the island of the honest man
Old teenage hopes are alive at your door
Fingers trace your every outline, oh yeah
You keep on dreaming up
Jag minns varenda scen ifrån vår film
And the people passin' by stare in wild wonder
I run the risk of losing you
Cause something was lost then
You're the getaway car
Yes everything is different
Ohohohoho Honey, honey, sugar, sugar
And if you're feeling me sing it out
Up in a tree knowin' damn well you'll never reach the top
Hey, there's nothing on earth that can save us
Oh, falling, yes, I am falling
Treasure torn out paper from the corner of a page
If you spend every day wishing for the next to come
I've been completely shut down
I'll make my own way
But we don't understand anyway
Would you go along with someone like me
I felt it in my chest as she looked at me
 degrees, that's why they call me Mister Fahrenheit
They'll break me
Music is my hometown
And you, you needed you, you, you needed me to hold you
From inside my soul
To the liquor store around the corner
There are several days
To look to better days
And the inside jukebox roars out just like thunder
Let it always be this way
She loves me again
The cars are moving like a half a mile an hour and I
Four beats from soft
Don't worry, even if things end up a bit
Well I'm afraid I'm not gonna give you back any of those kilojoules
But my Stockholm syndrome
Right now masquerade, master the merry go round
Tonight's jackpot is a pig, hey, that's criminal
Get off your lazy arse, Alfie please use your brain
Where the summer had not touhed the clouds that pass above
Anyone from any other crew
And forgetting the rain
Can't have one
It's all right in front of you
Who threw his arms around me
"The Whiz Man" never fit him like "The Whiz Kid" did
And it's the last time I sit by
Everybody gonna feel alright
Don't I need to see you pull your knee socks up
It's my party, dance if I want to
All you need are your kicks when you need 'em
Man, play something for me DJ, cuz there's nothin' but love
At least a million times
We was all on the cover of Newsweek
I never let a motherfucker break me dogg who gives a fuck if a nigga don't like your steez
I'll never find, no I'll never find another way to say
And love love love all through our minds
In February air
So hold up and take it through the night,
And I want to do so many things to you
There's something about you and you don't even know it
Late nights and early lights
Don't you understand I've told you before
Don't believe me, just watch, come on
Cherry cokes under this moonlit summer sky
Send me on my way
I love you, honey
Just keep me guessing please
And I'm like "there's no way to say and there's nothing I can do
She's been living in her white bread world oh
He and his oldest boy Blair
So won't you please show me yeah
If I'm wrong makes nothing right about yourself
I gave you a foot massage
The wilted flowers that I gave
Go go yeah yeah huh what
And follow our hearts to content, she said
It was here just the other day
And I miss the days of a life still permanent
Ours is a family that's based upon tradition
I love with caution and trust, alone
I always find my way back home
The restless corpse is collapsing wind
Somebody sing hello, hello, hello
I'd write the ending without any sorrow
She's taking an elementary class in kung fu
Come and open up your folding chair next to me
Come on, come on, if you feel a little lighter
Don't tell me 'cause you think I don't know shit about the way you feel
And she loves him
Taper jean girl with a motel face
There's a painter painting his masterpiece
That makes you act the way you do
You keep saying the past is not dead
You can hide the money, I'll mark an X,
Oh if you find yourself amongst the lonely ones
I could not crawl back if I tried 
Your holiday
Broken hearts hurt but they make you strong and
To your place, place, place
Is something I will never do without you
Get right down to the bottom of the barrel and float back on top
And though I'd love to be the guy
Will decant the excess salt from the sea 
She's a one oh
Is The Equipment In A Pyramid
But still I am in love with this life
Battened down to fare the wind
I put what I want, when I want, in my body
Hell if Jesus had the power then so do I 
But if you look twice
Fridays I see your face
And I won't let you steer, commandeer the atmosphere, since you suggested running away Romantic
I'm in over my head inside
And we were drunk as shit
He drop the record, I start a stampede
Was there anything else
Rolling right along 
Just pure fiction, that's all right
This is your pay back
To be part of the miracles you see in every hour
Va piè via dialetto guarda,
Oh, someday I'll wish upon a star
When you kiss my nose, the feelin' shows
Till I saw the American dream come true
As the shadows played tricks on the girl in the dark
Girl in the blue with the big bust on 
The words that I longed to hear
Dark damp has stopped where I once stood
For all of these simple things and much more a flower was born
'Cause I need more time
They just look away
I promise you I'll pay you back with Time
What did we ever do to these guys
Hey Julie, look what they're doing to me
'Cause lovin' is what I got, I said remember that
Un p'tit air sur trois tours
Your fickle heart's unwavering
The way I saw the world when I was young
And I hope, I hope you're arranged out"
Yeah, now I'm back at your door
For anything that uses my back
I feel so fake happy
Tried to put mind over matter
There's a big day waiting for you
That you are all you're meant to be
Feel what I feel today
Oh no we were waving like the trees
Your heart may long for love that is more near
And round and round clockwise
They travel in the air
For your criminal clothing that fled the scene
And let me know that you're mine let me know you're mine
I'm drivin' fast, I feel so fine
'Cause sharing some meals is something
It's coming around
And everything will be okay
The riders on the chan de lise
Everybody will die
True love
Could be tomorrow but then
I can't get insured for the state I'm in
And I wish I could say that it ended just fine
Everybody needs a bosom for a pillow
If you say, I'm always yours, ooh
You, you know, you know my name
So come on minger
I was never meant to go to school
Not just my home girl
Now a whole lotta woman 
With your own eyes
And it ain't nobody's business No
So let that wonder take you into space
That you will be around
You know the miserable do love company
As the tanks roll into town, as the tanks roll into town
When I met you, I said my name was Rich
If nothing else
Can't get no sleep tonight, damn it feels so good tonight
Beside a boy, you just don't know if he is up for
You put me in the magic position, darling so
So I could hug you like a man"
Wish I could say to you 
Do you remember when Do you remember when
Sweet honey
For the second time
What if all I want in this world
For anyone else but themselves
I recall, a time when I knew it all
Ever so careful on the strip
But restlessness has siezed me now, it's true 
Yes, but, you're a girl
I can't stop, I can't breathe, I can't think
One day one woman asked him
Mm get high with a little help from my friends
Hold till my blues fade
Don't want to break her crown
To Friday night's reversal of time
Just go ahead, let your hair down
Carry me through the night In the hills and highlands
I thought relationships were nothing but a waste of time
Lets forget about the rain
Hey, trees fall and so do men
Take my hand, close your eyes
We can dance, we can dance, everybody's takin' the chance
People on the street now
You show me yours, I'll show you mine
Yes I need you
Please take me away from here
Hey girl, you've got a fine laugh
The way you love me, eh eh
Some cheap red wine Some cheap red wine
Watch out for flying glass
And I knew we'd view it piece by piece
Its gotta be at least a thousand degrees
Take it, baby
My lover, I've been donating time to review
Payback the chicken
'Cause I can feel it, I can see it,
You gave me the word, I finally heard
Boy your love makes me feel like
Found him on the couch one night cold and stiff
Life is ill, again life's a movie
Now you've been sighted, oh, do you live till you die
Better believe that it's gonna be the biggest night of the year
And one just ain't enough 
That this won't be one of them
Everyone around, love them, love them
Every step I took and street I've walked
You never let me fall
But the pretty girls don't look at me
Or just some mother's wasted son
And my reasons for the way I love you
A lazy day
And we can go to that private view
Tell me all about your day
From now on trust my feeling is true
On the back of my neck
Fall in love to Down on the Street
We have gone to the country 
a touché mon cœur dans sa chemise à carreaux
I know she's the only one
We'll be waiting some are praying
Thinking bout tomorrow 
I understand when your girl is stressing you out
Maybe I better stay in bed
The finer things keep shining through
And shivering we cling together and watch it pass us by
Why I make that face Oh why would I
But it's always the same problem,
There's a girl right next to you
Pressing on, all my distress is going, going, gone pressing on, pressing on
I beat her and kept her apart from the things that she loved
And I'm already gone
And I want all the world to see we've met
She goes out looking for
Dansa fran botten for att na toppen
All I need is you
Well, it's safety dance
They ain't helpin' noone else, it's a hazard to your health 
And the wind catches your feet
Baby your love
Now here's a happy ending to believe in
What are you waiting for
That you will believe in love
I guess there's got to be a break in the monotony
Till that day, just
So bang your head against the wall
Look straight ahead, nothing but blue sky
But all I see is films where a colourless despair
Sipping tea in the bar by the road side,
Don't close the door, on what you adore
The sky the trees, houses, buildings, even my own body
And it's a chicken fight clan
Oh, I'm having so much fun
And I will pay no mind
Cause who knew that my luck would change
Emptier still and there probably won't be
It won�t take long to get when you feel like you're soaring
I'll maybe tell you all about it someday
Can't let go of it,
We don't need to drive, oh no
Can you feel the drops as it starts to rain
With my toes dangling into the sea
Fact, you wanna turn back
And if you should know girl, let's get a bit lower now
One day my prayers are gonna be answered
But in some ways they remain the same
You've got no reason to be scared
Uptown funk you up ah
I could deal with this nonstop spinning world
When you go into the place
Hello Seattle, I am the crescent moon
It's okay to call Aaah
And find the distance to the stage too far
Speak through these walls
Ooh yeah, days when the rains came
How far I gotta go to reach you
Live your life
The voice of  years experience
Put away change for Ibiza
If we were a pair of jigsaw puzzle pieces
'Cause when it's black means "watch your back" because you're probably
That we were meant to be just right
"Well, there's something I never told you about that night"
Never been lost in anyone, it's me they want
Just like water takes the shape of where it's held
Or let the sky be grey
And everything in between
I dreamed of summer sex with you and you whispered in my ear
The repositioned light, the post atomic night
And if they come for us,
I'm scared of what you'll do 
Everything seems nice
Hits the bottle and goes right to the rock
Because we're what you want to solve all your problems for tonight
I trace the faith to a broken down television
Awatchin all the snow that's fallin'
"You are too young to put all of your hopes in just one envelope"
There's somethin' 'bout the way the street looks when it's just rained
And all the people on the island they already know why they sing
Let me take you on an escapade, let's go
The one that tells you to taste past the tip of your tongue
Work hard, now we know how to top bills
Just because they can doesn't make it all right
Shake it, shake it, susugar
My heart always seems to know
The bracelets and the beads
Limping and broken the tunnel fell in
I woke up on that sunny street 
Your cold fronts and the rain don't matter
We still think that we owe you some
One is for the money
From your lips, a precipice 
Every time my tears run dry
You run
"Wake up young dragon, let's go get compromised"
We'd moved to the West Coast
Your own history
Without you, my heart is blue
And it always somehow seemed to fall apart 
Oh let the rain fall down
 part nos vies qu'on laisse de côté
His red head and his red eyes
On the outside
That your dad was gettin' wise to you now
How did it come to this
To get across the sense of impending doom
As soon as he marries her then she starts
One day, we're gonna get out
Are those eyes overrated They make me want to give up on love
But I'll return to you
With my best friend
Hit the ground
Teacher marks our height against the wall
If you want them raised right you I guess you start them young
Spray painted bricks and dead firewood
What's with these homies dissin' my girl
All the looks of love were staged
Leaf by leaf and page by page
Just don't give away your selfrespect
And what did we find
Find the snail to give us breath, to give us words
I arrive through a window, I leave through a hole in the wall
I welcome the sun
Because tomorrow always happens yesterday
What're you tryin' to say to me
I'll give it back
And I may not be your salvation but I'll offer nonetheless
This car might make a good old boat
You're feeling sociable
I need my baby, I need my baby
And all I say is I don't wanna say good night
I love you
I know you'll mess up your hair
This world would be
Then they can't aget awhat they want to steal
We gotta kick that gangster shit
Neon black corpses, stacked, eclipse the horizon
Everyday Christmas, give Travie a wish list
Go, go, baby don't go
I don't do crowds, everyone put it down to rudeness
I guess I've always been a bit of a fighter
And I was just walking on one fine wire
Oh yeah 
Tungsun
But sometimes I forget
The honey's stuck us by the hair
This little southwest village shouldn't cost that much
But you should know I take it both ways
At the end of the day, when there's no one watching
And make you feel alive and good
The spookiness of night surrounds us in trees
They're done washed away
No, don't you worry, we'll all float on alright
In a day or two
And never come down
Please say she'll change
Make it like your birthday every day
You're so ooh You're so, so ah You're so, you're so Hey, hey, yeah
Well, it all amounts to nothing 
Yeah, the road gets harder
Oh my, that's a big plan you've got there
Merry Christmas, girl
All my loving, I will send to you
No you will never stop me
All you need is love Hey
Spitting hype things 
And you'll turn your head
You'll be a fighter of fires 
You didn't think that they were too great
From the fire
You're looking at me
Surrounded by some china men
Throwing out your frown and just smiling at the sound
And watch the Sunday gang in Harajuku
And I'm losing all those stupid games
In the middle of our world, I'll be waiting
She said, "Be my photo bitch and I'll make you rich"
Wherever you are
I'll huff, I'll puff and blow you away
So sweetly you said
From all the drinks I get drunk off music
Oh no Please God, tell me we're dreaming
Cigarettes and songs with a winter's chafe
If there's no quiet corner to get to know each other
I'm a bad muthafucka, I'm way too fuckin' co'l
Bins up front
What will be revealed today
Don't you love them enough to stay
The roots are shooting up through the tool shed
Everything is ok we can try to make it
And sometimes my patience in the whole process starts bending
And she do what I say and I say what I mean
Can't get over your love
'Cause holy cow, I love your eyes
Just sign on the dotted line 
Government man spin his politics till they got you pinned
There's no way to convince you, girls
And I would gladly hit the road, get up, and go if I knew
To fix the world up for you
They didn't know they'd been disabled
Well the sun one day will leave us all behind
In the summertime girls got it goin' on
We're moving away
I want a kiss that's as sharp as a knife
But I hear you crying in your sleeping bag
I just want to feel something today
It's words I wanted
What did I do to you
At Waiamea Bay Inside, outside, USA
And your daddy ain't around to pay your bills
Will decant the excess salt from the sea
A loss of the senses
And after all this time
Like authors and painters
We run green
Say goodnight and go
Well I was never meant to be the good boy
But I'm in love with Stacy's mom, ohho ohho
But I can't live that way, oh
'Cause something
When out of the orange colored sky
Wire up a radio
'Cause honey when I get up close to you close to you
Despite all the wrong, dragging you back
And let you settle down Let you settle down
Where did you go now where did you go
to light the eyes of all the harmless sociopaths
The sky was gold, it was rose
I wanna hear you say oh oui 
Now what happened to our coat of arms
Come downdowndown, my love is calling
I've been ghosting, I've been ghosting along
And faith is growing thin
All the way to my car
Like a strangers love
When you're worried, call me
She said, "Oh my sweet goodness, wish you could be here every time
And one time playing football I pulled the tendons in my leg
My life
Coming to take you away
And boy, you got it so wrong
My face as I'm dying to figure out a girl
You got that keeping it warm
You don't need treats
Feel sick after every meal I'd say
To live their life on a sunny day
Is always greener in someone else's yard
But all I saw was twenty miles of wilderness so I went
I'm on my way, gonna make it big, gonna make the songs for the chicks to dig
Don't let your friends tell you why
Look the other way,
Because if I could have my way
Don't care what you do now
I didn't want you around
I wanna live my life now
The word is on your lips  say the word
You'll be my American boy
It's all about your rotten lies
Came back at noon
I'm not going to let stuff get me upset, and I won't let all the little things get me depressed
So the fortunate kids, yeah they left on their lights
We're falling to the ground
Well, give me all you got and don't hold it back Yeah
And in the evening she's a singer with the band
At any time my little world seems blue
Ah ah ah yeah
Give her up a song and then ask for it back
In a forest grove at dawn
Baby don't pretend
And I wondering what to say but my eyes do the talking so well
Sitting in our dreamy daze by the water's edge
Your smile into striptease
I saw that boy, standing there with a deal, and he said
She's only one life away
No, I'd never make it through without you around
Why did you leave me here alone
Yeah, kiss me like we die tonight
If I want to change the world, it's gotta start with me
It's not the first time
But not so cool man if you care
Try to look in her eyes
Mark the rhythms that I shook
Back to the things that got you here
Silver moon's sparkling, so kiss me
And when I see ya walking down the street
Strong wind, strong wind
Ooooohhoohooooh oohoohoohoohoohoohooh
Kinda like this thing but there's something you should know 
Will it ever stop
Gimme back what I lost
I learned to wave goodbye
I won't give the chance to be my enemy
Waiting for travellin' light
Rollerskates, them lines
Well, let me introduce you to my style
I can't stand to think about
I can hear it in the back of my mind
Look what you've done
It finally seems like we've turned into strangers
Is more than you'll say
You better believe that we're all getting down
So, just stay with me, I will love you endlessly
And I still dream of you
But for me there's a devil and an angel's voice
La la la la, friends friends friends
It's a shock, not a kiss
One or two ooh's
In my mind, I miss you every night that you're not here
You gotta swim
Feel your magic touch
You're bad mood just ties my hands
Everyone in town wanted to be around you
Mach dich bereit doch wart' nicht zu lang,
It was beautiful, slow dancing to tunes of Billie Holiday
Still be my friend
But she's been gone
You can sit around and wait for the phone to ring At the end of the line
And fill you with songs of love
I don't understand your reasons
No heart flutters in late spring
A candy man, a candy man, a candy man
I'm a child yeah 
Ancient walls of whispers tumblin' down
Starts out easy, something simple, something sleazy
The only way is down, I can see that now
And it is the one thing I'd almost forgot 
Time ticks by, where did you go
Maybe I just need a change, maybe I just need a new cologne
Why did I come home, 'cause I hate it here
That's what takes up time in this life
You've been looking good today
Now, You got it, you're wow wow wow wow
You've got a strange infatuation with a love that's in the air
With another young man
Well, she woke up from a weird dream
In deep confusion, in great despair
Now we're falling, falling, falling , falling into the night, into the night
And you stashed my heart
It's a new day, In a new land
Und erst dann trifft man sich irgendwo zu zweit
Ooh ooh ooh
Always when we fight
The song is for all the ones who's singing out loud
You see this perfect boy,
"Don't you dare look back
Let's go, right now
Baby, then there wouldn't be a single thing we couldn't do
Always running through my head
Lift your open hair
A new hell he must conquer and destroy
And I was denied the future I'd been searching for
I want you to understand
But you still read
Jo Davies and the band,
Let's go for a ride
Just an itty bitty little bit hot
I wonder could they tell, how did they know
Oh yes, safety dance
I can see clearly now the rain is gone
You're holding onto me
I lose control of myself when ever you are near me
Come out to the west backsides of my eyes
And so the story goes
So, so I need it too
From something Paul said
Pay the piggy back, back,
But if I should break
Spread the word and you'll be free 
And we will wait for you
We get high in back seat of cars
But we had to move on
Hello Seattle, I am a cold seahorse
Oh lovely Rita, meter maid
And a heart of steel, always on her own
No, it didn't used to be like this
Big effects and big named stars
And we'll collect the moments one by one
We'll fight fire with fire, fire with fire, fire with fire
That I gotta let you go
The words are
The beautiful ones are always crazy 
I don't remember what you said to me that night
None of these remedies, I feel
Cause who I put my faith in it ain't no four leaf clover
Turn it up turn it up mash it up
Little darlin' come with me
And were just like, how Rousseau depicts man in the state of nature
The wind that wakes the ocean For ya
Sure is the greatest thing 
I got nothing to say
For sticking two together
Leave your boy so far from home
We both know I won't be standing still
But this morning
Can you tell me what's the point, man
At the mountains at the birds at the ocean at the trees
Lighten up, it's gonna brighten up
Because in supermarkets they turn the lights off when they want you to leave,
Never miss opportunity
What's that thing on your chest
Some are the messengers
It's funny
I like to move around
And there's a light on in Chicago every pane of glass
When I'm hated, damn, wish me well
And it's not like I can't stand
Should I look older just to be put on your shelf
The kiss will know if lips stay still
Do I repulse you with my queasy smile
Don't go kidd yourself well not today
The party's crashing us now
Because you act so tough, I totally lost control
Trouble is sometimes
I wanna come home
Love's what I got don't start a riot
Someone's been sleepin' in my bed
Yeah if I lived in China, I'd have some Chinese children
I'm dancing and singin' in the rain
Yeah let's dance, come on and dance
And my girlfriend went and cheated on me
An end to that my friends
Sometimes living out your dreams,
For letting you go
When you are away
It's said and done
Primo mixing  Noreaga talking
And it's not much, if anything
Escapade Let's save our troubles for another day ooh
Even the walls start caving in
Sailing sasailing through the clouds
Blazing down that highway on my way to Rock Star Land
And I'd sell records by the ton
You make me go out my own mind
And we were back in '
Anything that you might do
I'm still taken by surprise
I didn't say
Brand new on the scene, it's the Team called Go
And ponder on everything we say we trust 
And everyday I push him off and tell him boy we're over
You'd think the world was ending right now"
Take me in and dry the rain, 
Now When we do our thing, it's an original groove
Hey, I'm a cherry ghost
Take back this and that
To the jungle through the night in paradise
I'm trav'ling at the speed of light
Some guy wrote 
The view is the prophet
And the touch of your lips
Sleeping to dream about you and I'm so tired
And shopping for breakfast to be eaten all alone
And let your love show and you'll know what I mean
All right, at five minutes to midnight
There's a preacher down on th and farnam street
Goddamn right, it's a beautiful day only you
All night, all night, all night
And you put my feet back on the ground
I want to repair your desire
We will find that we're stuck in the middle
Sometimes I need to be alone oh yeyeah
What I'm looking for
Next I'm getting on the plane
Morning, noon and nighttime too
And the purple's talking down
Chop another line like a coda with a curse
In my mind, in my mind
And I won't say a word of its true if it's not true
Let yourself be enchanted, you just might break through 
Won't be long till the truth comes out 
And in the end, you'll know I've lied
I got a wild heart
You are the colour my dear
Or in between the attic and the basement
And you could say "Your love to me",
You're better than money
Because you're bringing me in
Oh, we celebrate our love
Do you feel the same
It's just like a funeral
And it's me and you and were shakin' the ground
When I met you I said my name was Rich
You're the kind of guy that blows my mind
Dress falls down at the aftershow
And bury them beneath the sea
Hey, Madeline Hey, Madeline
Complete with deceit,
I'm not in love with you
Feel myself hovering off the ground
I need your love
There is no other one who can take your place
You know that you make it shine
Wherever I'm going, I'm already home
Do ya need a little time
A little bit of Monica in my life
Wide eyed, panic on the getaway
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Well then we've got to end it before it's too late
Clap your hands if you want some more,
And I need you to help me put on my clothes 
You can sleep here on the floor
We are strange in our world
You're so unreasonable
Let's pretend we don't exist, let's pretend we're in Antarctica
Well, some things just, some things just make sense
Oh but it's gone
Do you feel like you're falling down
Let me get to know you better to make me less attracted
My hands were meant for somewhere else
I feel I've got a lot to prove
Turn around your back on each other
I'll have to walk a thousand miles
Well, I see trees of green and red roses too
She will be gone
There is nothing stopping me
I can't refrain 
I don't want to get up oh
Your nightmares only need a year or two to unfold
People say Mr Pleasant is good
You knew that I adored ya
But I would never kiss your lips
She fell in love with another
To spend my time missin' you
I feel much better, baby, when you're near
My head was full of brilliant dreams
Electricity wires are down
Clouds come
That surround me
You know, you got me going now got me going
Be easy on the kid
Do you love, what you like
Oh yeah, all of the tension 
La la la la, friends 
We'll be swimming in the sea of wisdom and serenity
And the only thing constant was the constant reminder they'd never change
Selling subtleties, it sickens me 
Trying to pick up a girl
Little girls doubledutch on the concrete
I'm just being honest Hey ya
From the other direction, she was calling my eye
Made me feel weak and
Oh baby, I need one more chance, ha
And II, I wanna be you lover baby
Lying on your bed, I think you're pretty too
Self around me
Never wonder what the hell went wrong
You've one more chance, so get it right
We end up together
Getting closer to your butterfly
"This thing gave me writer's cramp"
I give smile a give a song
I think I'm in love,
Now that summer is here
It's nothing wrong with perfect and perfect
When the war ends, yeah
Because my dreams are bursting at the seams
Living your life in the gray
To help me through this time
You'll soon run out of choices
But when you are, that's when a
And it won't take flight
Took two showers a day and I dressed up like a princess
I got me so down, I got me a headache
All my youth, the young offender
Your brain gets smart, but your head gets dumb
Every minute I have needs to be made up, but how
Close your eyes close my eyes
With the girl next door
Don't waste another day at all
So just listen to the reasons and the hints I've been giving
And shakin' my hand
When I'm lost inside a dream
Like a ferris wheel, full of bluegreen eyes
To light up the room
So tell me where I'm standing now
And shout out and wave my arms and hold my tongue
Give love, give love
But I still talk that caaash
A goodnight's rest on the floor,
"Peace on Earth" to everyone that you meet
Under fourteen feet of clothes
Shake you coconuts, come on, coco girls
Cool out, thinkin' we local, c'mon homey we major
Escapade Well, you could be mine
Was filled with darkness
You can wear my clothes
The spaceman says, "Everybody look down
The letters on the pages that you memorize
And everybody knows you're a liar
Dansa till din rhythm Dansarens drottning blir ej besviken
With the last ways left to remember, sing
In your life
And the trees lean to lend, 
You'll feel it when the dance gets hot
In the twilight of these white nights
And I kept it with golden things
I don't see what anyone can see in anyone else
Your books write themselves, they line up in row after row
Baby look what you've done now
Almost loved you
In my pocket piece of paper and a key
Oh baby, don't stop me now I'm having a good time
There's a reason for the sunshine sky
Sing on and on and on through the town
Sacrificing all the things that we had
So tell me why our movement's out of time
Someone who needs me Aheh, heh, hey yeah
I need some help, help me out boys
I love you
You'll be doing it a while, livers only fail
Let's save our troubles for another day
It's very funny 'cause I got your fuckin' money
Let's pick a fight on whomever we like
If you could make your own money and then give it to everybody 
I try the light therapy from the Xeroxmachine
So what's wrong with taking the back streets
Got my toes on my pup at the foot of my bed
I've got friends who have married
The dark canyon wall, the call and the answer
Not my, not my, not my My imagination
Know that maybe I will be okay
He was looking to the sky and
Meaningless scientific breakthrough
Biggy hat, little hat, fatty man, skinny man
And I don't know how it gets better than this
Tell 'em violence has taken the wind out of my sail
And I, I'll drink all the time
He said, "Hey, sister, it's really, really nice to meet ya"
You charmed the lifeguard, he let them use the pool all day for free
Just wait and see we might be made for this
Tell me, you'll always want me to stay
Looking for a way that I can see your face
And he knows it's time for all the wrong reasons and time to end the pain
But he couldn't understand why no one would go
Singing "I see songs in shapes and colours
I wish she'd let me be 
Each other's eyes 
You won't mind
Smiling in the pictures you would take
Let's rewind
Remind me the things last night I should have left unsaid
I hang on every word
Friends tell you when your fly's undone
Asleep and constantly floating away
I don't care Fingers through your hair,
I don't need a God to make me feel all right
Will you break and take all the worlds from my mouth
As if there were apartments smaller than mine
Right about that time is when I come back to life
And then she's right there next to me
Well, I should probably warn you I'll be just fine Yeah
Well, it's all right, riding around in the breeze
A thousand ways that I can hurt you
You left your black gloves on my table
I know that you'll feel better
She still hears music in the air
The old republic was dead and gone
I look into your eyes and say 
Where friends won't debate my health
I can't stand missing out so when you call me, call me
We say
You just sit and get stoned with yearolds,
Your style, your voice, your points of view
Went home and cried to her mama tonight
And they pulled it out of my head
Ooh, by your side
Ooh Here I am, and in this city
Used to be in my backyard
Ain't nobody's business
And you drag your feet
Singing songs of love to pass the time
I caught it on the rebound and landed with a soft sound
Mummy always wants you to come for tea
You lost your focus but I got a plan for it
Everybody let's go have some fun
Every pot of gold fill and full of distortion
Sadder than the end of Summer 
You're breaking into separate parts
Baby, come on, yeah
Your wounds are going to heal 
Learn a little givin' and stop
Everything that I had till my feet went numb
From side to side
Livin' with louie dogs the only way to stay sane
No no no no no no are you crazy 
When I worked in retail they said I was a slob
But you will end up all alooone
I keep writing songs that are all my own
See how they run
I saw your wife the other day
I'm the last chick standing up against the wall
We can't makeup for the lost time that we both apologize for
I gotta get some
Just say yes do it now 
Says it's gonna heal it but, you won't make the call
I'm so aware of where I am, but I don't know where that is,
And if you want some fun ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
When the first cup of coffee tastes like washing up
Is hoping to take you away
If I only knew your name
Carousels make laps each night 
And all my friends
To give up everything
The sound, the sound, the sound
It's got a CD player
She got my heart again
Oh baby, yeah my heart's a thumping, you
I can't deny these things that I do
Man, I love
And you tell me what you need
You have a lovely singing voice
'Cause it's alright
I'm the sorest sight, now I feel like trash
And I forget myself
And when she kissed you on the kisser, boy, you kissed her back
A pretty girl is like a minstrel show
Don't try to let yourself down
And outrage and mesmerize
I think it's the last time for us
Could you be my love, my love ooh
Trying to keep my head on straight
Can't aget awhat they want to steal
I wish I were free from this pain in me
Felt a wave a rush of blood
As we exchange strangers and lies
When I wake up in the morning, love
I've just got to get myself over me
Hey All right now
Everyday that summer by your side
And for a moment I escape and I forget
Until I come back to hold your hand
Brand new tecs, food stamps and welfare checks
Living in the moment
Stay right where you are
Where I almost did five years and then seven more
See you better act fast because supplies they never last
I'll love the earth someday 
Sell a block for  you got for  a gram
I'm glad I hitched my apple wagon to your star
Zone  through , you know what I'm sayin'
We can do anything we want to
Remember through sounds, remember through smells
Take it back if I thought it'd make it work
Rarely removed
And you want to go for a ride
But there is no chance I'm going to do it again
The teacher had you write a letter, you were eight years old
Couldn't see me without you babe
Watered down, the rain will help you out 
I might be accustomed to walk
But his best work was his letters home
Go surfin' the sun as it starts to rise
After all this time
Oh, here she comes
'Cause I know that you did 'cause your friend told me that you liked it
Yin yang yin yang yin yang ying yonana phone
Or what happened in the end
No surprises in the record collection, you must have thought I was someone else
Heaven was a place still in space not in motion
And talk about me
Why did you give up on me so soon 
Love bird, you flew into my window
Tracing the lines of my face for
In love with someone
'Cause honey you know
These dreams under my pillow
All the day I wait
Anything we've ever owned
It's Saturday and I won't be long
Still, I only feel all right when the VU is flashing
To get a word from the wise,
I'm in love but its only temporary, temporary
Little bit of love, love, I feel as if I'm wastin'
And on our hands, our wrinkles understand we never really wanted more
But you call me when you're bored and you're playing with yourself
The voyage to the corner of the globe
In the diary of a priest, in the sheets that lie upon his bed
You say you can but you don't know
You came like a thief in the night and stole my heart
A smattering of distant applause is ringing in my poor ears
But I still wanna know
My friends say I'm uncool
'Cause Ievery time I think I'm fine
And if I should falter, would you open your arms out to me
And standing on a pigeon toe in his disarray
Popular mechanics for broken hearts could help me now
I don't get drum and bass
You're too pure for this wicked world
He's far too innocent to be a part of
That's making me feel good
I need that engine's push
This time could be what
He pointed to a conch shell and then to the lime
Is it 'cause you're just like your mother Like your mother
And her daddy is an engineer,
I hear the music all the time, yeah
That gets to walk off with the girl
I'll call the white house, have a chat
'Cause every time I see your bubbly face
They'll never take my body from your side
I'll stop the world You've seen the difference and it's getting better all the time
What you get is what you see
I spent the winter on the verge of a total breakdown while living in Norway
To call the shots and name the price honey
If we could all say we're sorry
And you could be a love to me,
And there's a light inside of me
Bright light in my eyes, oh, this desert's a tease
Okay I mean, don't get excited, man It's 'cause I'm short, I know
It's been undeniably dear to me, I don't know why
I wanna feel this way today
When I was a young boy I got a stereo and I taped all the songs straight off the radio
Get down from your tree house sittin' in the sky
We got gas to get that straight, we movin at a fast rate
All of the roads are open
And completely new to me
Falling down 'round our very heads
This is it, call it quits with honesty
Number one
Sometimes you reach what's realest by making believe 
Change, changing the way
But if I can save you any time
For a time when no one's cheatin'
Waking up warm in your arms and without a care
I'll never get to tear your clothes off on the photo copier
I wonder if you're gonna wait for me
I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the mirror
My words get lost in the moment of things
And then walked you home through the park
I got to tell you something
We hit the sky, there goes the light
Stole my temper back from the lost and found
I won't need 'em anymore
She said what did you think your mother would do this and how would your father react oh lord
Seven weeks of river walkways
When it gets dark I tow your heart away
Timbaland and JoJo
All I know is I'm in love
And I've only got one sock
Stacy's mom has got it going on
Payback the donkey
I cried myself to sleep last night
But being myself is something I do well
Of the life that's teeming in the dirt
In the backyard
Its only 'cause the sun shined once again
As the world keeps spinning round
Inside I heard the trumpets call
Ooh, there's no stopping us
I just have to look at you
I guess I changed my mind
When I woke there was noone there
I got a shelf full of books and most of my teeth
In honesty it's been a while
Pass the wealth around
I tried to call you names
But you know which way my pendulum's swinging
No offense to you, don't waste your time
To taking props from nineties boy band fashions
Now I see the vision through your eyes
What I thought I would say
This hit, that ice cold
With their petals on my back
I'll have you time travelin', have your mind babblin'
But if the sun will rise, bring us tomorrow
Got to carry some stairs to get near enough
Book to shelf, and foot to shoe
Brand new sheets, let's break them in
And I, I keep stallin' and keepin' it together
The road is pulling me into her open where
I remember feeling like a ship whose captain was too drunk to steer
And I want something else to get me through this life, baby
That touches you and takes you far from faith
I'm shot to the moon
And look it's on my backx
Could this be true, it all comes down to you
I jumped so high I touched the clouds 
In the end, you find out that my heart was battered
So am I in this alone
Friends go out and grab a snack
I'll be back in the ballroom swingin'
Lead me to the land that you understand
Watch you change your light bulb
'Cause I use mouthwash  Sometimes I floss;
You can keep it inside
And the dance clubs
I saw a light at the end of the tunnel
And I want to know everything that you do
Dance with me pretty boy tonight,
Over a sea of grief, Scarlet died
We're drivin' down the road, I wonder if you know
Can we take the next hour
I'm lucky that my father's still alive
And since you're headin' up to Carolina
It was worth it just to learn some sleight of hand
Don't expect the world with no work that's absurd
We've surfed and danced and all the faces 
Point at the epiphanies and call 'em all drug related
Seems like there's always someone who disapproves
His black shirt cries while his shoes get cold
You're so ooh You're so, so ah You're so, so cool Baby, you're so supersupremelybabadioh
Lost in a silent ballet
Chelsea, Chelsea, tell me you love me
A holiday in August
Time, where did you go
Could be a blue blue Christmas for you
And time's not poison but once you drink it all you'll die
I'll stay until the weekend
We can stick around and see this night through
Long hair cloggin up the drain
Bottomed out in the long run
Because I know this time
Who are faceless and born without names
Learning to counterfeit their disease
Roger will attempt to write a bittersweet
All right, all right, all right
And I don't breathe
When you're on a golden sea
I'm just comin' here to come down
And I won't run for my life
I'm sitting here in the boring room
And gave thanks for being a hundred and still feeling amazed
It's a secret no one knows
A lifetime full of words to say
The light that passes though me
A time outside this pressure 
While the world just stayed the same
Singing in German the cold summer warning
And any snide remarks from my father about your tattoos will be ignored
Killed a flower in someone's garden, but I don't care,
I'd rather talk to you
When you think you're right
Brama, am I shallow cause all my clothes designer
Nigga come through flickin' and he had that shine
Well, some people try and treat me like a man 
I sold my soul way down in the dirt
We'll make dreams come true
I wrote her a song
Gravity has a way of pinning us to the ground
Fillin' up my mind
Making up a mess of fun
You wanna lose control
Your looking east
And it hurts to see these companies be stealin' the life
Till I opened my eyes and walked out the door
Billy Liar's got his hands in his pockets
It should be clearing up soon if only in dreams
With time, time, time
But I'm no fool, I can't stand here betrayed
No I don't feel like I'm falling
Don't you know you spin me out of control
Outside a bed and breakfast
Ooh, ooh, ooh ooh ooh
I couldn't tell the truth
A wolf from the steps,
He don't understand
And get me home for tea 
So maybe I should stay and map around your world
With your head hanging upside down
Love is hard but that's all right
Spare me of this cause
I wanna make you feel alive at night
I'm given all I got to make you stay
Like a satellite or star
The dog has not been fed in years
I felt like I could just fly
There always the same
Wonderin' if there's clouds and stuff in hell
It's a little bit me, a little bit me
You're bundled up now, wait 'til you get older
I climbed the hill, I wanted to look down on you
Have you heard that sound before
It's only right on movie night
That's the way we get by
And the star of it is Photo Jenny
Or do you prefer to fly
Lookin' at the sky
"Everybody needs a little Devastation"
It roughed my steel and shut my mouth
I'm willing to go on, but not alone, not now
It's not as if the sun won't shine
Remember back when we were young and still above
Without you by my side I just can't sleep
Ya' take a holiday, is this what you want
When you're holding me
He's supposed to show me where the money is
This is my face
I'm waiting for you
Give some time to prove that I can trust you again
I don't care about the world
And sometimes I'd rise to the challenge
Huh all right
Tiny minded twotone suckers
You got a feeling nothing here is free
Never thought it would come to a goodbye
'Cause music is the mantra unwinding your head
But you, obviously, you didn't want to stick around
Celia, you're breaking my heart
"Ok, let's fly", she says, "this carpet's made for two"
I bought a one way ticket
I'm a little bit wrong
Often Sara would have spells where she lost time
We're on to something good here
The people follow the signs
'Cause she'll never be mine
What in God's name did I do
You're blushing red, your head can't hide those thoughts of dread
And when I look to the shape of the sky
I can tell by your shakin' hands that you want me
He catches the moon looking down from the stars
Please come with you
Can I get get get to know, know you better, baby
Then every little thing is gonna be alright
Love isn't this game where
God made, God made love
And you know that ain't bad, oh yeah
To share this life with one I hold so dear
Writing letters on my wall
And when they say that I'm just a terrible kite
And when the night is through 
Like skies that are so blue
Tag your face just to rub it in
But mine and my baby
He thought I might need his help
It was made up in your mind, could be anyone, anywhere
Is Valerie Plame, if that really is your name
There's twenty girls for every single boy
A limegreen lizard scuttles down the cabin wall
Half of the ring lies here with me
But the blues are still blue
'Cause you're bad, bad news
Jackknife in your sweaty hands
I heard you say in some interview that "feminist"
Gonna cry, yeah
So puff out your chest in some weird dusty fight
So alone
I forgot to do my homework
Then you stumbled around for a good ten minutes 
Wherever we touch back down
A watering hole
When I met you I didn't know what to do
Found a life worth living for someone else
George Burns' pacemaker beats steady slow and low
I leave tear stains on the ground
I'm in it to win it, sit back picture that
All we need's a little time to chase the blues away
Make out with all your dumb friends
Who let you down
My feet are still sore, my back's on the fringes
When you thought you would break me
And people are people, regardless of creed
And be there till the end
You're a bitch
Turned out just to make of me an honest man
Oh what a world it seems we live in
Wonder how I'm managing to smile oh
Where do you go after midnight
In my bed I watch TV
Is your bed made, is your sweater on
It is the wind beneath your feet that makes you fly
I've been wasting time
Love for those who gotta make a livin' movin' muscle
But I don't know which way my brain is going
And I ain't need nothing else, no one else but you and I
This time of night's for singin'
Some stories are magical, meant to be sung
Boredom strangles the life from the printed page
When we're driving in the car
I stopped eating and sleeping
Buzzin' in my brain
Till their lips start to move
They don't believe our love is real
The house we got at Sears Illi'
And say this must stop,
I was hummin' a tune
After all these implements and texts designed by intellects
I know this night is like no other
And we knew when we tried harder there would be another offer
Oh I'd run as fast as I can
My sister she counts the bars,
And if it looks like this, then you're doing it right
I don't want to hold her down
So tell me baby
Give me another night just another night
Bright bright sunshining day
Honey, lovin' you is the greatest thing
She runs through the valley of death and of sleeping
Nanny bakes fairy cakes
I said, "Where have you been I've been waiting for you"
With a girl the lonely sea looks good with moonlight
I made a lot of mistakes
Know Jade's the girl of the hour
Oh, something once pure 
They gave her a mirror so she could talk to a face
When I'm dreaming of you
And love love love all over mine
Just holding you and gazing into your eyes
Street lights glisten on the boulevard
There's something to be said for luck
All I gotta say is I must've done something good
You want a new song
Many years from now
Three days, she's found herself a friend
Them bitches sure were crunked up on it 
When it was back in the day, back when things were way different
Mymy looking for a guyguy
'Cause they're calling me by my name
Ooh, baby I know you do that to all the girls  You know that I'm fragile
Ever wonder why they kill the weak ones, baby
I'm in love with Stacy's mom, ohho ohho
When I say
It's not the chase that I love
Oh, I sincerely miss those heavy metal bands
'Cause she's watching wrestling
Out here in these streets, every man is for himself 
If there's one thing that I could never confess
Oh, the trees were all leafless
All I got's a moped moped, moped
Well it ain't about the money
Ikea just some oak and some pine and a handful of Norsemen
You've got it That's it You've got it That's it, man Whoo That's it, you've got it
Just like a giant spotlight
And the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do
One ocean to another
And I'm looking like a fool again
From this place on the mantle my heart was taken down
To a reign of love
And fall so deeply in love
So go ahead and take a picture
I guess I'm stuck in this mad world
In the rain to bring you candy 
And let's just get right
That you are blessed and lucky
There's only one girl in the world for you
A needed award I can't afford, a finished song, one more chord
And nothing's gonna bring me down
But I feel warm with your hand in mine
Get your oars back in the water, kid
Nothing's worrying me
I'm old enough to know that people waiting on some big sign
I will be kind and I'll be sweet
We had a close call
Get it, get it 
The best one yet
'Cause I need you to make me take my nap 
How do I get back there
Until we had a row, a kind of falling out
Into the depths of the salt mine
We'll look to the stars but not just yet
Oh, here I go, you're moving way too slow
He knows that he'll never come back
So true, in a serious face
A wicked lady, sittin' by my side, sayin' "Where are we"
The British Summer time's just great whatever
And if we got hit to the end of the road
But, I had to stop from the shock of what I found
You're such a lovely lady
But I won't regret 'cause you can grow flowers
And I fear the guys with normal eyes
And through these crazy times
Everything is fine, dad
Yeah, here she comes
We're ready to move
Did you know she was flirting around 
Peel up off the street
And I can swim, but I should fly
I opened my eyes last night
'Cause happy boys and happy girls around the world
Stand up don't make a sound, your ears might bleed
'Cause they're gonna wash away
Their souls are crumblin' like a dirtclod hold
I don't wanna say I'm leaving
Don't say anything
And I knew without asking she was into the blues
Do you, do you, do you, do you wanna dance
Maybe you're the one that don't just stare
Deep beyond the things I don't show
Monday, Tuesday
Look over look fast again look past
Y no estas, y no estas Yolanda
Everyone uses and no one believes
That's a thing that I keep 
And I'm calling to you 
And we knew it was time to take a chance here
Send me on my way On my way
Someone to take your life beyond
Get up now, get up, get up now
And we've felt how our hearts melt down
Name after name, it just goes on and on
And there's something right in front of me and I
I'd rather dance, I'd rather dance than talk with you  
Wake up song
It seems that people stick like flies to you
These are wild, wild, wild days we live in
You've got knives in your eyes
I got the concept and came to the conclusion
DJ's spinning up my favourite song
Has it been a day or a week
This time
We think we found the truth at last, when it escapes
With an uptown girl oh
Bat it with your eyelids
I work hard then watch some TV
Don't ever let it show"
Shop the streets to find out who I am
I don't care if Monday's blue
And now my worries are gone
With these tones misunderstood
That smother you, all radiant with joy
Deer die with their eyes wide open
I'd go the whole wide world to find out where they hide her
Ah, 'round the bend
In a van with my friend
Build home
Be it true, you ain't got nothin' to do
Even though it was the middle of June
When we met that summer
Singing songs loud on the way to the game 
And wreaking havoc on our world
You ain't what I'd call a friend
Real sugar, that's what you've got so what's for me
There is nothing like their mattresses
Saturday, wait
And the beat we both stomp on the floor
I'm gonna start a factory the size of a country
Maybe if we think and wish and hope and pray it might come true
Young gal, you done me bad so I went and did ya wrong 
She gives me money when I'm need
Prove that you're rock steady
And we're thankful they're lending a hand
Deep into the sea
I dream about you often, my pretty darlin' Darlin' you're so fine
I feel alive, I feel the love, I feel the love that's really real
You'll miss your train and come stay with me
All on my street
We feel we've not made our true goal
But love's a lot more
In the crowded lonely night
And write your name
When you were lonely
Moments away
It ain't no big thing if you lose your faith
The conversation turns to girls we knew when
This place were we felt free
Keeps the melodies inside me
So I could see the Mississippi on her knees
'Cause I saw you walking down the hall
You can bet it is a bitch, kid
Don't get me started love
Boom there go the treetops
Come come come on
Loading in the back of a pickup truck 
When I get older, losing my hair
They'd take their feet
Take me away from the norm
Sometimes, the feeling is right,
If I live for a million years I would be Right there to catch your tears
Won't you be my head, and I'll be yours
There she was standing peacefully
Coming up to the surface
You'd better stop
Lalalala to end
I think he's tasted
But one last time let's go there, lay down beside me
You always knew
Is it spring where you are
You know it's time
Well, you and me, we'd run away to be wherever our adventure awaits,
I don't need the answer, the answer
I held my breath every time
It's your life, it's your world
Got my friends, got the sunshine above
Ambling madly all over the town
Hey I told you I'm an OG, never had cold feet
Except this is right
Okay now, ladies Yeah
This selfdefeating meeting of the minds is eating what was once so hard to find
And you drag me to the fashion show
Just clap your hands But it don't seem like me
Uh, they can't do what we do baby
That's okay, that's okay
And a dream inside our heads
But girl I'm not your savior"
Here is one we shout
Oh good, good life
I used to think maybe you loved me, now I know that it's true
And it takes a road to go nowhere
The day glows into the night
And we laughed at the beatitudes of a thousand lines
You feel the need
I need someone to hold me
Make friends with you
Near our home
But the rents are high and LA's easy
If you need, if you, if you need to
There's cutlery, a tablecloth, some Hennessy
Well, I have got a sister,
I won't worry my life away 
Well we move with such elegance, with such grace
Gon' be your whole family on that funeral line
You can't imagine so many monkeys in the daily mail
You say yeah
Elevator, elevator, take me home
Or do we soon forget the things we cannot see
Pay the donkey back,
And I'm free from the world
But there's evil in my head
Please, please stay with me tonight
But the truth is so undeniable
Or like all my dance heroes would if they existed
Should I say return to sender is just a well be done
Could you leave me with a scar
I can't seem to get my head straight
And plummet out of sight and sound
I love my God
Through the desert of truth
But at night with lips of honey calls the devil's heart
We were walking there
Graft my heart upon the vine
And if I lived in Iceland, I'd still have Chinese children
Atell me all the things that I wanna hear
Let me take you on an escapade on an escapade, baby
If it's because of me
I've got mixedup memories, and I've got favourite places
Tu tienes pila y loco haciendo cola
Early in the morning, risin' to the street
You're in my dreams
Though the sun has yet to appear
Because we know you're younger
Don't ever close your mouth,
Yes it's clear to me that this life is gonna be
But if you make an ugly woman your wife
Then this somebody ought to be you
And every part of me you change
When the rest of my life is so hard
I don�t want no savior baby, I just wanna get it out
I'm soft, but I'll be all right
I say soda soda, I'm a high roller
Someone's that I never really knew
I'm gonna tell you how it's gonna get done
That when you lose something like a golden diamond ring
Don't want to miss what I'm looking for,
I must admit you smell like fruity nuts and good grains but could you show my purple gaze
She's the only rocketeer in the whole damn place
You left me at home
Ripping through my wicked world
Baby anyhow I'll get another toy
Glow like fireflies
Oh woes be me, it's a jungle inside
And she was, like a starry night
And leave teardrops everywhere
That bends back from underneath your feet
But it's okay now
If you find yourself caught in love
Oh let the sky be grey
You cut in line, you're cutting cake;
Out on the road
If everything you want is free
I could watch the dreams flicker in your eyes 
But you say
In my secret language
I'm convinced God works in mysterious ways
Someday we'll meet beyond the time and the bars and it'll be
Well yeah
Yes I get by with a little help from my friends
Every time that I turn around, I let you down, you read my mind
I'm getting tired of living like I'm dying while the world is moving on
And I always get confused,
The ones who told me I'd be better off dead
And to go back where I was would just be wrong
Let's get rich and give everybody nice sweaters and teach them how to dance 
Ooh my mind
And when you come back home
Leave the acid kids in their green fishbowls today
Just different faces
Tuesdays I lay awake
Ooh, now that the years gone by
I would babe sing 
Feel good from morning 
Must be the season when those love rites shine
If the trials at hand are really getting you down
Who's got the looks
The cashier was scared, she asked for my info
And since there's no love, just love for the game
That old rusty spaceship wants to sail
'Cause I know something the prince never knew
But baby if he don't change his mind
You're driving me crazy, When are you coming home
In five years time, we might not speak at all
My name would then be handsome Jack
Or fate or time
But as the words are leaving his lips
When we climbed to the peak we planted a flag
I know if I put my mind to it
And I came upon a doctor
Searching I, for dreams in sleep
Put a penny in the slot and make an artificial light shine
They say "Hear us out" in every town
You keep covering their mouths, they keep on talking
Me used to be angry young man
A birthday wishing chimp
Soldiers on the Great Frontier
I'm an owl with tired eyes
Or if you're gonna find a new boy to spoon
You'd loved me all your days
Take a cue from anything you do
Miles and sister
They're takin' me down as the prisoners riot
If you ain't got the doremi
It's just the way we feel Yeah
But my middle finger is going to carry it out
Suddenly I feel as light as a butterfly
Tapered jean girl kills me
High off the ground from stair to skyscraper
I'm the wolf today, hey, hey, hey
But while it was all going accordingly to plan
Let's see what needles do
Guess it's time that I was quitting
The Candy Man can the candy man can
I got misty eyes as they said farewell
It stumbled on the steps
Here I am, I'll take my chance
A pie in the face for being a sleepy bull toad
'Cause she has so much fun has so much joy
Kiss kiss
But there's no ideal inside of me
On the back of your hand,
And we can't get it back
I was blessed with the body of the Goddesses
You will be the world to me and I will always be
He left a card, a bar of soap and a scrubbing brush next to a note
Anyway you want the truth is
This must be fake, my lip starts to shake
And I love myself
My sweetie, my lovely
I can't recall a better day
So I keep calling at night Keep calling at night
I'll render services
Oh I will surround you
I think yore saying that you
I've done this before
The great sense of passing through
all I wanna do is get off
Seven stars in the sky, in the sky
How could someone mislead you at all
Take a chance, take your shoes off, dance in the rain
To the town's best baker
Let's get emotional girls to all wear mood rings
Another day, another way
G, ooh, I'm going diagonal
And give us nothing more
Cause love is a marathon
See all the colors in the sky
Safe in a stone house by the sea
Flashing eyes and if they are color blind
Just 'cause he can't hear what you say doesn't mean that he's not listening
Here is the time when we didn't speak
And everyone will know me by a different name
Let's do it right now
Everytime the tears run dry
Elevator buttons and morning air
But we don't go down without a fight
I'm on the rocky road
On a little road barely on the map
Lit up the world as I fell asleep
I will, I will 'cause I will, I will
We can take a ride
When I'm twenty seven shades of blue
Of these white nights
So I try so hard to keep the rhythm of a train
We can walk in straight lines
And making love to your memory
I can't see the difference in it either way
Sky is blue you say forever
I'd like to return this spell
You're the ocean 
Wont you come out and dance with me
You look for leads, I follow clues 
Join the blood that flows between us
In the dark in the dark
Seven weeks of reading papers
There is nothing to say but the things I know
If you're the one, ha ha
It's night time all the time
As everyone else seems to think we are Don't it feel like, like sunshine
Everything I  describe
Call the investigator, the heart investigator
And we totally ripped off a man named Woody Guthrie
It doesn't matter what you say
Is this last time my dear
Baby you've got me tied down
Who cares if it's the dumbest in the world 
And I don't need an excuse
Let me tell ya, your love your love keeps lifting me
Nobody does it anymore
White clothes in a hot pink hot wheels
I saw an angel become the devil
I don't know if you knew that
Hello, little girl
Is waiting to take you away
The prospect of lightning was ever so frightening, 
Cause you don't talk to the water boy
And catch my disease
I'm just a little bit caught in the middle
Is that you on the train
You'll never be a better kind
But I'll keep trying to stay this way
Never guessed it got this good
That you're the one I just don't need
Fake, fake flowers
I'mma let you try to convince me to 
Well I heard two men, talking on the radio 
It's days and months before I see you again
The ships the ships are coming in, the great ideas are wearing thin
Phoenix, ride wit' a G, St Louis, ride wit' a G
And I know you stay by my side
The way your hair swings over your eyes
Payback the monkey
Then I could, then I could, then I could show you how your money's spent
Though I spend my days in conversation, please
Try the river boat, the carousel, feed the pigeons, BarBQ
And if you're trying to sing an old song
And I've been climbing ladders through time 
So I got out of it
No one but you, you babynobody but you
What scarecrows think would turn your pale cheek pink
Blue becomes red and red becomes blue
You don't need no Halloween
Like white needs black, if you leave I hope you need to come back
I had a dream we were holding on and tomorrow has become today, become today
What a wonderful world, world
He looks around, around
Sorry that you feel that way
Yeah, I know sometimes that ya just don't fit in
Only to find you'd nothing more to say
We put faith in our concerns
We'll leave this all alone, 
Seen your scars and kissed your crime
Ég óska mér og loka nú augunum
You won the race and got the gold,
Oh give it a rest, I could persuade you
You can see that you're being surrounded from every direction
I am swallowed by the guilt of this
If you're seeking repair, 
Guess I walked right into it
Though it's making me crazy, yeah
Girl, I've never loved one like you
A boy is stabbed and his money is grabbed
Don't let it get the better of you
Every heartbeat needs a reason"
Because of alcohol, I've shared  beds
I know you're gone
I know the bad's gotta fix itself
You're just jonesing for a spill
Pylons bust, right outside
To think of life without you, my world would stop
Pickin' up things we shouldn't read
Catch a bright star and aplace it on your forehead
All the time
There's something I can feel when I breathe
Your potty mouth is pushy
Let's get lost
But baby I was doing fine How do you think
My girlfriend's bitchin' 'cause I always sleep in
Used to hate school so I had to play hookie
Will you stay here, for awhile, dear
You got what you want
My faith won't give in 
Still you want me all the time
And she knocked twice and we got silly and noone knew what would come
I wish the rockets stayed over the Promenade
Cause you can't believe how much your pleasure is a factor
Are you coming or are you not
'Cause you're the only one who understands
I'm dreaming you're out in the blue
I said oh yeah, in an mmm bop they're gone
I'm playin' like shakin' under the coconut tree
Everything you are now 
Said the voice from afar
I'll always be your girl
I want to know everything about you
Take it back to square one
Looking for a lover to climb inside
All the world would
When I've spend one with you
I came up like everyone
You and I go shopping and find exactly what we're looking for
You can love
'Cause there ain't nothing that's more certain
When I heard your German accent, oh Silvia
To the sea I offer this heavy load
Broad daylight
And you're really getting all you gave
I had to let you go
CCCCounting sheep, if only sheep could put me to sleep, oh
Your lipstick stains
So don't ask me how to get started
Hoping that somebody gets in
Until there's nothing left for you
And maybe I should call her up
I sit in the window watching my days from a great distance
You tell lies thinking I can't see
You'll tell them you're proud of my marvelous flight
'Cause they are free of thoughts unpure 
Geezer lighter the futures brighter
And I love my hash
Darlin' do not fear what you don't really know
Will I always be denied, I thought about it last night
OK, bring it down, yeah, we gonna break out
Up in my bedroom
But all I wanna do is get off
Dance, yeah
Line my eyes and call me pretty
Because we're together
Exoneration lost its, eraser
No familiar scars
It's still in the evenin' if I'm sleepin' paper problems
Sometimes all that you can do is say no
You better keep it in control or you'll go crazy
Oh, to fight is to defend
Song from the mouth of the river
Even after all this time
And visit every week
That some gray men with telescopes are gazing right into her eyes
Sing along lil' mama you ain't gotta worry 'bout no drama no I'll provide for friends and fam and fans
I used to be your girl
Say your goodbyes if you've got someone you can say goodbye to
Waiting for everyone else around to agree might take too long
You are broke all summer
I'm quite alright
Talk of better days that have yet to come
The morning sun here, you will see It's my oldest memory
I love you more each day
I hang from every word
'Cause I will be away from you,
Let your blue veins show
It's  o' clock on a Friday morning
I look at you, you look away
You didn't have to be so nice Be so nice
I remember thinking, oh this will never be lust
Get down, get down, I want more
Pass my time, procrastinating now
We'd waste our weeks beneath the sun
I know everything's going to be alright
Possibly in another mind
When half of being good is being lucky, anyways
But the one you'll always be
That looked like helium
Interchange plazas, and malls, and crowded chain restaurants
Do you know what it's like to fall on the floor
We always sleep with the dogs on the bed
I hope you know
Living in a city of sleepless people
Any way you want to
Love don't die
Oh yeah the world can sometimes make you feel bad
Flowers in the love of my arms
O you could chose a friend but you don't seem to have the time
Your face, come on, is dead and gone
Don't you wanna just curve away
I am dancing with my friends in elation
Was the place to go
Drift away and die
Got my fingers, got my legs
Someone is smiling, someone cries 
And your eyes must do some raining
As he asked, if I would come along
When they're spitting in your eye
The phone is ringing when I get to my desk
We would sing and dance around
Free, yeah
There's a whole lot of walking, whole lot of walking to do
Hopes and dreams and memories
Why should she be the one who's killed
Clouds like bubbles in a sink, touching my face
You know, you know, me num you know my name
'Cause then she might be happy, no longer lonely
Don't kiss me goodnight
Trust me, darlin', come on, listen to me
Let's go far away to the humming meadow
So I heard it's no good to run
All I wanna be, yeah all I ever wanna be, yeah, yeah
But if they don't see the quality then it is apparent that
To face your mother
A roller coaster ride
I did the Flaming Waffle with Ho Chi Minh
I'm wakin' up at the start of the end of the world
Are gone
Hey, remember that other time, when I would only read the backs of
Free like whatever we dream about
It's bad enough we get along so well
Riding on my moped, looking for fun
Maybe tonight we could be the last shout
In a minute it will all be coming down
Though I sometimes feel like a clown
A pretty girl is like a violent crime 
I seen ya, I seen ya, I seen ya walkin' down to Chinatown
Doctor Jones, Doctor Jones,
You pick me up when I'm feelin' sad
The empty promise makers said, here it comes
We're shining bright and I want you,
What did you see when you were there
Wait wait,
And then night came, so we got into our sleeping bags
To keep my soul all right
It feels like floating
Make you feel, make you feel better
Like a fresh manifestation of an old phenomenon
Can I, can I break your sentiment
And I start to complain that there's no rain
In the eyes of my grandpa, right before dying
Oh I, oh I, I'm gonna fix this world up for you
Get out of the car
A wind so loud that we might never mention
You can do it today
It's so hard baby, out here
And The world is made of energy
I'm your only friend
You're not a gold mine
But I am sure they'll get along fine on their own 
Do I feel all right No not slightly
For jetting round the world
Do you want to, come on
I feel love, yes, honestly
Nothing more nothing less
This world is going crazy
And sun sun sun so what the heck
Win or lose, win or lose, I can't say
Did I tell you I need you
Am I a fool
I'll say it one last time one last time
In the car when your mother lost her temper
Been hating on my new perspective
Is the glory of a boy
You're how I wanna be Just how I wanna be baby
I'm going to turn into a lens and focus all my attention
You're always wearing Dodger blue
Your kisses make me blue
All I need is just to hear a song I know
And nothing here's worth winning without a fight 
It's early so take your time
Are the words that grew to hit my spots
Stick around, nostalgia won't let you down
Gotta be everything more
I'm weird 'cause I hate goodbyes
You stood up and tried your damnedest not to listen
Just get me off of the boat for a little while
Yea I'll see you tomorrow
People in love get fast and foolish
And I'm looking like a fool again whoa oh
And every breath is a bomb
And I won't sit back, and take this anymore
Real hard meals wont you stay awhile baby
You be one and I'll be one too
It's perfect, for a flying honeymoon  they say
The only thing that He can do is hold it in, hold it in
To give a little way, oh please stop holding sway
To look up at them clouds with that fake silver lining
Taking his time as he crosses the bridge
Behind my eyes 
We'll fly by wheat fields and water towers
Truck driving the black night away
And can I wait for my decoder
And when you loss control
Soon they're gunna hear
Baby, take a good look around
I'll get the whole world to celebrate
I had a golden dream
And I'm glad it's today 'cause now I am strong
You've got more than money and sense, my friend
Dearly Beloved We Gather Here To Say
While the girls lift clothes down the high street and they say,
I'd like to be under the sea
Don't you touch my boyfriend
I hear a song it makes me think of a girl I used to know
But soon comes Mister Night
Join our group and you will find harmony and peace of mind
Your picture
And it's war if we fail
Take me back to beautiful England
And love you 'til you're sore
Come and get it
It was crime at the time, but the laws, we changed 'em
Honey, ah, sugar, sugar
I'm around when your day's gone all wrong
Threw our shoes into the oceans
And broke my heart to make things right
I'll be playing basketball with the President, dunkin' on his delegates
When your heart is beating lighter
And I welcomed the dew as much as you did
We get along Lord, but not today
I got you
Something that isn't so cruel
Every single one of us is twisted by design
That's who you've got to be
Mechanicsville and Summerhill and Zone  to roll with me
But she drifts so far away, I'm on her coast
Adelaide, Adelaide, you need to quit, quit making a scene
I only want the time to do one thing that I like
It's been a dream being with you
To save my life
It's not my business to talk about
So you know the time, so you know the time
And team look at me now
One day at a time, sun gon' shine
So toot what took man choke on it
Well there's an ideal inside of me
Yeah, you gave me wings and I used them
To see the sadness that's inside
Want to make sure that you never waste my time again
We're all tied, and it's one on one,
Well, I need you to help me reach the door 
Another postcard with chimpanzees
And when you go to work
Never to be mine, no matter how I try
'Cause you and I both loved
Walks into the room
You are the night light
Well tomorrow you're coming home
That we're all in this together
Take me on a trip, I'd like to go some day
You go to town
Will you break and take all the words from my mouth
And feel it for a minute
Take back what they've taken if you wanna play it safe
Yeah, the touch of your lips
Guten morgen, guten morgen, good morning Hey
All alone in the clear view
Life dangles your dreams in front of you
And you sat in a chair thinkin' "Boy I'm such a prince"
Oh, great white city
You you give me sound, smashing my styles
I had this perfect dream
Where the light bends at the cracks
Next spring will bring you back again
Take a shit where you sleep
I've been trapped by love
Home sweet home, I've
Down your dark basement stairs
Some people wind up
Awakened to cheers after years on the fault line
Away we go Away we go
I knew you were wide awake
When you can't dream well, what's life mean
The lips that slip are the lips that press
That I can't tell you anything
Try to open up my eyes
Don't wanna hear you say mayheyheybe
Never mind wonderful you
Gonna cut my water with a rebel yell
I just wanna be your firecracker
The steps he's needing to take
Throw your love around, love me, love me
So if you're ever feelin' down
There's something in her face
While the kids don't sleep for days
Why who's got the power
You turned the heads of every boy and girl alike
If you work all day you keep the rhythm through the night
'Cause we're falling and I love you more and more
All night like a friendly ghost
'Cause the songbirds don't do singing on pavements
Through these lies
It's got leather seats
And there she goes right on the spot
And in your lovin' arms
Shiny happy people holding hands
There's a place called Kokomo
What did I miss back then
Did it break enough Break enough
Waiting for the day it would be me and I could say
Ooh, Silver screen on a rainy day, Sally Bowles in a cabaret
To have come
When we roll out, we roll on dubs, rollin' up bud
Burning out my dreams
Work it out baby sweat
Anything we've ever known
My My Time Flies A man wrote a symphony
Makes you wonder where you are
'Cause we always breakin' the mold
Then may his soul live on forever in my song
Hey, don't give me that face
Diet Coke, I'm on my knees
In my heart this way
You can tell by looking in, the party's plain crack
Anything you want you can make it yours
Yeah baby this is your day
Where's my wife and family
The reason I think I'm something special baby
For trying to reach the things that I can't see
I put up a fight
Yes I I'm alone and
She hits the dancefloor, she LIGHTS up the dancefloor with glowsticks and
Some blue December
That's hardly time to take a shower
Sit around idle and nod my head
There's no way to say and there's nothing I can do", go
I backed my car into a cop car the other day
Wild cards, men from Mars, dressed in stars and stripes
And embrace me and then brave my heart for you
So, let go
And you can jump all the time and everywhere
Upon a roof below the moon
And the new way of living would be a reality
You're a sophisticated lady, you've got it all
We're different and the same, gave you another name
Your letter an'
And I'm already missing the summer
All I do the whole day through is dream I'm dreaming, dreaming a dream of just dreaming dreaming a little dream you
Are getting rich with their mail order scheme
But you should know that I go both ways
Try and test that, you're bound to get served
I'm coming up, put down your cup, don't make me start without you
And I don't want to make a wake out of my life
Something glorious is about to happen
All he did was plug me in, I got the chargin'
Creating it right now
I got the power
Ajust before you draw your terminal breath
I know it's done for me
And years from now you'll make it to the next world
Becoming a habit
Say we'll be together every day
My eyes wide open, I'm in rapture
And if love is just a game then how come it's no fun
People are just people like you
And clap your hands
All I know is work is easy when you don't stress out about deadlines
When you needed an hour
Say "Damn" and let the poor sucker sleep let him sleep
Now who you gonna wave to
So I fall to my knees
It's what you need
If one of these two walls could speak
Now don't it feel good
Let it tear us apart
I look at my reflection in the mirror
We'll be like bugs when they break through a cocoon
So you better get a record player, and a generator
I shoulda known that when things were going good
How does it feel to be under the gun
Tell him I got nothing for him
Finding nothing more to argue
Keep planting to find out which one grows
Now where did I put it
But she only cares when she so inclined 
Oh my, you make amy dreams come true
When I'm feeling disconnected well I sure know what to do
Ain't gotten to except at a slant
We're sick like animals, we play pretend
From the sky you looked small, but I loved you the same
Cry your guts out till you got no more
But the girl's got a lot to be mad about
And we don't care about their own folks
Your head was taller than the trees
Form a line to the throne
Girl, put your records on, tell me your favourite song
I wouldn't be alone
As his shadow came towards her
And that's why every time I roll the dice I always come undone
Last night, girl, like a dream Hey
Oh my sunshine
With this sick tune, play it in the car
The dead soldiers lined up on the table
Thursday's all but wasted now
It's coming from inside her heart
And the way they make me feel
Singing wait, wait, stop, drop me, go, go, go
There's not a lot that I still could say to change your mind
Something has died
Now spiders in my dreams
Baby, baby, baby,
Bodies in the sand
Your inner mind 
This is no broken heart
In the ivory dome you've made it your home
Trying to reach the things that I can't see
Let me live my life
I sing the blues and swallow them too
No one to forgive
As the heat fills my lungs
Salvation waits at ocean shore,
That had ever hurt our feelings
Is the one where you told me you'd love me forever
The world is a ghetto with big guns and picket signs
This nightmare's supposed to end
Whenever you come back, I'll be waiting
My Uncle John had a special friend
Several times I have heard your demand
The day would surely have to break
I never tried to hold you tight until you left me and fade
He says, Why am I soft in the middle now
The weekends of downtime and months of an ennui that kills
Just scared of being alone
You're everything
Hang it up, daddy
Do you feel alive
Never said we'd be friends,
The sky I've seen blue and green
There's tension in this room, 
Nothing never I'll ever learnt
Get healthy, and all the things that you want
In all the history of human connection
And I'm permitted one act I can save
I ride rollercoasters I try all the cultures
Tryna do the right thing 
It's not exactly love it's to adore
And I know, I know you are changed out
They remind me of the pickup truck out in front of your neighbor's
On his lips a perfect smile
And spread these words around
Gonna pick you up like a paper cup
And I knew the world was over
I could run but I'd never
I won't let sorrow hurt me
And you know that you feel it too
We will write a postcard to our friends Sheltered in his bivouac
When you cannot sleep
It doesn't seem there's hope for me, I let you down
No politics, no history
Oh, to hold you when you cry Do ya love me 'cause I wanna know
If we survive, are we free of the dumb luck
We're glad you're home
Sun comes up on the old neighbourhood
So Don't Say, These currents are still killing me
Aye yippey aye ooh wah
Plenty of girls and boys in love,
She said to me that she's so stressed out that it's soothing
Right, now, it's something you created
Well, life is too short, so love the one you got
And all of your troubles are dead and gone
And you fall apart, cause you felt apart
It's time to tell my story
But I spun around and searched no more
Could've made you forget
And I left a little something to help the time go by
The angels go "How long till you can see her"
Something tells me that I'm fine
Uptown funk you up hey
And made her makeup run
Won't somebody help
Laughing, dancing, in the blackness of magic
I keep on dreamin',
Back to the street
Wilted pleasures leave you with a breath
When you gonna see it doesn't matter if we're the only ones
You gave them nothing but the best
All I have to do is let it ride
The animal inside of you
When you worry about your tan, when the weather's getting clammy
A new level of growth he must confront himself
No one's ever listening
We could start a little farm with little white bunnies
She's got a picture on the table 
I've been slipping through the years 
I guess I get the gist of it
You've got to look at life the way it oughta be
For you to be all mine
Yeah, you get me
You've been locked up, and you need to escape
Say the word and you'll be free 
You've always been in my way
Depende, cora,c~ao              	        It depends, heart
Well, here comes my car here comes my car
Covers and covers and covers in colours
People moving all the time
This world is a warm, sunny park
I stay game till sun'll shake my shoulders
Look into your heart and you'll find that the sky is yours
Better recognize your brothers
I started running but there's nowhere to run to
Don't wait and see 
While the birds were still singing 
The way you move ain't fair you know
And we're taking calls
When I'm with you baby, oh
Everything's heavy underground
Let the lovin', let the lovin' come back to me
I have been treated so badly, baby
Where the rivers unwind, rust and the rain endure 
So I'm back again it's ok
Done living like a runaway 
Really didn't think it could
But if you wonder why I never wrote you a song
The dog days are done
Just ease your mind have a banana or two
Why must I spend my time
Goin' 'round this roundabout, oh yeah
Go baby, go baby, oh we're right behind you
In the light, there's still stormin',
Well, there's a road with a distant glow
In his dad's closet with a box of fun things
Everybody gonna jump and shout
Your love is there for me
But now I'm shoved through subways 
So I get bored and I shout
'Cause getting down and jumping up
But it's kinda cute
Well I am a woman
We'll never know what anything was for
With the girls around
I see forest, a treasure chest full of labyrinth
Well the cats and dogs well they love to play
Take my hand and we will shine
Come on down to the front, and stand right here and don't be shy
I like where we are 
But I let love rule
I love in the rain
So how can this dark cloud be raining over me
Call me in the daylight, speaking of a future plan
Hamta minen din
Nothing new to say
I done been through a whole lot
Let's save our troubles for another day ooh Save it for another day
We're gonna see sunlight
Then we can pretend it's natural
Take a chance
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah
It's automatic when I talk with old friends
How much I was in love with you
Throw your partner behind a desk 
And I'm lost in a daydream
Wait for me another year or two
Encoded title doesn't give away as much as it should
Anything you want is yours now
And look me in the eyes take off that stupid fitted cap
Life is like; I don't know why I do things like this
But love don't die
That were ripped around the seams
Than run away with little boy blue 
Still we can make it better, throwin' all your cares away We want you to get used to this
And you don't say much, yeah, that's true
Yeah baby come on
Feeling warm in your sand
Keeping on the heels, 'cause you're sagging just a teeny
All I gotta do
For a tender glance, ohoho
And your love it's all I wanted
And I can't believe you or read you, 'cause there pleasure in your preview  It's all in your eyes
And maybe if I'm lucky I can catch them before you fall
Always aching
But I'm out in the cold
Gotta do my hair, put my makeup on
And I sing but my voice is breaking
Come back, come back, my little peace of mind
You got me singing, like
Ah, Gerard Depardieu
The walls of Jericho
Her last words keep raining down, on shelter
Here's a hand to hold on to
Your gonna be on my time, my time
You've got to open up your, open up your, open up your throat, Matt
These are a few of the visions I like
I've got to let you know I've got to let you know
A time to even say
It's here in my heart and it's here in my head
So I save all my breath for the sails
I love you, I love you, I love you
Yeah, it comes in waves, but it's hardest from the start
Well my eyes they look for better things
It wont be no man of me
Waiting for my travellin' light
We're all waiting on dream
I spoil them when I'm in love
So much love in you
He's got me runnin' around the office like a dog around a track
Listen to the music of the moment, people dance and sing
And in a way I guess it was
A test no man could be prepared for
My body's never been so light
But now's your chance to shine
And as I continue you know they're getting sweeter
We don't talk about it
It's the sound of her verbs
But if it's as it seems, and I keep having dreams
Because the only thing you own is everything you lack
And not recognize the aging street
With doors ajar,
Should we chance our arms' alarms set to high noon until the shiver in the river is gone
Like the party going on in my house
But then you dance dande dance with the women that lets you
We'll be rubbing shoulders once again in the sun
'Cause baby, I can love you, baby, I can love you better
I wanna make a supersonic man out of you
There's a devil in that angel face
But it doesn't really matter
Scars of where the war was waged on words that we heard as a joke
Gonna love you every single night
She took it from his lilywhite hand
Every moment was so precious
You took my heart and put it back together again
As time goes by reality
One day like this a year would see me right
We don't need to drive
Timing's everything
And I am the peach in the starfish on the beach
I can't remember half an hour since a quarter to four
Pushing through the topsoil,
Things will change, I'm not saying overnight
I'll have my eyes set on you
When you turn to me and say
We were gone but what was on the top of the mountain,
Who knew Mind you I never had to stand in line
If you only knew
Good day, sunshine
I can get to my sleep, I can think that we just carried on
When that moon is big and bright
I'll end up far so far away
Don't want this to stop,
A Bright And Charming Girl Like You
Take one step left and one step right
'Cause we are changing
This Monday morning walk
And there's so sense in trying
She comes from far away far away, and gets closer every day every day
She shoots colours all around
But I could go all night
Your hair And nothing more
'Cause when I hear those drums late at night
Aye yippey aye yeah
Because before you pick up the phone you'll be dead
'Cause I know the life from your burning wheel won't wane
I believe a light that shines on you will shine on you forever
Don't say it's gonna be all right
I used the light to guide me home
I don't think I understand, 'cause I don't really know myself
Is something that I can't deny
To prove that I was tough I hopped on one foot
Did you stand there all alone
It's time that we got this flaunting down
Believe in the magic that can set you free
Jump in the line, rock your body in time Hoist those guns a little higher
The landlord say your rent is late
Soup of the day
I don't feel so unfortunate
It's a crying shame, that the love won't leave me alone
And make it sound so very nice
The stitches of space that slowly come and go
All those years gone by
Got yourself another hour
We're gonna be alright, yeah, yeah
We are the stars of your real teen dream
I know it's not much, but it's okay
The end is growing near
Eating pbj's and watching the church channel nightly
Work all day, little to no pay
It's a mystery
Take the map and point to anywhere
And this'll help things turn out for the best
You're my every thought yeah
Don't say hold on 
Now they're on the ocean floor coastin'
What can I say
That's where mine go
Shoot beams lightening 
And the summertime will make you itch the mosquito bites
Sometimes you just can't hold back the river
Cocktails and moonlit nights
What a gift a woman can bring
Just enough to mess my mind inside
And ba, bababababy, please don't blow me away away away
I said I'd die for you
Known as the female mind
You're driving me crazy, when are you coming home
They'll be spitting in your eye
Should they kill me, your love will fill me as warm as the bullets, yeah
I've got a cupboard with cans of food
You did
Yes, you know my name
Now I love to feel that warm southern rain
Where it's like they lost they mind
You're such a mystery
Worst in all the world
Of these strangers in the pages
Couldn't blame you 'cause I know I left you all alone
You're a supernova in the sky
Then maybe place all your winning on an outsider
Glimmering, glistening, I'll see her tomorrow night
Now its time for you to go
Dear Valerie Plame, I'll look for that long exchange
But I'm just gonna shake
Your house will float on Noah's wood
I'll meet you where the sun it always shines
Inside the mirror is a false impression
But this is love so we'll survive
We keep it rockin' till  am
Thursday night your stockings needed mending
That never seems to care
So let me get you in your birthday suit
I had enough feeling give me what I want or put me on the streets
As we're shifted through this twisted abandon
These are the best days of our lives
You wear your smile like it was going out of fashion
Struck from a great height by someone who should've known better than that
They say to me that God's do exist
If you would stop treating me like I was just a child
Oh yeah
'Cause my heart is yours
That you won't walk out on me
But not in love
I was happy saying I had a love that wouldn't last
So better keep your head up, keep it on the up and up,
We're leaving the house just for the day
There's a dog in the yard with a manner that rough
You know my name, 
I didn't wanna settle down
I'll hold you, don't you go
I think I see you coming to town, hunting you down
When we're looking for something
I'm no fucking Buddhist but this is enlightenment
Lives within your life
'Cause magic ain't no handmedown yearning
And there's more to this than acting my age
Now, talk to the man who's laying down by the door of a bank
A new day comes you'll wake unfold
Isolation I don't want to sit on the lemontree
A lifetime is short and death is so long
I'm not saying you're not on my mind
To grow, what to feel
So do the bluebirds sing
When I think of life without 'us' 
Why don't you keep it in the background
I hear the music
It's true, you're my love, whoaohohoh
We're gonna make it to the beach on time
Is raining from the sky
It's a difficulty and I'm bitin' on my tongue
And I guess its in my blood
In your kingdom by the sea
You know, you know, you know my name You know my name
Mr Postman, look and see
Twentyfive years old, my mother God rest her soul
The SUBLIME style still straight from Long Beach
Your world is so inviting
You don't even know what side
Empty the pack and watch your wings grow back
And you will see just what you've done to me
Solidstate radio forty five
Face to face and cheek to cheek
Tell me I should be looking for love with some other girl
Amusement or treasure
I promise you, I'll show you such a good time
Well if I lived in Thailand, I'd have some Chinese children
The heavy hitters and the chichi music
I cast my memory back there, Lord
'Cause our time is short
Drives me away
We together, I remember
All the people come have gone
And you cannot run or ever, ever escape
And got out of bed
'Cause we're all a part
Without losing sleep, without losing sleep
Indeed inside me deep inside will always hope for worst
Two, four, six, eight, I run and hide
Could've made me forget
And everybody's saying
Let's just keep pretending to be friends, oho
But now I'm lonely as that
I'm getting up and coming over
You gotta give it up for the new modern man
All of his money is gone
That girl is giving you the eye, and I and I and I
Starlight, can you give me the fame Star light
Push me through, counting the miles
I said "I love you"
Hang me from the ceilings, little mobile constellation lights
Should have watched my step
Give it to me baby don't you dare lose it
Just to hear about my day
There's an underwater Ferris wheel where I found the missing link to this island chain
Please tell me that you've got me and you're never gonna leave
It's your heart, it's alive
To your mother
You're a deadweight, right straight on your way
I've got buttons for my coat
You'll say it that's the way it is
You've done everything to please
And we will put the lonesome on the shelf 
And sun sun sun all down our necks
So stand by the fire
So when I say I want
Because I borrowed a book that I saw
Is there a letter in your bag for me
The winter would hold no spring
And you cry with emotion listening to a bandoneón 
Is if I ate blue diamonds, pink hearts, and horse chews 
Everybody was dancing in the moonlight
I knew the worthless dregs we are, the selfless, loving saints we are
'Cause I know if I'm up all night
With a heart full of mess and lore
You be the fighter of fires 
'Til we knew 'em mathematically
And they're alright
I don't get angry when my mom smokes pot
Take me down to some place below
I see Dylan Thomas in your face
I'm writing you to catch you up on places I've been
It's not a walk in the park to love each other
Make the voices sing
And brought 'em all together for one night
I never forget you in my prayers
I said, Hey, I put some new shoes on and everybody's smiling
I wanna get you tonight
From a guy thought too cynical for love
A million miles from here where no one's ever been
Just when you think that you've got a hold
No I don't feel like I'm falling down
I got my finger on the trigger and you're in my way
Your pain's gigantic but it's not as big as your ego
You're a falling star
All my life, I've been feeling for you
I can play the guitar like a motherfuckin' riot
I put bodies into motion
Now everybody wants to go to California
Why don't you meet me on the dancefloor
Everyone wants to go to Jamaica
Do your thing, your
Something like a sunset
Or that city life is too frightening
Her boyfriend's a dick, he brings a gun to school
Well, Barbie, we're just gettin' started
Hello, hello, I know it's been a while but baby
So I've come to say goodbye
Heyla, heybahelloah cha cha
Oh, don't you think by now there's truth
I'm carrying all the love of an orchestra
Take those waters and settle 'em down
Hallelujah here she comes
"When we're so far from right, when we're losing the fight, when we are letting the light weaken its beam
Hangin' out up at Laquiji rock with friends for sure
What you want is just outside your reach
Jumping into the streets
You say I hate you, you mean it
I just got to got to got to
I've got to change your mind I've got to change your mind
In the pouring rain
Listening for things I cannot see
Oh, and while you're away seed
Give us the greens of summers
The record's playing for just me and you
That's what he's prepared to do
And your head's in the air
Now the light of day I no longer see
I knew that this was different from the start 
Lost to the world he had known as a boy
I got me goin' crazy
Go down to the sea
But you could get back down, you can get back down
All right
But none of them worked out for me
Oh that's tremendous
Ooh baby, baby
And check your credit on your new Nokia
That's got me waiting for your dynamite
Was just to hold you close
We felt so far away but we were still in town
Yeah, baby, I'm down down I'm really down
I'm just a girl that's only chewing for fun
Hey girl, you've got a smart way
Surging through the darkness over the moonlight strand
Heyla, heybahelloah cha cha cha
'Cause I'm done with that; I've got one foot out the door,
Deep in her eyes
Standing on sound
I never bought a suit before in my life
And the clouds came tumbling down
I was walkin' along
One night I fell asleep
That's the kind of world that we're living in today
If you need me, I'm your man
Lap dance fantasy
Spread out boy, I'm a mile wide, and I
Can I be fallin' in love
The little things that used to make us happy made us sad
Have you confused your power with might
Talk about me, and we'll only talk about me
And my dumb dreams
Let me be the one to light a fire inside those eyes,
Each happy ending's a brand new beginning 
Of luck
Music is my girlfriend
Bullshit, bullshit, bullshit, bullshit
Butterfly, 'cause I can't find nothing bad about you and
We'll be holding hands once again
You say yes
I'm looking in my almanac
When you are holding me
Because you know how much I wanted
And now all her friends
And I need someone new
Had a big hunch that the world was a big lie
The postman holds on ohso tight
But she had to go around
Never wanna let you go
So if you're angry about the fact that it's red, 
You're a game old boy, judging by the way you walk 
From myself and from the land
If you want, want my heart
An old man's eyes
Please just let me go
Forget all your politics for a while
Officer Friendly's little boy's got a mohawk
I have someone who needs me
I'm supposed to fill it up with something
I didn't listen, cause my brain was missing
I'm red as a beet 'cause I'm so embarrassed
Gotta hold myself down
Pharoah on the microphone Sing all hail
Who loves the wind
Is all about the wordplay
Sleeping in a dreamhouse
Shake shimmy shimmy
We don't notice anything
Who's got everything
Stockholm's cold but I've been told
But maybe I'm a little bit weak
Everybody fades away;
So no one could avoid
I am riding all alone, I am running all alone
We'd stand staring in awe
And I know that it's so cliche to talk about you this way
Show them what you got, whoa
Is there anything left that you haven't done
She said get up off the floor
Óró mo churaichín ó They couldn't think of something to say the day you burst
Are you invited to the party of life
And other winter vehicles
And I don't wanna lose your love
Lurking there beneath your feet
When we're at home
The world
And now she's looking for a downtown man oh
Long legs don't give me no head rush in the morning
I'm done, uhuh
I don't care 'bout that, I don't care 'bout that, oh
I was sure that I'd already gone
With open arms and fists
Meant for a distant lover
Yeah, the sleight of my hand is now a quickpull trigger
I got Prince singin' Hot Thing to me
He met a girlie who was brave enough to say
I'm going downdowndown there at  in the morning
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
Just doesn't matter
Calendar, the years, verbal hemispheres
Nothing seems to fit
Far away from each other every day
And I feared the best and loved the worst
Young boy you done me bad, I went and did ya wrong 
Call up my mama, said I'm in love with a stripper yo
And her friends are all the same and they know it's not right
She's talking to a hypodermic reflection
There's no more keep it in the background
Why won't you leave me alone
What turns diamonds into dust
'Cause I got no sun down
You can call me Al
Feels like the world's at stake yeaaa
The girls are holding hands
Now when you're movin' to the city
I just can't believe the wonder of this feeling, too
This is all pure fiction, you know that's right
So you better run
Dance it all the time
Understanding all of my weakness
A fragment of the girl
Leave the bright blue door on the whitewashed wall
She says, "Dad, the prom is just one week away
Of people with each other
Two little kids out selling lemonade in the sun
Is buried down deep with the rest
You're the tops
How could someone not miss you at all
Rubbing on the lotion and rocking on the horsesized pills
In spite of all the things I said, I always want you near
Still got all the things that I woulda give her
I've come so far to meet you here
I was talking to myself
Ooh, you'll stay the night, Ooh, yeah
I'm counting the days since I began to live without you
It's a fiasco at your back door once again
All I know is the world looks beautiful, the world looks so damn beautiful
And People are people, regardless of skin
Do you wish upon a star
And I made my way to the kitchen
Still I think I'm doin' fine
They fly away as caskets close
And will you love again
Away from this scene 
But if I could have my way
When it's Tiny Tom time
I like her for her mind
Baby, please don't let me go
In the light that passes though me
I been sitting in the darkness
Are the songs that we sung when we chased them away
Oh, they don't know nothing
And it says my heart's never in tune
In his octopus's garden in the shade
Some of the other stay, give it up and run away
You know we're all a part of the world, of course
Like a real big thing, again
Varirnar brenndu, höldumst í hendur
That let their emotions get the best of them
Found myself in the city near Piccadilly
Guiding you, a voice is coming from behind the stage
But they read none of the part in the hallmark card where they read about the dreams
And I know we both need room
I just wanna feel alive 
I wanna hear my sound
I almost didn't make it
Mmm, I don't see you laughing anyway
Well they're the gambling kind
That golden cross Lord
The crowd is a stare
You get smaller as the world gets big
Now I'm in a movie seen as a star
And that's my fact
I found some poison in your bed
New shoes stuck to aging feet
Who wants to have me just to love me
Ginsberg, Dylan, Cunningham And Cage
I really don't like your point of view
We wait for the bell and we dream of somewhere else
Addict till it fall, fall, falls
Not sure how I got it, not a dollar in my pocket
Drifting off to sleep drifting off to sleep
Yeah we will run
He'll lift you up and turn you around
Gold is just a trick of light
Take that gross look off your faces
Oh but honey I still see him
From the cinematographer's party
What goes on inside
From the age of the dinosaurs
Long live rock, I need it every night
Oh Silvia, no one will care in a hundred years
All my friends are on their holidays
And allow myself the time
There's things you can say
I got your nights I got your nights
And roll with the toppers
In the twilight
And in the new land a sand storm roars,
Nightly, beside the green, green grass
We've gotten quiet for it's last precious seconds
That says if you've got the money then I'm yours tonight
Slumber party, pillow fight
Suddenly I am the one
Plant a seed, plant a flower, plant a rose
I'm singin' and dancing in the rain
We're the magic boys and we'll make you smile
Hold you tight, say goodnight
Are falling down and nearing the rose beds
Ooh from head to my toes
Just like us they are waiting
I am sitting at the set of Cali sun
The things that you love
Well there's a house on the block that's empty now that Dominique's gone
Pitch by my doorstep
I knew the words but they didn't sink in
And just enjoy the show, oh
Oh will they talk
Didn't wanna believe it, but now you are all I see
And I'm high enough from all the waiting
And if you want just hide your eyes behind your hair
She spits me out in her surly blood rivers
I tongue the roof of my mouth
Kick out the blues
So the room must listen to me
'Cause the day you realize how amazing you are 
Come into my life
The taste buds taste right
The type of women make you never forget
Illuminate the blackest nights
Without you standing by my side
You must raise your prayer to a shout
The sky can fall down, the wind can cry now
You know nothing seems to fit, I couldn't see my way through the shit
Now I'm Cracking my sweet love
"Well I have no way to say and there's nothing I can do,
I was holding on to her and she was gripping me tight, she was
Who's this man that's holding your hand
And on a Sunday evening bells ring out in the dusk 
They say the Nile used to run from east to west
I got ba ba ba inside my head
Like you were saying something
Ain't as bright as the star I've found
But in the meantime, I got it hard
When I looked like a mess
When the desert ends, I'll ask the dust
You and I, no one else,
I'm waiting in my room 
Your precious love, uhhuh, oh
Our love is still alive you never touch me
Roll your eyes when you look at me
You and me gonna touch the sky
Silly me, I left a message with no return number
I can call you Betty Oohoohoohoohooh
Or you're going to have to go with girls
He knows that in a moment
I been bummin' around this old town too long
But you're tearing her apart
Oh it's only getting sweeter
My mind turns to a different point of view
We weren't particularly cool
Sometime's shit won't feel all right
Waking up at twelve in my clothes again,
So sweet,
Maybe somewhere down the road aways At the end of the line
Not going to mess around You are what you want
Come on say the word now fascination
Surely not to live in pain and fear
I'd rather tell you about how I'm feeling, boy,
Under the sun, under the moon
I want the world to see you be with me
When the worlds go to it, they always fall, but can they do it with a cold foot, I say're you're
You can turn off the sun, but I'm still going to shine 
Just put your arms around me, tell me everything's OK
In Penny Lane there is a barber showing photographs
Oh, Billy Brown you are a victim of the times
And you are having a nice time
Seven weeks of feeling guilty
Can I still kick a ball a hundred yards
Uptown funk you up, uh
This went on for awhile until they finally found you
Of many sons, many sons
I wanna runaway
Tell me, tell me a story
That everyone's alone
It is the gold, the green, the yellow and the grey
If something in the deli aisle makes you cry
I feel like I oughta thank somebody
Galaxy defenders, stay forever
Everything worked out at school then
Yeah you need to direct them this way
My midnight melody
From a tree
I'll touch you once you make the first move
And oh my god, I think it's happening
On the th floor overlooking Tokyo
This, this could be the summer, the summer of love
They've got two flashing eyes and they're colored why
Clap along if you feel like that's what you wanna do, yeah
And Imma go down that drain girl
Find your own direction 'cause there's sweetness in the air
How time can move both fast and slow
So come on make your move and free me
You can't hold back
I've just got to get you back
Ooh, I get the shivers
You're good at making me feel so small
And explosions never make a sound
This feeling of tenderness
To deliver a painting for some silly reason
The brilliant girl with the famous thighs
And all of these spirit voices
Just to cure it 'cause I can't ignore it if it's love love
It's the last to come back when the sun melts the snow
Semicharmed kind of life, baby, baby
And I'm so lost inside of my head
Woo hoo, and that's for all time
If there's a reason
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
I think you come from another world
That make you mine
Oh, beautiful baby
I don't know, yes, honestly
Couldn't hide the fact I wanted to rap
This is what I'd say
Far away, my welllit door
We swim underwater, and our mouths  In tune
And I've been watching stars coming out of the wall
Shouldn't need anyone
In the nude in front of you
My, my love like a voice
And I was afraid when you kissed me
A little bit of Mary all night long
And I'll say I no longer feel I have to be James Dean
I sure know what it is like to be alone
We went walking through the hills
We might not have any money 
And lifeless and black
Until you lose your hair, oh
That people could smile more
I want my money back
Bout everything he's seen and done
Mon corps ne bouge plus quand j�entends ta voix
The call your life's been issuing you
I'ma call ya afro cause you never bald
I will hold you tight so you know
I tried to kick the ball but my tennie flew right off
I don't want to spend night after night with you
Go baby, go go, we're right behind you,
Ooh, did I tell you I need you
He said to hope for the best
Release your inhibitions
But I trip fast and then I lose 
'Cause I'm not the only one
'Cause I'd get a thousand hugs
And you're talking to the town"
And we'll have fun, fun, fun now that daddy took the TBird away
The ooh's and ah's and falala's are back in love
Oh I get high with a little help from my friends
The work is too important and we're no longer young, after all
Put it back together yeah yeah yeah x
That I have been around for awhile
I took you to Best Buy, you took me home to meet your mom and dad
The town,
And miles of thread
My mind is aracing, my heart is prepared somehow
'Cause I'm dancing around in your world of play
The corner cafe
Now you got me missing you
Something's gotta give soon
You're my best friend
And grass stains on my knees for you
Why, I wonder, is my heart full of holes
DRUGS leave no one alive
He says don't think, don't talk
I'm still the angel to a girl who hates to sin
Four beats from the party line
I dwell in the darkness
It seems like years since it's been clear
For tha money, you can get it too, it's all about yo ambition
We felt our hearts so strong
Are you feeling, feeling, feeling like I'm, feeling
I want the waves to grow loud
So many times 
I feel it in my feet on the streets
How the wind went and pulled me in and no
You said, "Look at me", and looked away
It takes those tears to make it rust
They'll anger you then bat their eyes
So come on and get down 
Empty loving makes me seasick
But you will believe in love
Saturday morning and it's time to go 
And I can't stop the reels from turning
Everyone has a home
And I've become just like a terrible mess
Please tell my mother I'm down on my knees
And the sunlight hurts my eyes
I could stick around and get along with you 
Pass the hubcap please
I'm a mating rhythm
You're the line in the sand
Honestly, I think you've lost your mind
And I feel good, yeah 
And now's the time to sever the ties
Out through the open door
Well you are the one
Because you look so lonely
Beats something else, you know I never think about myself
And I will make sweet dandelion wine
Ambitions are already starting to fade
Run fast for your mother, fast for your father
Don't you try to call the cops little girl
You go from day to day
Wanna get your mitts in my oven
In our little place
Yellow lines they blend together in my eyes
It used to seem we were number one, but now it sounds so far away
Under spell and the ghost of a man,
They say patience is a virtue, but the doctor says she don't have long
What more can I get myself into
All these people talkin' 'bout you now,
And no plans to take back
No sun is shining anymore
We had our mindset
You play along to songs written for you
But I killed for love
Take a look at the girl next door
Oh, yeah, now
Till the break of the dawn, yeah, party on my lawn
Waiting for someone to tell you everything At the end of the line
There's nothing wrong with you
You're right, strangers are easy to like
And looking for the right guy
I can't believe everything 
I was born to endure this kind of weather
Let me love grow good for you
Oh, one day when you're looking back 
And words of pledging trust and lifetimes stretching forever
You know I wanted just to hold you
Ça commence comme un rien
And I am a war of flesh and heart that's left undone
D'a lic'enca um momento         	        Excuse me, one moment
For me boy this is just the start
Shook my fist in my own face and said I'll show you who's the best
Just for me, oh yeah x
I'll sit back and relax and think of all the things I'm going to do
A street cat got him by morning and I had to bury pieces of his body in our building's playground
The only thing I feel is pain
Hits her over the head, doesn't care if she's dead
I always make mistakes at my expense
This boy's life among the electrical lights
Everything I need
And the pain that comes with it
'Cause right always takes too long
Light and day
A spaceship
Everyone's gotta get bottom
Because I'm mental, be gentle, be gentle,
The papa said, oy if I get that boy
So now it seem like we can't get no further
As a walkie talkie
Just because he loves you too
Clap your hands But it won't do nothing
It's time to roll the windows down and
In the middle of a very happy ending
Keep the rhythm through the night
Mm I get high with a little help from my friends
Don't say slow 
Oh, baby, you know I'm down down I'm really down
I said they call me Mister Fahrenheit
The smells of the city
Oh, the moaning half tones
Turn your heartache right into joy
To keep my heart from jumping through my mouth, dear
That said "use these down to your bones"
And I'm picking up the phone
Shut the bedroom window in the morning 
I live in your tall trees, amongst your fearless leaves
As the wheels, hit the ground
Ever what you got, I don't need it
We could be together if I stay bright eyed
You think still
To the only place I know
So just sit back relax
'Round and 'round and 'round
To let you trouble me
Some people will think I'm crazy
This ain't your home
Honestly, I just don't care
Won't last the night
Can you believe that the crew has gone
That turns out the lights
Then meet me after the world with the shivers
What's with all that information, oh, don't give it away
There's no point in taking chances 
And every time you feel like crying
Not hours or days
Yeah I promise you my friends
Needlework on Thursday
No one wants to hear about your th tear, 
So we're taking you down with the scissor, paper, rock again
It's a crime to fall in love
Come and ride with me, pimpin,' let me show you how we get it
Far as the eye can see
Told me you were not the one
To the bypass of the town I hadn't visited
Right, now, it's something you create
Lost our world of make believe
Me and my crew, we came to get down
When the morning comes, I will be all right
I've got to show, show, show you
How we'll be in love by the morning
Going backwards now
'Cause I think you're too doggone outta sight
On a night when bad
In the hills and highlands
I had no plans to meet you baby
To bring you the beats in time
Joey call me on the phone
I'm feeling better ever since you know me
My heart would call and I would gladly go
Maybe I can meet you in the morning
Someone's beaten up
I cannot fall in love
I think inside you would find something sweet
I'm living out my dream
I got a fair bit of chat but better than that
And they said we would�ve seen you two years ago
I know more than I knew before
Now we'll parade around without game plans
I buy lead Nike shoes
Going to bed wondering if winter come early this year
Don't change your name, keep it the same
Move through the sleazy scenes
I survived the livest niggas around
Nice day for a walk in the park
I've gotta start to open my heart
I'll write home everyday
The language of the frost lobs dead balloons over ruins today,
You've been called here today
The things they call our destiny
Some chimps are swinging from a vine
lies beneath the ocean waves
Or will I see you, dear, and wish I could come back
We break into mobile homes
O my dear you're a threat to the bad we all see
And as far as I can tell there's nothing underneath your vneck tee
Doesn't that make you shiver; the way things could've gone
I found my soldier girl
The strong in me, I still smile
Ten in the morning
All the world is birthday cake 
Woooohoohoohooh
I hate every single movie by that midget Spike Lee
But I still remember when I saw you as a goddess
You come to throw me
And carried out
Oh, I really love it here
All these people  they look so, they look so happy to me
For the summer, for the summer
Oh man
They call me Jane
Let's get lost till empty
Maybe I talk too much
I'll love a girl someday 
So many special people in the world, in the world
Right everybody
Oh I will dance with Cinderella
Yeah I'll stick around, I'll be right beside you
And though the breeze is through the trees
Run until your lungs are sore until you find an open door
Makes you think all the world's a sunny day, oh yeah
How does it feel to be
The parents are sleeping soundly
I'm away with the fairies now
Distract me so I stay inside
That they inflicted on you along the way 
Where the dreamers go, ohohohohoh
We love everybody, but we do as we please
This way I feel that she's always with me
I told the guy who's at the door
Their definition always changes
Still your mind
And I crash my car 'cause I wanna get carried away
That you got the look to see right through me
You'll open up the cage
I see you at the foot of some mountains
Vaguely yes I seem to recall
Yes, things we say
We would be warm
I don't have a reason
To the childlike man
To do it right, child
And the talent we got will shake you down to the bone
So when I trip on my feet
Yeah, oh, yeah, now
I won't live without it, I won't let us go
Same sweet fate
Wild card in sight, wild card in sight
I feel it in my soul soul 
They don't mind it if you're told where I'm from
Of your bad fun 
'Cause I couldn't stand to face you
No one gets you any, no one needs you any 
Easy girl if you die then too so shall I
Girl you got to realize before it ever starts
Pig out and dream a new
There's a shadow on the wall and it's nine feet tall
Yeah we've been walking barefoot
So bring it up, bring it up, bring it up yeah
They kinda like to keep you in your place
We go to sleep to Shake Appeal
You tell me I'm a real man
Passing along and sleepy as night
At the oberman
As long as anyone with hot blood can oh
Said it's berries in my heart bread
Baby if you telephone
Here comes my Chinese rug
Listen, watch, and wait
You won't last another day
When everything is out
We could have given up early when it was dark still, not light
I got your nights I got your days
That shows some great big teeth
That at least tells the rest of the drawing, king
But didn't feel so right
If you let her go, she'll move on
Another summer's passing by 
Sgt Pepper's lonely
Oh, you think you've got it
But all the time when I'm alone I think of you and how you've grown
Sidewalk, streetcar, dance a goofy dance
Well I don't know what I'm looking for
But I dropped them for Chelsea
And the heat is turned all the way to full
Rebuild the void with flowers
Fourth time, I said that's that
Julio, get the stretch
And come right back to bay
Welcome to the tea party
Chérie, chérie, comment ça va 
Singin' along to the words you don't know
Cause everybody pitty a fool
Woke up this morning early before my family
If you were the love, I'd be the desire
Cheer up, sleepy Jean
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground runnin'
Catch up with your life, catch on up
I waited so long, there'll be no decency, no
And all that I can say is that she's all I want and all that I live for
Tie you to your feet and watch you drown
So let your hips do the talking 
For every time I feel lame
I'll have to lend you excuse me is this the venue
We all got our stories but please tell meee
You crushed paper hearts
I really like you, but I'm so scared
Ain't nobody's business,
At the curtains of the waterfall
Put my old sadness to sleep on a shelf
And where you've been you've come so far
We'll cut our bodies free from the tethers of this scene
I traced your steps through the city of romance lazily
Es tu mejor doctor 
And I find that my heart is my home
Work, work, work if you
I know we all have a similar dream
I've got a feeder for you to perch on
Shifty eyes pay attention
People tryna inherit the skill so they askin' me
Just forget it, it's the same old runaround
Taking your order, he will look away
So everybody that I love can have a couple bucks
Marionettes on weakening cables
In every life we have some trouble
Won't you take me to your home,
I drive you face the window
My head it tends to stray away sometimes I can't see clear
It's industrial, work it underground
Did my heart break enough Break enough
I'm glad that you are waiting with me
I know you're beating my heart, beating my heart
Only thing that I can do is hold it in, hold it in
For sore eyes
Yeah, hot, hot, love
When time is on your side
I feel like a ghost who's got a skeleton face
Oh life, with your shoulders in the mirror
I've never felt so blue
Through smeared mascara, I looked into your eyes and saw a light
There's a girl with Cherry Chapstick on
I want to be like water and never have a doubt and
On the floor
'Cause I know that you wanna dance with me
Because tonight's the kind of night
You give whatever it is I need
You're in harm's way
Take you today
Let's celebrate, let's celebrate, let's celebrate OhOhWiOh
As you dole out the packages, noone seems to want you around
We want the new temptations woh oh, ooooh
I've been awake from the first day 
So as you pull me from the bed
Clap your hands But I feel so lonely
And you're on fire, they're throwing punches
Till you cut through my tether and changed everything
My hands were numb
Saturday morning
After all is really said and done
Something in your eyes
That's the reason
That's all I have to say so, baby, can we dance
And fall flat on my ass
Feel them licking at my face
April, May, June and July we'll hang outside
You know my name you know me number
Now the kids are all grateful when they left the nest
That it's a winding spiral case
No, I wouldn't challenge your home
How the wind went and pulled me into your hurricane
Can't leave it alone
Everything is out I gotta
'Cause baby I just wanna know
But your life is just one big mess
Any kind of monkey she wants to be
Still your soul
We cut the legs off of our pants
Ain't got as much as you
I'm screaming from my bedroom window
In your itsybitsy teenyweenie ridingupyourbutt bikini
If I was a different man,
I don't care whether you hear this
I love you, ONO
So just say it, say it anyway
Oh, bad girls get you down
On some religion that he said he newly found
Denn ein Klaps auf den Po ist doch die beste Anmache
Not today no, no
Try to believe that once it's gone
They feel like they're the same
Start a new fashion, wear your heart on your sleeve 
Yes, I saw everything
And I make you shout
Sukie was a kid, she liked to hang out at the art school
Hold my hand
And it was fun fun fun when we were laughing
It was a strange thing to do
Go press that dissonance, if you dare
Kuluman
All I need is you by my side
That bridge is on fire
Sick body part
There's no turning back for us tonight
I said, uptown funk you up
Well I've been pushed to the edge by my headache blues
And done
If the elephants are reaching for our purses
Well, you know I gotta get out
When I spoke I explained my feelings
Or united nation, put it to your head
Let me walk through the stinking alleys
Don't need a watch to waste your time, oh no, oh no
I woke up today in a very simple way
Two people synchronized
That you might think of me as a man
In your light, just when I'm in your light
Dawn is breaking everywhere 
I'm gonna spend it in the dust 
Quit fightin' while your husband
Why don't you fly around my pretty little miss
Raindrops keep falling on my head
In a green field somewhere near a freeway
Looping round and round to me
I want to be your friend
At twenty one the world was mine
I wanna make you happy, are you a good girl tonight
What did I do to deserve her love
She's back, I can feel it in the air
You don't set an example for the youth of our humanity
'Cause some wise guy built you pretty
But I don't, man
Feels like I'm dreaming but
We've got to keep our little click clicking at  BPM
It's the time of year the water cleanses itself
Drank the dark wine of the New York night
Sick of holding on to nothing when I just want to hold your hips
You just gotta call on me, yeah
Before the leaves disappeared
These trying times without losing our minds
Sit back,
I suppose that I could hold it in
Hey, hey I keep my head down but I keep on swingin'
With that on tv you just don't care
This is the journey of the man on the moon
Something that in my memory has been misplaced
When you always would win
Oh dear, oh dear
When the only boy you know is your dad
And as we twirl the glow in the dark stars on your ceiling
I won't let my life go to waste
Give you some time to prove that I can trust you again
And it burns so bright
Still I notice nothing makes you shatter, no, no
Let me stop to lock my top
When you search in vain to find
She will be sweet on me, just like a mystery
Give love
Wednesday, she's lookin' for a friend
About the state of the world today
Didn't make sense not to live for fun
I get to be myself and I get to sing
Wear a tall hat like a druid in the old days
With a radio and good batteries
Girl, can you give me a reason
In awe all day,
I might have looked the other way
So what if I break down
Military wives whose tears drip down from ten little eyes
Push through, push through baby
Solemn summer
The person I knew I didn't really know
I would've listened to my brother when he spoke to me
She's always looking for a fight
Is he a family man
Music is my imaginary friend
From all the jobs the one I choose is music
I'm taking far too many chances
Oh, I think I need your help
And all the good times on which we do depend
But I'm no wiser than the fool that I was before
And comin' off the line when the light turns green
I used to change my style like I changed my mind
I know every line
And it was time for all the wrong and lonely, lonesome reasons
The time is getting closer
I had one of those flashes I'd been there before, been there before
He approached my window
In the hope of saving me 
So baby drive slow 'til we run out of road
But my skin is warm and my heart is full
You see this woman woke me up at a quarter to three
Taking a moment just imagining that I'm dancing with you
Far away from all the violence, safely flying in our own orbit
Well would you save all of your bottles if I promised a refund
But love is blind and you soon will find
Even when it's hot outside
The time I spent with my life on bent
Pour a little sugar on it, yeah
Easy way to tell one so
I declare my room a scene
Have a good time
Your girl's a dollar bill we don't know where she's been
I need somebody to love
No, lets exceed it"
Baby there's nothing, there's nothing we can't get through
And all my ladies poppoppin'
Aand my parents
Don't go, say you'll stay
Wenn die Blumen und die Bienen in Berlin nichts tun als grienen
An engagement ring
And everyone's sarcastic
You took my feelings for nothing
My friend
And your man watching from the trees
You already know what it is, man, this ain't nothin' new to y'all, man Yeah yeah ha ay
It seems like years since it's been here
All that I want and all that I need
I said, Papa someday I'm gonna write a symphony
I love your iridescent sheen
I love to mix in circles, cliques, and social coteries, that's me
Then you know where you are
And tennis on the sun
And I think it was the summer of th grade
When every race is run
Its just the sun you need
Says he's got a big boat, but it's just a fairy boat and that makes for a short, short ride
But time is often on my side but I give it to you, oh boy
Am I tripping for having a vision
When we can say good night and stay together
They tell me to fight it
I never thought we'd fall out of place, eh, hey
'Cause you were my protection from the rain outside
Well, it's all right, we're going to the end of the line
I love the way that your hair is always neat
Gonna wash my bones in the Atlantic shore
No I can't control it
A chance lasts a finite time in the cool July night time
He's never had so much fun
While I stand here and think it up
What is he to do He's been kicked out of school
Just forget it, just forget it
And drivin' away
My office glows all night long
Like the ocean needs the moon to take the tides away
Knees in my back 'cause we're flying high
Well one of them is mine
Same girl then, right now's a groupie
And turned ourselves in on our selfish turns
Yeah, he'd better get out of my way
How I feel inside
The rustling leaves and branches bend together
When I get rubber in all four gears
I was only a kid
I'm in the mood to dance
In bedrooms above
There's someone else inside my head
It's coming around again
Oh yeah you look at me
I can't sleep, in the silence, broken
While we're playing indoors
I'm gonna be the man who comes back home to you
What a way to fix a fool, we are failing our youth
Breaking open skies of green earths
I sing the blues and you swallow them too
Another rainy day, we're trapped inside with a train set
She saves her lovin' early in the morning
With the winter coming on, and the attic cold
Collapse onto your side
What's up with my heart when it skips a beat skips a beat
I, I saw a girl in my dreams,
We can never seem to find, the time we lost
Cause days don't get you far when you're young
Put it back into the grass again
I scream it to the nothingness
And if I was a tree growing tall and greeen
Tell me how you feel about me
Whole weekend recovery
Waiting for nothing but our beating hearts, going far
Sometimes it's painful in the light of the truth
But no, I won't get that call
Take me to your best friend's house
Last night everything was right
Fade off miles
Are you to assess what I've been What I am Or become
Yes you are bugging me,
And then crashing at the Wrights
You can dive into the water and cross the rivers
It tastes sweet
Then I've been waiting for the fallout with history
Ooh, it feels good to be free
We always have been caged
Most beautiful girl I've ever seen
You got your youth, and you got food in your belly
Nobody nobody nobody will ever know his longing
Besame Cuando Estes Bailando   
Dancing in the night in the middle of June
'Cause there's a million things to be
I wondered how fast is light speed
You feel the sunlight
We had a little dream
I'm just being honest
Hello, hello, I'm really hoping you'll forgive me
No sweet melody the sound of spit
I can't stop what you've begun
Even though I know the river is wide
I'm packed and I'm holding
To the end of the light
And you knew all the best moves,
I'm a new soul 
I'm having such a good time
Heart it races alone
Yeah, yeah
A place that's built on noise and needs
And let me know that you're mine let me know you're mine, ooh
When there's so many beautiful reasons I have to be happy
I'm the skilled love doctor growlin' What's your sign
And there's one more thing
It's a casual goodbye off the mountainside
Long blonde hair all over the place
I still love you, the girl from
So I could scatter all my notebooks on the prep school lawn
This boy has broken down
When you show me your world, I just smiled
I've got a thousand opinions, and half the time, I'm trying to explain
The sun on your bare shoulders,
We're losing time
It feels like gold
Now I've looked in the mirror and the worlds getting clearer
And someone said it ain't my scene
I'll be back with my Superman action
Hell if music is the victim then so am I 
We don't care about no
Stoned in paradise
Over the crest of the last wave falling
As usual you'll get your way
You happened to look and see
Down, type of tears that money couldn't buy
You make fast living look just fine
It didn't lead nowhere
And you have your own engaging style, you've got the knack to vivify
Somebody's fame and fortune
He is a fool to assume, you'd spare a thought
Throw on your clothes, the second side of Surfer Rosa
Go on wasting my time
I, oh well I could live in this town
And is this the last time
Losing the feeling of feeling unique
That I can't get out; I can't figure out how
And of course you can't become if you only say what you would've done
We can walk dear the pier is farther than it seems
I like it when I bump you, an accident's a truth gate, I'm humbled in your pretty lens
And their friends wanna talk music
That we have got something real good going on
Little bit of love
She breaks down on the video
We're falling in and out of love and then again before the bell rings
Even when I try to fight it
No, no, no, no, I never thought I did
How you doin' I'm Mr Mos I'm back
I'll never get to share another cup of tea with you
Days spent with the grass and sun
But neither of them know that you are carryin' my baby
And you know you wanna go go baby
So please don't make me wait, 'cause I don't wanna break
Woooohwoooohoohoohooh
Studied pataphysical science in the home 
Devastator sleeps under satin sheets
'Cause it's hard to make out running away
But everything it fits so well
The way you walk, the rhythm when you're dancing
When no one's in the dark room
For all my life
To do the things that we say
People need to get the axing
And I don't know how you're taking all the shit you see
My friends all crazy
Let it be and come with me with the look in your eyes
Everyday, a shade of blue
It's a long open road
If you had done anything with anyone else
And from my house
Whether or not the weather is on my side
My cellular bananular phone
Senora dances Calypso
I don't care if Monday's black
We stop and go, the promise is already run cold
I'll be careful give it to me
I love, I love, I love you, baby
Troubles while I can burst
With our heads so high
When my angelic work was through
Jump into lakes, the surface breaks
Life is glowing inside you and me
Oh yeah I know that I'm not perfect baby
People still actually give a shit about the Queen
We watched Titanic and it didn't make us sad
A phantom of the heart
Say something and I'll feel alright
But, girl, I just can't buy
Hundreds of pages, pages, pages for words
Watching the skirts you start to flirt, now you're in gear
Someone remembers
They say we're losers and we're alright with that
I've got a fever baby, it's your love, yeah
I gave it a chance, she must be crazy not to leave
And I know that sometimes oh I might feel alone, so broke, and cold
You gotta wait, wait a minute
When electric hearts, electric hearts
The radio
Give up your will to Him that loves you
I'm breathing Hawaiian air
And people gonna come and people gonna cry
Ya end up with no teeth, nigga you don't know me
My favorite record is playing again
Let us sway into the sunset
I was told that I'm a man now and I'm not allowed to cry
Love, real love, love, love, love
We've been conditioned 
I got food in my belly and a license for my telly
Just give me my first chance, it's gonna be the last
Yeah, yeah, what I've got, full stock
Two timing your state of mind, these feet got left behind 
He said, "Harry, life is great
And from the hard time living to the sleepless nights
And all the things I hate, I wish I didn't have to hate
That there ain't nothing at all
Got to leave and get ready for my second date
Why can't I shake this mess
Fufufun
En la gran feria, de la mentira, yo fui el ciego el que no sabía
There's nothing better I have to do
'Cause I love her
I I I I turn up the radio
Soon I'll be feeling left for dead
Another one, another one
And only for your eyes
My car keys are jingling in my hand
While Zak without a 'c' tried out some new guitars
And your wings begin to unfold
Told her from the start,
Sometimes I can be down like that, when I don't cross myself with you
Do, yeah yeah
La la la, whatever, la la la, it doesn't matter, la la la, oh well, la la la
And I am  pages through this notebook now
Kodachrome
You're just a boy again
Floaters in my eyes
Well it's true, yes, but you won't get far telling me
Well you can come on to my place if you want to
The thoughts you bring and the songs you sing
And with each new day
I think this could be right now
Cheers to the wives of the drunks
And sometimes I wonder
To make me smile again
You will never be my fool
Oh I love you Amy
My eyesight's fading, my hearing's dim
Oh, skip to the ending
I won't let nobody sting me but you
Was it all a dream, cause your finally breaking free
Right here in the place where I belong
Premo, what up man
Twoinones forty five
He'd let us in, knows where we've been
It never does but who's to say at least my doctor gets paid
When you were just a baby
There's too much talk and not enough time 
By leaving me a card or a letter
And even if time ain't really on my side
She's so glad she's telling all the world ooh
Can you feel my heartbeat Can you feel my heartbeat
Looking at the world,
Hang with the rats and smoke cigars, have a break with Frank and count the stars
Last night the weekend caught us up
The lights are on 
You're so restless, what can be over there
As night becomes the sun to rise
But other girls were never quite like this
Oh, I did it
T�as des chevaux, des poneys, faisons des enfants
the timing andthe moment
That I almost got hooked on, 'cause you ran away
Try to find a better life
'Cause they gonna wash away
I value them, but I won't cry every time one's wiped out
Sometimes you're forced to fit in between the lines
Yeah everybody
I think you're going to miss me when I'm gone
We've got to keep it physical
I said how come
She says "Hey
Because once we hit the top we've just begun
That everything is on its way 
I would be right there to catch your tears
And everything's forgotten
And hearts getting broken lead to people growing cold
Third or fourth weekend into June, December seems to come too soon
Hey, what do you say
Now what's the matter with me
Never ahead of, never behind it
I can tell you what they say, haters, if you wanna know
Can you tell me Oh yeah
Taught me some of life's most valuable lessons
Let's go around town
The mutual conclusion was I'm not worth knowing because I'm probably dead
The soul of a dog, he's alive and not gone
Fly it on out like an eagle in a sunbeam
I can't sleep
You'll be the one that I'll love for ever more
The snare it sounds like a gunfire
Hey, everything's right, said everything's right tonight
Seated on the floor
And It takes some fears to make you trust
Life's a laugh and death's a joke, it's true
Did you take the time to listen
You know it makes my heart beat
Let's see how far we've come oh yeah
Know that I will always run to greet you,
Anything you know you mean
I'm having a good time and of that I am proud
But you are always looking out for me
In this town where we roam
I got some apples if you want 'em
Ohohoh, yeah
We used to play outdoors
Thinking of a way to get you to stay 
But just one quality
Le bonheur aux lèvres un peu naïvement
You're always there for me, now you're with me in dreams
Sometimes it's not a good thing
In the things that you threw
Don't look at me
Been thinkin' 'bout the way you treat me right, yeah
Tell me that you've got everything you want
Bout fallen ones and miscues and misviews
I want to always feel like part of this was mine
Heart and mind, and soul in love
They say we look pretty good together,
I learned how to hold on
Been dreaming of this since a child
en un carro Yolanda
I kneel to condition all the feelings that I feel
And I carried it in my head
On my own face
I see friends shaking hands
Shed me from the universe, carry me from lies
It's a perfect day for doing the unstuck
Do you play with the girls, play with the boys
The sun eclipse behind the cloud
Every way, love's a little stronger
I'm out of control
Can I fold you in fourteen ways to depend not defend
While we strive to figure out a way we can survive
But getting old, it takes its toll
He steps right into somebody's fat loogie
Fell in love when I saw you standin' there
Nobody knows what lies behind
Standing in the back, looking around
Launched a thousand ships in my heart, so easy
So won't you please show me
Leggy Blonde, goodbye, goodbye
Ready for the rail to break now
He's building up a shine but he take it slow
Burn this land
And it always hurts the worst when it's the ones we love the most
I put back on my overshoes
Ease my mind And you say you belong to me, and ease my mind
A long time ago
"Oh, don't you dare look back
Where are you
Pow, pow, don't run away
I laugh at myself with the girl in bloom
That you didn't have to do it but you would anyway
Work, work, work, Senora, work your body line
Mothers see it coming around
Sunday morning rain is falling 
Gonna live like it's the end of the world
Let me hear you say ooh
So leave me alone
Under the open sky oh my, baby I'm trying
We got everything
With the voice in our head
If you love somebody
I'll remember you this way
Oh, I just want to sit around your life and breathe your air
Dancing, dancing I'm in the mood, babe
For only one time,
Oh, why is your face so pale and white
We'll forget all of your sins
And girl you know
But it's too late to turn your age around she's no the one you want
So I just let go of what I know I don't know
My head is a box filled with nothing
When she was finished hanging out she was all alone
Tha taste of your lips
You got that beep, that beep, that beep
Say you won't be coming home
Soon I'll be feeling out so cold
Recommended
A little bit of Tina is what I see
Is gonna come to me early
Bed clothes, why am I in bed clothes
Oh my god, the way you look tonight
To the mid day light
Why not dash your ugly boots on the fire and then dump charcoal
You pull them out, feel they're changed
Those raindrops are falling on my head, they keep falling
When she wind up, she bottom, she go like a rocket
And I'm just looking at your garms
But God I love some people sometimes
Divine is what's in your mind
Sometimes a gift like this you can't deny
It's wrong, you dreamt of him
Lights turn on and dark turns up
And a million adventures not yet begun
Send me a postcard, drop me a line
You're okay, you're with me here in the silence
With the eyes to see it
I don't live in poverty, I got a little bit of money and I've got a healthy body
They dressed a like; his name was Ben
Someday I will treat you good 
In our eyes we're falling
Let her talk like me
Higher education making a sense
No me tengas más consideración
And a beauty that annihilates all life
There's songs, sounds you bring to us
One life, live free,
In a different light than I did before
'Cause I've been looking at you
I'm so mad at you cause now you got me missing you
As long as you're in front of me then I'll,
Hey babe, I know in time
Con la cara hacia atrás
Welcome fishies to my hook
Everything was fine until membership lost its privileges
It's gotta be at least a hundred degrees
'Cause I'm always right behind you
It's so perfect, for a flying honeymoon  they say
Must be all that sleep I missed
I'm talking Juice Crew, not what the word define
Everything fades away
I'll be the girl of his dreams maybe
You say yes, I say no
Where there's a will, there's a way
Still you just can't please everybody
She knows she's losing it, yeah she's losing it
Would it take a half a pound to roll a joint for you
Women with their nursing children
And it feels like there's no place to land
Our son is losing his mind
'Cause they're done washed away
I get two loves in my life
That make it possible for all white boys to dance
And she cruised through the hamburger stand now
Slide over here, climb into my mouth now
Felt the blood rushing and mingling
And you'll be thinking, how did I get here
For nobody but you 
Off the darkness that creeps in sometimes
Tweedle on the needle, man you're just for thread
You're burning me, like a shining star
Leave me in the dark, you'll never hear me cry
'Cause love won't set you free
I see you asleep on a twin bed
But that doesn't mean that your dreams are gonna come true
And you lived in these clouds with lightning in your feet
She's so far away from crowded nights
I heard it from a friend
Do things I can like so
She don't care what you say
The world beat you for the something nice 
But feeling somehow inside opalescent
Bring a mirror to my face,
I wonder if I'll get to say Wonder if I'll get to say
You remember your first kiss
"While you were sitting in the backseat, smoking a cigarette you thought was gonna be your last,
Like drunks we spin until we're sick 
Mark the places in my book
Baby's got a praise like a scarecrow in the corn
Won't you come pass the torch Bring your hands
I'd never, ever, let her get away
Still I can't stop thinking about you
Cheer up and dry your damp eyes
To let you know what you meant to me
I wrote some songs 'cause I love her
You think you're clever but you're never saying nothing at all
Thanks for, the time
Forever when time runs dry
C'est plus dur à faire qu'autrement
I was so stupid for letting you go
Gotta throw it away
Wish my dream would never go away
I tell ya that I love you
It's for you I swoon
Please not to purse their faces grim
Eh, eh oh yeah, there's nothing else I can say
I'm the moment between the strikin' and the fire
It's when you hit the ground
Love, love, love, love you till Tuesday
So you gave me your wings
Oh dear, it's been hardly three days
I'd rather stay here all the night with everyone who sings
Keep the beat up, let's drop the beat down
Of the buses on the ground
And I let clean comfort you from the wild unknown
Baggy jeans and a tight top, lemonade and Pernod
Someone who can promise me
Little bit of love, little bit of love, little bit of love, little bit of love
Let's get back to tearing this place a new floor
Oh, Billy Brown needed to find some peace of mind
And someday maybe make of me an honest man
I don't say much at all, but I bring up your name
With a secret ingredient
With a girl I dreamed oh yeah 
Now he got even with the photographers who
When will I get my chance to watch autumn leaves fall
Don't say no 
Helps me get over it, over it Helps me get over it, over it
I suppose it's the way the cookie crumbles
But you can rent some love with a couple stacks
And I spoke up with my new hands
Think of me, don't let me keep
When you are sipping on the sweet nectar of your memories
And this this could be the summer when I grow up
Never get enough of you
How I got over, where the people come apart 
Everybody, just hold hands
In my city, eh eh eh
Baby, I know you do that to all the girls  You know that I'm fragile
Take me wanderin' through these streets
Long as you let me in your bed
Thunder and lightning will strike
 years on the coast figuring out the weather
And in a roundabout way we can disappear towards the coast
Let's see how far we've come
So calm that wicked wind,
I keep my mind on my money, money on my mind
And let me watch my soap
Let's sing it to the world
On my head the water pours
And close their eyes and open
Someone who believes in all the things I'm thinking
Do you know the seasons in your mind
They say
That float and turn and hold the flecks of light,
Things are what they will be
Last of the lost boys who've thrown in the towel
Windows down we see a falling star
Die Halluzinationen hören später auf
I've traveled all this way for something
As time alone stands still for some
And when she wakes up and makes up her mind
I keep on forgetting myself
She said "How quickly would I die
And look for the stars as the sun goes down
Tonight I have to leave it
Nothing ventured, nothing gained
In case you need more from me
In the end 
Ventura County line Inside, outside, USA
Come and get it if you really want it
That I was far away
Is it a call for an emergency
'Cause it's all we hold on to
That I'm a child 
But Valerie Plame, if that really is your name
Just now, the part about my love for you
'Cause I swear it's getting better yeah
Looking for the answers in the pouring rain
So many dimes, got dollars signs
Lightly on your rightwing shoulder
We've got everything you need
Run, baby, run, forever we'll be, you and me
'Cause baby I gotta get through
I know I might never come home
So would you say you're mine We'll be just fine
It's like my heart can't be tamed
Feeling OK, feeling OK
Oh land I can see for miles
It's really good to see you rocking out and having fun
Someone else's date
If I went away
Give my story to the children and the lesson they can read
For still your face comes shining through
Understand that all I do
Closer to the soulful days that counters all our evil ways
Lets burn the house and run away
People might react to all the things that your characters say
And feel an ocean breathing waves,
Those sapphire eyes
Hear me shout
I've been thinking, and I've got this plan
Well, he's just a man
Keep your head above the meaning 
Don't stop me now, I'm having such a good time
Standing here right now
Jump in the line, rock your body in time Whoa
I'll take her home after midnight
Have you ever seen the ending so nice
And your lies are so much bigger than my lies
Do you know what it's like to fall on the floor hey
Thunders getting louder and louder
From the projects, she know we need our welfare cut
They said "Don't take your business to the big town"
We are doomed but we wanted more
And the funkiest grooves,
The only thing there is to say
Do you remember when we first moved in together
We belong together
I say what's, what's cooler than being cool Ice cold
The light below is bright on top
Don't you wanna love me no more
Watch as snowflakes melt inside our hands
The kids were shouting "Let us out"
Just when you get on a roll
Nobody's ever gonna
Yeah, you got that something
Things will be alright
I said, Hey, I put some new shoes on, and everybody's smiling
I love the temperature and smell of your body
So tell me something That I didn't know
Bring it all back to you
You can take up all my time 'cause you're the only one
I know tomorrow you'll find better things
I don't dare to touch your hand
Hey you, do you remember me
but there's a reason why the last is smiling wide and sitting higher than the others, 
You'll never do the things you want
And I love the riddles that you speak
But the streets are all safe
Adversity, we get around it
If you wanna have a good time, just give me a call
And I know, one day, I'm gon' come up
To buy the things it takes
Always always always travellin'
He does not break any dad rules
I thought love was more or less a giving thing
Ruby, we used to love you truly
Here's what I feel, ba ba ba ba
I took a book and went into the forest
Forgetting all your worries life
All the colors of this world will run together more than ever
Of gasoline or to be tied up and stoned
We're gonna have a good time
The afternoon in a cold hot air balloon
With crosswords and Sudoku
Now say you're mine
If you hold me
And there are faces on the six AM working crowds
And he asks us what we have done for our souls lately
They got lost as they were taking off each other's clothes
Yitho omanqoha
It's Friday night and I won't be long
But I will give them all back to you
I will let you be, I will I will
To wake up with a smile
So come pick me up
They don't play me on the radio
Another sunny day, I met you up in the garden
Our stepmom, we did everything to hate her
And a pillow for my head
We'll hold it to the wind to and see how long it lasts
Turns my cartwheels into head stands
That's when I'd get knocked down
It's kind of level but it's wavy
That we'd share after the stretch
You'd think me rude, but I would just stand and stare
I could tell how you pushed your foot on the gas
Spread your love and fly
And feel for a minute
I can edit those parts out
In your heart
You were young and man you were sad 
Grass grows green and it's just everyone
Ain't got no friends, ain't got no schooling
With our hands and feet, making peace
Waiaiaiait, Mr Postman
Why's everything so wrong
Scatter my ashes on this place
Oh, we get together
I took the Polaroid down in my room
That you'd be waiting there whenever
When your nom de guerre was codename Caroline
'Cause fear is only in our heads
I carried you till it got dark
Until the milk comes out, come on, coco girls
You could kick a drum but
Please, Mr Postman
Lalalala, take me home
When I fall in love
I can see your face on the wall, I hear your voice and I call
Won't change how I feel today
Clap your hands once and clap your hands twice
I'll be there to say what up
I think that this might be the day to 
Let's stay up all night
In a couple of years
Maybe we'll be friends
Waiting to take you away
Souls are feeling heavy
Out here in these streets, if you get down on your luck 
Caught up in the middle of a headache and a heartbreak
Tonight, I'm seein' stars
Like twisted souls
Today I sleep in the chair by the window
And when you see me, don't hate, that I rolled up
'Cause I hate what I've become
When I'm around
The sky was blue beyond compare
All of this world
I shouldn't be up at this time
That I shoot across the sky
I mean what's the point,
Wait for me, wait for me
She said I love the way you think but I hate the way you act
Hah my girl is a queen
Mm, yeah Mm, yeah
You can never get enough, enough of this stuff
It's all that I got
He'd better get out of my way
All you want's one more Saturday
I gotta live on an island to find the juice
I'm gonna tilt a while
But not a friend worth noting
I have worries to give to the sea
Let's go around to other distant nations, now
We finally had frontpage news
Christmas break of ninety eight just flipped me upside down
All I do is dream of you the whole night through
Rooted in between the computer games and cartoons
It's just my party now
Woke up this morning feelin' fine
You're so ooh, so ah, so cool
The smell of  just waiting for you
Someone who never made it into my new life
When you wildin' out, runnin' 'round in these streets
Your mother should know your mother should
And what is mine
This old heart gonna take them away
Oh we'll cry 'pass the wine, pass the wine, pass the wine'
There'll be Ma and Pa and Grandmama
Don't waste your time
But not the way that I do love you
He'll be bringing them in to let them out and play
It's halfpast the moonlight
The taste of summer sweetness on my mind
I'll come another day, 
I want the whole world to celebrate
Friends make graphs together, la la la la
Freeze outside for one quick smoke
You are everything and more to me
It's Monday bloody Monday
Say goodbye to the setting sun
In England people know me
I like where we are
I can't stop dancing dancing
Kicking up the dust in bed
It feels like you're lost
And falling from the seams, is a steeple swarmed in light
Their kids so there's not a sound a sound
Attempting to walk
Every single molecule is right, when
Já, rifjast upp og núna man
Lord, I don't know if I'll ever be back again
And I know you're beating my heart, beating my heart
Here comes a feeling you thought you'd forgotten
Sometimes fade to grey
I've got songs in my blood
You've seen the difference and it's getting better all the time
Don't tell me 'cause you know I know it hurts
Only nothing's for free
Those kids are making progress now
You and me always, and forever
I'd look psychotic in a balaclava
Mundane Sundays, when I'm gone
You are always looking out for me
And pray to God for no more rain
She waves for everybody down on the floor
I would like you to dance birthday
She don't feel the same
I need to be loved
To have something above you
What's in your blood is in my mind
I'm bouncing off the walls again, whoa oh
Aeyyoh, I came here to party
Oh show me you love me Do ya love me 'cause I wanna know
She tells me all the time, you know
With new taste for speed, out on the street
My, my heart like a kick drum
Courageous boy, now you're a clown
I wish you cared to see 
Nothing is forever
Just let me go
He said, "Nas what the fans want is Illmatic, Stillmatic"
There's a sword in your side,
But a man who's got the type of moves to make you loose your mind
I'd sing for all the ladies up there
Tonight's the night to cross the line
Don't you try to call the cops little girl;
Did life bring you down here
It's no baloney, it ain't a phony
See now I'll be on my way to make this claim
Ooh, ooh, ooh
He's got a dirty mind, just don't know what you're gonna find
Vicissitudes are boxing our heads
And you've seen me roll with you
Where the hell am I
Wednesday, play with me Thursday
But still I'm glad I hitched my apple wagon to your star,
All adrifting, he's a nogood boyo
The feeling of coming, the feeling of going
And all the competition's overcome what may
We hit you, bboom bang, a bboomerang
I'm counting up the minutes till I get alone
We're havin' fun
And you will believe in love
And tonight I have to leave it
The candlelight flickers
Hey, remember that time when I was broke
All this just to go out for the day
And there's nothing you and I won't do
It feels like poison
Yea, I'll see you tomorrow
And I had a drink the other day
It didn't change the way I feel
Alisten to awhat I say
Oceans rise and oceans fall
'Cause I know gold is just a trick of light
And makes me fight for something that just can't last
I'd hurt the ones I'd loved
But the lights are so bright that they blind you
I feel like committing a crime, yeah 
All the things you loathe
The time to be a ghost
You were bright, like a new day
One day like this a year would see me right for life
He might get it on, on his own and start building a throne
About my soul
We are falling
If you want to know the truth
I know it looks bad 'cause I kissed all your girlfriends
Well, then you're friends with me
I had to learn the hard way, I had to let her pass by, let her pass by
I knew the worthless dregs we've always been
Whoops, I think I've got too close
I warm the engine compartment up
If sweet Death should ever conquer me
To come together
Cruising and boozin' and rockin' on the horsesized pills
With a torch and a Woman's Realm to keep you company tonight
To the feel good hit of the fall 
My hands shake, I'm not usually this way
I'd rather dance with you 
Just like I knew you would like I knew you would, ooh
A mother and a son and someone you know
And I've loved you since I heard your first cries
I hope that you'll stay the night
From my heart into your will
Don't stop me
Stack it up, be on my way
Every little thing gonna be all right, don't worry
Don't get wise to everyone and everything
I know someday I'll find it
Keep it up, rock'n'roll,
Out of thin air,
The more he knew he knew he didn't know shit
For an offnight
Mumbled words under my breath
Been holding it in for a while, 'ay
A fella looking dapper, but he's sitting with a slapper
I never knew nothing so there's nothing to forget
I sail above your inlets and interstates
Thought it would be there overnight
The light was on but it was dim
It's stopped rainin'
I hit the radio dial and turn it up all the way
From the point I've come from
So they won't get inside our happiness
If ten million fireflies
He passes big houses and family cars
We can dance, we can dance, everybody look at your hands Out of control
Wow, look at her
Close your eyes and hold your terror close
Before we crash in the ground
But you don't think you can say it better, oh baby
The sun is shining down for lovers
And as they lead us to their village, a thousand voices all started to sing out loud
All I know is driving on drugs feels better when they're prescription
I need a second chance second chance
Chuck the deuce up, and tell 'em it's just love
Now those who knew my situation prolly thought a mirror shattered
Start pretending
Under the sun
Kinda love you got knock me off my feet
Doing things, getting better
I hate poopin' in public places but we all hate that
Now pick me up with golden hand
The music's too loud and the noise from the crowd 
I will say a prayer, just while you are sitting there
I blame myself, feel my head explode from a night a gin
Saying, "Ho, have you ever said an honest word"
And it's gonna take, take, take my precious time
And I'll be falling fast asleep
She's so far away
The sun is shinin',
Like this city is on fire tonight
I never made you feel complete
To what I want I land further away from where and when I was a little bit younger
Don't wanna guess, but I think it's time we turned around
If you start believing in me
I seen ya, I seen ya, I seen ya standing in it every time
And go all the way back home
And when she's talking, she'll say that she's mine
Shake shake shimmy without you
Who lives in those lights in the distance 
This wrinkle in time, can't give it no credit
And I will wait to find
All I need, all all I need
Hoowoodoo oohooh
More than you think, if the sun would come out and sing with me
Suddenly I see Yeah, yeah
I can feel complete, stop paying dues
I replay it in the back of my mind
And turn it up while the lights are out
Watch me fall
Cold hearts brew colder songs
Baggage  Wine
It may be only a moment
Still I know them all well so see you later
Should we make believe you remember me from a holiday delayed by a storm
'Cause I don't have my mouth organ
It gets you through the night
So come to me mama it ain't no crime
Loneliness, don't come around here
I've got no claims to your crown Let you settle down
And you're on your own, you're in the street
Heartbeat, heartbeat
Trying to make it so I never see your face again
And in the first moment of her waking up
Go see the world 'cause it's all so brand new
I'll be up up and away
Just today
We will be all right
I've got to have till I am dead
And all of these spirit voices rule the night
Would you say you're mine We'll be just fine
Butterfly, you messed me up, you make my heart double beat and
Where cherry bombs stain the blackbirds red
All that dies will live again
Mmmm, you're my little girl
And if I ain't sellin' no records, I'm servin' them packs
This night will never end
I could show you a place
It wasn't hard to find, you painted flowers on
andahalf years old
Have you ever been to heaven at night heaven at night
These are the good times that you'll miss
Couldn't have been no more than one or two
The Mississippi amends
Whispered in my ear the things I'd like
And never come back
Away away
What we are, what we see, what we are
Oh that'd be spent in sweet content dreaming away
Maybe I'll ride
I'd tell the children
I kick it like Adidas, flowin' sticky like adhesive
Yeah, Estelle, we about to get down get down
Come on and work it on out work it on out, ooh
Oh, it feels so big it almost hurts
We can be together, if you want it
I know you�re gold
The pleasure with the pain pain pain pain pain pain papapapapapapain
Got to get you into my life
And it's us guys writing down a funk rhyme
A whole lotta spending money
I'll never find another way to say, I love you more each day
I was blinded by the light
Peasant child, you're into botany
I left all my friends at the morning bus stop shaking their heads
If the melody's timeless it won't let you down
To see it come to an end
And break them all if we're not havin' fun
Oh, they were apart
I meant what I said, all I want is to be one of the best
You can't take all those things they define you and me
Oh, that rain that's iching on my skin
Because you're sweet and lovely, girl, I love you
The wrong pictures in the paper
Music is where I meet my friends
You made my frown turn upside down
There's nothing after that but you and I
The sunlight rising over the horizon
Like the moons and the stars and the sun
To keep looking ahead at your future
The river's running fast right now
And eventually the sky did return
It made such perfect sense
I painted a dirty word on your old man's MercedesBenz 'cause you told me to do it
And maybe I should say "What's up"
Well, anyway, it's looking like a beautiful day
And forget our dreams
Ain't nobody's business Ain't nobody's business
Your boy comes to see you, he's your Hollywood thrill
You're all alone
All right Just give me a call
Wasn't what you hoped at all
Shake shake shimmy
Neon black whip, war gang hiss;
But before she had time to accept it
The rhythm of a line of idle days
It's just another rainy Sunday afternoon
You're drivin' around town
To lose my way
denn der Teufel bittet dich zum Tanz
When are you free to take some tea with me
I've been spending my money in the old town
Teacher thinks that I sound funny
But, I'm afraid your brittle bones would break
As I attempt to unravel the web by traversing and rehearsing and perversing along the doubtladen extension chord thread of my life
With everything considered they forget my name ame, ame, ame
It's a mistake to blow away
A place where they will never find
Colours and colours and colours of colours
Are you trying to stop it Everyone's watching
'Cause everything is never as it seems
And the boy, that ordinary boy
'Cause I'm still, here whoa oh oh oh
Everybody wants to go to Iraq
The sun falls down like money
The king in I died
Let the melody flow all night, all night
Every night on the way home
And I would gladly leave my hiding place
Where the rivers unwind, rust and in the rain endure
In an octopus's garden with you
I've been so damned sad
Have we missed an opportunity 
You don't know the way to his heart
I just ran into a few someone's today
She didn't make Italia Conte
Good time
The town's shut down, the people left with their bags
I was moving forward
The party's done The cake's all gone The plates are clean 
And I walk the neighborhood
Things will be okay
So go make your mind up before our times up
The old bastard left his ties and a suit
And if time's a limitation
We fall for the same lies, we all have the same shoes to fill
I been bummin' around this old town for way too, way
Sometimes they justify my claim
I have to face the truth 
She's a star
Hey hey mister man
All this justice in my hands
Aright or wrong
Cross when the drawbridge light is green
Ancient walls are tumblin' all over this town
You get what you take
Girl I been waiting all night to see you Dance like me
Carry your love in a trinket hanging round your throat
The blood in my veins and the wind in my lungs
I take it in but don't look down
The story of you and I oh yeah
And I heard the jungle breathing in the bamboo
Could we please be objective
I'm not done yet
I even hear you gotta new car
Please come to save me from myself again
'Cause the grass will never be greener on the other side
It's all about tonight act a fool
The writing's on the wall
Like I love you
The dream is over
I'm a little firefly
I got a look at you
Of these things behind the door
You can't tell me out of that one again
Won't you stop teasing me
I likened to a radio
I'm not your typical, stoned yearold,
I need my Bo Peep
'Bout their promotion of the simple life
Sing the last thing on your mind
Only shooting stars break the mold
But it rings and I rise, wipe the sleep out of my eyes
And there fell to my knees, neath the coil and the brush of the fern
You can be Jane my wife Should I marry Jane tonight
I called your doctor up and he promised me pain was fun 
Shake it back, shake it forth, we wanna see you move
On the front lobe of my leftside brains 
We are homeless, we are homeless
You fear that you can't do it all
I won't stop, won't stop won't stop the beat
We in recession, but let me take a crack at it
Kiss me alone
All summer
Been like twelve years since a nigga first signed
The sun is blazing we are sweating you look lovely
So hear this please
To see through to our star bodies go
I can see you take the money 
I got a selfdestructo bust 
Closing your eyes the feeling so right
Laugh or cry, well we need to try, get off the line, time to fly
But then he cracks that smile
All those frozen strawberries I used to chill your bruising knees
Why I don't cry when my dog runs away
Thirtytwo softly focused, brightly colored eyes
I fall on my knees for my, for my city, eh
Home again to find that you were gone
Them throwing stones
Schlag jetzt die Zeit und danach deine Mum tot
A star,
And there's no one else around,
In this life it's hit or miss
There's only one thing left to do
I didn't even want around
If this is what I call home, why does it feel so alone
Don't get maudlin on me 'cause I'm not fit for it
True love breathes salvation back into me
Hollywood blues
Without your love, I'd be nowhere at all
Dance, dance, dance, Senora
But we'll search 'til we grow old
She's fighting with the sky
Better reach for the sky and raise up the ceiling
Are five kids better than one Who doesn't like to be gone
Don't let the stars get you down
I don't mind, I don't mind
Home among these mountaintops can be so awfully dull
Homage to Venice, the home ha ha of the
He got her meals and he got her a bed
Maxwell stands alone 
I lost my head
Let's think about all those nights on Luckie St
I got all I need
No I won't no I won't no I won't alive alive with love, alive with love
Awww, it looks good on him, look He looks great Hey king
Better say goodbye
The fox chases the rabbit round
From his head to his toes, by a criminal, but with a sensitive soul, with a set of raccoon eyes
And I could never tell as a kid
On her way from the school,
Happy to be that way
Supporting Volbeat with love and hell fire
Elmore James got nothin' on this, baby
Oh, don't it feel good, don't it feel good
But to surrender I just wept and regretted this moment I don't know
Hello, my baby
I'll make the moves up as I go moves up as I go
I sat down on the street, took a look at myself
It's going to take a little time
Higher, a higher power
My friends said homie you know that your white, dude
People, just move along
If the folks come home
That you already knew that you was gonna finish last
My, my the cruelest lies are often told without a word
Never wanna say I wish that I was there
But when you go to meet God, you know you want to look nice
Oh my god just please don't ever let me go
Lets find some place new
Come fill my little world,
But how long, babe, can you search for what's not lost
He's not making much sense
Feel my head explode from a night of gin,
Óró mo churaichín ó Flicking fire like saltwater into my eyes
Baby, please
A love they'd know 
Like chairmen Mao's
A candy man, a candy man
Sometimes he forgets that you're even there
Come on, dance, jump on it
There's no such thing
Today was a fairytale
You can try to hide the sun
It's the land of make believe, can't you see, can't you see
So long I been hungry for something else
And I know I should be home
I can't hear you baby,
Life gets hard and I'm headed for the highway home, home
I can unroll rip off my own tights
I didn't know what to do
Since that summer, since that summer
And the dreams that you dreamed of
Not today
Why do I always have to tell you  forget about the prescient signs, forget about the life we knew
I got here, where
To tell me that you're not the guy
Shake it, shake it sugar
Why you gotta act like you know when you don't know
The silver sound is all around and the colors fall like snow
So mama don't take my Kodachrome away
Well, I know flirting is nothing
I really don't like your skinny jeans
I need a simple space, and rest my head, and everything gets clear
Gonna be all right
I doubt my reply would be interesting for you to hear 
Everything you ever wanted from this life is gonna happen right now
"But don't you understand
One day you'll be washing yourself with hand soap in a public bathroom
I spent the winter with my nose buried in a book
Cause all they say is kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss
In the slickness of your blood
I wasn't expecting nothing,
Ppput my record on
Let the beat control you
Oh Jane Addams, spirit send thee
It ain't no carnival cruise
Wish I could get into your mind
My keys around my neck were jingling
Did you know the seasons in your mind
But honey you know
And if it wasn't Fall outside, it was in
I got strung up from our loving 
First place in the race
Hurry up and get a move on
And only so much you can control
Yeah, we carry the mail now
It'll be just like the day
Be the love generation
It takes some bad for satisfaction
Momma, I'm coming home
When all the doors should be closed
The red and sweat and tears, the love you got Hey
Taking in the sights of your empire's colony
Then you just gotta try
Make it better, we're here to welcome you
We act upon desire to each a hand for hire
I know you like it sweet
Shape it into an ear and then tell me your pain 
I will shout the same to the world
With my lover, she's counting the diamonds on rings
A moment in time we can't replace
Is the new American way
Now I've been worrying about your feelings, yeah, they were worth protecting
Babe, the night would see me wide awake
So why don't we just move into the other room 
Promise not to abandon you, please let me go
If I get drunk, well, I know I'm gonna be
Oh oh oh, ooh ooh
Fuck yeah, we can live like this
Roll up, roll up for the Magical Mystery Tour
Yes, I know everything
I say hellowhoawhoa
I shouldn't have wasted those days
Soon as my eyes see tha sunshine
And I heard the sound of acapella grooves, yeah
'Cause there'll be Ma and Pa and Grandmama
You and me chasing paper
The lovin' is a mess, what happened to all of the feeling All of the feeling
We've watched it all from the window ledge,
I love the wonderful thing it does
Perfectly at peace so I move along a bit higher
And if you try to hold on
We can take a ride go tell everyone
Like the gristle of loneliness
We can be happy underground
Everyone who sees him says, "Eww"
To go back to where I was would just be wrong;
Tonight we're gonna take the breath of a thousand lungs
Rambling down the boulevard, with a fire burning in a wooden heart
So sing like you need this
Folk take for granted as they walk to church
Let's do it together
You'll notice the beat is gone,
When you make it me plus one
You've got to make the morning last
If I have time to
Feeling the love and I'll set it loose
I see a thousand cherry tulips lined up
Seven stories we're climbing tonight, 
Do anything you can to dodge the busstop blues 
Alcohol under my breath
Got the sun we've got the waves
You sweet talk like a cop and you know it
All the boys that she, that she had known before,
Icein' mesmerizin' the minds are sick ones
Get the cool shoeshine
A stranger's face is seen  but was he on our team 
Calling my name and I follow just to find you
You've got my secret combination
You left your dark horse in the stable
I've got a fever, baby, your love
With skin you'll win
About your hair you needn't care
This is for real, this time I mean it
If we'd had never changed a thing
But look here until then
I feel your warmth, you let me in
The rain was gone
Donde estas, donde estas, Yolanda 
Unlike girlfriends they don't mind if you have more than one
All night day dreams 
Run for your children, for your sisters and brothers
Memories bring us back to where we've been
Don't stop, never give up
Still, I only feel alive when the VU is flashing
We can shake, shake, shake
Cause his father's not the man he'd like to grow up to be
She feels peaceful there
But separate's always better
That I have a taste there is no turning back
But pain is the only promise that this so called savior is gonna bring
Whoa, whoa, I never realised what a kiss could be
Telling me not to let things get in my way
Around the clock You are You are
You better get here soon
Down comes the reign of the telephone czar Aaah
Kind of frail, I feel it in my bones
MIT Virtual Reality Equipment To Self
I can't get out of my bed
I'll just wait awhile
So please, try to understand that if I could, I'd call and I would be there
And her chest is full to bursting with thoughts of an evening
And they bring all of their friends but I don't mind
Escapade Come go with me, we've got it made ooh
I said, Darlin' do not fear what you don't really know
Folks given up under the quivers and lines,
There is a hole and I tried to fill it up with money
You never get to
Let you off the hook like my man Mr Lipit
And I'd rather be home in our bed
She follows me 'round wherever
Und bis ich die Kohle irgendwann dann mal zusammenkratze
And I will ask you to open my door from your side
I got a feeling within
Is a mystery no doubt
Don't do any good to say this isn't what I planned
Gotta let me in, hey, hey, hey
Gonna let it all out an do my thing
Just look through your window, look who sits outside
Home sweet home,
Means that when we have parted
We are collapsed in the act of just being here
Find the words that define these feelings
I put the right foot in front of the left
Does this city have a curfew
Doesn't mean I sad because I
The dock in the lazy sun
The little children laugh at him behind his back
Really high into the sky
Yeah, oh, yeah, oh
Das wird dir gut tun
Girl dresses like a kid for fun Kid for fun
To carry out missions 
Then someone said with a cold hearted chest, "You're a mess"
Can speak the words on your lips
The days before the day we die
He's got the sun on his back
The stars were burning so bright 
We live in a free world Free world
You're all our brothers and sisters and our babies
Sometimes you have to wait until it passes by
Love comes inside you, gets behind you
The things we've written in it
I'd hand the skies to you
Lonesome and forsaken with no gratitude
Young, uniform minds
No, I won't let them take you, wont let them take you,
Those smokestacks were making clouds for the sky
Well out of my ears my little black baby hears
We'd fry our brains 
Because people are the greatest thing to happen
I want to be alone for a while
I am too a spirit and a walker
'Cause you're so ooh Tootootoo, so ah Tootootoo, so cool Baby, you're so supersupremelybabadioh
I've been dreaming since I woke up today
All the stars are fixed up in the sky
Let's turn on each other
But baby I need more than that
Always remember
As if you actually were inside a saltwater room
I just want someone to say to me, no oh oh oh
And we don't care about the young folk
And she keeps calling
Shelve tops is on
Than let you come to harm
Just please, give me a chance to say no
You are suave thanks to ribbons that opened sesame
Heartbreakers gonna break, break, break, break, break mmm
Speak about the future in past tense, here it comes
By the harbor, we found a boat with your name written on it
I've nothing left to say
I think I'm in love
We're doing it right
But I never loved no one the way that I love you
Where I've built too many walls
And I'm smiling for no reason
City please don't let me down You are what you mean
So this is what they do out here for fun
We're the kind of people who can shake it if we're feeling blue
Nothing left to lose
Wander the great indoors
I gotta go, gotta go,
I rise as the morning comes
Ég óska mér, og loka nú augunum
Long as I know I have love I can make it
She drives a little white car to the seminar on Modern Romance
It is within us all the time
Until that solid gold is in your hand
My money's got no hold on me
On my feet I wear two shoes for dancing
Say I'm tired as hell
Got to find another way to live the life of leisure
Now I'm walking on sunshine, whoa
I'm the messiah, recognize it, political prisoner
Oh happy day
She thinks he does not love her
Just let yourself go
Or the grace of your eyes that can see good in me
Buzzin' in my head head
Hide behind that baby face
It will some day let you down
I should've guessed that you'd be just like all the rest
We are surrounded
That things are better when you're with me
Never say goodbye
On a mountain top
We face the hardest part
Take me home good lord for heavens sake
I've been alone and I have missed things
You still think I'm someone to look up to
Now it's the th hour of a twoday night
Others only read of the love
I'm as deep as the plot to an amateur gay porn
But it's a funny way for you to tell me
I got no ifs ands ors no wits or what's about it
Feels so right it can't be wrong
Or a little unsettled inside
I've been dreaming of the city for a long time, far from my home town
You said, "Blackie's dead Blackie's dead," and then run the other way
And take a second chance on me
Stop at Third and Fortythree, exit to the night
Tightfisted with his compliments, it didn't seem to bother him
You know it kills me to see such a pretty girl so tired
I feel like my heart was broken
Lovers all talk in the spits and tongues
For a while"
I'm sitting on the edge with my two best friends
We are lying in the sun, when we're done finding a towel
I've just seen a face
Uhuh, uhuh, they can't do what we do baby
Just keep your eyes on me"
Everything you do now
Another decade getting high until you're free
All I need
Life goes by so damn quickly for me
They say, Sir, do you got a light
Ancient walls of flowers tumblin' down
Don't make that call, he'll put you down
A thousand ways that make you statuesque
And I thought that I would kiss you
Yeah, I got busted
But the words wouldn't wait
I have dreams of orca whales and owls
They'll jack your money
By the side of the road
Is just a yellow lemontree
You, you, you, ooh ooh ooh, you
Hear a phoebe sing his only song
Raindrops are falling on my head
And we'll both be on our way
Someday holding hands in the end
And now she's looking for a downtown man downtown man
Past all the casting couches, rugburned knees
Open academies, avenues and tree
Everything's right
And there's two things I forgot
She didn't care to hang around,
She can break it up
My words are my faith, to hell with our good name
Well, the years start comin', and they don't stop comin'
Please come with me
Oh Stacey, look what you've done 
I work all night, keep on walking, alright
And true, let ya get away with it
Hoping I could learn a bit about how to give and take
And as I roll along I begin to find
Ah, just turn around
I can't remember if I like what I said
So I say
And I like to tiptoe 'round
He never got far 
They call me her
As he drifts to sleep with a moan and a weep
Since I don't have the time nor mind to figure out
I wish I knew, 
Have you ever made love to a beautiful girl
You know, the look right before you cry it's always here
Does the sum of the slights hurt 
The patient, the patient fall
And when someone else instead of me
I would have liked you anyway Would have liked
Lucked out, found my favorite record
The rabbit was removed under the whole moon
As long as I got you, baby 
She wrote me a letter
Feel alright
Bit more then the girls he pretends he doesn't thrill
Oh, they're gonna put me away this time
If storms are breaking over great escapes
Flying 'cross the floor
Won't be as bitter as the ones behind you
It hurts to see you dance so well
And it's become just like a chemical stress
Yes and no, there's no right, but we have no better light
Just say yes
Shake it, susugar
For a chance to dance with stars
Do you remember when I shook your hand
The songs that we sung when the dark days come
And my dear dear dear Khalana, I talk too much about you
Have stopped to say goodbyes
Next step into the stars
'Cause I would make a hook and eye
Throw yourself on the aeroplane and fly like magic
What makes you think that it won't grow back
Now see how the colors blend
That caravan girl
Do you want to make me sweeter
Will you find another boy to go and kiss and tell
Oh, oh, I love you so
I got a little breath left let's suffocate it
All the bees and birds are flying ah ah ah
Sometimes luck's not on my side
On another's affair
I behold travellin' light
But I'm still the king of me
She's laughing inside 'cause they can't refuse
Last ones to laugh pull the trigger here on the run
The ice we skate is gettin' pretty thin
She will not let you be
Clap your hands Where's my milk and honey
Won't somebody save me from you now
In the mortal life
To find an old man with a lime and a kind eye
Occupy my mind
What if I die here
It's a funky beat
Warmed up weather, let's get together
I lead with my left hand,
Should I tell you how bad I need you now
And ask you what you think because your thoughts and words are powerful
I can love you better
But then you came and made the past look so funny
Shake it, shake it
For my boys in blue in case of an emergency
I know you didn't mean that
I want to change my orbit
And honestly leave when I know that it's time
Of anything at all
I thought that you were standing over me
You got a million things you want to flee
I got a man to stick it out
And when your mind's made up
By the bedrock
These are the days, oh
Crawling out of the world she brought
I just had to let you go
Yeah, yeah
Sapphire and faded jeans, I hope you get your dreams,
You make me still
You don't wanna let the moment pass you by
Do I look to the other side
Like you rewrote a essay for a class
Steady my heart, it's beating faster, beating faster now
No I get by with a little help from my friends
Drunk, watching the television
Like glitter's raining on me
The smell of you in every single dream I dream
It's driving you mad, Even if she falls in love
She's instantly more pretty and more interesting than me
I put a tag on everything
Lose all your heart,
To have something to hold
Move a little closer, hold me tighter
You won't soon forget the name
And I can hate your girl
Illinois in it ran from the Ronald Reagan Tollway
We love one another
Don't you try to tell me that you never loved me
Say the word, love
Something never quite so defined
Most ideas turn to dust, as there are few in which we all can trust
As there's dancing to be done
With the dawn I still go on dreaming of you
I can act like a star, I can beg on my knees
It's not perfection, yeah
We dive so deep we keep in touch with your buried bones 
I'm thinking, do I have to plead to get you by my side
And wouldn't it be nice to live together
Where the spirit never dies
Keeping versed and on my feet
And if you were a kiss, I know I'd be a hug
She's not anyone
I'm gonna be round my vegetables
With a face like that you'll never ever make it big,
Into the milky way again
I think yore saying that you will make me,
It takes the one to have the other
Nothing can stop gestalt
We're the  boys and we'll make you smile
Oh, you're never coming back
Where all the leaves have been swept and the flowers grow
Cigarettes and a six pack, he just got back
Giving deadarms in the hall
You know I'm not the little boy that I used to be
Goodnight darlin', you're so fine
Broken down like a war economy
When there's a million things to learn they never teach you in school
Spending someone's hardearned pay
Þú tyggigúm í hendir hár fast
I'm gonna pave the way at night
When the big hand strikes twelve
And if we've only got this life
Coconut hit me on the head jonesin' for a fig
Tell me that you feel this, and I won't give up
If I lived in this land, if I lived in that land, uh huh
I got something I think I really wanna show ya
Once I get you up there,
Please come and see me again, I never felt more alone
No way they said take it, take it and don't break it with your own two hands
The tenements recall Rome
And it takes some words to make an action
Every single line
Now, take me to where your sister lives
And all the people on the island they all want to show why they sing,
Acan I get get get to know knknow know you better better baby x
Candy lips that taste too sweet 
Ooh, ooh, don't tell me no
Super soaked in honeycomb 
The rust and the rain so thin, well I'm in like Flynn again 
I only see you when you're walking, walking to somewhere
I know you'll get me through
You can close it off and turn it away
She's got deep brown eyes
In my finest suit, like a perfect gentleman
Stuck in the middle
Scared of a world outside
Waiting on love to call
You never should worry, your hours will now be as long
In my heart is a spring
I feel so guilty
I just need someone to love
And I'll say fuck Bush and fuck this war
Straight men
We sold our clothes to the state
Passed a little lonely cleanse
But Friday, never hesitate
Oh like you were saying something
When the sun shines down what's left of me
I took something and it feels like karate
I'll write my full heart
Now all I need is someone to tell it to, maybe that's you
Take those things that cannot stick and 
Your car is pulling off of the curb, hey
So I will never know the right way to say thanks
'Cause you make me feel
Before getting involved in a game
Revenge is the saddest thing
Adventurous smile shifting to frown
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
It's getting very near the end
Everybody wanna dance now
Never let your mother race 
It's alright I'm getting dizzy just enjoy the party 
And the world wants to fight me
Well, since time had a mind I've been lazy
He'll be coming home late, yeah, he's coming home late
Don't mind all my friends, I know they're all crazy,
All the riches one could dream
These special moments do exist
I just want to be ok today
Said I had to go down to where the cliffs meet the sea
Well I love you
We'll never feel bad anymore
Heyla, heybahelloah whoooo
I never thought you knew
A little bit of knowledge will destroy you
But that don't mean that we're not still family
The lair where I stuck my dirty beak
Henri Winterman Cigars
Aggressors are in their places,
It's standing in the light now 
But something flipped like a switch when you came around
Know that you'll still do it
Forty hours television and prescription pills
Yeah, yeah, yeah, ooh
Look into your heart and you'll find love love, love, love
You sit outside in the dark
I got stung
Revolver's been turned over
I'd like to shake you around and around
Add up the sum of the slights and 
Uh huh won't fight your war until I'm finished with mine
Baby, I feel good 
It does flips and throws you over
You didn't have to do it but you did it to say
I will be your light, I will be your light 
Stay right here where you belong
Came stumbling toward us
He's everybody's girl"
Lucky I'm in love with my best friend
In the middle of the street doing cartwheels
You're going to see how life itself 
Never mind tomorrow
What's that, boy
You've still got a view of the summer sky
I don't find it funny anymore
You're fooling nobody
I don't know where to go, can't do it alone
And the way they move and the way move their hands
The sun keeps on shooting through pine trees
We're on an island on the fourth of July
And satellites that compromise the truth
We know, it's all about the way it comes out
And Cairo at his head
In the blackout they dance right into the aisle
Mashin' to the music, I can do anything
That love was bigger
You see, you push it in the corners
One more time, we'll do what we have to
I don't wanna wait in line,
Just let go
My arms get cold,
And I, I'm never letting you go, baby
I'm gonna do it, gonna do it my way
And I don't care who's wrong or right now,
Is there a letter
And we'll get to know each other for a second time,
Poor young grandson, there's nothing I can say
I've gotta search hard for your clues
Come on back to me, reality
Oh love, love
When you go up, down, jump around
And float down Grand Street in daylight
I'm getting it back with that terrible feeling 
I'm liking this American boy, American boy
I'll let you know
There ain't no stopping us now
The help at the door
But when I'm in doubt, I open my mouth
Yes, we're going to a party, party
And all the presents from her uptown boys uptown boys
Tell the promoter we need more seats
That sacred night where we watched the fireworks
Generation to generation it gets passed on
Storybook endings, fairy tales coming true 
And it's never okay
I swear we're gonna get there
To the darker side of town
And waste the time with you
I'll make you laugh by acting like the guy who sings 
Why were you gone, why were you gone so long
So give me your hand and let's jump out the window
Sorry 'bout the things that I said
Now the funny thing about it
Gotta new set of friends, a new kind of business
You feel your dreams are dying
Sometimes words just can't explain
Ooh I'm giving it all tonight
How could I ever forget you
Music is my back rub
I know, yeah we are still learning
I've been creeping round this town because
That flew right out from his hands
I'm gonna snap back into formation
All the feeling
'Cause we can always sing girl
And maybe even you can feel it too
And I know shine so lightly, so clearly blue
And the light shines on
We sure are cute for two ugly people
I've been standing here waitin', Mr Postman
Just like a rocket baby
How do I get it back the way it was before
You know, you know me you know my name
When the chaperone crowned us the king and the queen
So it came time to fight
Until you have a daughter that's what I call karma
But the meteor men beg to differ
Your the best girl that I ever did see
You wanted her and you got her
I'll give you my only love
With the lights turned up, it's hard to hide
Where are the hidden folds
From the projects, I send shots where the cops is, nigga
And the ones you'd like to be rid of
And there's always something in the air
He's my friend, He's not my friend
Not a lot left to say
That you can feel me
With your feet on the ground and your head to the sky
All the things that flow through my mind
I've got this banging in my head
Charlie's fixing his van, he's waiting for a postcard
Shed a tear for the one you love
Oh baby please give a little respect
She's there to love me, all day and night
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me
When I'm so far away Oh why would I
Now, you talk about your childhood wishes
It's some kind
Don't try to fight the feeling
The stars in your eyes would turn and break my heart
Till I'm running out of air
Riding swiftly through the night, almost missed the light, if ya feel me feel me
Oh things are gonna happen naturally
Hook her, book her, nook her
Everyone back my hearts at war
But he smart, he plotted a plan for Polygram
But everybody's pretending the sun won't ever come out
Now the spit's flying everywhere
But contessa, I already did
Take it to the tippitytop
I woke up with the rising sun
Don't have to be ashamed of the car I drive At the end of the line
Arriving at the door
All I need is a hook now
I'll be the girl of his dreams maybe
Love on the filthy streets is so divine
What you don't have now will come back again
The silhouettes behind the dust clouds call me friend
I've got the best of interventions
Just close your eyes
We will put this flesh into the ground again
Though her face is ugly, her eyes don't match
He can tell a fairy tale, it's happily ever after
Oh, comes down to hope, came down on me
She saw the future, she heard voices from inside
Come get lost with me
That's why I'm standing on the overpass screaming at myself
Now did you know this is limited time offer
There's a sun coming over the horizon
Electricity in the air
Weight is coming off, soaring high, Pleading you to stay, come alive
With a woman who lets you
Now stand Stand
My feelings I don't
I believe in the faith that grows
Ein Schluck vom Flakon
Whiskey or a gin, that's alright
Sssing my song and
And down Doheny Way Inside, outside, USA
I have a love
Beautiful this time of year,
Welcome to your barbeque
Bombs away Say Geronimo
They're just girls
When you're with me, baby, the skies will be blue for all my life
I don't feel like I'm fallin' And I'm so fly that
And once I tried to make a life
You'll bring me flowers and you'll bring the showers
Your heart can list the all, happiness you know
How near we've come is yet to show
Come out of the cold
Maybe somewhere down the road when somebody plays At the end of the line
I'll stop the world and melt with you
In a storm in my best dress, fearless
"I'll come another day" 
Oh Stacey, you think that you're the only one
Don't care enough to write you a letter now that I'm doing better alone
Selfless fool who hoped he'd save us all
But things like bad timing just won't wait
Hey you, you're still the one
'Cause you'd be living in a world of your own design, undermined
Once I get you up there
Boy, let me love you and show you how special you are
That no one's gonna take your place
Clean your hands and go to sleep
It's been this way for so long
So come on let me sing
Feeling kinda lonely
Someone get me out of here
Oh, mirror mirror upon the wall
"The Whiz Man" will never fit you like "The Whiz Kid" did
Woo ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh~
See the world sometimes
I want earth to breathe to me
Everything we could but won't
Hit the dance floor
It made me feel like I belonged
I'm a nobody, too
Back when my pops was a boy, ya know
Ain't no thing I can be lugubrious with you
And you're right
You stare at him long, you can find a new song
It didn't make me feel like shit
There is nothing that would sort you out
Live while you can 
That's the way
I never wanted to be better than my friends
We're together dead and lonely
No one would hear me now
Make haste, I feel your heartbeat
Can I have some please of that
Enjoy it while you still have it
Do you say goodbye
I am somewhere in the city, I am climbing up a fire escape
No, I'm only getting started
Through the gorgeous light of the sun
And it rips my life away, but it's a great escape
Over the moon under the sun
When the summer's gone
For the girls you hate or just don't know
I hear the music baby
There must be enough love around the world
And with this silence brings a moral story
But you could be waiting for your life to begin
Stomp, stomp the beat
Now the look in your eye
But all these days
I get strung up from her loving 
It seemed like rainbows would appear,
Goddamn, I am surprised that I have survived
It's all that I got why don't you show me
I still never told you about unstoppable sorrow
He's walking along with a soul in his lungs
Nobody would see us go
See I'm all about them words
Hug my family and take your picture off the wall
But we're alright
Left this haunted town
I think it should be funny, uhoh
I see it clear, a shooting star I'm a really good singer ladidadada
Been tumbling down quick first right from the start
On an island in the sun
Put up your hands girl but not so, so pushy
And it doesn't seem to mean anything ooh
Oh, oh, serious as a heart attack
To not creep up on you and the space we put between
I'm floating around in ecstasy
You think you've got it
Look at me now, I'm falling
And I'm longing to feel your embrace
From the people you despise
That's what our love can do
We can dance, we can dance, we're doing it from wall to wall Wall to wall
Too much hogwash, not enough hearsay
Never had to battle with no bulletproof vest
What the scarecrows think would turn your eyeballs pink
To say that you deserve this 
Trying to get home find a phone
Floating and fighting, like a kite on a string
And it's you and me in the summertime
You can find your way home on the 
Now the sky could be blue
I wanna fly with you
No, she won't stop making the crowd scream
Watch the night turn into day
Hold your hand out, you silly girl
Ancient walls of whispers falling low,
Can you hear the ocean roar
I hope that you remember this
You worked hard, died poor 
I carry myself to the fortress
We got it, we got it
You painted a picture she wanted to see
Who knows what's around the bend
And all the signs of your life
But it wouldn't stop my love,
It's getting so complicated
Buys a twenty carat golden ring rinring
Did you forget to read the script
No matter what they say, we're heroes, boy we'll get to break out
If I buy those jeans I can look like Kate Moss
You know you'd trade your life for any ordinary Joe
Nothing you can know that isn't known
Singin', don't worry about a thing, I won't worry
By the river of dreams
Can we get away this weekend, take me to Broadway
Besame Cuando Estes Bailando Come On
Ain't got no perfume, ain't got no beer
Only your love makes house a home
Nhliziyo yami somandla angibulele mama
And you're a little bit right
What you need it for
I hope you're feeling better
Dodging holes and telephone poles through the dash
Something sacred I lost
I'm so sick of feeling sad
So now I'm staring at the interstate screaming at myself
My shavin' razor's cold and it stings
Baby I'm in love and maybe it's not to tell
For all the AM phone calls
I can see the meltings of inhibition
el mejor de todos los tiempos come on
She's the midnight pick of the day, yeah
That's gone and I know that it won't ever come back
Our love was stronger than your pride
I don't even know how I got here
I'm tryin' to help you out so can you stop being a twat
And no one would hear me now, hear me now
Let me love you tonight
He'd thank God it's Friday
Neither you or I would ever know sunlight 
Another place to face where I lace you at
If memory serves me right
Once there were parking lots
I just can't believe the loveliness of loving you
Oh that's the way it is
With a calculator and a ruler, baby
And everyone says 
Bring me my Japanese cigarette case,
I've been running and running feels like my head is spinning round 
Someday I will treat you fine 
Before these blue shade days are gone
You and me, no one else,
You keep me warm at night
Made a friend tonight
You've come to pass
With facts and figures that never add up anyway
Whoo, dance, dance
So many tears to your eyes
But when they're parking their cars on your chest 
I'll still change my underwear if that's okay with you
Let's fall, look where we land
Vaten voir quelque part
You were like a power of nature
I've been everywhere and back tryin' to replace
With the sun beating down
But I know when the stars are aligned you can
Shaky legs holding up my feet
Disappointment haunted all my dreams
But I'm gonna party tonight
And this town will be cold when it gets hit by a comet
All these thoughts as I open up a zingo
Everything here is beautiful
I ride roller
Trying to swim but your sinking like a stone, alone
Not sure if you mind if I dance with you
Nothing can happen too soon
Of ages and battered books and
It was hidden in the fall
And you're blind to the fact that my
Darling, go to sleep
Aloha my happy west coast friend
Ooohooo
With the Annie sample and Money ain't A Thang
I love to take a photograph
In the night light, we still shine bright
Edmonton's just a four night bike ride outta town
What if I'm right
The only things I'll read are faces
She's got super human thighs,
It's wanting what you've got 
'Cause when I think of you as mine
The horses are coming
One, and you hold me
'Cause she's my only friend
Until that day, I guess we stay
Then again it just depends on
Now it's getting late and there's still no sign of her
Bury your eyes in a secret place
And the family heirloom jewelery
Hey, let it drop
True love from me
Everyone you meet
You are staying with your friends tonight
All I can say is eh, eh
Backseat on the 
I've got time to spare so
Oh I love the curling of your hair
It's better not to holla back
Upon your face, you may think you're alone but you
Know how much you need it
I cannot reach a pen for me to draw the line draw the line
When you come I feelin' better
Oh, the way that you're always surprised
Keep an ear to the ground so to drown out the sound,
While others grab terror, call me shuffle a deck
I'm going to leave you like new 
Will show in motions rendered by the night
Then won't you stay the night
Oh what a world my parents gave me
You make sense of it
Lucky Strike and I will travel woo hoo
But if he doesn't stop fucking with me
Yeah, everything must belong somewhere
When you find it all around
Now it's getting hotter
Waiting for, waiting for, waiting for, waiting
The last thing on your mind
And sing that old song, how does it go
Where we used to say
Love will fall around my door
Till this wish is my command
Shaking that thang like you're playing pop warner
I really got a good excuse
And now there's a place to go
Drove up in my bone Camaro thinking only about you
And every time I hit, she say it's a home run
You know I wish I was an ocean
Well he said one thing, before I graduate
In a cartoon graveyard
I can't see me lovin' nobody but you for all my life
Saw our hearts were little stones
Well there's nothing to lose
And I'll wipe them out of mine, too
To hold you tight until you left me and fade
You're so restless, you're gonna end up alone
Why don't we sleep all, sleep all day, sleep all, we sleep all day over
Oh, please believe I said
There's no need for despair
You'll never feel settled in or become an equal  no
Let's get something to eat
And maybe I'll come back for you
Boom shak got two shoes for dancing
We're gonna run away, we're gonna run away
It's that I can't dance a single step
I don't care if I'm alone here singing songs to myself
Clutching your soul to the toll of the blight
We'll spend some time forever
You're a lover of the wild and a joker of the heart
You've agreed to give me everything
How can a flower bloom in
Quand tu me prends dans tes bras
Of a dead and hanging man
I was a kid again
I was just some stupid boy on a bus
And it's bigger than everything I have ever done before
Leaving the world down beneath the clouds
My skin is covered with sharp spikes 
But don't miss me goodness because I rub away every time
Head colds in frozen weeks of summer holds
Honey, I was wasting away in a room
Fake funeral
Sugar dumpling and muffin baby
Oh, Susannah's still alive
The tender love and care
And you are infinitely invited
And faith is all we need to be the one, far from my own ground
Say it will always be like this
This one is good
Seasons come and go 
With not enough love to go around
There's more to life than this
Living my life
I need you, CHA CHA
Honestly, everybody's stoked, I'm finally free
All of my days
I been bummin' around this old town for way long
This ain't a greater plan to break your heart over me
I'mma let you try to convince me to
And I'm glad you fell in love with me
Take a look around, there's something happening
Keep it in the background
Your lips, they pout and twist
Complacent and miserable
I'll be back at a quarter to 
There's a light
Shoppin' bags full of cartier forgetmenots
When you're happy like a fool
Fumbling 'round in the dark with a flashlight
We were victims of the night
Touch the stars, for time will not flee
Shake your body line
Life would not matter
Egolovers need more power
Dream yourself along another day
I hold sunlight and swallow fireflies
So I called up Lisa
So meet her by the sugar mill after school 
You did This one thing and I was so with it
Never knew how much I didn't know
These people overwork me
Cozy and cold, put the horse before the cart
The golden state wins again
Some color on monochrome
I went over to the wayside
You cross your heart and hope to die
I'm gonna swim in seas of green, I tell you
The city
We rarely practice discern
In church on Sunday making out in front of the preacher
Blowin' dro on 's, livin' how the song go
Heaven don't fall on earth
Goddamn right, it's a beautiful day 
David won't you stop dreaming now
Until you find your man
How's your brand, new limousine
And ain't nobody gonna tell us to go cause this is our show
Even in his heart, the Devil has to know the water level
Woooohoohoohoohoohooh
It's the last  hours and this whole world is ours eternally, eternally
Without a line to divide what is theirs
It's you and me tonight
And I watched the world being reborn, till one am
I'm walking all by myself
Nothing really mattered when you called out my name
You're all fakes, run to your mansions
They are tangled up in the light
But it sure ain't what we need
Even when somebody knocks
Baby, I hope that you get a clue,
We hang around dans ton quartier
This one goes out to you and yours, worldwide
I just had somebody tell me I was introspective to a fault
Destroys your hope and dignity
And then it's not just showing off here
She's been living in her white bread world white bread world
Should I feel flattered that you hate everything but me
Damn, this love is skin tight
Don't get upset, and now it's just the beginning
I've been waiting, I've been waiting, I've been waiting, yeah
Love today
And yellow stones are standing on her eyes
Their parents all cackled at dirt on my hands
 years asleep before we sleep forever
Just like that, th grade footy heard
Help me get my feet back on the ground
You take command and lose control
Just left to move
Won't you help me share my love
Don't keep it all inside you
And I'm off to save the world
Keep fafallin', these heels they keep me borin'
Awaken from a slumber to a rollercoaster ride
Your second chance may never come along
Till the time I saw your face
At you grass stained and runk on the ground, 
No one will ever like you, you're not good at anything"
Until you came along; now there's one less thing wrong
You'd think the world was ending right now
Go ahead and marry anyway
I'll drive around all day and kill processed fish
Then won't you stay the night
But, girl, I'm gettin' wise
We are not what you think we are
And realised by the distance in your eyes
It's easy being with you, sacred simplicity
I left my man in Houston Texas 
But then I started wondering
And then on the way home, it always seems like a good idea to go paddling in the fountain, and that's because it IS a good idea
If we've got to burn out, let's do it together
Sitting on a flagstone talking to a faceless girl
Nice to have the time to take
Making love in the afternoon
If I had the chance I would show him all I am
Well my heart goes blind and the sun don't shine
And it takes no time to fall in love
From all the ladies the one I kiss is music
You could win a rabbit
When all of our troubles are gonna end 'cause
See today, no way
The Queen says no to potsmoking FBI members
Like the color purple, macaroni and cheese
But the musicals don't play with me
You've got to prove that you're no liar
So stomp your feet and clap your hands
Smash on morning Southwark stone
The sky is clear and the moon is full
Her tiara digging deep in her head
Four banana three banana two banana one
There will be feasting and dancing in Jerusalem next year
Beneath your window pane
Everybody knows the way the eye goes
I don't act right
When it rains it's sure to pour
And the world is synchronicity
He'd say
Every time it's the same routine
See the Buddha on the second floor
From what I've heard with skin you'll win
And you'll be saying, how did I get here
There were times I was sure, so sure
Don't worry baby
You've gotta let her go because you're breaking up the girl
Come back, come back,
Speed train
So I gather around me all the little pieces of a song
To an island where we'll meet
Runners, until the race is run
Lies are gonna get you some day
Eh, eh eh, eh  There's nothing else I can say
And start a riot, a riot be rebel
My heart broke out in song
Like the summer sunshine pour you sweetness over me
Thursdays I reminisce
But move
Be the one with the loudest mouth
'Cause you might get run over or you might get shot
When the walls are caving in
I felt like there was something missing in my daytoday life
Like one big flop
Every Sunday morning
There's a shake with the shock and a gift off with them
Oh happy day, 
To someone else,
Soft kiss and wine what a pretty friend of mine
Believe that somebody like you'd end up with someone like me
Don't take anything away
There's a whole lot of walking to do
'Cause I can't stay in the middle of it all
Two or three times the bell will ring but when when we look for the better things we search for this we have not build I feel it crash upon your skin
Trying to live without your love
So let's abandon that track and leave our fathers fighting in a sack
Help to get me through
They know everything, they know where you are
On a long lost day when you're gray and dull
Counterpoint
So I got it made
But there's no number to call
The two of us together
The dog days are over
We went out late last night and we danced through the night
I'm waiting here with open arms
I knew no vices and I knew no sins
Generate the music that makes you feel better
My last case I got bail
You make me feel much better Cause girl we're good together
And never ever watch the ten o'clock news
Moments live or moments die
Not serious, about the way that you are
Got me goin' around
To push me around and tell me what to do
Óró mo churaichín ó I dragged you back a sleepyhead
You can knit a sweater by the fireside
From your cigarette
Don't think that I'll forget
The warm, red Sun gives up and sinks into the trees
As the dust clears and it all starts to disappear
If you steal my sunshine
But who's that ghost who keeps walking by my door
'Cause they don't let you talk
Y'know baby
I'm so burnt out; I'm a shell now
We should know better I made a pilgrimage to save this human's race
The feelings that I feel
So dreamy, oh Mandy
You know I'm really gonna, really gonna have it made, yeahhea
To be needed by someone
This time around, well I'm not buying it
When I get in from my work
When you're looking at the rain
You keep moving, stop moving, it's the same
They never stopped moving
I was dreaming of just you, now our cereal, it is warm
Life, oh life, oh life, oh life,
Leave the liberty in that broken bell today
Shaking sticks, oh what a show, rushing joy from tip to toe
If I say I'm not loving you for what you are
When the conversation stops and we're facing our defeat
The beat's really hot
We say that we'd take you down
I sing my song and I'm a rocker
You know we all ride on
So we're making a lot of noise
You know it saves me to think even for a little while
Chorus repeat until end
Don't tell me that you didn't try to check out my bum
The crowds keep me coming back
Before the party's over make it on over
You've seen and heard all an old man can
Well, they're no friends of mine
I paid my, I paid my, I paid my money to the welfare line
I feel alright, I found a place that fits tight
And then I'm left in bits
It's you who's got it all
But being such fawn of a man I didn't burn down any old churches
And I'm on my way, I don't know where I'm going
When I fall asleep
