Is it strange for me to say that
And heaven don't tear you apart
Because in a village a poor lad
The firemen shake
There are places, there are places, you can go to
Oh but I know
We are obsessed
Even though I know it's impossible for me
'Cause all my life is wrapped up in today
A single weed gets respect
And if I should taste fire
Memories, memories
Waiting to phone me
Ten times a day ten times a day
I want you too,
But you don't understand, I wish you understood
All those words came undone and now I'm not the only one
Torched by the burning sand
A time to go a time to live
Well they'll never believe it 
I never thought I knew
Adam in chains
What will they do, when the money runs dry
The end of my affair with the west coast
There's a place
Fools rush in where wise men never go, 
You bring the spring, the summer, fall
So I gotta be, I gotta be, I gotta be 
I lay around in corners
A change is clearly taking place
She got with me 'cause her hubby was a weirdo
I love
Late in the night
But the sheep seem to shower off this office tower
When I get back to the city
Oh, only to wake and hide your face
Because I don\'t associate with fish
Last on my list  and then I quit  to kiss your lips and weep
Ich will dein Alles sein
To slow down this seemingly
You can make it last forever you
And we are leaving some things unsaid
On my way By now
Cars in the distance, a bicycle bell
Concrete girl, don't fall down
The fears are toying with my head
Its way
Your face is full and paved with lines
You count the stars reflecting in the windows
Don't take, don't take, don't break my cut and paste art
They look up without realizing that they're standing right there in the palm of your hand
Some bed of nails I have given you
As we skip the goodbyes
Toasted cob, mustard where we were going I bent, reached
The more I drink the more I wander off
Perhaps I lack some foresight should have known
I been on delivery and received every punch
Makes you want to laugh out loud when you receive it
But now's your chance to shine
And they pretend that they don't see
And you know I'm not coming down
This is how you keep waiting and I don't know why
Nothing will happen and soon you'll be back with me
Possibly years I don't know
Clearly that is something wrong
This ship will still sail on
Every step is moving me up
So come closer baby
Yeah, I'm alright, I'm alright, baby, I'm alright, yeah, I'm alright
And I wish that I could see like everybody can
Jag vill ha han som han är
Lying on the bathroom floor
Dorian will you follow us down
But after each time I'm still glowin'
You tell the stories I need you to tell
By the time you come around
I'm now on a road holding out my thumb
Someone will come
A time when it was true that, love was sweet and innocent
May you find kindness in all that you meet
There's a very big man
She can bite her bottom lip all she wants
I don't ever stay away for you, oh no
But it's just you and me, baby, if you wanna play this game
And I'll sing harmony
Take the road that leads you home
Like I did, you know
Stamp your feet 'cause life's unfair
I wanna pull things up
Jenny pledged Kappa and she started PreLaw
I can't get no relief
Saw the devil's servant, sent her home and new desire
And we can be free
So I'll drive away with all my things
How many smokes till I'm satisfied
Everything you need to see
Caused enough damage
To the one I love
A family man
Feel it wanting me,
Ten feet tall in this an empty space
I hope you'll understand
Find a way to remain
Who knows where
As long as we keep our spirit inspired
But I need a hand to hold on to
You get away from me
Down a Dewar's laugh out loud 
'Cause I feel you, oh, I feel you near me
You can turn me inside out
They're looking at me, all the people to see
Any day now
She smoked her lavender cigarette
Do you know what your fate is
River running black and red
Heart of the country, smell the grass in the meadow
You sit and wait across the gate 
Wer jetzt nicht schläft verfällt der feuchten Träumerei
I've put a spell over you
The eye that always watches us
That said love would end
All of the shit talk
Before I sold records, no promotion
I do a whole lotta lookin'
Made you clothes from insulation
Holding my breath through tunnels, well
May you have may you hold
We can play it nice and cool and keep the pressure off
Were always hard to find
That she passes by the price trying not to steal life
Send it in a letter
I don't doubt it, I feel it
It depends on who's in control
No matter how hard you fight
We'll see if Jah wills that we're alone again
I want your love
Well, bless my soul
The whole time
I just can't work it out
Is making any sense
I'll chase you for the words you owe
The midnight train is awinding low
Guess so, it's starting to, who knows
She clenches and she cries and she lays on the stairs
By the cracks of the skin I climbed to the top
kommen zurück
I've got desperate desires and unadmirable plans
When you alight, mein Lieber
I'll be teardrop in your pillow the beautiful sorrow
I pretended that somehow you'd really stay
Made more sense to him
Invite our friends
But anyway bird
Do you still feel the pain of the scars that won't heal
For the rest of my life
And everything else will follow
I had a black horse you had a grey
To try to throw some light upon the gloom around our bed 
Do you know
You lead me to places that I've never been
I know that I control my thoughts and I should stop reminiscing
You won't control
I should fret if the worst looks like the best
And your mouth never speaks
Sweet time came
How could we get any closer
Saving all the letters you wrote
Bringing fear and reign of terror
I think we'll be alright, I think we will survive,
Give me your hand, it's time
And you'll look to the heavens above
Cut through the country, speed through the dark
Sometimes the city life feels like
Lay down your money and you play your part
This is emotion 
Find a convenient streetlight, steps out of the shade
They stretch before you come inside
Always needs to be mentioned
The door of my motel room
It's falling you feel
The sun sets in your eyes
I'm still young, but I know my days are numbered
Candle is waxing, takes my apartment
Nothing left to ffind when you are down
The things I've been through
That breathing is sexual
But I sit and wait for you I'll wait tonight
I know, I know, I know, I know what to say here
'Cause nothing,
Blind to the gemstone alone
Oh, that's breakin' all in pieces
Oh, my love
I want to be the place you call home
A decade later and another face
Rubs the back of his neck, the stress takes effect
Let's spend the night together
I feel at ease
Is our season over
This soft is raising the softest ceilings
The bottom line
Get you here today
I do not trust my senses to remember your name
Will anyone get close to me
Because when we're drinking we can never be filled
The comfort of fireflies
She looked like a chocolate eclair
Why suffer back in the game
The leaves are falling
The farthest thing from perfect
I'm on my knees can you see me now
Never had an easy love
And they smile when they can as they speak of the man
AND I'll find somebody new and baby, we'll say we're through
Crippled in your arms
There blows a lily fair
Did you imagine you could ever be so strong,
We'll be older in a year
They will all just go away
Together, to be
Your best friend in life is not your mirror
Of course it's long gone down, you're still hanging around
I know if I stay here in this night,
She's never coming back again
She may soon be gone, so don't look back
Got a new sleeping bag
It's Christmastime
We are the crack that was mended
It was a sweet summer's night on Hammer Hill
You keep abreast of all the things you think you should
Don't pay to fight it; can't change the color blue
You would still have my heart until the end of time
Somewhere in the rubble there's a flame
If I forget to set the alarm and sleep on through the dawn don't remind me
I can feel your breath on my neck my love,
And we stayed in our Calvins
This time like every other time I believe that I never find
Hoping to show a soul disturbed that
To warm it up, be wise and be smart
There's nowhere she could sit besides the bed,
When I am done
Bright copper kettles and warm woolen mittens;
Don't you call anybody else baby,
You'd think that we could learn to do it right 
You call it all you want
If niggas only knew the kind of time I was facin'
If God lent his voice to me to speak
Every night is a nightmare
We say no, oh no
And I bet, then you exploded in my heart
No one could ever wait for you
Easy come and easy go, whatever
There are sentences served in a prison I built out of lies
When its time for the shakedown would you take it
You lift up my spirits, you shine on my soul
If we do, there'll be no turning back
As I'll have to already child
A wire away from touching
Es gibt nichts, was Dich am Boden hält bei mir
And on and on from the moment I wake, to the moment I sleep
And gets herself lost
Do you wanna turn back the pages
We could have it back again
La sombra de tu cuerpo y la soledad
Will you come along to the end
I'm a hopeless romantic
We watched as the heat seared through our skin
And I will take the sickness and I'll bury it down
Just shake our heads
Plowmen dig my earth
And it goes fast, you think of the past 
I remember the sting
Between, half the time I'm so dead
Gazing dreamly at the door
Scowling away at nothing
Shattered from the start
To speak the words
Busy talking, busy talking
You're my guy,
Which way to go
But tonight I think I see what it's all about
Before they fell away it seemed to matter all the same
Oh it always, comes back to this
And I will love you
I wish I could stand up and turn around
And I hated that you've gone away so far
I know you're still thinking of me
On this bright spring morning
Won't you come and fix it
You know well
Until her new face changes
If you know my destination please,
Clumsy, unadorned and colourless
Your mysterious eyes cannot help you
You laugh at every word, trying hard to be cute
Against the wall and across the hall
I thought, did someone let go, or did they lose it
One more bad break could bring a fall
Comfortable and warm
You left some words saying now it would be good
We both discovered
Then everything else starts to overflow
Then make a sad face and tell me it's too late
We see the world through identical lenses
Or just something we're both dreaming of
The kitchen floor
Their eyes aglow and seeking heat
You spread your rusty fingers across the ledge
Running like a river white hot with desire
And close on down
But I think it's you in my room
If I could catch my singing bird 
Lo and behold he was standing under the welcome sign
She looks around and around, you know, it makes me sad to see her like that
Shouts to keep it down, wagon draws a crowd 
And when do you think it will all become clear
Lord have mercy on the frozen man
Sinking through dark black holes
Heaven is all remembered
Of the perfect man who may not be you,
Friend of mine
I still know you
Lost one and all
Till darkness came to pull her away
Every little night
I don't know, make it
Cause you been cheating and it hurt me more than you will ever know
Prestame tu piel
How can the light that burned so brightly
Telling all your friends that this love is just made for bleeding,
And yes sir she lookin' so mighty mighty
I only want to lay with you
Watch the flames climb high into the night
Like a pony cart and an old bird bath
Don't make a think about the bad kind
Hey yo, I know of some things that you ain't told me
With what they say and what they do
Pray that it's a Saturday is a better day for me to go on
But this time I'll just have to
Tell me where was you last year
And we need to unplug these dams
I let go
The world has surrendered
It doesn't much matter why
All the things I should have said to you
I'm so full of these endless rhymes
'Cause I saw you
I want to run far from this grey town
The channel numbers change
My brother wander in the tall grass
There isn't anything that you can do
Feel my hands, love, 'cause I'm numb from the neck down
But I can only tell you what I know
Te seguiré queriendo cada día más
Look how she's so serene
You may think I might be crazy
From the right to the wrong settle, settle
She was nobody's nothing
But you can't fly unless you let your
You know they say it's better
Where the air is rarefied
Oh, the preacher's amen
The price that we pay
As good it was, then the magic hour seemed to be fading
Losing all sense of time
But you know that I still love you
Won't let the bastards grind me down
You're acting like a child
You were playing like a devil wearing wings, wearing wings
I want to leave them tomorrow
To live a lie, it really got me all excited
And if they ask what you're doing here, look over at me, baby
I gamble it all away, tumble into fall abased and ablaze
My love for you was strong enough you should've known
Quietly from the ground
The end of the time, they're the end of the line
Those dogs that love the rain and chasing trains
Back to the old house
I'd like to meet a space man, who's got it going on
And who needs please when we've got guns
Lilac Wine, I feel unready
I will wait for you 
Then you take away the starlight, ooh
Some people been known to do it all their lives
We keep on waiting
You're someone else
Climbed on the windowledge
Now the deed is done
Got dirt on your face
Under the waves, I know who I am
Now I'm suddenly aware
Growing up we didn't have a lot of money
I smile and shake my head
Just a slob like one of us
They'll throw opinions like rocks in riots
I'll just sit for a while and sing looli, lailay
You blame for your despair
Distant fathers, fallen warriors
The way light means more than it did all day long
I'll always be with you don't forget
Eric B man looking like touchitheshootme
Since you fall from every throne
They come for Women, weed and weather
In water's full of grace, 'cause only time will tell,
Ne te moques pas, te fous pas, te fous pas, casses pas
What if I was someone different in your only history
He sends cheap thrills, to pay expensive bills
Love, everything's confused harmlessly untrue
Give it away
Gathered to a redbud tree
Refrain
She looks at the rain as it pours
I can't resist you, I can't wait
Flights of grace, and future falls
Remember what you started with
Life's about film stars and less about mothers
The laws of chance strange as it seems
Oh, you poor thing
Try'd to picture it going dow_wow_n
Even when I'm gone
Now I'm right here and I'm right now
I kept on lookin' for a way to take me through the night
A place some say I should go more
You put down that telephone
Now I'm too gone to fight
A million voices scream in my head
And I cry
I'm gone, you're still there
Hey I've flown away
But a memory still haunts at my door
You keep me seeing rainbows in the sky
What lives underneath
She said, "i don't mind
It turned this boy into a man
I want the world to know
But hard to get release
And the smiles can last for days and days
And there's nothing I could do without you here
Like a song
If we don't give her love and affection,
I'm just a question, knowing my answer
Really all I felt was falsely strong
The love I stole from your lips,
Did you understand I don't have a choice
Don't run away
Calloused hands and candle light
It makes you feel old,
A fever comes at you without a warning
From those who are late
The wind changed, the first day that you came through
Out on the street
No other universe but mine
Burned it all down, take me with you
Really need to say, oh
I've looked in the chest where I thought it should be
I did this for you too, you still got me around your finger
In the broad light of day
Dreams, dreams
Carry past the word
Devour me quick, accept my orison
'Cause you're praying way too much
As the sun dropped off the page
And only summer eternal
For I'm a gambler that just wants to lose and be allowed to leave
Tearing my utopian fiction apart as it happens to just pass along
I done hit it from the back, to the melody and rode it slow, now I got to go up in it fast but I'mma finish last
Ooh leave this city behind you
Yet I can never sleep here
You keep me wishing in the dark
Tables and chairs worn by all of the dust
Temptation is in deep now, threads of greed run through this fabric
The one with "I do"
I know how tricky things can be
You want to catch your breath, you want to get out 
I'm tired of fighting
The water's coming round again, maybe you'll be gone by then
This makes me wanna spin
If the stars say that you can not love
Yeah I've found someone
We're living in the wild life
You know I lied, but if it makes you glad
Static every time
All these days
As I lay down beside her
The shadow proves the sunshine
Never, never knew you from the sun
There's no way out
Though you are far away, I know you'll always be near to me
You need good timin'
Immer wieder geht ein Regen nieder
But it doesn't change who I am in my heart if I look like a dime
How did you make me go this far
They'll drink bad wine and they'll eat lemon cake
I would like to move away from it
Mad intervals of mind residuals
Still I know it's gonna happen someday
Like a River
All of them one to one hundred
Let's take a walk down your old street
Some Minnie Ripperton will definitely set this party off right
Everything You are
So we say go
Not today
Digging deeper in my mind
It ain't a land to boast about
My Eveline
But I say Yo sit
Restless little one
But now I'm a man,
This is a movement made of the youth, 
You try your hardest to rewind the tapes
'Cause I'm blind but not as blind as you
When you know I would do anything for you
Yeah, she'll always be the girl from yesterday
Warm days filled with sunshine
Enjoys alone folknocracy
Les yeux sans visage eyes without a face
You're doing better than you know
And we fall asleep, under leaves of a couple of them nearby tress
One second in your presence is a miracle of love
From each part to unfurl
Summer nights
Sometimes, sometimes I wish that life was never ending,
I'm always falling down
Canceling the faces that we knew
C'est un scorpion Il les pique, toutes
Come and lay down your heart on me
Sugar horse, lives inside
There's nothing left for me to borrow
It really works
I wanna be the one who can make you proud
Dancing together at night until two
A party at all
Please tell them that I loved them more than they will ever know
You can sin or spend the night all alone
Used to spend my summer having parties on the drive
Blowing away all of your cares
Be they hope
We were giving on back on all that's left to do
And take your stand
Will you remember 
This relationship, it even got me back to drinkin'
Telling you when you're asleep,
And this is the truth, and the truth I declare,
Confident and blind
But I can't shake this, and I don't know why
It haunts me in my waking dream
I wanna stand up and walk on my own feet
Lonesome brothers
I grow a space suit in the blink of an eye
Stepping out into the light
Judy's fantasy has come
And I know I can't be found 
Cigarettes and a headband
You'd be outside waiting by the road 
But if you gotta go
Is fading away like tears in the rain
Rain washed out its glow, heart beat steady leads me down below
Com olhos de verão
Where flowers turning crane their fragile necks
I remember the good times when you loved me so
Summer thunder on moonbright days
Just keep on trying actually what she really said was
Never will, never will
First left my woman, it was down in Santa Fe
Into the wilderness
Until we came back down
Tell me, if we sleep together
Held on strings
A poison victim, look of steel
About everything you can't understand
You wouldn't get it
The first day that I met you
I faced a star, my heart and hands
I see numb empty faces
Time to step lightly
Do you notice me at all
And I'm thinking about the needle
If you want to buy a brand new fancy automobile
We'd make ashes of our clothes
Even in your arms I know
A rush of memories washing over me
Look at all these people
It stays late to clean up my mess
I do bheatha sa tús, sa deireadh,
Ghosts settle on You
And I heard of that Japanese girl
And when the cold wind's blowing
Looking out at endless snow
Through the window of my eyes
That bliss comes at a price
So I can forget it easily
No, I'm not that kind of whore but I am a little Lord
It boils and boils and leaves you dry
I forget the mallets from the lessons that I went to
Whatever happens to me,
And as you walk through death's dark veil
I wanna introduce myself to you
You know we'll be getting some getting jiggy just for fun
And it's too late to get on
Have a car and a nice girl too
Let's do it serpentine, I don't mind
It has written in my soul
So the bartender who tends to pretend that he's concerned
That old devil sent
Your way you get out of this mess
If you can work some magic, we can double our paychecks, so make the s look right
Swept back to all the grief and the worry
To be moving Moving Moving my way home
You want what's mine but you don't deserve it
Gently, children
He pulls on a coat of new born skin
My mother told me just before she died,
And I stare out this dirty window Stare out this dirty window
Of the one who is sweeping
Never die, never die, never die
Bring just your fire
But you should know this girl
Goes street to street to street
You wait for summer
An endless sigh I cannot hear
He's tryin' to make His way home
The supermarket, Christmas time 
She wants to rest, she can't till we have
We can all be free
So large, people thought my windows
E aquele sentimento de amor eterno
He fought them all the way though
Friends not lovers
Collected it all in my coat
You come to realize
My hands clench the squeegee, my secular rosary
I can't seem to find my way
Tell me more of the very soul, look alike, look alike
The sun will rise
Like a baby, stillborn
Sure as the setting sun
And time is come and gone
I wonder what we could have been
The love I hold is older than the sky we lay under
But I won't fade away
Some things are hard to remember
As if anticipating when they'd be allowed to caress
Don't write my name on a stone
Clareira azul no céu
I heard it's modern to be stupid
mi corazón roto ha venido, me habla y dice
Dreaming while awake
Leaving the central state from shallow ground
Like I want your flowers
You've been dead a long time but you refuse to accept that shit
Every time it's the same
For all the world can see
Sometimes she says
But even though we miss our friends
How low no one would know
You see we should start
It did float my soul along for awhile
And I can see it in your face
'Cause in my head
And when the moon is high and bright,
Don't lose faith
And I let them pass by
That's your choice, no one can stop you
Knew they were some millionaires, their ropes were dookie
That a brief taste of love is as sweet as any
To hand in his heart and take his last vacation
You were so clever
Would it be different if we knew we would win
Boy the way home will fade and be so hard to find,
Don't go looking for him lady yeah
And then I knew
Do you know where your heart is
Jesus the Mexican boy, wearing a long desert trip on his tie
At how we could gather knowledge
Up and down the spine
Come fly with me, let's take off in the blue
Where a man only lives to die
The things you hide, what you don't say
Me keksimme rakkauden
His last words were
I used to fly 
And I try to pick a fight
I returned a paler blue bird
Bet you thought you'd hide from me, didja
Ooh, once I got you in the mood
And then from somewhere deep inside you
I've come a long way to just fold back into line
And just a little bit of rain
Like brothers on a hotel bed
Open your mouth
If she don't tell you then she never has to change it
Let me hold your hands
Like to handle with the lights on all night
You and me have the cherished love
'Cause we don't wanna hide no more
You ever wonder what we could have been
And you won't come home again
But what when your fields are all rotten, your waves of grain, amber waves of grain
Her hair falling all around me
And you know who I am
Take your coat off when you know
Your heart is worn and the seams are torn
Closer than anyone
Cause it feels like static when you're here
With limp arms I can feel most of you
He packed his things, walked out the door and drove away 
It feels like we are falling awake
Now I'll never have a chance
In the book of my life
A wildcat did growl
Break the barrier of sound into the sky
That always bring you down
Dressing in silence for nothing to lose
So stay where you are
In one hand I've a Bible
Was here from the start
Saying I'm gonna change
To let them go silent into the ground
Maybe it's all right,
Please make no mistake I'll be there too
That one day ill find a way
It's TIP, you know
How dare you
I guess it's only right
que pasé junto a ti 
When I'm trying to keep my head above your charm
Oh brother, will you let me in again
You probably thought I had more upstairs
His bitterness shows it's side
And I see fire burn auburn on the mountainside
Didn't know, didn't know, didn't know,
He took a plane across the sea 
Act like big city kids when the sun goes down
Well across the fractured landscape
Look for ways that I can tell you
To watch them thin down to dust
Cut the corn, washed it clean
I'm alone for our last goodbye
Take me to live inside the truth
No one else take my place
And I'll become, as a girl
I'm here in the protectorate, the fear I held was delicate, to
No reason or rhyme, no presence of mind
And I'll come back to you
Lilac wine is sweet and heady
I wasn't around, you stayed in tonight
Mietit miten lopettaa
Have you ever been to North Point
My heart was wrapped in clover
I know this something is here goes
Watch the world go twirling by
Just wanted to be one of you
Trains and winter rains
Nocturnally helpless
As I've dreamed of you
Swims through your eyes
Waiting in the silence; if you won't spill your heart
They mean nothing to you
Black Talons start flyin, when a nigga flip
Used paperbacked living bible
No, I don't think time is gonna heal this broken heart
Nothing left to find when you are down
Just shine, shine, shine
A strange kind of love
Heaven surrounding you
I'll wear my sword at my side x
Still sang your songs that felt our songs just right
Do you know this change of hope covering their eyes
Could I put my hands up
Pressed up on the wall
If you will come all the way down with me
I wish I could say what words won't amount to,
All I've got left is the taste of salt in my mouth
A single furtive reason
The ladies all want sweet perfume
The river is deep and the ocean wide
You should have known,
I made it all end
Generally we are a lonely people
Blossoms in her lover's arms once more
This shit is hard
You made me feel beautiful 'cause you believed I was
Do our ways converge
Thank you for not letting go of me when I let go of you
Then if my heart should somehow stop
I don't mind
New York City, took me with the tide
Deeper, deeper, deeper relax
And I know we haven't said enough
Don't you run away, don't you run away, don't you
But I don't know, my nights are cold
Wanderlust
Todo verbo que é forte
And when you're in the moon
Feel a breeze of a new beginning
Reminding us how far we've come
Barking dogs and model planes
Now some of us are weak
You did your best to change that
Are home and they know
Driving home, the sky accelerates 
Know your name
Memories got spilled without shame
And it only weighs you down
And when I set my eyes on you
Break your back to feed it
And mentally puts her back together
And hoped she'd understand
The way I might've changed my mind,
Just let yourself sink into the groove
From the stars in the sky to the ocean floor the world is yours
Mistakes I can't defend
Don't count on anything
Too young for the worst of my mind
Help but wonder
Those bangles that I paid for long ago
Cause my mouth just won't work right today,
Fell in love with everything
I want a horse, I got a sheep
It's something that I'm supposed to be
I said, "Please don't lie
I'm coming home to Arizona
I see what's in your mind
It's something that's neverending,
Soft and warm, continuing
Even though that night you flipped on us
He's got a goldplated ceiling and a TV show
What a day I have had
I'll find my best friend
And as your senses dull
Will I ever be free
Madison Avenue's claim to fame in a trainer bra with eyes like rain
I forgot to mention
And scented lotions
Ooh oohooh, oohooh ooh ooh
Watching all the ground beneath you drop
They roll their eyes and they call you crazy
My eyes look distant like you never really knew me
Liverpool or Rome
So it goes and so it goes and so it goes slows your mind mind mind mind mind
And we're making our weather with a lone lifeboat
Sometimes it snows in April
They can try but they can't take that away from me
"Don't wait for me now"
As they crumbled into dust and washed into the sea
It's my hidden hope that you are still among them
To relax and unwind
Baby, I'll be falling
To have one and one make two
And I don't think I ever heard you speaking
And I remember you there
We got the money, we got the money, we got the money
And even though I'm right behind you
If I was wrong or right
You'll stand proud, face upheld
Excuse me while I disappear
Different for everyone I see
And God bless you in your travels, in your conquests, and queries
Save it for a little while
Have you ever felt you ever want to kill her
The sun never shines
Only I don't know how they got out, dear
Don't be unhappy can't remember when
She said my pasta was delicious, bit repititious
Show me the way
The most fragile of things
Awake all night worried for
A heavenly host
Who needs a friend when God's on your side
And all the ways I got to know
Looks a lot, doesn't need it
And I trust that you love me too
They both slowly stood up and climbed off her hands
And I'd run to find you anywhere at all
Oh, you lost it but you don't know how
Time won't wait
So they can in turn reach up and kiss the sky
Take you to another place
We look like everybody else
Would leave you alone
But though you're still with me
Goodnight Georgie, goodnight Grace
As everything falls on me
'Cause we hurt each other once before
Whenever you're around
God grant me the strength to accept the things I can change 
As if they were caught or something mmmmmm
'Cause the stars in the sky, and the fashion that they are aligned
You make it look so easy, baby
Mais mon corps s'ennuie
When do I call my feelings on their bluff
Fly away on your silver wings
You never, never need to part
But your road is yours to tread
Ja, Fredrik är gammal men kärlek är blind
I gotta really try
And how we stayed awake all night long
But if your eyes are wide
I get the space in between
You're still here in my heart
You are the one who forgets
I only need you to be friends with me
We looked, so we found
That we'd never be apart again 
And my eye on the street
Her welcome like her love for me
My memory's a broken machine
There are so many reasons to keep us apart
Let's aim high, girl
Everything I do, I'm gonna think of you
Before the heavens crack open
I don't doubt that everything is what you gave me
But I'm trying to get her back
But don't let her go
And your hair smells of smoke
As ondas vão e vem
Put a snake on my neck and a bird on my arm
Given up, it's over
But I wanted them both
Some new place I said, not this place I've been
I need your patience and guidance
Sugar, we can come alive inside your dreams tonight
When you come down
We don't need to escalate
And you talkin' 'bout her family, her aunts and shit
I hope this heartache of mine won't get any worse
This place I see, just doesn't look familiar
I'll find the strength somehow
And I ought to be on my way right now
Mais mon coeur aussi
For better or worse, our history is too real to hate
And I know I know they're threatening
Clearly I hear your voice
Cause there's more for you to see than when you see me on the scene in my
I wanna call you again
She thought too late and spoke too soon
What's done is done
Candy says she wonders why we try
That my shadow days are over
I'm not a child I know, we're not going steady
And wonder why you fade
I feel it, I feel it
Yeah, freedom's mine and I know how I feel
You tell me what you want and I'll tell you what you get
Imagine the wind in your hair
Backhand, role reversal
Mmm, we may not know the reason why
I thought I would know when the planets had aligned
Another fool would dig the broken car out from the snow,
God knows
And his pain meant nothing to me
I'm not sure that I want to
She feels that she has nothing left to prove
So I made up my mind
Over this before
Just another red light x
The shadow has a dream where
From a careless word that I said
Bring the rhyme
But life is not tv
I can keep a secret if you can keep me guessing
So I look in your direction
But it says so much about us
I wish you would hang up and turn around
I've had you so many times 
The shape of your elusive arms
And what she sees she can't believe
All lightning bright and thunder loud
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations, 
Now you know I'd hate to come over obsessive,
Cause you know I believe in you
Since you've been around
That's all I need, that's all I need
You're a drunk and you're scared
But painting's creating, and I'm just erasing
Jus show me where to sign
Once upon a summertime just like today
I've got to say that it is kind of funny 
Take this feeble mind
We went Beyond where we should have gone
mikä ikinä tuliskin nii
The ties are not undone
And the EssDog waits tables and he sold his guitar
'Cause it's a battle when you dabble in war
So I set the child in me on fire
Nobody's sunny all the time
"Turn into stone," I knelt to the Hobo;
Still here in my heart
And all I know is that I just don't know
Are you changing, are you changing, are you changing
Nun ich muss es leider brechen
Even then I must have known 
Saviors always say
And I wanna sing to you, oh
So when the dice came out at the bar downtown
Never said it was good, never said it was near,
I'll just sing for you
Will I ever learn
Lies in the hands that set me
I was younger once
You look so beautiful in this light
Well, ten thousand tears passed by
And I'll get there soon
Friendship strong and true
Those kind of cars don't pass you every day
I discovered that a heart is lame
Outside there is a pain
And I know there's so much
Let's just turn the whole damn thing upside down 
And I do believe it's true
Left me stranded, and took away my pride
You can slow this down
So write them in the sand
Got all the words to keep on hoping,
It was like she was a bootleg
Planet starting to lift up over ours
Oh, beautiful son, smiling light, good morning son, sunshine
Stay sick together
So far away and so alone 
Its building a prison
You've surpass all my fantasies and
Spillin' on the floor
But the old flame ignites when we part
Oh, but all I know, is all I know
Bleibt zurück in der Vergangenheit
Living with the price of a world of sorrow
I'd like to dedicate this song to anyone who done ever lost somebody
You think you're bad but I'm badder than you
Well the cause of it's a lesson learned
And baby there's me to make you undone
Fuck my everyday
It's all right, it's OK, because the night is just another day
I'm living in a home in the heart of the country
Is calling out your name
I think I need a big vacation
The other details are inventions
It's you or none, my damaged one
Like apples from a wild tree
And remember though love is strange
While I was in between
You made it to the dark, now you're gone
'Cause you're still around,
Ride the only one who knows
It's all I need
I'm moving on, I don't even know her
Telling you to never look back
Maybe it's about the perfect place
The alligator from getting up
For a better life
Unfettered beast inside
So light and so easy
A smile, if you dare ah
She was mine
Ricevo il tuo contrordine speciale
Ooh ooh, oh oh, oh oh oh
Words are spoken
I couldn't tell right from wrong; where is this all coming from
Just to get back in
Pra viver só de amor
I don't wash and I don't comb
When the song is over
There's a hole in the sky
It could bring joy, it could bring sorrow
And we'll pretend
I guess I'll go chase some memories
When the last fish the last tree are no more
And we fall through fate
Tha missing piece to the puzzle, the grind, the hustle
There was this book I read and loved
Sunny skies weeps in the evening
You killed the feeling but the pain's still alive
I don't know where we are headed for
I'll stay up all night to hear about your day
Away from her, alone she'll die
Got you looking at the glist on my hands and wrist
Found sorrow in my mind most times
From my seat I see the fields move by
The world is yours
We can deja vu backwards, baby, make it seem like a trip
'Cause I do love you
And say that we tried
A radio in tune with the sky
But I somehow arrived
I thought I'd never see
You always found the words to say
I won't forget all that I've done
That I won't die for some time
Now forget how it felt when this shit move slow
True colors, true colors, true colors are shining through
Sometimes we talk all night long, we don't shut up
I really like it, this rock and roll
You know how I do it, Concords on my toes
Baby, cast your eyes
All the people you press against
A tiny little worlds that tickles your ear drum
Won't stand a chance
Yellow girls are running backwards
Rattled till it stopped
Works the web like no other, gotta put him on the map
Minutes later we came back
All I know
Sometimes I'm lost
Bless the day he came to be
I breathe the masculine scent of his skin
Goodnight, goodnight, goodnight
My file has been deleted
Why don't I love you like I used to do
Late at night your footsteps
And showed me why she never took some time with a man
By the river
Reality starts to settle in, you're sweatin every wake up
We used to go
The righteous 
You will never waste my time
As I suspend my breath
I close my eyes to see
Of what you want to say to me
To make sadness invisible, suffering a figment
That IIIIII wanna be your man
'Til we die we won't be forgotten, we'll never give in
Throwin' out the lifeline
If I could bottle up the sea breeze I would take it over to your house
And if you watch a girl watch her, girl
Everybody else just arrived,
Silver strings spun a gentle song the gentle song
I have lost control
We want you to know we feel better, we won't have to worry anymore
On Sunday morning
Can't even tell me what of me you need
Pure inside enough to see
The best kisser that I ever knew
And I can't taste anything less
For the cute, cute, cute ones
Did they forget the light inside your eyes
And the rugged wheel is turning another round
And mark a place in time for every chance you took
Don't just let life pass you by
You don't give that soul, no no no
Oh, no, you didn't have to laugh that way
Il a six domiciles fixes
But suspected I would end up back here
I'm gonna tell you I love you one more time
Might not be such a bad idea if I never, never went home again
Not all good things come to an end
Didn't amount to anything
You live within the sense
Zwei Stunden später, ich hört das Telefon
One thing is for certain I'll BE HERE for you
Everybody sees
Este e um sonho estranho
Under the waves, down in the deep
A sober straight face gets you out of your clothes
Ist jeder Club die Manege
In his eyes
A sun in your hands from the middle life
Swaying like the children
And overspilling my runneth cup
Wawawawawawanna comprehend
Ich verliere meine Antlitz
And so today, my world it smiles, your hand in mine, we walk the miles
And now, there's nothing left to hide
It'd be nice to go out drinking with you
I've got this one fresh second, one fresh minute, one fresh hour of my day
Pictures are pasted on shop windows and walls
I thought we were doing fine with our lives
I alone am returned to tell thee
Now if all my golden moments
There's a piece of a puzzle known as life
Find a love a just because I need you, so much
They've got the lights down now
And I love the lies you've told to me
In the darkest of places he gets his thrills
It's always the same
Or the weight of the seven seas
Occasionally glancing up through the rain
That my friends is where I wish I was
Go down that road
He feels the power of the past behind him
She in the coupe, she in the Neon 'cause she on the BS before we can start
I met her in a Kingstown bar
What goes in my mind, its contagious
And I know when I'm older the only running gonna come
Me quedaré sin nada, si te vas
You're my wonderwall
We will find me a whoring
I live a life of the simple kind
But I feel as if I've never had a crush before
And make you fell all right
Hold the thought
Because you took it all away and, you're paralyzing me
Da wurden sie füreinander zur Medizin
Snowwhite ferocity
For my bones have found a place to lie down and sleep
It's a new dawn
There on the cricket's singing stone
And so deceiving is the clouded heart
While I'm smoking on a B, dippin' through the streets
We could have danced all night
Nepalese, antifreeze, calories, can't you see
Hoping the cold would kill the smell of angry gin,
Juergen lives in Munich, that cozy comfy town
It doesn't stop at night
You pushed me so hard, that I feel so insane
In something that's never leaving,
I'm just chasing me my time
Follow the mountains
You drank all the water and you pissed yourself dry
They fall short for the most part
Stuff regarding all my friends
So he sits back at his desk
We dare to breathe
From another dream
One of these days I'll give up
There's no need to be so terrible
I put my pride on the line
Faces change, the names they are familiar
You know we don't really love one another
Where is the dream for which I paid dearly
Things must change
On that night from the balcony
I feel, I feel, I feel, I I I feel
I've been lonely when I'm with you
I didn't mean to leave you all alone
I looked across the lake's surface
And I, I will follow, but I'll never fall in
My lonely days are over, and life is like a song
A weekend in a weekdays shoes
And he calls me moonlight too
Then all of a sudden I'm fine and everything's all right
And thinkin' 'bout you in the night
I have your name print tattooed upon my skin
Little fella wanted to know
Mojique sends the package to the American man
And mine they spy out cautiously
Lets start living life before we die
Now, if we had the power
That makes you alive
I be living in the sky every time I ride by them hoes
Technicolor girls are always on the phone
Your love, brings me sunshine
Get help
I could fly you away with me
Cause you don't want to feel you are alone
She says oh well oh well you'll do just fine
The day is always so bright
Swano
How long 'til you're gone
I know that I don't have too long
You won't survive just because you're idle
Walking back towards your house
Whisper a quiet tune
In your eyes I see the shame
That even to physically exist is sexual
And it'll buy you a place on the lowery side
And it was too late then to run and hide
Can change the way that you see me
Who are trying to bury me
But I still wanna please you
Your name used to taste so sweet
Can't stop a river, when it's burst it's banks
And her time was to come Called to her son 
Feels like the world has passed away
So your heart is warm for ever more
From which he says "I miss you so"
Forever will be the shortest time
Study at the dock where the schoolgirls flirt
So long next time
There beside yourself, choking on tears
My mom's gotta find a way to get a job
Ce mec est un playboy
Faces under water
Hey, I wanna crawl out of my skin
Gone I'll be gone
Keep changing your mind
Did you know you could last this long
You know I love you, though I can hardly say
For several years now
You see what you believe
I'll carry on, I'll carry on
So wind your watches down, please
Honk your horn, put down your windows, push yer button
My soul is saved, I see city lights
Oh, if I knock on your door would you let me in
Don't he know he could only get as high as he fell
'Cause all our days are just so many waves in the wind,
Wave goodbye, I know that I'll believe if you spell it out for me
Oh, sweet Mary of silence
But they're all too busy to go into town
"So that's you, singing and selling"
Like furniture that I find on the street
Ground had arose and passed its knees
Each drop of rain 
Don't get me wrong, I know you've got your life in place
Anyway I think leave days 
Whenever I get lonely
Outside, awake
I cook crack in the microwave, niggaz can't fuck with me
So, I'm changing my plea
But the noontime makes me tired
And deliverance has many faces
So I'd always find my way back
More than we need
Build a little stronger castle in the air
I know the words, I know the sounds
Pushed you aside when you entered
It helped me realise
But some that do, lay claim
Then I know it had to be long ago
Been here time before, and it wasn't real
Olden times and ancient rhymes
Screw the universe
So when I'm suffering through some awful drive
'Cause I've been left up in love before,
Thinkin' that life has left them dry
In our hearts and in our soul
Lets walk away from this hell
To put this into words
Oh I'm gonna take it all away, baby
For the cute ones
Also my partner Bankhead, , what it is, nigga
That's the place where we used to play
Excusez moi my angel eyes ain't here
Where to stand
Call me when you get
But I know you don't deserve to be broken
And all your fears
'Cause I swear and
The river is deep and the road is long
Of the high pressure area
I follow the tracks
I understand I'm just a fan
Times I remember
It's time to go
We have not talked for so long
No I don't need you to save me
Who knows 
Only you can slow this down
We didn't
Bring me out of this shell
Like I get the poetry in motion
And I claim I'm not excited with my life anymore
Listen to me what I have to say,
A desert around me
Of its pieces on the floor
I won't betray your trust because I'm
My mind is racing like clouds across the sky 
Exciting and new, shameful and true
And don't forget that you called it all bullshit
But the sadness in your eyes won't go away
Kvarten för ensam, stan för svår
We brought us down
Stainless steel between the fingers, straighten
You don't know how to ease my pain, you don't know
até amanhã eu vou ficar
Sing me that song
This is the place where I felt
Take a look around now
In a blue light
And the place from where you watch us now
Do you dance the light Fandango
Waitin' for a call from my family
Common and Gil ScottHeron
With ten, wide, safe, stairs
Me with your mobile phone
Let us revisit the past
And I wanna pull things up
Sugar, always
Such a beautiful view with a long way to fall
Today I said goodbye
And I'm thinking ooh I can't live without you
And the same Berkeline recliner
Säg var det för det Fredrik Åkare sa
I still can't believe you're gone
To your heart was the only part
Sound as if my parents had a fight,
And you know me, in my s and my gold teeth
The pressure will make you feel
You let her win
Off came those awful toe rings
I can teach you how to sing and dance
I know there's someone
The pain and the sorrow that you felt
Until she's had her way with you
Our signs, our water slides
No never again
But you make it too hard
The concrete broke your fall
It's in my job description,
Concentric circles
And no one else
To tighten the rope so that you never will forget
But how will you know if he's kind
I don't try to move along
While the present shatters all around you
Shined with everything we were living for
I know it hurts to hear,
That I ever read
The social strain is watching you out with all your friends
That you're free to be any person
Closed the hatch up with one hand
Such sad eyes
If you're out of time,
I look around me and feel you are ever so close to me
Where bodies are indecent
So is it all right if I go
You are mine
Ah Juliet, when we made love you used to cry
Into the fade out line
But all that I know is it's gonna happen
Here's my list of all the things I should have said and done
And still you look down on the teenage dad on
Where hope had lured by the thousand
So much for running
Oh oh oh yes they do, they do, believe me
Everything rises, going at it all
So you know that when they shine
I wish I was in you
Move How I move
And I'm only halfway sober
What do you know
I will admit I almost always underestimate it
Too far away
And the sun no longer shines
The water is wide
You'll always be my silent valentine
There's too many of you crying
If we can't stop taking
Now I know where I once saw you
Look at the blue skies gone gray
I dance with the wind I flow into your dreams
No I don't know how to live
I hear children singin'
I know you're said them a  times before
It's my whole life in words
Never took no advice
One two, one two
To make sense of the signs
So it falls apart
That almost made you cry
An' all you knew
No way to speak
Staring down the barrel of a 
A heart gets caught inside ones thoughts
Speaking freely
Nothing has transpired
And I've got some things
seh wie Du bist und wie wir sind
Find a way to tell you that I want to let you go
No longer ill at ease with the crazy people
I can't believe that our trains didn't even slow down
Never ever figured, Lord
You to be with somebody else
You seem illiterate to all my emotions
And our first goodbye always seemed like hours
The warning signs have all been bright and garish
In the weak last gasp of the evening's dying light
A tinkling piano in the next apartment 
The music's true
Wooden floors, walls and window sills
The last night on Maudlin Street
E aquele juramento de amor eterno
The mood subsides
It's like a pain locked in a part of your heart
Could be feathers and down
My job's simple
For a Summer day
And faces
Skies stare
Bullseye hung on your soul
Here to face the fortune and the bile 
You know these words 
Head against a window
Oh, look who it is
It's only father feathers
And I don't know if I can do this alone
In the ancient sea that night
Open up till midnight
Vase left a perfect ring
You're not the type they can capture, you flit like a fly catcher
Back with snow even sun
And I can feel you in every single bone
Roll the film without the love scene
If you should wake to find you're abandoned
The whole slew blossomed beautifully,
Flies so high and sings so good
It felt easier to touch
You take a walk on Bleak Street
Por encima de todas tus otras cosas, me gustan
And you still buy a daily newspaper
Send away for a priceless gift
And we fell down low
But baby please don't say we're through
Anticipate our first touch
For all the times I never
I've been runnin'
She's my butterfly She's my butterfly
Each time a curtain opens
This pipe and these needles are my only guide
Wouldn't be the first time love made a fool of me
I come in peace
Now that we spread our wings
Now my door has swollen from the rain
If he's out on a date then her life's in ruins
But please come soon
I wanna see you born
Oh when the cold wind blows
I got a perfect set of blue prints
No one can see inside of me
And for my missing heart, I carve one out of wood
He feels the presence of the wind beside around him
Every drop
The time has come
Run for cover, hide beneath an avalanche
Now I'm standing here alone too late to cry
You broke the locks, I grabbed on to you
Here in the dark I made for you
But wondering why we travel so far
Anger steaming up your glasses, you've been holding parties all your life
Just to let this go
I'm falling apart with every beat of my heart
My home, my friends and you
You'd laugh and run away
Give me a boat that can carry two
I am here and I will be forever and ever
Like a bad tempered prom queen at a homecoming dance
Sewn to the sky
Fink I'll grab some magazine 
Quiet nights and desperate love
Have to meet the sun and moon and
Just when all the bills are due
All I wanted was to impress you
Snowflakes that stay on my nose and eyelashes;
These graces that hold me
Did you know you're so beautiful
You can say it's night or day
Was playin' on the radio
Do you understand
The sun is out and up and down again
She won't stay for long
Get through the days, do your thing, do it well
Harlem river I'm in love love love love
Ain't it funny how we pretend we're still a child
That's what you want, but it's not what you're asking for
You go east for those real green eyes
I'm sick and tired of all of your sob stories
Where all people live in peace
A move, a glare
When I finally get it figured out, I've changed the whole damn plan
Yeah, he said it was a one night stand
Of the world from your shoulders
azure ideal, spirit
She is shaking out static anonymity sha la la la, sha la la la 
Please don't say a word
And when faced with dull and dutiful
Canyons mighty walls
With your face painted on to your friends,
And how my dreams they let me down
I used to think time, was on my side
The one I miss forever
Bound to be let in
I took a river and felt so slight so hold on
I have bread and I have wine
The blood of the pretty bird
My sweet sweet heartkiller
Can't begin to see my future shine as yet
But I've come home
I saw the sky in you
He wants to show us how
Leveled home
Of beautiful lies 
Once we wanted nothing and everything was new
I'm kneeling down 
Oh my love
But sweetness alone who flew out threw the window
I said angel of mercy I'm alive or am I dead
I hope I see you on the other side
Man my code name, they called me chef boy r 
Take care, please, take care
And the ground is hard
So haul away 
And tumble into any open arms
Learn how to use them, then abuse them, and choose them
Look at us now together
Double feature, you will survive last forever so rest your eyes
Share your bodys health
And by the design they shalt not kill
The new age now
Knowing that you'll always be
There is no real reason to accept the way things have changed
I can watch the sky turning grey
No one told me
Backbeat, the word was on the street
You must have loved
Don't know these emotions
Now here we stand
It's very treasure, just in case
Stay till the morning and the world just might get by
Put your hands on me, my love
But something keeps me hanging on something keeps me hanging on
Coming round to you late at night
It's lame because it fell above the needs of this
I get to record demos at attempts to blow
My attends to you
If your scared just think of me
With nothing but this girl
My premonition hits hard as our start is apart
I fell asleep on your cobweb
The faster you drive, the less you can feel
Everything else will follow,
Whenever I'm empty, you make me feel whole
I don't know what you're carrying
Please don't let me down this time
Seven miles above the earth, 
Die Antwort liegt in dir,
It's blown apart by the wind blowing by
Empty and cold 
Big dreams of elegance
This king among men
The piece that I represent compliments each and every one
I am, I am, I am, I am not afraid because
Now I hear your widow crying
The old times make way for the new
My last transmission down the drain
I want to make much of Your love
One of the reasons I looked up to him crazy
And It must have been an hour
All the birds keeping singing
I dreamed that I saw my girl Susanne
And you can make it last forever
So why don't we just walk along the shoreline with our silent song
All he carries is his pride, he has nothing to his name
Did you know that you could be wrong
Through your weary head
I've been skipping like a stone
Well Daniel says it's the best place that he's ever seen
I thought I made that loud and clear
sólo son sin albedrío
Don't make, don't make, don't make a joke of my heart
Do you really know
Oh you look so pretty
Until the girls all take their clothes off
But you don't know me
No new friends, no no no
For the boy I love dearly lies in farmed Waterloo
e sî's ie wurden gevvar, 
Would wait
Eggsroll 'em over and a package of Kents
We may fall apart
When there's nothing I have ever seen
Härjar ute mitt i natten, vad han gör det vete katten
I swam with sharks and beasts of the sea
And you know I was just a kid
Put on your spurs, swagger around
I have never reached such heights
I feel overwhelmed and still your here
Fills the alleys where men sleep
These flowers are coming up wild
They interview the people who are authorities
Threw his watch away
Now I've been worrying about your feelings, yeah, they were worth protecting
Who took a homemade, fan blade, oneman submarine ride
The honesty of love
Like sap rising or honey or tar
And knock the wind from one last urge
Still smell the rain, distance aside
But I'm not too sure just what to say
What you get is what you had to give away
The one thing I refuse to fake
There's nothing more deadly
Move it up, move it up, move it up, move it up
Red light crazy shining
When there's no water to wash the burning sun from your eyes,
It takes some cold to know the sun
It named me as the fool who only aimed to be
I'm gonna make the most of this day's plans 
The crew of crows fly the skulls and bones
From all around the world for the women, weed and weather
And as you move on, remember me
Grown ups don't know
In the end you've got a friend for lifetime mhmh
It's been a long time
Just the way we are I guess you've seen it now
Was a turning point  so many things there to learn
That special kinda' lady
Swept away
You're in your white limousine,
But you laugh in the middle that you've made it
Back in the light
Tu n'imagines pas qu'elle l'épie, qu'elle le guette
Nothing is so easy
To stay in Grand Hotel
On the loneliest cloud in the sky
It's never gonna leave it unless you start
It resonates inside my soul
Don't fall over
And you'll awake
Save your days I don't save days 
Or night,
You don't know
It's in my body language, read me
In strange ideas, we live apart
Sunshine, come and help me sing
I'm always yours
To make love out of care
To mine their freedom out
I'll tear out your heart"
Täällä ilman sua ei oo mitään, ei ilman sua tuu mitään
Drive your car until you see
It's right behind me
These words in shadowplay
And we live another day
And we don't put enough emphasis on the ladies sometimes
I guess I could waste all my time and my money
Deep in my heart, that's where the knot comes loose
But I'm holding down and out
Sixteen candles burn in her mind
But it's your image burnt into my mind
Someday I know I'll keep myself
Virá ou ela me espera
And when you're dreaming
Some old hotel room in Memphis
Passando por la
But it ain't how I live while I'm here
And you know how much I need you
And it goes fast, you think of the past 
There's not enough years underneath this belt
Look much closer when they appear
Now, there's a few things,
Well, future is diminished by what today we did
Like a pendulum
It's a silent murder
Like babies want God's love
We were kicking around
They release you then you turn to see
I got nothing I could leave
And the old trunk was just illusion
But I thought you might
When I will come to you
mikä ikinä tuliskin, älä pysäytä musiikkii vaa
When the knight waits in the laurels
I have it, I'll never pass it, I work my magic
And take your heart and make you mind
Tu verses le sang sur mes vers blancs nonpluricellulaires
And I don't know
'Cause I had on my headphones 
I wanna rock you in my arms all night long
Maybe I'll change
I have called your name, I've an idea
The youthful boy below
I struggle to breathe
You were there and I was was with you
I like you more when you don't make a sound
I've got a taste for it
A part of me
I know next to you is not where I belong
W te cholerne ziwioletnie dni
Just like before when I was a child
He let slip away
The world is so pale next to you
The universal man
Go games and adult education
On his estate
The summer is over
Believing all the lies
I thought about following any of these ships to the end of their journey
Do I drink my rivers, drag my feet, and drown in my dreams
See you is my new chick, so we get our grind on
And the memories of a life I wish we'd lived
I pray that we will stay the best of friends
So I lie lonely surrounded by you by you
Everything he's done for me
Es regnet und wieder eine Nacht
Take your time
Than what we're living for,
Yeah, the summer count can come
You are my moonlight, ohooh
Running around the circles in the night
All my friends
Every night
Somos dois contra a parede e tudo tem três lados
But you always will be the only one
All I ever wanted was to stand beside you
Cause you say you see straight through me, don't you
When you look around I couldn't be found
All I see scares me
She wants to get near to you,
There are times I can leave my heart wide open
And you can't help but think
How can we ask for the brightest cities every night midnight 
It's like the glory days, it's like a fortune sold
But that day ain't yet come
From which this living near can be exempt
They stand beside me and all that I am
I'm just the hope
And find the words we'll sing in time
This prelife crisis, is killing me
But these wrinkles masterfully disguise 
When they turned all their bones, changed to stone
May we meet again in another life
Gave me a card with a lady naked on the back
So kiss me like you wanna be loved
Boarded a train bound for Vegas and married secretly
Yeah, you'd sing along, you'd sing along
He's always wanted to write, that's all he's wanted in life
Let me love you
But you don't want it, no
Crawls back into bed
But you already know that because you used to crawl in bed with me in the morning before work
I don't want you
I try to believe in anyone look at the state I'm in
Those special things
For you I know I'd even try to turn the tide
Surprise, I can see it in your eyes
I saved you hours of therapy
To wake you is all we got
When I thought that I was strong
But all this time, I been chasin' down a lie
But we'll do our jobs till we break down and fall 
Building new rulers
Im Silberweidenpark
I hope you're singing now
In my life the piano sings
Well, it's your misfortune that sweetens my song
Come morning light
It plays a trick on me and it seems to fool us all
I'm waking up gonna buy me some shoes
I'm gon' be around
A kind of delight
Break it, the creed is all we got until we meet again
The sweet flower that they both seemed to hunger sweet flower
The calendar was the saddest thing
Could be the biggest mistake that a man can make,
Still a baby in your hands
No way, no way, no way, no way, no way
She ran until her feet refused to hold
I simply remember my favorite things,
Maybe it's time to go
To pull him out of his reverie
As you relax
With Him we shall be forever blessed
Serve through, I never meant to hurt you, for certain I'll be
You right next to the right one
Back back back in the back of your mind
I'll still be sleeping
Ease his worried mind
Toddler screams over power the infant death rattle
All with the same thing to say
At the end of yet another day
Come and let me feel it in your eyes
You will be by my side
And all I can say is you saved me 
I can keep it together
I've got your voice on tape
Calling from far away
In mine when I'm asleep
And all it really needed
Sometimes x 
Your vines that blow by borden's grove 
I'll wait this out, by the hour
Lights another cigarette
Pretty bird
We held hands and we ran
On days like these
Bumpin' R&B and I got the heat on the 's and I do it well, well, well, well
I play you're song just to hear you say that
The way you feel is not my problem
You can only find the gold by digging in the dirt
If we got it wrong it's cause the days have no numbers
If there's a scream inside of you just let it go
You're a flower, you're a river you're a rainbow
And it feels so free
You had movement out of my sight
Yeah, we breakdown
Oh, God, well, look at you now
'Cause I've been sitting here since half past nine
Prayed I'd meet someone like you someday
Mercer is a merchant, a policy merchant
Of course I love you 
About all the clues they got
I feel so sad
And hardly ever left my home
Don't stop feeling now
On Maudlin Street
Są cudownym wspomnieniem jesieni
I just wish you could hear me singing
And I never meant her harm
Elle verse des larmes, je l'apostrophe
The accidents of birth can make it hard to speak one's mind
Well you might have it all but you'll still want more
Who will I find, to stay forever
Waiting for a change
Like a child would his mother
And I hope I'll be ready when my life
Jag saknar dig mindre och mindre
Just keep scratching our eyes out
And leave behind the springtime days
Since someone looked at me that way
So long, this is goodbye
Or you can sleep through the static
Ripples of black
But it seems so far look in the stars
"This playground is yours," spoke god when you met behind closed doors, "Gesture your hands and the pawns shall subside"
It'd come to make a mess of things
And some roads only bend
To be with yourself, take all the blood you want
 que ce Martien
I'm gonna live till I die, I'm gonna live to get high
It's something that is out of our hands
At last, my love has come along
I will always hold your hand
We were about to discover what that noise was all about
Where neither star nor moon would shine
But anywhere I am, tell me you're waiting for me
I'm a foolish, fragile spine
Take me, take me, home Me, me, me, me
Yo, you and me used to run ball in the league
That's ever been
Ich bin der Diener von dem, was ich verdiene,
Two palms, no sound 
No love in a drought
And if you really didn't know
And I will give to you my summer wine
You don't know what the sound is darlin'
I done set it aside
I can�t feel all the things you've ever felt before
Its ring in hard earned
When you live in a memory
It is mine alone
Time is driftin', this rock has got to roll
Each time you come to town
Would you remember me ooh
Sob o sol da manhã
You make me so hot
And water was running through both of your hands
That sneaks through houses as we barter for sleep
I guess that's how I know you
Same old house just the family's changed
The woman I'll love
And fearful hate that's steming out
And to be tired of this little romance
Steer me back to my life
To beat the ambient harm
Loneliness, don't come around here
My hope is that we'll meet again
 AM, I watch you sleep,
Our families are so far away
On the highway, but I'm barefoot
I'm falling
Uncovering secrets that I've never seen
The darkness that softened the angles
I will wait for you as long as I have life
Promise not to abandon you, please let me go
But I hit her head and she finished her walking
But now, I don't think too much all the time
When all is said and done will you love me x
You make me feel as though I've been born again
Now that's ok, let them stop and stare
And I'm screaming for the breath
And tell the whole world there's anger in all of us
She sings beautiful and slow
Why don't yousing write paint make
And all you say is over the edge,
To the god, Fred Jordan, we're
But I'm still dancing on my own
In her innocence unused 
I feel the sickness taking over me
Don't turn back
Because when I am drinking
Got no place to sleep it at
With maps, a mountain range, a piggy bank
As we passed them by
The ordinary people they do not know
It's always this way
Help me while these thoughts are troubling me
There's always somebody to watch over me
She want's you to say,
I don't know why
I said I'm sorry to change my mind
Won't have to ask her please again there she goes
Talking shit about a pretty sunset
I was down and calling for a place to hide
And it's your life
Hell, you know we keep talking but there's no mistaking it
That love is not around
Floating out on the tide
I'd love to impress you with a back somersault
G Rap tried to get us to sign to Cold Chill
Is to make you feel safe
The thief, he kindly spoke
Don't want to be first in line
Plus he had the spinner from his Daytons in his hand
For there's no more world,
I won't give up my love so that fate can have its way
Half wishing you could start again
I'm afraid of never choosing
Lay down on hard and ancient stone
She's aware of her implant
Did you imagine you could ever feel so strong,
I'll make it through
Thought you had broke your own back
On the fallen snow
If you get scared of the space
Still I could hear
You neglect your wings like you don't need them
To make much of You
We'll bring a child into this world
We spoke with forked tongues
Anytime she goes away
And I will always feed you and feed you and feed you
You're my moonlight, ohooh
With the line and hook, delight I took 
But time will show
Put it on my shoulder
And though you say you're with me I know that it's not so 
That hurts our feelings Hurts our feelings when you say we're not rappers
Now my feet don't touch the ground 
You always seem to know where to find me and I'm still here behind you
While trying to keep a hold of your hand
Besides every time I see you
Went from cities to touch the suburbs
File off the sharpness of feelings so
Quem sabe com ela eu teria as tardes
I wondered if the waves
Now you know me, for your eyes only
Tired of fake diamonds, fake silver, fake gold
I didn't see the brave girl so near me
Let you have more than mine
Of your hair
Hey yo, man that girl looks good
Sleep, child sleep
Show the world the you inside
Passing out is taking off into the stubborn deep
We don't wanna hear don't wanna hear
There ain't no mountain that's too tall
Until their toes are cold
How long must this day go on 
And now she's here on someone else's arm
And you could tell that I was nervous so you held my hand
I prayed for you that day
She sees the beauty in things we all miss
In your lost enchanted brain
Here we are in the orchestra
On a night like this
Emotional air raids exhaust in my heart
Wonderful and healthy
Her night was good and long
And shower her with my
But this time it doesn't matter to me
Me disse que era um dervixe 
I am a ghost to everyone I know
Have you ever had the feeling
All of the rest will follow,
And no more tears will I cry
Beneath the waves of trembling stars
Until the day it was taken away
That runs from the map off your body
'Cause I already know how this thing go
That was never for me to say and say
Can't change my mind
Take good care of it, babe, take good care of it, babe
But I still like it, maybe
With the new you
But you're on to me and all over me
And that was the end of sweet Molly Malone
We started out so brand new darling
I've come home
New eyes, so I can see
Well, open up your heart and let this fool rush in
Where people walk without touching the ground
When will you share your winter nights
People comment around us
That you're on my mind
You get your grip and peer down over the edge
But the silver moon
And torn your heart
I turn into the world's worst Romeo
With all the vampires and their brides
O sábado, o signo, o carnaval
an Originellen Schauplätzen
And fly to a faraway land
The trouble with the straight and the narrow
Did you understand I can't help it
Did you ever have to make up your mind
Jjust the way I'm supposed to be
Because narcotics grow better than books
You framed beside my bed
I cut as many as I could handle
There was never anything there in the first place
She want's you to say;
I've been wanting to do anything for a long time
Unwanted, late September when you are eager to find
To bring understanding here today
I feel my time my time has come
Be wilder
Stare keep sweet and quite insane
And the job will know I'm insane
I am nothing
Weil dich dann jeder Blick berührt
I've been cycling in circles 'round your empty streets
If we leave tonight
Fixement, le ciel se tord
Hot summer nights, midJuly
Through faces moving in the crowd
And the boat is full and you can't get in
Strangers find the eyes, just the same
He could help me
This boy I know, he has a heart of glass
They only tell you not to cry
Unsure if I want you to see through me
It's just a town like any other town
Do you recognize the one you knew before 
And in your grass I remember him
See what kind of tombstone I might have
My only friend keep on
No one to hear a sound
And I find hope when I'm let down
Every prophecy written
Deberé salir a ver para entender que yo no sé qué será de mi
My old heart
Will you rise or fall
Could I leave you I'll never let you down
They become so dull and dutiful
Van enlazadas, acariciadas y no hay más
She was forty three years old and as far as I know
Sweet little darling
Dave, w "wide wide" being sung during second line by Jian and Mike
Their kids can't go to school
You said I was the missing part
Et pour tuer le ver tu bois l'armée rouge
I'm not breathing only air
The spirit has spoken
Is worth more than diamonds and precious pearls
But nevertheless
It's so funny
My life, I'm sure of no one
How could I ever let you go
They're the ones who'll hate you
A place where every time you breathe a wish comes true
And I would not have you walking through this world
Are you gonna be, are you gonna be, are you gonna be, are you gonna be, are you gonna be, well, well, well, well Yes it will, oh, yes it will
If not tomorrow surely one day soon
Don't say walk 
Bring back the days when we were crazy in love
And the sky was aflare when he came up for air
Cause you can go out and meet some girl you can't defeat
Te tiram da tua calma e tua mãe a te buscar
Espalhe por aí boatos de que eu ficarei aqui 
This world is burning and I'm terrified
Yes we know that all good things come to an end
Brokenhearted jubilee
He made me sin
Cold, cold water surrounds me now
I used to take your breath away
Is the moonlight just a flame for her memory
Other Voice garbled I just wanted to call to say hi, and um, I think I might bring Marissa and Tracy up to Topeka garbled
And joyful memories there
Ist die Angst, es wieder zu verlier'n
Still pyre smoldering
A mirror of ourselves
So you thought that getting sober
But I'm doing all the best I can to leave this nowhere land
Did you know that I loved you or were you not aware
Move your arm in your watch To another time on the block
Your praise little gifts you spent your money
I'd be the king if I could say to you
And turns their faces
Let the atmosphere surround me,
So don't cry
I won't burn unless you're there
Yeah I'll always be waiting for you
And you just curse 'til your head bursts
I know I've been through black and white
And the song I was writing is left undone
I'm in the dark
I'm looking at the telephone
Sun goes down,
But I'll try again tomorrow
So we keep our voices low
You look outside, HATE in your eyes, I enter big money for the enterprise
Take me back to the retards; cause the world just make me sick
If you let your feelings go, dear
Schlaflos, was hab ich nur gemacht
So tonight I sit and wait 
I stare at my own reflection
The trouble with you and me
Another fool would go down to the,
I remember hours scraped away
To the ground
And I'll be here, singing
But I'm still not a bird
From the pain come the dream
Comes through the dust
But something wasn't there
Or just visiting friends
Be a family
Keeping your strength
If I could share what's on my mind
And I'm looking from a distance 
I walked in town on silver spurs that jingled too
Everybody needs a place to rest
The setting sun is never feared
Cuesto obrigado tanta mucho que canite carousel
But my darling,
One day I could breath
If we leave tonight then we leave it all behind
Your music was to stay forever
Now too late I guess the real world I find
And Papa shake my hand
'Cause they realize that my time is finally coming
No no, it's a negotiable term
The men are wailing toothless, the ladies ghostly pout
Mojique buys equipment in the market place
Bye bye baby, baby bye bye
Come back
Love in this life
Now say the word and I'll lay it at your feet
We wetted warmth and killed it and in the water hid
It's still a war down there
I love you four, that's more then I can afford
Makin' you feel blue
Like a diamond
But you're a song I wanna sing all night long
Waking and dreaming
There's a high wind in the trees
My body's young
I'll just remember the wind, and the snow
Crooked souls trying to stay up straight
Där dansar Fredrik Åkare kind emot kind
To wrap my harms around 
If you'll bleed for mine
Then he told me that I was Apollo 
Get lost in the tide
You're looking through the eyes of a child
Tiger in the sea
If I stay, well than your tears will set you free
Of people who will stop
You were kinda sorta my best friend
We'll make it out of here
And find the romance
And no one drags us down
I've been thinking for a while
The pressure
Mä oon istunut tässä jo monta tuntia
Stars that shine
From the ocean to the shore
My skirt floating up around my waist
The clocks on the wall
It's  AM, she moves a little closer to you
And there will be no sound
Hanging clouds over me
Never let them tell you you can't go your way
All alone, with a heart of stone
I don't want anything else
Through your mind and away
The hours change so fast
Confusion rules this shifting age
Yo, I been up the creek without a paddle, now I'm back on the saddle,
It's not that we're bad together
When all the world is green
Our war is the pressure, we need to unite
Doch das Einzige was ich dabei empfinde
Together we were known as good friends
The things you'd like more of from me
On their mouldy bed
I seem to miss the missing part
Like an atmosphere around me,
I just wanted you to feel what I feel for you
In search of destination
You look first, then stare
To the heart of a golden man
Tout peut s'oublier
When he offered his name
So renovate your soul before you get too old
Where the trout and salmon play
My world just falls away
Out on your corner in the pouring rain, oh
My brother dreaming of a new land
Slept on the bad side of town
But it won't stop me losing
Tidal waves, eruptions, plagues and thunder storms
Let's take a drive through the old town
But you say life's so unfair
To view the fair fields, and the valleys in bloom;
Oh love, you were a sickly child
Another day
In spring they lie flat at the first warmth
Smoking vines like cigarettes
Oh, nice
I heard about your story through the years
I dream there and sometimes I wake there
And she will be loved 
And the boys they run faster
What are you made of
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone,
Turning into something I can't cope
First touch and listen
And "I love you"
So you're in Nashville on the phone
All my young boys 'round me saying, "Get money and fuck these hoes"
She was comparable to Cleopatra
I was too Busy staring at youFalling into Getting wood for the fire
Not a single one will believe
You've come a long way, you're selfassured and dressed in funny clothes
But like everything I do I fail
But never a lie
But the sun is burning
And yet I keep on coming back to call your bluff
And all my tomorrows belong to you
When everything comes apart
And just push them aside
Or if it's right to try
The floor is blacker than the sea
I've been taught to hold back my tears and avoid them
When you marry and you look around
I had the boarthick wall and all that, endure pitfalls and all that, fallin'
And if time is all I had
You open the cage and he sets you free
The lamest goat has born two kids
Moonlight
ist das Zeichen entfernt
Pinpoint precision
Why care, why share
I'd switch us around and
Never knew this was possible
I tell you that I can not see but you persist in showing me 
We are children born of wars
That I never, never meant to break your heart
And will I ever take his name
Got a job, I don't got no pension
Please don't lie
That liquid guilt is on my lips
And you can bet your life it rains
I need a knack for keepin' out of trouble
The story of a ship
Down in the fire the angels are singing
Of mental illness
Forgiveness for a man who was stronger
And now, it's time
As the devil spoke we spilled out on the floor
This is for all the single people
Irohke nul neeyope sosona malhalge
Have you seen that moonfaced kid
Look at you you're blue black and through being that kid I knew 
You know how I get
I'm standing in the dark
Still I keep in mind that snow is safe
Somedays have no beginning
Come fly with me, let's fly, let's fly away
They fade away and now you're here
I built an empire on the low the narc's don't know
There are things I will not do
Retrieve the past like a prayer, bringing it back into the light
This soft is dimming the brightest cities every night at midnight
If I was a simple man
Gonna keep moving on up to the higher ground
Why does every cent gotta be a bet
The last bus I missed to Maudlin Street
Bad memories
They're much stronger than I thought
And understand
I know
Känns som om alla är äldre nu och ser efter varann
'Cause it raised you
If you find the time
Sweet like candy
So dedicated to your fate
It's a free fall
Being in love don't mean you're free
Tow the hours of my memory
Look a little closer there's no tears in her eyes
I nod or I shake your hand
I've seen the look in his eyes
She was so beautiful to watch
Catch another dream now
Unrelated sounds
Chasing fireflies
Secretly wishing me gone
Sometimes in a dream you appear
When I woke back up on the subway
But I hear it loud when you fall in the deep and I'll always find you
I want to be there tonight
You might catch me in Atlanta looking like a boss
You're riding alone in the back of a steamer
Till the light of morning comes
Don't let it be here
It's Christmastime
And the war drags on
And all I want is your love
Say it again Lovely So lovely to do it again
We'd be wasted
Raindrops fall as an old man cries
Would you catch me, if I fall
I know, all too well
But the shadow it grows
We march towards the sea
But isn't is so unlike us, come now
As a black dog down in the basement
And sometimes I meet the real you
You speak like you sing
Was a windless night 
One lie short of true
You bring me courage
I wouldn't stop 'til I broke your heart
I will wait for You there
And I hope you take this everything I know
Because I got you too deep inside
Roses north I don't know how long we'd been waiting
I cut myself on barbed wire
It sleeps in the day
The wind will fail
But you can't help feeling used
Oh, don't stop, you've got to shake your waist
To play the passion out that haunts you so
When you expect whistles it's flutes
You'll still be here
Lo, the light limned low
Sur ta voix son corps dansait
They aren't
Jugué con fuego sin saber
I can't explain or understand, I just love You
Ooh, I wanna take you there
The tip of the moon
In thrall of weathers wit
So the morning light can shine on you
Please, just say my name
I would still hear you
Your love is king
Every lament is a love song
So until I truly believe
Come a little bit closer there's nothing for you to fear here
L'univers a ses mystères
Yeah everyone knows
Oil and water, lust and sympathy
Some sense of reality
When the flame turns blue
If I lower mine to yours would you kiss me on the face
But I don't know the game
And my beating heart
To keep my arms open wide
Beneath The Tree of heaven
For when you're lonely and forget who you are
Please try harder while you can
The words are too rough, I can't shake it from off my head
I love the way you dress
From coast to coast, or where ever I find my place
I'm glad I could help
That she passes by the price trying not to steal life but they reach beneath you
Feelin' that's from way back
Everything is still, do you think we will
Burning the light of our nights
Weatherwise, it's such a lovely day
dir den Kopf verdreht
In the way those eyes I've always loved illuminate this place
Maybe you're headin' out
How I survived I will never know
Shooting up right through my heart
And fallen into you
Come on and show the world the you inside
Spend all that you earn
Who's fallen for you
The rivers are wide
Than to risk your heart
And the violet grows 
Did you ever have to fin'lly decide
It was born to be beastly
I can't say when I'll leave you for good
Touching herself with me wide awake in the same room
'Cause I'm fragile
The sun is setting
They told a tale of bad goodbyes
Can you share in the pain and the happy times
'Cause they made you from the light
Go east on Sunrise Highway 
My mind is in the gutter
She spoke of her love returning in time
Deliver me, giving and sharing
It's gonna pass in time
But not looking for what I lack
I wanna be the rock underneath your ground
I want you around
But we must back our things first
I light the light
Nothing's changed
Everywhere
You reach inside and tear out all your cables
The stone's poem is mine
A bunch of bright forgetmenots
Suddenly everything has changed
There's no time to sink
We say no, no no no
Seem so unkind
Should you eat one of the ripest ones, you can fly
Can't get a grip, all alone in a big white house
Bring the answers on in waves
Sure there must be good things left to say
Or I'll still be standing more than likely
It didn't make sense
And float over the tired tired sea
But everbody's watchin' TV
They taught you how to feel, but you just feel numb
A pussy nigga or polices with a warrant for me
You'll be my lady
But still you want it, oh
Let the struggle end, the joy begin, it's true it's love I'm falling in,
Oh, the song would
Of someone who is still true at heart
Did have some fun
I shed tears writin' this song, homeboy, that was real talk, man
It's so cold around me
Never felt this before
Songbird was drinking from a table but songbird you just flew away
Interesting just slightly
Have you ever been told you're mediocre in bed
It wasn't really sad the way they said goodbye 
It was never to you
I said before too long you'll be a memory
In to the games of
Cause you were cold as the ice at your front door
You will make it through this night
He likes to take girls to the park
She the girl in the movie and I'm the hero
Alle Dinge ringsumher gehören mir
That girl from the Molino
Wish you were the one for her
And I sing you a song in the moonlight
How come we never came closer
When you open it to speak
Because your daddy's so alone
If I stay right here than forever with you
America my way of life
And all I have to do today
This ain't no summer fling
In uncertain times
And sometimes when the beetles horn
He won't have due this falling ride
Your cold marble floors and secret doors,
Things will shortly get completely out of hand
Sun shines bright
And a night full of no fear
toquémonos más
The spark in my eyes is gone, somehow
So I started to get cold
So I can forget them easily
I've been waiting all evening
We have to fight between us
Yeah please turn red 
You raised a trembling glass and shouted 'FUCK THE WAR'
I'mma play this Gladys Knight, me and you gon' get right
I'm not man enough to handle it still, oh
Yeah, this time I'll just have to
I'll head on back to the wall
Know what it mean to be on the scene and in the audience "Ali", beamin', yo
When I fall
When you were my girl
She's on the ocean
Can you please try harder while you can
Loving you, is the world that's strange,
No one seems to like this
A family is relying on a millie to survive
I wonder how your body tastes
Dogs barking outside
Said we'd soon be together
Walk around
But I'm cold as, the wind blows
Come take me high above our time
You could see it, I was blind
You know we keep talking 'bout a revolution
You're in Milwaukee, off your feet
You go south to the white spirit world
It's true, so girl that's why I'm asking you, can we
And there's alot of things I wanna learn about you class is in session
That wallow all through life
And I saw your hand
One lonely moment in your arms is the miracle of love
Everybody hides some scar
If you love her let her go"
Hulled far from the highway aisle
So, if I ever hurt you it will be in self defense
But with the will to work hard and a library card
Every mouth that you press against
I never needed you for pointing out my wrongs
Old times always sound so bad
And my heart slows down
I turn to you and say  awake is the new sleep, awake is the new sleep
Everything
Play the song without the hook in the third line
Like there was any law
I'm winding down
Lie me in your quiet ground
All I need
My place to yours 
Lover, can you hear me breathing
Give me one more chance, forgive me
The Good Lord would come take him
For once in your life just let go
Could you breathe inside your wellknown plastic bag
I'm never alone won't you please be near
Montanha viva, sacra, ferida, doce e celestial
I wanna travel the world but I, I just can't do it alone
Any other fool would be out on the roadway,
She waits for a new
And time was held 
Then I can read your thoughts
Has triggered unfamiliar restlessness
Now we're dancin' to the music that we made
E os meus passos
We look through antiques on a fuzzy, fuzzy day
Children aren't afraid to love
You know there's no greater love
He doesn't feel the heat, he doesn't feel the time go by
Down to peace and contentment
Her senses explosion
Putting all the vegetables away 
But you don't want to know
All der Kleinkram neben meinem Bett 
That mean she'll fuck till the morning, time and I got time
We stopped beside a little flower stall
And there is where you'll stay, heheh
I had a very disturbing dream last night
Brother, brother
'Cause we're enjoying our time
It's way too late
And he was only skin and bones
Oh Harlem River
Don't turn her away,
I almost missed my death it's so good
If it reads like a puzzle, a wandering maze
This is how it always starts, all order falls apart
Without love
It's taking place
Like a burgular running out on an alarm
For the rain to gather
I'm like a frightened horse
Maybe I didn't realize
That you can't see the sky
I am drowning in a river of my tears
It's just like a train
My pants are too tight
Don't forget I'm still around
In fagend weeks before I left for school
Why we up  AM on the phone
If you do, the world will kick your ass
What d'you say
In my own mind
From romance
Want the price but not the raise
Little Ray had an NSX, I was hoping I'm next
And the girl that I love is on the other side
But when I look in the mirror
Throwing his morning hours away
Than me, trust me your eyes will be
liittymään mun verkostoon
Do you want to be hypnotized
You can replace my fears
Orange, orange, orange in the mouth again, straighten
She said, "I love you" and it suddenly clicked
But then again how come my shoes are so light
Through the window you looked much sweeter
At night
I slept through the falling of the leaves 
Like the world's tallest selfsupporting tower
Quieren ver adonde van tomados de la mano
I close my eyes, and I dream of my butterfly
I always envied how y'all rock wit Dre and the Chronic
Teardrops of acid rain
Say it again, say it again
Oh, your daddy's rich and your ma is goodlookin'
When we pray
We can hop a train to Mexico
Paperclips, melody
It always, comes back to this
But whilst it breathes
Well this heart is on wheels tonight
Still dancing on my own
Without me by your side
See how they're dreaming
And you're keeping her up at night
And not to say a thing tonight
Mister Wolf knows what time it is
I wanna make this plain
That you're gone
When it's time to let go
You loved me
It's not too much time left for us to breathe
You got to let me out of here
I'll be somewhere in that crowd
My love is a fleeting one
On the back of a motor bike 
And it coming down sideways,
Todas as cores que fugiram junto com você
Oh yeah, you came here with my best friend Jim
Perhaps a stranger she could love
Doggy, and I ain't talking bout my pitbull neither
There is no one to keep you warm
And I believe we will be again
I was a person who would censor "Pee Wee's Adventure"
I'm willing to buy his arrows of loneliness
Cover me with your long feathers
And she breaks my heart, and breaks her word,
Plant a seed I'm in need of a break from the fire drill
And off came those awful toe rings
I think I hear the whisper of my own best friend
Blaming their troubles
Phones will come alive
It ended with a twist of fate
With my sunglasses they can't 
I try not to seem too depressed these days
Oh you could see it in her eyes
As close as I get to love
When you thought you'd soaked up all of the blows
When I found out that each and every one of you were dead
She will be true, to the one in her life,
Oh honey know girl, give it one night
In Montreal, I got so mad, someone broke into the van
For everything that makes you weak
Some of them got closer than others
You've got such a pretty smile
To my brothers that's on the corner
Trusting desire, starting to learn
You never listen to anyone
In paper chains and stars
Pretend that we're both older than we seem
I'll remember long drives sitting in the back
I've never felt so close, but now I know it's over
My heart is laughing
Around the world be be ay be be ay
We have to prove that our love is real over and over again
I'd give you my hand if you'd reach out and grab it,
Oh make no mistake my friend
It takes me home
But we won't be watching tonight
You take away my firm belief
Won't you say my name
O verite um calis oteru | Careum deum calis potere
I wanna remember all there's about you
Just think of what you'll get when you're past this
I remember the kiss when we first met
I guess my art is just lame and it's strange but still somehow I'm
Nothing sweet, nothing nice, nothing kiss, only fights
Now some of us are weak, and some endure
Pilgrim saints, lonely widows
And then there's morning
Don't you breakdown
Even though there's no one who is closer to my heart
I concede into the sea
Or if I say that you're beautiful to me
But you're neither friend nor foe though I
Bebí en las fuentes del placer
Take it back and then let it go
With an umbrella full of holes overtop my head and
Everything will be alright
Time it does not matter
To know me as hardly golden
Keep the straight line
All will wash away
To a fight nobody could win
My mind in the gutter
She got a lightskinned friend look like Michael Jackson
These sheltered hearts can't make me stay
How to dream anymore
Show me to the bed now
To cause this reclusive silence
You work so hard for your boss, to him it's just work
Oh, wait maybe I'll jack a truck
Wrap around me
To hear you speak of it
Than you want to be
You and I, where it started, how we lived, together always
With one or two I get used to the room
Come and take me on, take me down
Now she's gone
If you don't know, you're right next to the right one 
He's at his bitter end
Hey, remember me
Jump off the end
Ask someone who knew me
So sing along street children
We're at the tiptop, yeah, we're not getting any better than this
As an outstretched arm slowly disappears
Where the wind sits by the river,
Maybe I'll write this up or maybe I'll leave this down
I fell into the ocean
A garland of shame
dass da was Grosses war
Like the town where I was born
I remember what you wore on the first day
Got that new song on repeat, oh oh
You could quit the fight or you can say goodnight
Say you'll be mine
To put the fire in her voice
Well you can fall for chains of silver, you can fall for chains of gold
But if that's all you want
This wreck's got a home and a whole lot of hope
More than a couple of days,
I stand corrected, how well you read
Is it just me or are you fed up
Down in silence to the ground
When I'm feeling sad,
It feels like
But the pressure
This is how it always starts, dumb choices from the heart
and we know how endangered we do
Steeple guide me to my heart and home
Father once told me that the night is so ghastly
And the streets I see, will stand the test of time
The embers of a drowning man
Like Madonna, so emotional,
Just want to know my little flicker of time is worthwhile
Just let them roll
Why are there so many records of my life,
Now darling what are you thinking
For things I cannot control
You're still in love with me but your friends don't know
Bow I only have things
You were meant for amazing things
And the rest of our lives would've fared well
And believe it's true
Your sister and me have a set of keys
Love was meant to be
Into the lion's den
It's never how you feel
Well, sometimes it's just easier to let yourself drown 
We all feel the need for wonder
The candy gloss is immaculate, it's simply amazing
It's in your pretty head
The ocean is in the tub
You are more interesting than I'll ever be
I know I can't be late
I know it don't phase you anymore
When my eyes shut, they'll take me to the land
We'll make it last forever
I think of you and everything's okay
We don't ever have to make a sound
The dust of Barcelona
We will find love
From the moment of commitment, nature conspires to help you
Flowing rivers may have stopped me when have stopped me when
Imagine if the life that you thought you shared wasn't really there
She covered me with wings and
Caution tape around my heart
When you need it I want you to
Sometimes I find myself sittin' back and reminiscing
Of being together
Your sister says that I'm no good
I never thought it'd be this way
El perro está contento Ya no oigo el lamento
On closing doors
Lord hears my inner prayer
I can see right through myself, crystal clear
Pour Crystal in the blender and make a protein shake
You were calling me mad but I know you're the same
You turn to rocks and omen
I won't deny the change
The winter though it darkens me
If you're not around that's too bad
Mexican border
That journey is over
To open my door
nach der Zukunft fragen
From the start
Say stop, made up
I praised the Lord for drunken honesty,
It was words that really stung
Because
"Thank you because you loved me and so, ami
The snow came down
It brought us down
Yeah, it's the best job in the world 
I was too busy staring at you
My whole life too
I held on to the shore on to the shore
SO I wrote down 
'Guess what, mister I've got no voice, no future, no leadership'
Say hello to feelings that I detest
I wait on clipclops, deer might fly
A dha chun a ghille bhan 
So I pull my collar up and face the cold
This is just a nightmare
No, nothing has changed 'cause I'm still fact, she's fiction
Let's climb to the top of the state bridge
Made of cinder block
Look at me run
Listen here, some things are meant to be
It could raise these bones again
If it's broke then kick it, dust yourself off
Maybe I'll head out for a movie
I was born crying out and it's come back to me
Heroes often get shot
Sideways rain
Hans sinnen letar klöver
To see these eyes
There was a man in our time 
Hold on while you breathe loud
I've seen the world, lit it up
And the weight of the breath
I know some times
Likewise, the low pressure area slides down the sides
A song, a song
On the back of a rock
Is there something I didn't grasp
Ohoh, no you didn't care to see the light of day
Where we're right
And I was pretending that I was in a Galaxie  video 
The problem was you didn't know when to bow out gracefully
Took me to Columbia, back then CBS
What's your name
Swallow to die again
That sits beside me
Come see what you've done
But I don't really want to
I can't sleep in this bed anymore
Now eating from your hand
So I want you to close your eyes
I got a get a date,
I think separation is OK, you're no star to guide me anyway
A whole lotta give and not enough take
Well here I am writing you a love song Holding back those years,
I try to believe in anyone look at the state I'm in, I'm fine
Know your mind don't go running around like this
If you would take my hand, baby I would show you
Snow or rain it's all the same
Weathered forever
Como se guiam os cometas
But I forgot what we felt like
And I let go who what I know 
You know a little problem or two
With the devil up her sleeve
It'd be nice to go out drinking with you
Shadows dream of light, let's slip on outside
All that face, makes me wanna party
Don't be scared
No matter how many mile away you are
You keep on taking your chances
Since you've been loved
And then letting love grow
Until we're strangers again
All the things that we can be
But from here they're liars, cheaters and thieves
We were down at dead man's hill
Everybody's hiding in the neon lights
I just lay there like a rock
With your car and your handmade overcoats
And our bodies got so much clearer
I want the finer things in my life
And look out the window with you
That's what you get
But baby I was lonely
Heard a shout of someone calling
I love this power
And she slurs, "No no, just one more"
One day, you come around to see the other side of things
You will never wanna go again
Counting stars again x
Prodigal son, clever, better than ever, back
Oh, when you came back from the scene, it's true, you brought a melody
Waitin at the stoplights with nowhere to go
Especially those that are out at the zoo
Say you will wait long
But it doesn't matter 'cause I'm packing plastic
NASA knows, how the pheromones, cascade
People thought my windows
For that plane ride 
Mother earth take the pain away
While you got the energy
Except for the sound of Jacob Marley's chain
Mm, hey little bird  hey little bird
And I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
'Cause we ain't gonna lie to you
But to turn back now we've come too far, so
Swimming through the ashes of another life another life
Your love won't be leaving
Unless I want to
'Cause you're still here to heal what's wrong
There'll never be anything new
And many still to be
Did you know that you can dry your pillows with your dreams and smile
Staring at an endless sky
Only breathing
And all the lights that light the way are blinding
You sit down slow and watch yourself in the glass
To like the movies that we watch to pretend it wasn't winter
It's closing time, it's closing
To be there by your side and keep you warm when you are cold
Back and forth, back and forth"
But you only showed me the door
Now I've grown so much colder
They've broken your heart
And says "Better go home son, and make up your mind"
And I won't tell the lie"
I confess this heavy heart, has me on my knees
On love he said
Oh and lay your flame across my fire
On some picturesque grave
And I'm thinking two, is better than one
Oh, when you came back from the scene it's true, you brought a melody
Här är jag med allt det andra
Everyone knew that he was really a pornographer
On kotisi lämmin ja lohdullinen
I fly the cross of the blue factory flame
Like coming home
Just want a way of keeping you inside
Depending on where I am with you
The useless thing again
Stinging and older, asleep on pins
And the moment I can feel that
Then there's me no use or pretend
And I'll be waiting there for you
Waiting for things that never came
She's holding a secret that she'll never tell,
She deserves all she gets
The more she sings
To the skies of Heaven
In life today
I have seen your city lights
She took until the colors faded
The time has come to say goodnight
The great indoors
I don't have any words to put into your song
Trying to find someone to sell her cocaine
Now everything that's ever gone before, is just a blur
Well it's all for my betterment
Losing my reflection and my clarity
Come baby let's drown
Et landskap som våkner
It's been three years or maybe more
Oh, isn't it time
Oh, isn't it time Woah
But in this racing world there is no place for me
And it's okay, to not even start
me contengo de amarte más
Push me over see me spin
When she's around, he feels nothing but joy
But life is cool and things aren't bad
um meinem Schicksal geschickt zu entkommen  doch es kam
They said she was the pretty one 
Just close your eyes and ignore
My hair has grown
And would our flame still burn so bright
'Cause the baby isn't old enought to speak
You keep me without chains
But don't look at me this way in the broad light of day
A bullet in our breath
Any two can turn to one
'Cause you make my heart feel like it's summer
Their kingdom come
Here comes Jane, you know she's sporting a chain
I've tried to teach you well son all of everything I knew of how to live
And you can wave goodbye to the frozen man
She was coming around the hill
Everything you've learned from us I learned
But the flickering pages that trouble my sight
I want to show you the stars
Of all the things I've meant, but never meant to say
So he bit his tongue
E o que ela não
With a desire to be understood
Of feet, of feet
in meinem Leben dir gefallen
A tear in the fabric that no one could see 
My only source of light
And afloat I'll stay
Giving love is essential
Yeah well come on check it
Your heart was made of steel
The night is on her hair
What's your plan do you think you're a man
But now he lives inside someone he does not recognize 
Scenes of my life
And dragging your mother's clothes
But nobody has any wool
Of finding a place where they're
And if we do than I hope that it's you waiting there to meet me
But I saw a man cry once
Where you end, where I begin
Who's now number one
Sempre o ultimo a saber
So tell me this is what you want 
There's too many strangers on this long
What's happenin', man
And I'm only halfway sober, and it's not getting me any closer
We fell in love I knew it had to end
That my love's misspent
Shut up and count some sheep
He left home to find his own, now all he had is gone
I can't leave you and back home my house is falling down
'Cause you know I'll never let you be
One with the shadows, the die has been cast
Let me fall apart
Lying on the grass
SmithDaugherty
It's not over till it starts again
Fever take a different route
I will miss you, distance aside
You were this close to closing deals
Ja sem nenhum sinal de amor
You're still
Only went down for the company
That breeze can come before you fall
Was all I'd ever let you buy me
At the bar with his name on the side
'Cause I know I won't ever see your eyes
'Bout being naked to the elements
This room was in the middle of a sandy plain
I'll fight to seize the day
Do you dream of me
I know that there's a boy inside the man
When your unfeigned heart called to me through the dark
So you can get on with your search, baby
And debate what's truly permanent
All of the firefighters put out my fires
The time of the final call
So I swam a little closer
So don't be afraid, to let them show Just show your
If you start then see it through
I remove with incision
No matter how strong
And in your dreams, I'll touch your cheek
Never saw it coming
Eine Woche später, eine Nacht, die ich nie vergesse
In the orange sky
Why I've been feelin' all these feelings that I'm feeling now
Light into darkness
Darling I feel you, under my body
To my people in the Twin Tower
A um segundo tudo estava em paz 
There was no one else this time"
Traveling lightly in your neighbor's yard
Could we leave before it gets bad
On the daylight of the strings
Near the east Waverly Hills, your hair pinned back
Come my liege just roll him over
When life becomes so dark
And to you I throw a low light
We saw this as a token that we could still run away
Hollow talking and hollow girl,
The end is closing in
Floating on a sea of superiority doesn't suit you
It was you who said 
I never asked for help, I take care of myself,
Maybe I'll forget it easily
I was as proud as any girl could be
Ah, la, la, la, life goes full circle
With you no longer here to hold my hand
Rainy days, cold nights to remember
Only New York can make it right
And they would float to my lover
And she smiles down on me 
For the tree to drop
And you left it at your door
That was another day
Half a heart is aching to grow
You could go anywhere anytime and find someone
Harlequin forest
Tu as pris son coeur, je t'en veux
And I jump over
I like sleeping
Ttrue words I said to myself
What you started
Whatever happened to Soy Bomb
an denen Sachen geschahen
Wish what you want 
We'll never change
All the wind's at your eyes, at your eyes
 reparti
muss sich wundervoll anhören
Twodimensional ships like ocean liners sailed across this desert
And we'll take stucco dust and wet drywall sludge
You as yours, me as mine, to before we were us
Puede secarse mi alma;
And all the fear that keeps me silent
Place I have known
And I can tell someday that I'm gonna say the truth
Is make you happy
But that you knew I was coming
It's creeping in sweetly
How your own choices make your dream
And even I can't pretend we're not near the end
You have a place to hide
Oh, hold its hands and we'll know what truth is
Falling down
Sunrays and Saturdays
Care about
Now she lies in a plush, velvet bed
Why must you shed such tender tears
Knowing that my thoughts will never leave this room
The song that the trees sing when the wind blows
So take my hand your treading water 
I don't want to be sad again
No dreams will come true
But I finally learned to let it go
Be they changed
I'm looking for them hoes, baby, what it do Drive slow, homie
And now's the time to let them happen again
I sell anything I'ma hustler, I know how to grind
It's okay, to stay here forever
Close your eyes
It is the nature of the business
I'm moving somewhere I don't want
'Cause I'm really, really, really I'm not like that at all
I'm waiting here for the firebell to ring
Too many words misleading
My body, my body  that's your job
Raise a glass of wine for the last time
Angels cheer, 'cause we're together
I stroll where souls get lost like Vegas
So hold me in your arms
They'll drink to your death with pink champagne
Older brothers and late night bars
Never to come out
So what are we saying
Bright eyes, how can you close and fail
Come the night you're only what I want
The flowers are everywhere
I thought you had took all you had to take
To let you grow into the person that I know, that I know you can be
We'll get to know ourselves again
The hits of sunshine, the hits of goldmine
el portero dice "¿Qué tal
Soon the suffering will end
Hieroglyphic every particle,
Lumière over me
I know I know you won't be mine,
I hope you look at me through patient eyes
But it's not like life's such a vale of tears
Wasting hours
Shut up and say goodnight
Feel the pulse beneath the skin
Hit the freeway, go at least 'bout eighty
The morning
"Just don't know if I could do it all again" she said, it's true
Watchin swinging bang and she bend another corner
It will pass
Bad luck you've got in my ring
In llamaland there's a oneman band
Winter bells in dark and silent dreams 
Are you waiting like a paranoid little boy
Where nothing matters
As I fall
It won't be long till I'm back again
Or how a broken heart can mend
Come back away, come back away, come back away
Leave inhibitions in the wind
The perfect place for me to find a friend
War torn, afraid to speak
And in turn, we'll all fall apart with everything
Before the song's begun
You feel funny in this world
Would you want me to be here
You've never seen me and you don't know my face
It's just hard sometimes, it's so hard sometimes
We're feeling more apart
You climb a flight of twisted stairs
Washed up by an ocean who had tired of me
The moon is a lightbulb breaking
I'm never on your side
Mit dir von Anfang an verflochten bis ans Ende meiner Zeit
But all good things, they say, never last
And what if I told you I was still in love with this
The view won't let you down
Your love is real
Technicolor boys, transistor radios
You are the one who came to stay
Because I spend all this time all locked up inside
Soudés à l'instar des grains d'maïs
Will we take to come undone
That tastes and sparkles like
As I step in vain
Je l'ai revue le lendemain avec des fleurs à la main
I'll be falling for you, baby
So content to sit and wait
He always was a son of a bitch
Don't know what else to do
So maybe we should pretend we're who we want to be
Wedding bells were just alarms
A deadly end
And the view is much nicer from the sky
But my cries are swelling
A breath of soot into her lungs
I understand your 
But I don't know what is to say it
Look at the houses
Wipe her tears away
Tho' the rain and the sun come through
Put it away, wait 'til tomorrow
Pathogenic lovers in a basement cell
Your hair, your gown
And all the universe cries
And we'd lie in the garden and watch the weeds grow
I'm slow
'Cause it never lets you go
He stands there, an empty stare, trying to make enough money for his cab fare home
Get your Tbone
I wanna be where the sun meets the sky
Her rhinestonestudded moniker says, "Irene"
Well I don't wanna lose it either
Stop, you can't believe, what you believe
So I turned to you and asked you if you wanted to
But we don't love no more
I have tried in my way to be free
Its all right, Its all right
I'm completely powerless
And I threw it all away
I'd spend a lifetime with you
Time won't heal a broken hearted me
When the gusts came around to blow me down
Every colour you are
Have fun you happy people
Your fear that got me to move
É como procurar no mato estrela do mar
Whenever you go
The roses are sighing
Still I need your guidance
Se eu não posso ver 
о Jameson, Guiness и Connemara
In my head, in my heart, in my soul
A line that never ends
I swam around with the bodies in motion
Ghostpenning songs for big haired aristocrats
And would you want to see
And its hard for you to start
Got woken up by birds and bees,
He was just an old friend
The sky is still clearing
Jag kan tänka tills det knappt finns nått kvar
Search for shooting stars in the night
Too bright for me, darkness descends
Someday we'll find it, the rainbow connection
Sometimes I wonder why,
And they'd, and they'd get themselves a hair cut
You're using all your looks that you've thrown from the start
Let it float away to sea
Sit watching the sky
'Cause you don't need me now 
It's all downhill from there
A broken heart and he doesn't even know
Just a ghost of who I used to be
Someone staying and someone gone
Forever
Come on, friend
Seems serene
Cause, all I wanted
We'll keep a secret if you keep me guessing
You bring new meaning to my life now
You'll never find nobody better than me
I got these feelings but you never mind that shit
On our world without sound
No one understands me quite like you do
bin ganz benommen, von dem was ich mir nahm
I have been wasting my time
beyze vintn mit yirgozn
Call out my name, when you call I'll be there
And if I suddenly went blind,
I dig down deep when I say I love you
I'll hang on, to the hope
But we're all just part of some giant grand machine 
I want loads of clothes and fuckloads of diamonds
I slept inside the piano till the rain was gone
No I won't I won't let you down
And I'm staring down the barrel of a  
He was black sheep and mischief and loved for his craft
It's all right, it's ok, because the night is just another day
But you know, no one stays up for you
But I'll remember to love you
A shimmer in the midnight
I'm looking for a saw to cut the chains in half and all I want is
Seconds change
Failing cells of each begun 
I know that there's nowhere you can hide it
If you will come
For its touch
Leave it all in a dark past
Nahnahnahnahnahnah brave new world
To fight against snow way too thick,
You know the sandman's on his way
Is there anything else
'Cause I don't stand a chance in these four walls
Wrote a letter to the universe instead
Orphan Joy
The years will help to keep your need at bay
I am wasted, losing time
In my heart
I wanna be the one you can be around
Is a glass of champagne 
Why I played myself this way
This old world's going to reel and rock
Nu vill jag bli kysst, sa Cecilia Lind
I need a map but not the destination
When all is said and done
I was waiting for your smile
No one
Now here I am down in Kingstown again
We'll leave on the evening train
When we wake, we hate our brother
And she said don't be upset,
You toss them aside, small and damn near unbreakable
Yes it always
Followed the trail to the wild flowers
I knew not to start
What you waiting for
Don't like to feel out of control
I would sure love believing,
Your family in suits and ties
You knocked on the door
Flesh of my flesh
Spin the bottle on the ground
For leaving them when the sun comes up
My hair grows, nails grow out
Open hearts, empty spaces, dusty roads to distant places
As I walk out the door
Alphabet das wir Beide teilen
Shine on, shine on, shine on, shine on
When tidal wave hit and our house was in splinters
The shadow come closer and it forces to stay
And young men never die
You're still here
Despite the knowing this is strange
Red eye flights help the stars out
How the fairy tale begins
I'm going to get my baby,
I feel you cry, but I can't speak my mind
It's not over not over my friends
Take off your silver spurs and help me pass the time
One of my best friends from back in the day
Yeah some feelings just never go
Trumpet sound
And laid the foundation for this handful of rhymes well I have left the frustration behind my eyes
But that's to risky for a man like me
I'm on a plane at , feet
So say it again
You know what�s to be said
If only you'd let me in
And he stood before my fleeting house
Take good care of it, babe
She's got me praying to the wrong god every night
Always run away
Tellin' me them diamonds, when she know they rhinestones
Anyone can learn the words
I am afraid of so many things
Abusing 'cause you're a friend
I sacrificed myself
I wanna know that
And this ain't no time for locking your phone and not coming home
I let it slip my mind 
So don't you let them hurts try to change you
At the end of the street
No one's job but mine
I told y'all, here they come now, you see them 
And I made them right, I made them right
Look around now
Undead audio, yes we'll be singing today
You need to pump your brakes and drive slow, homie
And the things you loathe
The butcher waits for someone's desperation
It is perfect for a flying honeymoon, they say
But the only one I ever think about is you
And her eyes grew wider than they'd ever been
Don't leave your torch behind, a powercut ahead , you know
I Breath the neon
Oh sing your life
I said someday you'll be happy with me Pancho
You don't have to say a word, it's crystal clear 
There's always something getting through
And I can't believe that I'm still standing here
The breakers in the bar, no reason to live
Ég bít í tunguna á þér
Do you believe that the sky is falling
When I don't know I'm alive, give me fire
ich bin der Sklave von dem, was ich versklavt
Before you write it down
I look straight in the window, try not to look below
Into the trees
Endless need, like a burning sun
I go to those places
The world is just illusion trying to change you
If you think you're sinking, you probably are
Weasel she's in New York, she got it all set up
It said "hey man, there goes the hood"
We held hands and made a circle
Will you still love me
The nightbirds start to sing their favorite song
And I wanted in your storm so bad
Just remember you called it all bullshit
If I couldn't have you, I'd rather be alone
Or is it a dream
Und dein Rock  Schock  der ist doch indiskret
Pakko mennä aina kauemmas kuin minne mä nään
si podré volver
He told us how he liked to feel it when it came out
'Cause I'm your baby still
Putting on jackets way too thin
I don't wanna fall in though
No I won't let you down
And we all have our own scars
I'll tell you what do, then, if you're inclined
I find that if you know
I love you to death
Where no one cares
And last time I knew
Then wake up your windows and watch
Pancho to me our friendship means more
You know I will follow
You make me want to cry
You are nothing
That while walkin' through town
Mwol guri mangsorinyago guge guri oryobnyago
She's only one step away
I know that you say I get mean when I'm drinking,
I left reality early due to the lack of love, reason
We all go through changes, run to different places,
You never know what might be under the snow
You're mumbling words with a lazy tongue
But my head won't function properly
I only say that word for you
und voller Zuversicht
I'll make it right
Everyone had gone to bed
Only darkness everyday
And when you hear this song, I hope that you will see
Why don't you come here and stay with me
I wouldn't change it for the world
It's gonna be a cold day
How do you start it over
And the melody's lost
Don't you see 'Fuck the valley' fudge, it's my hate, my love
Tired homes and tired trees
When you find yourself still living in the past
So please remember me, finally
It will be around for a while
The color of the world had turned dark for me
I'm just waiting for my love
I know, hey I ought to leave the young thing alone,
Speculate what we feel
I've got this one fresh second, one fresh minute, one fresh hour of my day 
Play names and word association
Cities full of people burn and scream and shoutin' loud
With the darkness coming down
But she could never believe that love would ever treat her right
Do you want to
You look through me just like a ghost
Where the rivers wind through the villages
Outside the storm clouds gathering
Like an eagle doin' your hunting from the sky
I was for sure
Look me over it's just a surface wound
I'm not looking for a fight
Fix your eyes on a spot
Go back to that place yea yea yea
People and places and places and people
I can let the current carry me
Und Staub zu Staub vergeht
Till I moved so far away
Forget about your sorrows
Without you, I'm a nowhere girl
It's like running around the evasive ground
Some days her shape in the doorway
Trying to make His way home
In my lap, honey
You can ill aford to hold to this views
Looking to find me a home
I'll still feel you here 'til the moment I'm gone
In a place
Every day is new
Moving in shadow
On the sea
Honey dripping pale of skin while there's bodies underneath
Hennessey and for my niggas OG Killa, call it Jason Voorhees
I'm asking y'all please chill wit the violence
I can make it digitally bright
And if you see her won't you please say hello
Ven juntito a mí tu lengüita he de acariciar
And I won't need convincing
Where is the best man All arise us all in peace
With one little stone
I don't want to be adored
But you're free
While I change the wings
Beating a path down the alleyway
Than I know about you
I go to sleep, sleep, and imagine that you're there with me
Take my tears, they say a lot, since you're the one who put them there
There are objects of affection
My room has a big white bed
Reunited for all of our lives
Let it break the magic beauty of your fragile mind
For fifty years I lived there with my man
In a dark and eerie corner of my mind
Well I know that my tomorrow's gonna be alright
Seen enough to bend him off the frame
I was never gonna let you
And we'll all float along with everything
You should go home
Then my brothers and the others are lost at sea
Buzzards fly above the car
 Generally we are alone
Put it on and get it on with you
And I've got another dream I'll keep to myself
Countless have fallen before
The young man is weak now in a lover's disguise
Everything falls apart, even the people who never frown eventually break down
But a fraction of this life
You are the lonely one
That set me free
I remember it was that Wednesday
Or if you want to build a place up in coldwater canyon
To search through books and records
I should mind if they say it can't be true
Scattering flowers washed down by the rain
Then please don't pick me up
And if you want to be by yourself
A life without you
And all the pieces cheered as tidings spread abroad
I'm your lover
And, now that we know what happened
Once I knew it's getting born
Every mile for ten thousand miles
A call for deliverance
The ocean makes my swelling heart feel small
In love with a broken heart 
Yes, I'm on my way back home
Oh How could you be so heartless
But you snuggled to me on the ground in the winter
I see you on the street in company
On your old ways that have fallen out of step
I took the N Train in from the ocean
When my soul starts growing
And the ring around the moon
I still have a flame gun
And the bills that you paid with were worth nothing at all
And the voices are laughing
The one who inspires, the one we admire
She falls over
Like the grasses that blew in the warm summer breeze
My boy MC Serch nevertheless
And never give up now
Someone come and take me away
hopelandic
I woke up between dawn and night,
I'll turn around
How my love it spins me 'round
Your lips glistening in the light
Looking for a way that we can never find
Say, "Baby, I love you"
I live in new wave
Well guilt is wasteful, pride is childish
And I'm going home
I'll let go
You can't find a way to get out
Oh, Jaqueline Misty, yeahoh
I'll make it right
Though my vision is strainin'
Grazie a te ho una barca da scrivere ho un treno da perdere
You know nothing about me, I know nothing about you
There is no cure for our disease
Every time I'd cry you would wipe my eyes
Breaks my heart
To feel so much tenderness
It's just what Judy needs a moment of release
Where is your sense of indignation
I lost my soul in Tokyo
And shortly after, the atmosphere comes to life
Who wears the leather coat
All you gotta do is walk away and pass me by
Drunk on calliope songs, we met a homewrecking carnival girl
And if the ocean should freeze
It did rain all night the day I left
Through the hourglass
When the rain comes
It may be over but it won't stop there
Like it did on Thursday
I'll brace myself for the loneliness
Another kiss that I thought I meant 
And shackles you down
And go high like the wind don't stop
One of these days I'll make some money
I'm just waiting
I'd rather believe in love
For pride is anything but rare 
That hung on the post In heart remembering 
Since the wreck, I know more what you need
Not the needle, nor the thread, the lost decree
I'm on my way home
I just want you happy
As you blink she is gone
Either side left or right
There 's a girl at the Molino
Now if you are who you say you are, get up here to the bar
We give up our rest, and the best of us though
And if you listen close
On the handlebars
And though my body was strong
I've got a whole congregation living in my head these days
There's nothing left
Inside us all, it makes me cry
The chances few
Back then there was no way of knowing
All the barbershops and funeral homes were open
Like looking at the deep night sky
Baby crying kept us up all night
Coming up for air
That she brushed her heavy hair
Look at me again, you'll make my heart explode
You ain't got nothing but bad, bad luck
"Take the wheel" she said "as I wander"
If we talk this teach
Ships in the night,
I know you love me most
Una playa lejos de acá con caracoles y su mamá
BABY GIRL don't cry
It's such a night, such a night
I would do anything
Something in the way she moves Oh, you know I need her all the time
You can stare up at the sky
Actually it was probably me again
It's a new day, for a new wave
The women in Poughkeepsie
Non nul naege malhaettji wae saranghandan malhaji anhnyago
Lost inside
Ah, I have swum those raging seas
I keep singing the same way
And I won't even let you home
But I don't care
Take a look around, sun has gone down
Can't stop a river when it's burst it's banks
Sail through the wind and rain tonight
Keep in a sack in which it always stays closed
And the Hollywood sign,
Move me to the rhythm of your heartbeat
The rain came again,
Ne me quitte pas  fois
I heart my art
Flying alone
And won't look back
A quiff, a whiff of smoke, an empty egg
Run, you better run,
Yeah, you breakdown
And everything, everything will be fine
I'd have done anything
Here we are standing here
How is it you never notice
Even though I'm far away
Cause that would really be the kindest thing to do
All your sisters wanna fly
The city tonight
Ghosts stand waiting in the dark
Sashita no hana you 
Stood in the rain to feel the part
Crash into merchant shores
Ooh I go home
Life's ups and downs, they come and go
She was a fishmonger and sure it was no wonder
It was so fresh, it was so clean
Sell some
Where the sun don't shine
Mojique waits for news in a quiet place
All these pictures hanging in the room
But I get the feeling
These blackened memories 
Sweet dreams and moonbeams
You know I'll be right here and
Red and black, 'bout my bread, man
It walks the street as the chimneys burn
I just fall out of line
Built upon the hate in man
When I needed you the most you were, nowhere to be found
And you flicked through the letters
Water, only water
Until there is no one to ask me
I don't wanna be like you anymore, anymore, anymore
No drink, no drugs, no cigarettes, no loose women because I'm weak
You're just like poison in my veins killing me inside
I've been alone all along
I know it's been a while
Kicked up dirty leaves
Their mouths all shouting asphalt and their bodies torn apart
Other side of the window
Teach you how before we're done
It comes from cry
Now after two honey blunts I discovered the buzz
And I dreamt of a shelter
My selfish heart hopes you don't go first
It's ok to cry
It's a morning yearning
Will I ever bare that soul
What's gone wrong
We find ourselves in love again
'Cause there, there's a light in me
Look, those are colours we know
Wish I learned to love you more
Every worry every tear
I've boarded up all the doors
I drove it right on down the street
She comes apart in the avalanche
Hello, welcome to dialaview
The further from my side you go, the longing grows
He's blessed us here today
And I remember warmth, I could have sworn
Couldn't afford that lifestyle, Tokyo's too fast and steep
You look like her smell like her
Don't you know I love you more than life itself
I could help myself to something
While the cold winter waitin'
The noise just went away 
To sleep at their feet
With this medicine I get from my, my closer friends
Life is nothing but a shadow
This is not four years ago
And I'll be there when the mourning comes
The way you'd play for me at your show
Who will show us how to read the signs
Should I be feeling guilty or let the judges frown
The rivers from your eyes
I never knew, I never knew
That your eyes are like stars brightly beaming
Where the river cross, crosses the lake
I think my time is running out
If I were to die today
Which way they fly
Burned out flames should never reignite
And I don't really care if you are straight or gay
My night been spent
Cold ice snowing
Lest I might go away 
Daylight comes and I want to go home
Know how to climb a tree
We are crooked souls trying to stay up straight,
As the howling and the fighting dies away
I know they're wrong wait and see
The thick and the grey
Lets drink to the memories that we shared
I never trust my feelings
And marmalade thighs with scrambled yellow hair
And make no mistake, my friend
We talked till the owners swept outside the bakery door
I was never young
This is a place where I feel at home
Everyone, when she was young, 
Worries have to be driven far away
What will you do when the drink is all gone
I'm just, I'm just sayin' I was talkin' to the girls you know
I wanna be your alarm when you sleep in
Long after I'm gone
Do you know what it mean when you see a dude's chick on TV gleamin', huh
And let the sun wrap its arms around me and
You got me, you got me, baby
I could get intoxicated just by looking in your eyes
They are the trees
And be what I want to be
Thinking in circles
Plans fail every day
Looks to the sky above
More panic than intent
She brushed her hands upon my flushed cheek
But only in here I get to see you again
I'll breathe again
Ne me le demande guère J�essayerais de ne plus te voir
Just care what you do
Get nervous every time
The answer's somewhere deep in it, I'm sorry that you're feeling it
But five or six bring you out to the car
It's not warm when she's away
And we wouldn't mind getting lost 
And I know it for what it is
Might have got that information anywhere
When morning comes once more, I have the loneliness you left me
I keep having nightmares, and I'm scared to go to sleep
Growing love but like water 
Back in the day, you stayed in my business
It's tying you up while you're fadin'
There goes the day, oh what a shame
Your table and your skin
A tear was in her eye
I held on tight and closed my eyes
Everyone a suitor I could miss
For the next good crop would pay my way
All the memories will never fade away
Everything will be fine
I'm ready for a ride
I can't come in 'cause it's too high a climb,"
I love you more than I did when you were mine
I don't want to leave her now
But one of these days Ill grow old
Remember our affection way back when
Do my best to make a drawing
All the little lights
You had your shot you took your chances
Among the trees, I pass the hours and fantasize
Cept a slow slow song
Wonderland, wonderland
And if the night is burning I will cover my eyes
Free from all the stress and take within my arms
Now tell me what's wrong, I never meant to hurt you, no baby, ooh
I know it sounds lame but it's so true
And they're begging "come home"
It's awfully considerate of you to think of me
I've tried so hard to tell myself that you're gone
Are calling me home
I'd get no blame 
Of course I said I couldn't and of course we knew that's wrong
Where they touch the sky
Like 'We'll meet again' and 'Fuck the man'
I know it's going away
Nobody's perfect all the time
And I thought I saw you cheating once or twice, once or twice
Yeah I kept on looking for a sign in the middle of the night
Taking me down
Don't need your help
And get yourself dressed instead
I remember playin' my guitar in the projects
Reading the signs that just seep out
I'll need you close to sing
When you dream of me
And then wnen it comes on top
I couldn't find a better life, couldn't find my way inside
It happens in the vicious when the truth starts to settle in
And people hang, on your every word
And wound up at your door
We had sat down and wept
Auf den meisten steht nur ein Wort Namenlos
Words don't come easily
Give your life
No one betrayed here but the memories lie
Well, until you get there, go on, go ahead and scream it
Manchild in wood
É como ver televisão e não dormir
Do you want a golden ring
And it's hard to say what you've got
Rivers that run anywhere
You've got too much in this
You better practice humility
You're a simple fool without shame
Her morning elegance she wears
Plastic cups for rum and punch, eating chicken that's hot and sweet
Somewhere around here, somewhere around here
Auch wenn uns das tief verletzt
Got a tattoo that said, 'together through life'
He'll prove it by using his son and his daughters
Only love, only love
Lying on our backs in summer grass,
The fool, play by your rule
es verkümmert noch schlimmer
I guess it's bittersweet poetry
A star stands still above while Brooklyn blurs below
In the arms of someone else
With your friends and all your jokes
This is no terror ground
Oh the wind dies, the thunder of the storm is coming
What are you doing hanging out with me
I'm going to reach on up over that fear
Om vi nån gång, nånsin blir som dom
I close my eyes, you reappear
Waiting by the mailbox, by the train 
Disneyworld to Yellowknife
I'm just waiting for my love to come
And you tell me, you tell me not to cry
When we're far away, so far
Shut your eyes, there are bluer skies
I will dance till the bitter end
Divine is your mother
I wanna get to know you
The neon signs got tired
But you already know that because you used to dine with me
E volta e meia Eu entro com meu carro pela contramão
I'm waiting for something
But what's man without his wealth
It makes me look much older
Deep down underneath
But it's overflowing evaporating in the air
But silence arrives
In twilight she's a constant blur
I can't forget
Don't forget the tune
I was sleeping, I was sleeping by the wasteside of tomorrow
And pulling all your threads saying
E minha mente voa                       x
You ought to know 
And it looks so alive
That old angel may allow
Can't stare it in the face
You're on every street, marked on the ground
Every single thought you think,
This maudlin career has come to an end
Never failing to fight at your side
Just do it, whatever it is
What do you care
It was custom built for all niggaz like you lid closes
And everything else doesn't matter
Future in my eyes, bright
Like lines around the sun 
It always will
The tunnel's now a flower bed
You haven't beat me yet
It's like I'm fade away
I've got half a mind to close my eyes and let the string go, sailing the wind
Looks like light and love
And one of these days I'll get a real job
If the sun is to set
All the barbershops and funeral homes were open, oh
I will be waiting here with open arms
I buy their hardheaded husbands a long cool drink
The things you loved before haven't changed
Your skin crawls up an octave, your teeth have lost their gleam 
Hope you never grow old
Keepin' it in for a later tune
Whatcha doing 'cause we'll be rendezvousing &
I dream of dreaming dreams of her
Then we'll have peace until we die
I will keep them close to me
Hang it up now or never
I don't wanna see you go
From up in the sky they're just people
Oh truly I love you
So I smiled on my Nancy, 'twas I broke your heart,
Means that everything I touch breaks
Of that night
A friendship that meant
And I know I can't be found
It's the season of the witch, it's the season of the spin
Every waking minute 
No, I don't know what she's thinking 
Flying down
We know that nothing else for us is possible
And introduce to every soul a drink made of tears
Now get a load of me, flashy, far from low key
The trains won't ride beside us 
Is it written on my back
Makin' sense of it, we hustle for change
Never will stop caring
I wrote my first verse, I was about nine
His value declined
May one day return to walk through those fields again
You, you brought joy to my world
Minä kaipaan eskimoystävääni  I miss my eskimo friend
From this power come the change
And under the water you scream so loud
The beat a hair behind
Warten auf dich
What do I care
This is my song to bring you back again
I need it more than I need myself
And in all of the kitchens in the world
We turned out Golden
And I will try and dry my eyes
Yeah it feels like it's wearing me down
So now I keep my eyes open hoping to take in all I can
Keep it together
Oh, let it free, that caged on fire thing
This game of cruelty
The longest time I've been waiting alone like the river
Hollowing souls
When you wear your clothes
Girl I wanna show you all around the world
Don't fight, don't argue
Imagine I would feel
He'd drink every night 'til he passed out
Sing to the world tonight
Into a pair of car
I'm on the right track, yeah we're onto a winner
Long gone
I can only think one way and I only feel the way I felt
There's a love between us still but something's changed and I don't know why
Right when I need you most
Pretend that you owe me nothing
I'm sitting in this car 
In my room with the curtains drawn
When I said goodbye, I'm sorry
Well, I'll tell you one thing, if you're keeping something
You're eyes are unkind,
Has the thought of leaving ever left you
Really I be on bended knee really id be on bended knee
You want to love your life from a prison
I still think of you
Has stolen one egg
The floor
Alltid förberedd för storm
I swore I'd be careful not to
And how the water can flow like it's streaming out of fountains
Chikazuku owari ni 
Welcome to the lonesome world of Abel
,,Als Tristan and Isolde den Minnetrank getrunken,
Oh it's getting easier but time will show
Calling their manchild as the trouble did flow
It's everywhere I look
I'm fast asleep now
That time won't heal a broken hearted
And if you saw with my eyes
Of idle days
In a restless world like this is
You know I just can't stand myself
You give me something to hold on to
And now we are through
It will lay her burdens down
Now, if you're never gonna move
My time has come and you will rescue me
It's too soon for me to forget
For the times I feel lost
I just can't seem to get around
Singing save our simian souls
Face the morning rain
A running comeback home
And I am one for you
Of your heart
I look straight in the boardroom, a modern Pharaoh's tomb
Even you are falling
Blowing out the candles from my cake
Notice a beautiful fire
And I wouldn't want to interrupt
Sends the keys to the lock of the chain
Lovers will come
We said "hi" and kissed with some bravado
All I want is you
So much that they'll never know
A world of hate and a world of dreams
Sister awake
How low one would not need to know
One billion lonely hearts
With every word you say
The dry Arizona faces
Wird dir morgen wieder genommen
You always have too much to prove
Kind of curly hair, eyes so soft and true
Hear you me my friends
I struggle, I struggle to breathe repeated
You hold up a sign that reads "Follow me"
And over here
The closer you are, more I see
Freedom can be freezing, take a picture from the pretty side
Reminding me I still had life
But surely by now I could say to myself
The sweetest kiss she will give
Slow bubble boiling on the bedroom floor
Ah, tear it all apart
And I've got a bottle I can aim at the center,
We can always be
Come on love love love
Everyone needs
Little things just seem to undermine her confidence in him
I know you know
Someone's calling
Well, we'll just throw it away
I heard your boys
And when you let me taste your fingers
I know you're somewhere, unchanged
But I must kneel to fight
But now I can't speak your name
And I'm gonna stay here indefinitely
Those names engraved always
How you get your kicks for living
Honestly over you
While I smoke a B, you can preferably find that I'm a G and all this well, well, well, well
I wonder how long it's gonna take
Are ships in the night
Can you look at the truth
We had collapsed ourselves in shade somewhere
No one knows better than i
Who had the knack of tossing
Freedom spelled by a man in chains
It just takes time
You know that it could be so simple
Grown up, want onlychild attention
Pretty bitches and tire marks, let 'em inhale them pipe exhausts
You may hate me,
You won't need a real job
di hilf iz nor in aykh aleyn gevendt
Beware of the need for help
When friends were around
She pours white wine
That I haven't seen for days
Not coming back
Full of broken live
To connect all things
You crashed your car right into me
Les mots sont nos vies
I'd pay to visit you on rainy sundays
I'm glad you came around today
yo soy mucho más de acá que ninguno de allá
Fools rush in where angels fear to tread,
Live together, live together
I am wasting without you
And he won't be back again
I'll let you sleep
But you're prepared everyday to make the same mistakes
Or right when I can't eat
If rap was the block or spot, I'll be potent product
Says we will always be safe here in this bed
And it's a rare seed
Don't you stop till you know you're gone
When there's no home to call your own
We haunt living dreams
Wondering which of the buggers to blame
The song of the fly and the rush
The wait is over and now it's easy
Deliver me, loving and caring
Maybe wait
Deep down inside
Will speak to me, a bird's wing on the window
You love me, yes you do
You're looking through
I see you, I see you waiting
Still everybody gotta build for that, me I make mills off that
Don't remember the look on his face, but I remember
Your voice it chased away all the sanity in me
Inevitable cry song
Your lips pressed to my neck
I Sit all alone
Fever I know in god I shouldn't trust
She'll be a fine lady before too long
You pick the storm or you pick the shore
Well honey that's ok
No broken hearts
Inspiration is what you are to me
While looking me directly in my eyes
And when the phone rang only once she took a dreadful fright
Guess you'll stick around
This darkness will turn to light
You give them what they need
Shit a little funny, feel a little laughter
It's getting hard to fake
In history, your bluest grace
That love causes
Like things we trust for if we must, we must burn them
One day our generation
With I don't know who
OG's say I need to learn to be patient
And says something like, "You and me babe, how 'bout it"
That will only ever do you harm
Over and over, you wanted it so fast
Maybe she wants me, but who am I to tell
With diamonds and pearls at your head and your feet
And in the haze I see a hand to hold
I am in love with you
And it tears down my guise
Could but compose man's image and his cry
Whatever road to take
And you made me feel like a fortress
Make believe
Give me marks out of ten for the clothes I wear
And I could make you understand
But the moment passes as the sun moves on
Strange it may seems
And that first breaking light becomes his enemy
But everyone knows
Don't know you're thinking
Now I've got a woman at home
I need to know when I have gone too far
Do you really think that anybody will listen
When you went to Steamboat Springs
For there's none of them can sing so sweet 
Can't seem to get it of the ground
Roses so red our hearts were busted open
Well this is something else, who would comprehend
When they cut the clothesline loose
Keep your self onside ny son and the world is yours
Whatever it is you think you are,
Let us have some relief now
Once it goes away
Looking for a home in the heart of the country
Now gasp for air
Though I never was sure of God
It takes a hen to make an egg
These temptations have blinded desires
And I may leave in time you'll see
Curve's the words, spin's the verbs
But I want you to know
But it ain't that truth we chase
Ich kletter hoch
And the rain beats down
Girl feels so right And all I know is you're the one for me,
That disease is the love of two alien kinds of creatures for each other
But I know one day it's gonna happen
On the threshold of some brighter thing
It doesn't seem like the first time
That old blanket of sorrow
Dragonfly in the sun, you know what I mean
A Night all alone
I'll fall apart from the inside and die
And he's related to you
Go away fly away go away
Julistan sun sydämesi valoa mä rakastan sua
It would be the most beautiful thing that they ever had seen
I gathered the twine as it trailed from behind 
I'm getting bored, I need, need, need, need now, now some kicks
But I still act surprised
So much time on the other side
Now everyone can share what's left
We go slow when we first make our moves
I never get anywhere
The love I hold is older than the sky we lay under
Is the last beat heard
The light, the sound of the cars
I want to hold you
Young men that learned to do everything spiteful
'Cause everyone knows that's how you get famous
But good things are gone
Candles in the sun, blowin' in the wind
We know you're there
Lost and losing trust
And weal I will cry every day
When the north wind blows
That "it's all we need"
Sing to me, sing to me
I've dreamed of you
I say if the futures been drawn out there's no point in living
That we come together to make it sweet
Back into that falling night
One step down
For the longest while
Où il ne pleut pas
Meant to go 'round in pairs
But I don't know what it was
The taste of your lips says we shouldn't have met like this
Love the light and yellow shadow girls
Like Adam in chains
There's nothing I love better than a free for all
You're turning into something you are not
And we lose, what's to lose, when you haven't done wrong
I'd slip my hand
But tell me, are you even aware
That I get what it's about
Oa, oa me leva pra ela
Oh, don't you cry for me
If I ever hurt you it will be in self defense
By the Sally Ann just barely 
Keeps coming back to it his voice in echo chorus
Hitching your wheels to truck, bus or car
I think about the girl all the time
All alone and bitter
I can't stop acting my age
Don't you remember
I knew you better 
I'll think of nice things
With my family, and my pastor, and my grandfather who's dead
For fifteen minutes and change
And a love that's warm and bright
Her hard parts I'm cradling
If I fall, if I fall, if I fall
When I'm down, down, down
When you thought you were caught with unknowable thrills
This is very interesting
Is forever over now
Who only wanna be pleased
Sweet nothings left behind
The heat is just delicious
And I don't recognize anyone from the dialaview
And I hope
And you're cotton candy
And change them 
E cada segundo, cada momento, cada instante 
Like I'm always missing you
Either way I think
I know I owe my brothers
Yeah somebody's bed will never be warm again,
Hopefully it occurs to me that there's one thing I can't stand
Unseen by the human eye
And think for a moment
Fellas, hold on to your girl right now
Say your prayers and turn out the lights
Das ist das Lied,
Please put down your heat
A city drowning, God's black tears
And so many thoughts that flow through my mind
Just wishing the numbness to cut deeper with its pins
Well I'm orbiting the world
There are colors in the air when I fall to the ground
Why do we justify these foolish who are burning
Nu daz diu maget und der man, 
We end it, it's all over,
So put up your fists and I'll put up mine
Things that you want 
It had been out all night
Trey has a window into their relationship
Then June came, sun shone
That it didn't have to be a long drive
The sun seeps through the window to see if we're still dead 
On a diamond in the rough I spent my better years
Caught like a fool without a line
My mother
Call out your name
Though sweet as wine, as thick as blood
Following him whenever he's with you
So give me a sign
Silverwhite winters that melt into springs;
You don't even know how to say goodbye
'Cause he can never love you the way that I could if you were mine
Never to return
And I won't let go
You know we'll never be alone
And I know my mind is gone
From the housetops to the gutters
I've loved 'til I've lost
And the thought of us together
Black coral on the sand
Everything will come in time
Some hearts are ghosts
In a wooden frame with splinters
But I couldn't get it right, I couldn't get it right
From the start you set upon
Everything inside of me that I won't let you see
It takes some good to make it hurt
One of these days you'll be
Und irgendwo in Frankreich
They're the legions of the damned from an unholy land
Tell me how I love you wins
Wenn du ihn mitnimmst, wenn du gehst,
I flip a coin, there's more sides than two
Watch it turning round and round
Though tears don't come to cry some grief away,
But I've never been here before
Your love is here today
I don't want you to show me
Up above the clouds, it is always a blue sky
And even if I was wrong, I know I don't deserve this
Run to a girl you barely know
When I want you, and only you
No I never meant to hold you back
Nothing's at it seems, you can be redeemed
Don't give the game away
The babytalk voices and the post class A nasal trip
For all men to be one
Won't you come and let me whisper in your ear
But I won't let you down so open up your eyes
Well, he told me if I try, I could fly for you
And I can be one too
I ain't jealous of the way you're living
You're fragile as a scene, ya know
It's still much more
Yeah, I need you, I need you to hate
In the desperate kingdom of love
And turning into americans
und sie fallen auf Dich drauf
Wore a cotton gown that blazed the night untold
Didn't want you to know 
You must follow your heart
Your love's the warmest place the sun ever shines
As you're sleeping silently
I trust my love, I trust myself, I trust the love of someone else
To keep the stop in time
I'm bright as the Oregon breeze
My blueberry eyes full of love for life
Fish are jumping and the cotton is high
Now now the winter glows 
Aber was ist mit denen, die keiner kennt Wer erinnert sich an die Jener dort, ging er freiwillig auf die andere Seite War er müde Konnte er die Realität nicht mehr ertragen Vielleicht folgte er seiner Liebsten Und da, ein Kind Niemand kennt es, weiß seinen Namen Es war offensichtlich nicht gewollt Es wird nicht vermisst Es ging nicht freiwillig ins Wasser Dazu war es noch viel zu klein Auch der da, man schnitt ihm die Kehle durch, bevor man ihn in den Fluss warf Aber wo Manch einer von denen kam von weit her Man weiß nicht, wie lange er im Wasser lag Die Strömung ist stark und möglicherweise trieb er kilometerweit, ohne dass man ihn bemerkte Warum vermisst sie niemand
You better practice happiness
Out on the freeway
The stars they used to drain
At nighttime I go out and see the people
We were broken up bound and everything fell to fear
Now everyone is here
Suddenly burn so pale
I'm on your side
I'm right again, I'm Chinatown
Focus on the light
And over here they need wool
Says she, now my young man, you must be excused, 
I kind of know what I want
To the ends of the earth, wife, kids and a car
Judy will be suffering tonight
I go to heaven
C'mon now, people, get yourselves out of it
Cinder and smoke
The stewardess came back and checked on my drink 
Beginning to wind down
It's ever so strange
Made of broken glass and famous haircuts
Hush now, darling, I can hear you're screaming 
Listen, we are
Of everything you are, everything we are
To sugarcoat what is said
Like a decoration for the holiday
Think I'm goin' home
Gone away
And death by boredom
Cause your lips don't move
Why'd you have to phone 
yo no quiero ver más
No time to lose
Got what he wants, lost what he had
And if there's demons
I don't know where I'm going
How we tried to make everything right
These are the bulletproof  carat gold tears  of a rapper
Now I've gotta leave
Where I need to go
I'll show you how it feels to be, blame like me,
He loved her, but he wasn't too sure
Try not to dream and dream tonight
Windswept child on a shooting star
Face the world with pain inside
I'd catch some stars for you
And pick up on one and leave the other behind
Oh, I'd have jumped from my trees
Polished up warm bullets hanging static in the air,
Maybe a day 
For you're embraced in my heart
So I wait to sieze the day
Well one of them is mine
Took you all for prisoner with just one line, one lie
The moon is a light bulb breaking
Never let no woman tell you she loves you
Please read them by the light of the moon
Got some cocaine from a friend
Can we keep it down till its back round till it comes
Around my golden sky
So just let me hide
And that I'd climb through your window
While the world wakes up early
Oh sweet Mary
But don't discount their winter winds
Always puttin' yourself last
And watched the sunshine
I'll see them, I'll find a flight around the world
The streets are cruel, he tries to act cool, he goes to work with only his one tool
Where alot of people lie, In a deep sleep
Flow like that Harlem River
You marry because it's expected of you
If you fall in, I'll jump down
Sometimes I watch my life
This is your warning
Now I lay and watch the green leaves
It's shimmer still beams clear and bright
All the things you loathe
And the distance between that was sheltering me comes in full view
But I know you and you know me
Running from the underground
Von Gott berührt, von den Menschen verbrüht
I won't wait anymore
But I can't let go
And without a sound, without a sound
Make it feel alright
The night had a number, number  babe
It's compromise that moves us along, yeah
Went plat', mad bottles I'm toasting
All a mirage gone bad oh
There's no one else, you know
We just feel like we don't have the means
You said I was late
And Harlem River I can't breathe
The day after my birthday is not my birthday, Mum
Anywhere's Amanda's dream
I know I may be wishing
I'm trying to make since of me and you
And gobble it like a candy
Damn, that's gotta hurt
Two scared little runaways
Hospital blue paint off the wall,
ei ilman sua ei oo mitään
But when the wind starts to shift
Where I used to shine
Well, that final day will come, it comes to everyone
To cover the tracks that I have left
River's bottom dark and blue,
It's easily the most boring part of your week
He's soon adjusted and got accustomed to these new ways
Then close his eyes
Been a scratch on the surface 
It was a triangle with soft, rounded edges and a split down the middle of one corner
Sometimes I feel so bad, so bad
I feel dead
To twist your loving arms 'til you capitulate
Into dark forests of piano sounds
But you won't be alone, I'll be here to carry you along
Makes him wasted
Hit by a car
When it filled with circus dogs, the parking lot
Anyone but me
We go over again beautifully mutilated
And my mountain's steep
To show you the stars and then win your heart
There's too many things between you and me
I just wanted you to know
Tired eyes for these 
White collar war crime, money gets spent
Just the way I'm supposed to be
Mutta sielussasi  But within your soul
That I'd seen you walk away 
It's just a feeling
I almost couldn't wash the sheets
Man this shit is hella scummy
Sometimes we let go of what we need
Turn to cloud
By believing in you
With a name like mine
I wrote another song for you
That only love can find
If the rain has to separate from itself
The ledge of life goes under
From the start they didn't know exactly why was
The only thing you have to say
With a silver ring that will hug you tight,
All that I want, all that I want, all that I want
And all the miracles of love
For my luck has turned against me
That's okay 'cause in a way I'm free
But don't you run too far away
Around the world around the world
Ever talk, decide out
You're a bird with songs to shout
I would protect you from everything
I've seen headlights passing by
A look in your eyes as they met mine
Te dire les mots les plus tendres
J'ai laissé filler l'hiver
And look 
Anytime she goes away, Anytime she goes away
On the phone to the bank about a default loan
'Cause lady and I, we could not stop
You know just what I mean
Comes stumbling towards me
Smokey Robinson, Ashford & Simpson Are you gonna be
While daddy was busy putting on his pants
Kitty asked me to read her stars
If I belong to somewhere, it's to your arms, Kery Kery oh
All the evidence points in one direction
In a world, full of people
But it can't stay
If this was my last day here on earth earth earth earth
Har bestämt att stå helt utanför det där som jag blir ledsen av
And in autumn it's girls and a broken heart
And as the sun goes down
I saw a navy blue bird
In the shadows, where I end up loved
If I don't do it, you know somebody else will
New slang when you notice the stripes
It's the little things that we do that mean anything
En wij daartussen
Run, run, you're not too cool
Then I hope it takes me, too
Take these broken wings
Standing alone
I've been going out of my mind
Until tonight
Arrête de l'ver les bras comme en , le  mai
You say darlin' don't
But then you call me on the phone to tell me goodnight
Time and time again I've been told
Let me watch by the fire and remember my days
"If I'm going to help you
Like a man, prepared to take whatever comin' for me
Shining through a misty tide
Talking about their homes
When I'm walking out between parked cars
Little green men do okay
Head on my shoulder, there's nothing left to say
Still I'm unable to inhale all the riches
And longing for a life 
And in tongues
The birds have no heads when you come around
You've got a choice, it's the toro or the toreador
Blood on the leaves
I never thought that time could get so far 
So try to be somebody
It's a long story
Brother, you will always be
Talking to the walls again
Sometimes you don't understand where I'm coming from
I never loved you blindly 
I try to run away
Look at all the mess I've caused
Lunch box collector loves
So I gave into your love
We'll rent expensive cars
I'm taking no sides
It's gonna pass
Pretty, pretty star
Lost and found, ailing wanderers
If you don't believe that these things happen,
You constantly embarrass me
A change is due
I've burned all paths that lead to peace
Bring me olive oil crushed for his majesty
Can you please
Arms out, knees bend, the motion flows
Dusonul saranghae saranghae
None of these things have changed
If you're the last one alive
I don't know what I've become
Moved silently along the rain swept boulevard
Words are mysteries
And pour it loose through your garden
Hope it's everything that you thought it would be
That is what they call our life
A memory made to last
Restraint restraint
By digitising thunder and traffic noises, Georgia was able to compose aleatoric music
These cells are virgins
Just tryin' to make His way home
Will it ever get here
And I've seen my wife at the KMart
To leave and turn to dust
But love is no big deal
You've been so alone
Falling down from a mountain of frights
I'm a living man 
I rolled and I took my chances
We can do some wrecking here
When you vanish in the air
Each time I'm away
Is there anything I can do, baby
This is the sign of our times
And I know what you're thinking
wann kànn es wieder zurück
I fought in that battle, so I might know the same
I wanted a story that couldn't be told
Who's willing to explain this story
I hope I get out soon
An ending to this fear
Sweetheart
This is no, sad and sorry dream
A second skin
It feels all right
I can't pull my self back from you
But niggaz don't even remember you enough to just shout you
When you seem further every day
Harder now with higher speed
The scent of magnolia sweet and fresh
Burned out roman candle, calling cards
All day long she's with me every day
Everything that everyone says turns me on
Until they rise like mountain ranges at my feet
Feel the spot, don't let it burn
But with you I am prepared for
Tidal wave rushing on and on
That's the sound of our love dying
A chilly wind is blowing
I know if I stay in and hide,
Down on my knees where I met You
You get the privilege of being with me
They are like those children
But I'll keep on dreaming
Now I spend my time
Sights and sounds calling form far away
Hold me, taking it back in tears
Nonstop July
The attention I need is much more serious
Find our way to fall
You're gonna be swept off your feet
I know best yea yea yea
Moments no one else can know
Crashing against my delirious thoughts where humanity's waiting alone
We were young souls
Is the time of the blink
And so our sun is sinking low
Radiation from a single mind
The sheets are too tight
And I'm the wave that crashes
I feel a change coming on
No pressure
Asleep inside the cannon's mouth
I hope you find what you are looking for
I've tried my hardest since we started
From up in the sky I can't see your lies
I'm caught in the undertow
Sometimes it hurts me
I had a bonafide downside frown with the swagga not around in my life
But a time will come when these numbers have all ended
And the sun is going down
To be used and then disposed of
I call the magical child
I'll have to let it speak for itself
Go ahead and put it down
I just wanna touch you
I finally shut my mouth so I can here my self think
Oh water that had kept me alive
Start holding you down
Alone I feel like I'm jumping on a trampoline
Who needs please when we've got guns
A force of nature filled with strength
Each time a faucet opens
And find something to love
The light shines on
Oh Lord, could you help me find some shelter Yeah
But I refuse to falter in what I believe
I will keep him warm
That I should fly
Tubehole wind in my face, thunder in gentle distance
The crow, the cat, the bird and the bee
It was great until those old magazines
About love
Never did this before, that's what the virgin says
Doesn't matter if we lie
My earnest prayers
I listen to the music, the music will take me home
Let your backbone slide
Everybody's gotta feel the weight of death sometime
And then you know you better make up your mind
She fixes her hair
Like a friend
Give a damn what he done, it's my motherfuckin' fault
Algunas veces, tal un capitan
Won't you let me go
Haunted by ghosts the evil force of mystery
Elle se déhanche, s'avance, se penche
Waits for no one
Scream to no one
Shaking hands shake their heads
Show me love, love, love
I come to rescue you
Oh, you live till you breathe,
And maybe it's true, that I can't live without you
But still we love somehow, oh
I lay down beside him
And love's a jewel while its first new
I don't dare to touch your hand
The feds watch me, Icey, they can't stop me
I got a phosphorescent secret
So I just stay at home, oh, just the saddest news,
Don't you remind me of someone
Are you just sticking with it now because it's all you've got
It's colder in your bones,
Oh my God, why are we so afraid
You just merely got it all wrong
Now she's left me for something more sure
Always trying
There'll be no answer to your prayers
Here at the top of a mountain
Hear the sounds of life grow late 
There is a growing golden light
I soon was finding out
We gon' get more acquainted at a time when you least expect it
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, I'm alright
Pull away your eyes it's nothing left to heal
I heard you did Pack it in
As the sweet babies crawl away
I've gone to find my ain true love
Just know who I am
I am a dreamer and when I wake
More than life itself
Talking to a memory that's never coming home 
We will play on till the end
A dragonfly is seeing it's helped
A silent mind
Like you should be loved
And I'm feeling alone
To bring our neighbors home from war
All that you ask for comes from dreams
Es war immer schon da
With a needle hanging out of its arm
And I've lost my words
With your talk of four leaf clovers
I'mma soar even as the shell fall
Rain, it wets muddy roads
Look what it's done so far
Or some song that's full of lies
A sight for sore eyes to the blind would be awful majestic
I'll see you back tonight where
But you've made pain into something I could touch
If it's a thrill you're looking for
Taking time
I'm off to my home away from home
I'm not sitting up here on some throne
I already caused, apparently normal
Is there anything that I can do
I've dreamed of this a thousand times before
Chewy chop nobody knew where we were a letter dropped to the floor
From the dialaview
What is dark like a birthmark
When the astronauts discovered
'CAUSE I've done everything and now I'm sick of tryin'
If you see me, I move slow
Baby won't you please come home
Only them, what they know blessing in this curse
I get get so full and I wish it never
I know you tried,
Locked up change deep inside
She's lovely now, just watch her as she goes 
Driving with my friends
What in heaven's name have you done
You're trapped inside
'Cause I didn't want to stay, I didn't want to stay"
From shanty town, yeah yeah yeah
Well if it doesn't it's not love
In the arms of cobwebs
Hey girl if you can't recall 
No more lies
Över torgen här går var och en för sig
We're the lovestruck ones
Just like the way that you ran to wine
You were flashing white light
Now you've too tired to care
Cleave the dry stone to a promise
Every time your lips meet mine
Unless I allow them
But I guess, I guess you just ate much better than the rest
Pour l'univers on quitte la Terre
Wave goodbye 'cause I know I'll believe if you spell it out for me
I'd breathe you in
But I never felt so lonely
Made me feel so good inside
But I'll be your candyman
Ja, jag sträcker mig så långt det går
Another hum drum grey day
It's easy to get scared oh
I'm going to miss the way I missed you
Their gold teeth mirror
And never be heard
Derramando no espinhaço quase um mar
A little talent but a lot would do
A front room endless hours, weeks, years even
About lovers and how they should lay
Things move rapidly
Since we fell apart I've been nothing but blue
I never thought it would be quite like this
Stitch it up and pray the kid recover nicely
And she'll say "Wait there must be must some mistake
On my way right now
Easy dreamer
I can shine even in the darkness
Now it's out of his hands
How long before the other side
They shut the bars down, leave you to the gloom
She's got class and style
Forgotten and
What have we done to each other and tell me, dear
If he isn't in by ten she'll call up her best friend
That I'm the one who has got your back 
When this beautiful cult of desire
On the top of dead man's hill
Never wore Sunday shoes
The war outside our door keeps raging on
We stay until morning, and promise to fight for our fates
And now or never, never made
You hold your heart out in your hand
We're leaving the shadows behind
And tunnel through earth
And though I struggle through the days now
When I'm away she puts her makeup on the shelf
I never said that it felt good to know everything that you needed to know
Of memory
All the wind's at your eyes, at your eyes, at your eyes, at your eyes
I guess that don't matter now
No ploughman's blade will cut thee down
Sure don't know, where you're going
The city you've made on this ocean of sand
That's the way the game's structured, for real niggas to suffer
So take me under the schoolyard, there are kids there who got lost
The autumn leaves have got you thinking
Is she looking for
There are secrets, there are secrets, there are secrets
Back back back in the dark of your mind
Because it brings me back you
There is Emmanuel of mothers 
For a light I think I see
I never wanted to go there again
They swirl in and around one another, creating the beginnings of the storm
Just give me the chance to say that I'm sorry
If you're searching the lines for a point, well you've probably missed it
And suddenly you disappeared
But do it now before tomorrow comes 
And th weight of my mistakes
No doubts left standing
She found her luck in wells and corner stores and jails
Yes, then you have given your soul away
But it's taking forever 
Watch me fall apart
Intoxicate the night
But who needs to see what we've done
Caught in this pool held in your eyes
Hold on to nothing
Because one day out there we will all be
There's one or two things I'd sure like to ask
You flower through my nails and skin
There's no compromising
Say a word or two to brighten my day
Through sheets of jungle rain
Pushed him far away
Soon we'll say good bye
Just drive for the light
In the powers of the earth, we wait until it rips and rips 
When I need true north and some grounding
How much longer can we bleed before we come to our senses again
Always yours
When she drifted off to sleep she had the whole world at her feet
Love one's daughter
To improve, nothing to lose
I'll wait and I'll sit and watch the clouds
das was morgen geschah,
Ma se ti svegli e hai ancora paura ridammi la mano
Now it's such a long way home
Everything, not a thought of you
Crack in the hands of a stranger
This loneliness has got me near
Let me remind
Funny how you see the truth,
I'm prayin' you're gon' make it through the season
And I won't come down for anyone
Taught me I ain't have to incorporate yay in my business
And now the brains are leaving my tomb
I'll wait for it to come down
There is a mother
At least in the dog's mind
I get the final say
Every word that you press against
And I, I wanted to see
J'ai laissé ouverte mes persiennes
Goodbye
Walking cross the floor
As he dreams of a waitress with Maxwell House eyes
Sugar, I wanna taste the way you feel inside
And maybe we're right
She will see it rising
Saw a balloon floating away
The size of men around your house
Beside her I care to linger even though it's not safe
In the tips of my fingers, in the skin on my face
Believe me 
She always said it again
I laugh and pretend
And if I had one wish fulfilled tonight
My body aches for you, and shakes for you
Divining my fate
Please don't tell me I already know
You may have or hold a child
May no man's touch ever tame
Soft haze in the face
es ist geblieben nur dünner
I love the way you smile
If time will set you free
Ride on, ride on
Today
Like the voice that cried on the lonesome tide
A lighter heart A lighter load
For him an old city
This heart of mine, you're gonna own
Ich werd mit Dir sein, an jedem Tag der kommt
Discipline to prevent things when they're older
Life without a moon and stars
And if you could step inside me
Fences divide our land,
Los Angeles, I've been waiting for you
I wish I had knew a
Where we could ride the tides
God talk to me now, this is an emergency
From all the times we ever tried
You're a dipper, a slider, carthorse provider
Drain in the last from a jug
So make the best, make the best of what's given you
Is it safer never to love
When I opened up my eyes see you standing beside our bed
Is losing the one thing that's holding you dear
It's a starstudded event when I valet park
I read that independence was a lightness in your step
Further shame the family name
But you're already underground
But it always, comes back to this
If this was my last day
Nobody ever could make me smile
You can trust and love again
Not to say today
I'll never pay before I go
I don't really understand it
Into the sun hurl them
Ou será um sonho de criança 
I can hear your voice ring in the air
To get what you been missin' come take a trip with me
Rarely seen
Out on the ocean
Pass it like you just don't care
Cracks like pavement
Aus einer Welt, die scheinbar nicht verstummt
When it falls down from the pillow late at night
Come to Drive them away
Erkki lives in tampere, now where the hell is that
On the hour in which I die
I'm downhill standing still at the bottom of Roy
And keep his undercover secret tight
We sing as the sky falls down
This is not the first time
Nobody's busy all the time
And when our day is done, then we shall be one
og vil til bestandighet
When the night air comes to me
That you bought at the grocery store today 
It's come back to me
The gents are gonna try so hard
Projecting what I want is always hard to know
Älä käsilläsi  Not with your hands
And if ya gotta go
Don't be scared it's over now, I swear
Even as my demons leave
Your pop says, your ma says
You know
Cracks and sailors fast and await the sun to show
Really need to say
Smokes in the basement
I walk away
He is drunk, he can't find his apartment
I feel it getting colder
You turn kings into beggars
I want to make much of You, Jesus
Just staring, closed faces
Seven wonders of the world he'll lay before your feet
You have no one on your side, fight your own troubled mind
Generally we are alone in lonely worlds
In Deinen Augen, seh ich das was mir wohl fehlt
Show me the ocean
A spotlight's shining brightly
Round my cold cold neck
Both a beginning and an end 
Der doch dem Meer den Regen bringt
One step at a time,
Businessmen, they drink my wine
Misfortune, got you like a sickness
Die Zeit verging, meine Gedanken wurden klarer
Do you really wanna know
How many songs will I try to write
Make the whole scene gather round come see it my way
Where is your silver touch,
Then you'd leave right away
For you I'd wait 'til Kingdom Come
I used to wait, I used to pray 
And in the morning after the night I fall in love with the light
I'm taking my time
Don't you feel like going home
So you sighed and swept your broom
A million fates turn up, turn down
Why can't I be the simply blue sky
Gonna keep on moving on up to the higher ground
There was an earthquake
We'll never be broken, we won't be denied
That nothing in this world
You gave sense to my life too
But you come over at night and we practice all the breathing
What you wait for never shows
Oh, and when love comes acalling
What I saw when I looked in the distance
Well I don't know I don't know I hope so
Drop a feather in the water
Can't blame you dove, when the blame is mine
And feel desire
That makes us insincere
Nothing clear, nothing bright, nothing I'll feel tonight
This time I won't be caught off guard, just like all of the times before
Try to cry out in the heat of the moment
When I feel the morning grass I let down my guard
You did it so, uh, cheap like
People and places, people in different towns
Aquele tempo que você sonhou 
Keeping out of trouble, never doing nothing
In the crazy world
Now this Hennessey, is gonna' be the death of me
Are you saying things have changed my ways again
It's completely morbid
Clouds look so clear in your eyes
It is still there
Oh it's getting better now
And wiped the sleep from my eyes
Baby, you look so confused, cause it feels like, there was no way we could lose no way, no way
My life is a fleeting one
And I'll never leave like you, that's for sure
You go north walk the good red road
And how we captured knowledge
And make me stay, here with you
Restless Spirits depart
Wearing my jacket
About a girl and a boy
Given away and now she is tired
The light is fading and the sun has gone down
I used to think
Mundo paparazzi mi amore chicka ferdy parasol
Floating over the ocean blue
From this cloudy sky
And I don't know how you smell
I never said thank you for that
And a one last try
And when love comes acalling
A satellite beside me
Got no money left
The weight of the world, already too much to bear
I'm gonna give me a good night sleep
Before your fingers came unwired
Sometimes I think
When I pulled it down, it settled on the ground
Where your shadow blocks your light
As long as you're with someone never left alone
Caught in the headlights of a very mixed up world
Oh, stop, you've got to shake the waist
Doesn't she know he's had such a busy day
Ah, ah, concrete girl
Only they can hear me pray for
And we know you can do more
And as I watch the drops of rain
And I was just a virgin, a baby
Overdosed on herion, died at 
Another mile of silence while I'm
Another breath without the girl I like
When your faith in life is gone,
And torn apart
Like the leaves
First you'll check with the stars
But you know I'll chase you down
Written by Billy Alessi and Bobby Alessi
Now the rain turns into snowfall as the,
 O'Clock you're still sleeping
Fly to the side
Or if I ever will
And I can't wait to be alone with you
I don't know
True love is cruel love
Sunshine, won't you be my mother
The last words
The misconstrued my answers due to the lack of love, reason
In the car park in between my house and yours
Essa menina tá dizendo don't worry
You warned us If you came back and we still on the corners,
I think I should be a little more confident
These foolish things remind me of you
It's a shame the things you hide behind it
Swimming to the surface like a
And it's all right
In the mildness of the spring
And I know why
They can't pin you down, can't pin you down
But without the chill
I hope that you're lonely
For her to open her eyes"
I wouldn't care at all
And her surface will start to break
I've been searching in the pouring rain
And if you start to fall, we will be there
That look on your face
Maybe then I held your hand and kissed you
Started rockin' the sleeve, I can't ball with no Jordans
Jackie é uma menina tão bonita que enjoa
Wenn ich sehe, was mit deinem Mund passiert
But I never will
I will dress you in fine linen, you'll appear like a queen,
Says he's sick of living his life
Ya pasó la eternidad
And it's the fear of you that takes getting used to
Out on your corner in the pouring rain
Back into the womb of the world oh
In Baltimore, the freezing cold, 
I lean back and let my eyes just go
They have faces
My pop's wanna get away from the pain
Backwards, into, the ground
Right now it may not seem like spring at all
But you and I, you and I, you and I know the reason why
You'll make me come to you
She's sleeping 
He calls the wind to guide him on his mission
Break it, 'cause they gon' take it hard if I don't make it through
It's desert ice outside, but this diner has thawed my ears
I know the shape of things to come
Brings Virginity to a close
So we wait for morning
And the balance seems serene
But did I see some value there, or am I going blind
We'll find some way
Placed in your mind to be a better man
Slowin' down
'Cause only you can slow this down
To think I have anything worth boasting in
Ha de servirme alguna vez
There's a man in the street
Its burning fingers rummage through your insides
What's left to say 
I hope you know you'll always be
I need someone someone who hears
It's twelve o clock and it's getting late
Everything I've forgotten looks just like new
Oh, what do you need 
To help you understand
Like dancers in the wind
Fortunes could fall upon your kiss
The coldest hands you've ever held
Baby all the time
I'll see you on the road, ooh
All the things you love
And drowns with the stones
As you float upon the sparkling sands
But I'd sing it from a place of pride
When will I dare to press rewind and start all over
Don't go looking for him now
Dom har gått för att leva sina liv
Look, I know girls love Beyoncé
Gee, baby, hope you don't murder me
I hope to lose myself for good
And I know this place that's near here
I know that I'll find my soul
Before I knew how much it cost to play it safe
 Oh no, man, can't believe that's true
Just because your eyes are open
I took a wrong turn and I just kept going
I sure need a good companion
I undressed you with my eyes I have
Taj Mahal I've come to rest
We waltzed down a moonlit boulevard
Why should you know me
Go slow
And even though I may return
And prayed that maybe
'Guess what These people can get away with that 
And I lost my words
And there's money on the table
Watch me fall apart, watch me fall apart
Patterned always yes, maybe no
'Cause then there's me, could I be the one
Can't do a thing to stop me Dreaming
To live the life you choose
A whisper in the garden of Eden
She was talking with a syllable lisp
A place to be a love to give
Maybe I know somewhere deep in my soul that love never lasts
You laugh and listen to my mind
The excuse that you're crazy is useless
They saved my life
Realized what you gotta do
I can't run forever
Millions without faces, without hope and without homes
Another day goes on by
We could be together saying nothing
Little drops of rain, whispers of the pain
When it's deepest in the ground
Of silences keeping me awake
They quickly come and go
'Cause you know I'll never let you be
And I can get on with mine
Is that I love you so
The way you wanted me
Colors fade in the night sky
When you're down in a hole
s�brent briderlekh, s�brent
You're a mirror with two faces
My name is raincheck, on a golden autumn day
I take Spit over Raymo shit, I'm a vandal
I wonder if you feel the same way too
Please take me under with you
So hard to please you
And they all gotta say what you should and shouldn't do
Sleep in silence, reshape, another way
Oh, we're living in the wild life
At least give me a reason to let go
To lay on his bed
Will your heart still race for me
Elle a mal et toi, tu ne reviendras pas
det kittlar och du såg att jag log
You run the disco infiltrator on down
If I could now I'd freeze time
Nurse asked me what my name might be
You give me cause for love that I can't hide
Your hand's upon a dead man's gun
Early in the morning to come later for a party
Didn't know I was lost
Somehow your baggage comes along 
Man I swear she fine homes, why she always lyin' though
But you'll never see I'd rather cry than have you pity me
Daylight dreamer
grasið verður grænna fyrir okkur
Her sweet incantations lost in infamy
I feel like I've known you forever, baby
Like the last one
Dazed shotgun your stain my way
Guess your death was a lesson in life, it taught me that
How in the morning everything will be all right
If I wasn't that kind
Don't sing that old sad hymn no more
Travel at the speed of light thinking the same thought at the same time
I felt it all, your starry night
I'll wear my sword at my side x
A joke when it's funny, well
Talk to me face to face
You've lost the wisdom deep inside
What's the point of this armor
Stand in the light Stand in the light Stand in the light
My heart's in my chest, you snake
Perfect taste choice and meaning
The things I've imagined do would really quite astound you
Could be the beginning of love
To the slow
The rhythm of a line of idle days
Hit the jackpot rolling through a pipe dream in a knot
I've always been too lame
How you get your adrenaline flowing now
An RCA 'cause I need the parts
And you really didn't know
You know what I know, an' I'm going go
The closer you get, better I feel
She sees herself rising,
Locked behind these wicked thoughts
Baby, they know just what to say
Traded in for a brand new life
Fires burn in autumn skies
Tu cuerpo es una parte
On beaches clean of sand and shell
When the moon explodes or floats away
They tell you from the borders to the waters of the gulf
The day is coming
Her clock is stuck on late, got a first name basis at Eleven
Where' we headed now
You'd swear they never knew you sold your soul to the
Behind the smile I fade away
Pretend life and his wishes
From the corners of my room
Out in the garden where we planted the seeds
When things go wrong I sing along
Ten miles tall in this an empty space 
"Donate now to my rightful cause"
And of all the times we had
Black radio, they won't play though
sonst kommt der Pöbel und nimmt mir alles weg
I know you cry a million tears so I want you to know
I lit my purest candle close to my
And I couldn't put them back
I dreamt that you were by my side
You've got to leave it
I could never come to understand all the powers I had of my own
Once in a lifetime comes
When you're afraid to hit the ground
And my momma swore that she would never let herself forget
It's through the crest on the breast of your school shirt
But I crave the light that he brings
Blue days, all of them gone
Lots of other worlds exist
And if the summer holds a song we might sing forever
As cool as a sigh, as murderous as something you say
And it takes some words to make an action
And months on end go by, in a single week
Har en massa fuffens för sig, jag vet inte vad det rör sig om
Never make an exception 
Like a summer rose, I'm a victim of the fall
Someone to stay in they corner like Mike Tyson
Shore to shore, got some land between
The forests had a rock in it
Will it go on if we start again
Oh how we'd fly
'Cause you were meant for,
'Cause I'm coming DOWN
And these song words have led her to nowhere
Lost my heart in its recipe
I know, I know, I know, I know all the games you play
That another sings Each story unfolds 
Everything you need to be
Reflects across the flatlands with a naked feel off into parts unknown
Whenever we come undone
It was my decision
Despising the grin on the face of the boy
You must be the one
And I won't go away
I don't eat well, I don't sleep well
The lights on the road, are strange and unreal
We just know that the fight ain't fair
Now I just dream about the holidays
You know I tried,
Tip of my iceberg blues are showing
And if you say that you don't care,
So tell me how do you feel
You're shot and you're going down so
So just cry your tears yeah
Down in silence to the ground 
Melt in to the floor
I am moving house
So hard to understand an unstable man
The wave that crashes
We pried open my window
I hope it's not too late that I 
And drive to find the show,
That love walks through
She was alive
With a face full of mixed ability
Some cats didn't make it alive
Oh let me go, old dinosaur
Gettin' down, so deep I nearly drowned
Oh my one, rushing away
'Cause I steal hearts and souls
Intending to outsmart, but I end up in refrain
And they can try hard to make me feel that I 
Deliver me, from all of the madness
I wait for manhood
All the bedroom lights go out
Dinner bell is ringing
Without any doubt
I've only got rejection letters and a sense of impending doom
And there's no way we ever could
Of tears of loves lost in the days gone by
How light can play and form a ring
She was cooler than you
Except for that day
Everything is done
Gone, so gone
I really thought I wanted to go
Yes, that's the end
Where the warm sun shines
I've been in the world
And I ain't never been a buster, always stood on my feet
And when the bride groom comes, there will be noise
I was already dressed when she opened her mouth 
I rode you on a chair and in the shower
And I will bear my soul in time
You want to touch me but you're too late
If you need a friend
Und so verkriech ich mich mit allen meinen Schätzen
If you search it out it will make you strong
Meeting of some notes on a pocket
It's withering and untended
Refuse to acknowledge the truth like the mind of a child
And I've been ridin' on this train so long
Can't tell by the temperature 'cause it's always warm
Barefoot on the floor
When you and I will leave the night 
I see clearly what you are, what you are
So sturdy up sturdy up your heart for the road is long ahead
And my eyes hurt, hands shiver, so you will listen when I say baby
And all the cold shoulders that the slightest draft lets in
I would not have come home this year
Please hold me back
Safer than it was
I know you're somewhere still alive 
There's mending for my soul
From lust to truth
I stay
And if you think you know
And the howling so loud that it alone drowns out the inside of me
Making love with somebody
I'm walking on the salty air
Will you just laugh and tell me that I've got it wrong
I have never reached such heights
Mourning, I've done my time here
And if you see her, tell her it's over now
Of the living people breathing the air today
When all my will is gone you hold me sway
Under a moment your eyes turned blue
I'll give you more to own than all of this
das war dein Leben an das ich dachte
Except for Your name
So you can rest and repair
Who's gonna say goodnight
To the rules 
Over and over, you wanted me play
Now this one is ours
But I know a girl twice as hard
How could you be so, cold as the winter wind when it breeze, yo
Ich war so froh über die Freundschaft mit Tara
You never have been sane
I know the signs
Somehow, some way
To keep the dream alive
Picture me in a boat on the sea
One thing is constant that I'll BE HERE for you
Toi, tu crois déjà qu'elle chancelle et chavire
Lost loves unconscious, made conscious out of the darkness
If I belong to somewhere, it's to your arms, Kery
You never ever leave my mind
Hold me in your arms tonight; Hold me in your arms
Wonderin' who to blame next, low this
So what am I gonna do with my time
Everything's cluttered and pretty
I give much more than I'd ever ask for
A thought enters your mind
While loudspeakers play soft music
And the naked bone of an echo says
My mother doesn't love you
When you are near, I feel so far away from the person I am
I know I'll put up a fierce fight
It's hard to beat the system
To try and move
Trouble loves me
Dig up a bone
To love
If I fall, if I fall, if I fall will you catch me
Laten we samen 
I will cry everyday
It could have been a sign but I don't believe in signs
Even the warriors are always great at night
There's no way out, no way out
Dated some stars but respect their privacy
Oh there's more left to life, Mona Lisa
I won't stop, won't mess my groove up
Show me all your manly mystery
The world of two
And said "Good luck, I hope heaven and hell
And hums in soft sweet undertones
There's been a long honeymoon
Summer close behind 
When I love you
They say Spain is pretty though I've never been
For my ride over to your house each night
It keeps the days alive and makes the hours fly
Chris Schwartz, RuffHouse, he was the best man
And the older that we get
I'm back and I'm throwing
Because I can't give you what you need
Is the time before each new word
Jagged vacance, thick with ice
He comes dividing man from brothers 
The right words
Let the pain burn away from our heart
And if we had to talk, what could we say, sitting side by side
How strange, how sweet, to find you still 
While you hold mine, I cannot wait
Darling I feel you under my body
Thanks for the song Mr Knight
Oh no, his pants are too tight
Dig deeper
There's only so much that our heart can grow
But there's a total lack of splendor
vajra baua maha samaya sattva
And I found you in a trailer on the camping grounds
It's playing with my heart
It's so confusing
And she has to walk straight home
Dad is the moonlight
She's allergic to "I Love You"s and staying in one place
Il n'est pas
I'm here, all alone
She's only one life away
If you want to hold on to the first girl that you meet
Is the time before action occurs
May no man's reigns ever chain you
And he knew where the pillow goes
Found my brother's badge
Such a long, long time
Your meloncholy song
Do you know where she's gone
It's as pure as snow
The truth is, we say not as we do
We were free to be everything we dreamed
It'd be better to forget you
Hey, where the hell are you, you don't call me back, John
And in my heart I hope that you will fall for me again
Kanske något illegalt eller så är han väldigt social
I'll roll away alone
Entertaining, thoughts are raining 
Were the only thing could guide her gold
'Cause I let go from all I know 
Life owes nobody hapiness
Next time I'll try
Then this is where I can't get back from
If I could fly, I'd be coming right back home to you
Our gun was still smoking
jeder wurde für den anderen so durchsichtig
Whoa, what are we gonna do
My world is turning too fast
Forgettin you a man first, chasin the fame
Lord a fresh young breeze 
Stop, you can't believe what you believe
Sometimes you're up, sometimes you're down
We've got a picture of Jesus
Like the more that I breathe
I've seen the world, done it all
So let's go hold your baby's head
Felt a pull I pulled away
Keep these feelings, no one knows
A climbing moon upon an empty sky,
Out of you, but NASA is on your side
My soul is weak, 
Weaving tapestries over your eyes to prepare the landscapes for disaster
Happy to see it says nothing about us 
Coming down with a sickness
Cold, on my mind, yeah
You're the one I like best, you retain my interest
To pull our earth back round again
The river met the sea again
Weather shades drawn, either side a storm rages on
I never needed your corrections
I no longer see the rings of rain
I za was, i za siebie 
So don't get tangled up
I wanna ride with her
I cut myself on barbed wire, getting wood for the fire
You're in my thoughts, you're in my head again
You're only in your way
In search of inspiration
And watch the moths dive down
God bless that smile on your face
I can smell the grass, and touch the flowers
I never knew just what it was
Found out the hard way that was powder that they were tootin'
And we shiver
So swan pond, oh swan pond
They have written in my soul
Set free this soul of mine
And left me cravin' for more summer wine
I'll be with you till we grow old
Just let them drift through your mind
Fever turn the lights out
Never come around 
There's something I'm ready to say
I'll try to be kinder and be more attentive
There's poison in your veins
Can't get you off or out of my 
Because this boy is now a man,
Really cut us down to size
And so be the morning
Could be the biggest mistake that a man can make;
Born without a name
Making fools of all the neighbors
Decorative rocks, we'll fight all their rentacops
Just get out and do your best
We can't hide the end
That's when it starts hittin the fan and it gets real in this bitch
Put your hands on my back
And your progony's brave, their tract house waiting, preplucked and prepaved
Who can she turn to when the chance of coincidence is slim
Yet standing in a pool of light
He's never asked for a favor or the money yet
And I never knew you from the sun
No one's heart attack
Waiting around about to crack
And drift away in a dream
Chorus extended
If I didn't know you, I'd rather not know
How you're supposed to keep it all inside
To the arms of my lover
Elle a des fleurs et elle pleure son coeur est pris au piège
She passed by and said goodbye to him
He gathers them into his palm and then he sings "Another day"
Where no one sees nothing
I can't relate to my predicament
Until it comes again, until it comes again
That although  years had past
I'll be around
Turn left at Carmen's Avenue 
These are the ones
Smiling across a friend's friends
All of us are falling
Her eyes on fire 
Ain't got no place to be
Beauty never dies
The road I walked home in the rain Walked home in the rain
I got that swagga back, I got that swagga back
But when you touch me I forgot and then I couldn't stop
Don't want it to change
And we'd lay there in the darkness
But certainly I hate your sin"
Met Paul, he wore some big glasses
What you get is what you got
Lets drive until we hit the sky
So bring the discrepancies, I'll pour the drinks
Without crying
She thinks I'm having a bad dream
But nothing could be further from the truth, my love
And there's lights up in the north
The murdered thing
It was just another way of saying 
Things will never be the same again
Things you've had to face, what you have seen
She goes down on her knees and prays 
So I won't say
'Cause tomorrow, you just don't know
So don't ever don't ever, don't forget
Across your heart, across your mind
Falling in love with the shivering engines 
Nobody knows where they are going
And you'd just go free
Do you think that you could see your way
I'll know
Avoir l'air d'aller plutôt bien
You promised me everything, you promised me thick and thin yeah
I'd be howlin' out a song in the back seat
You gave me the kiss of my life
Because you're young, sharp as a knife
If you can't sleep, I'll be there in your dreams
Oh I know it's hard but you stay with me, oh oh, we've got a memory
That you're never going leave me
Waiting on the world to change
Uptight when I look at your changing ways
Were people like us
For you around
You will come back home when I call
Rich man's comfort
But there's a ghost in my heart
Young men never die
Oh why But sometimes I'm the night
All the money I owe to my friends
There are tales of good fortune that couldn't be planned
Way beyond the searchlight,
Just to write one simple song
Farthest ends of me
Got a mouth full of opinions and most are wrong
The teenage terrorists freeze
There is no doubt in your eyes,
The orange was the size of a watermelon to me
And I heard the third one say
You keep stayin' on my mind
We can write stories 'bout the journeys that we made
If I could have one more chance
That puts a fight into me, you push me and I just can't let it roll, roll
The dance reminds me of a life that we once knew
The swamps and the prairie dogs, the Joshua trees
To make them want to glance your way
Put the pillow under your head
I got things that you should see
Du weißt um die Welt, die du mir erschliesst
And When you find your heart, you'd better run with it
Just remind me
When her wings spread she heard their song
And all my love's in danger
No voy a endurecer
And you believe in loneliness
I hear these voices in my head competing
On this day
Lock down inside
I lost my mind, I lost my life
Until the morning comes 
Oh, I know it's hard but you stay with me, oh, oh
Sure we'd met in another time and place met in another time and place
We carved the days from the hours
When you cut that dude with just a little mania
I'm out on a beach, sat on a rock
Trying to stay calm
I got my custom kicks, I got my Jesus chain
And it may be a trick of the firelight
The grass is screaming long
I'll remember who you are 
I built a wall inside out of a lie
Of having to stop
Be loved in return to the end of your days
Dust in a moment
Everybody thinks we're wrong
Loving you makes the whole world change
I know that just now I ain't been showin,
Ever turns out right
We gonna listen to some Isley Isley
Arid mouth so hard to speak
Will you wait for me All I wonder
Maybe she wants me, but who am I to tell"
But here on these shores
All my children can become me
Falling in love with the weight of the water 
I've got you a brand new weapon l
Empty winds scrape on the soul
The second I do, I know we're gonna be through
For God must know
"Sometimes to keep it together
And I set down onto love
His hatred to become
Now, I see winter's dawn
You are self professed, you snake
It just existed in your head, the reflection used wasn't you
y hasta perdoné tus equivocaciones 
She set my schoolhouse on fire
For the things you've done,
'Cause baby I wouldn't pay no mind
And there's no place and I can't wait 
You said you don�t have to speak
Tugging on the string, a travelin' thing in my soul
Racist, pointin at me look at the niggaracci
There's a name that plays in my head
Sä olet maa, mä olen kuu
And my sex life has all been plagiarized
It rained because I took the dust of
Complacency is lost for now
Hang it up now or never, oh yeah
Oh the things you'll be happy
Thieves will always say
But there are more and I'm gonna show
'Cause it's all you can be
And the depths of the sea
They were once in your eyes, but you sneezed them out while sleeping
This is my home
Part of the job of being a man
But he's such a man
How come it's always dark when you're around
EvaIvaOvaAvaline
And I will not stay with you
I got my swagga back
Now my empty arms are of no use
Go slowly don't wake me don't shake me up
Cheap lovers make expensive wives
Who I wanted to be talking to
We're alone again
You loved me once upon a summertime
It's the fairies' revenge they say
Fell with a silence
But now you're lit up by the city
And we make love beautifully
No, you can't do a thing to stop me
But it won't come down for anyone
'Cause he is stopping you
I tell you sad stories about my childhood
I got the baller genetics, baby, this evidence
Að lífið hér var hart enda var ég það sem á
You can say no to being a night looker, boy hooker, rent boy, bro, hoe
Found on a beach picked up in your hand held so close
Feel the presence all around
Down the street from Calumet, a school for the Stones
She's underage and so very very brave
Everybody knows that it really doesn't matter at all
Like your hair and your face and your smile
Written in your hand
With that blood coming down his chest
bei diesem Seiltanz am Boden
Her lush eyes show surprise
And I could have done so many things, baby
It breathes, it is my friend
Know your own name
True colors, true colors
Now it's dead on the dancefloor
When you tell me that she stayed out, all alone
Imagining that you are here with me
Up all night 
And as I wonder where you are
No other love could stem the tide
When we go to sleep and wake to another brand new day
Because of you I knew how it felt to be loved
I disappoint you, I can see through your perfect smile
And don't you worry I'm completely fine, I'm fine
I'll be on your street
So go on genius be who you are
I feel like I'm losing my mind with no concept of time,
And I can't breathe when you cry
And you're back out on the street
Let's see who gets down
Now if I've learned anything in my years my years
They fly the colors of their homes
If nothing changes then I'm gonna stop 
Hey makes it alright
Because you were on my mind
It all just seems like yesterday
And though I really tried, I never have been good
By myself I am singing their song
And now he'll go home to his wife for tea
Yeah, I'm alright
It's not that I don't want to be with you
She said, "let's stop the car and slow dance,
I got yours and I love you
But I'm quite alright hiding today
With this heart I will sing to you,
Like big rag dolls just cursing at the walls
But what when all your fields are rotten, your waves of grain, amber waves of grain
Que un mar de pasión
Give me your hand
You enter the room
Up and away he gone away
It's not a sign of weakness when you're searching
The sun has never seen
It's been the same since I don't know when
I don't care what you're into, I'll put
You carried me onto the fields
Background songs
Where do we sunshine, where the heavy rain
My ṗremonition of the world comes to me
Officer
Swept back to me
By saying, "I love you" and nearly meaning it
Will crumble into dust
It's so beautiful to me, it is everything I see
The way you make a mess
I heard the train, but not for certain
There's no money back guarantee on future happiness
Just a boy passing twenty
Deep in thought I forgive everyone
Ain't jealous of, now, now, the way you're living
And today, I leave you
All of the ups and downs, the highs and lows 
Vet hut, Fredrik Åkare, skäms gamla karln
If you don't believe me ask yourselves
Oh in your eyes there's a sadness enough to kill the both of us
How my days they spin me 'round
Parts of myself
Five thousand miles I'm away from you
The word frozen on
Give me your night,
The leaves were paths of skeletons
Yes it always, comes back to this again
And the breeze takes us deeper and further into the heart of a moment that is gone
Since I just can't remember
You will walk away the freest man
You left your dark horse in the stable
I took the keys from Maudlin Street
Aim for the burning sun
Just when you were calling her love that day
And it's like every time you look at me
Should I write myself out of the history books
'Cause this is the first song but definitely not the song
Just won't let you put the days to bed
Down to the end with you
She was so beautiful to watch drifting out into oblivion
I'm tired of fighting so I'll demolish
Concrete girl
I wanna be near you
Give my life until it all runs out
Hush don't you make a sound
And don't it feel all right, and don't it feel so nice
Don't you write it down
This is a warning
That I want those things you could never allow
A woman's night is filled with dreaming,
For our long and falling face,
Now you're too tired to care
We all have a chance to murder
I sometimes wish I'd stayed inside
Water's getting harder to tread
On the day of her arrival
Oh it makes me cry in bed"
And may leave those memories you've gotta let them go
As a girl can be 
It ain't gonna hurt now if you open up your eyes
As the scene unfolded, truth got moved away
Down one to all the hopes and cares
I can't wait to be alone with you
Ob die Winde Botschaft bringen
Paperclips, memories
You can't believe them
Than they ever would do in a jar
I won't let you down
I wanna live like we live in the summer
You know this could be something
Les yeux sans visage your eyes without a face
Op mijn nattedromenwang
Our bodies are exploding
So long have been sleeping violently
We are survivors
But I don't want to be like this
Taking one day at a time
Han för och hon följer så lätt som en vind,
The cannonballs fly 'round my head
Until it disappeared
All my friends,
The eyes are bright, he couldn't wait to get away
I can't sleep 
These parts of life that I cannot hold
When the game starts and one person's left out, it used to be me
Il mondo va veloce e tu vai indietro
Too late to turn back now, I'm running out of sound
Stepping into muddy water
Time to be with somebody else
We're never afraid and the consequence opens the door
Such spirit through the year
Hypnotised by the law of motion
Now I see that my world has only begun
The ground is falling under me,
The way the moon
Happen when you're asleep
"Oohweeee man" without your sunshine
That's the way
But the feeling does come back again
Chirping birds
I have heard the songbird pipe his note 
Whose love is this 
True, I need to be in love
To touch 
Remember love how it was the same
You hang on but you're falling through
Ne me quitte pas J'connais l'titre
Strange speech dirty human elements to question
It overwhelms my breaking heart
Don't you hear any voices crying
I'm a traveller  with one last mile my journey is complete
The straight line
If I could open my eyes I wouldn't do it
I took my time
Voit mennä, en pelkää ollenkaan
I pay the check and leave the change from a crumpled tendollar bill
I saw up on the screen all the stones I throw
Different people I've found
Breaking into pieces
I said don't get upset 'cause it's not a catastrophe
Today is gonna be the day
It's clear already, I will never be good for you
There's some sorrow in every life
Guiding light
I got a brand new set of stencils
There's a whole world outside your window pane
Your ankles and I'll
I cling to you tonight
Could this ever be
Dear Lord, when I get to Heaven
Hope you're safe and sound, not alone now
Got the skin and the bones
Don't you know you're
She's all right, let's me waste another song
Than to bear the pain
It's a fucking swarm of bees
I wanna feel that love with you
When I got scared you were by my side
And bitter sometimes
Summer, Summer, Summertime
Feels the way I do about you now
I dream of all day long 
Never, never
I know that you do not feel invited
There are others that are strapless
Pretending life is sweet
The past is still the past
I'll hang this dream up on display
Tell 'em what you're here for, you don't know
I'm gonna miss the way I kissed you
And I've seen the ones that come get reduced to bones and rags
Complaining "Women only like me for my mind"
Your face is inerasable
A woman's heart is filled with lust,
Vanhan runontekijän sanoin
So don't be afraid, to let them show
To hope it's not too late, I hope it's not too late
Now that your leave is over
I should care if the wind blows east or west
Do we stop, do we stop in frame
Till we came back down
And warmed his hands by the fire
It's all up to you, use what's been given to you
Such a little thing, anyway
I was so full of you
Give me your heart I'll open it up
By no means average
And hum the dial tone
So take my hand
Now it's buried under sadness and guilt
Never felt, never felt, never, never felt
I'm swimming round in circles
A tortured soul
Hey love I am at the point of no restraint
Frozen in a secret space
Stumble through the years, I'll make it heaven, make it hell
They know they're safe with me 
Now that I know I'll never feel the same way
You stop and I'm in over drive
Do sleep securely free from love or hate,
Some words are just unspoken
Say hello to the shrinking in your head
For their last goodbyes
Next thing you know
The way they tried to do in the last centuries
This is how my day begins
And I wait for you so patiently
To take the bitter pill
Must I still be learning
And I don't know if you feel my flow
And I'm leaving her never
The first thing that meets the eye
But in darkness, I'll always see those eyes
Wide world
Tell me what you are thinking and guide me
And I said venice
To be alone for now
Oh, starry are your spheres, delight
Seen all good things and bad
All our friends been acting strange
Who's gonna make you fall in love
Thinking of you and the love I got
Blinded by the cold
Lessons I've learned
A little underhand
Last night I heard you whisper
By now, you should've somehow
A place you can't see, can't see
But darling
Your heart was pure like youth and all it's charms
I wish you knew
No one should see this
But alas they are not now mine
Yeah I've been feeling everything
I've seen the future and the end is here
She's the only thing you've ever seen
Though I am the reason
But every year it gets a little bit harder
Holy, holy is his sacrament
Come back home
Save it and it ends up wasted 
You remember when 
Until my day my day is done
But you already know that because you used to ride with me
Tu mente lla no sabe a donde ir
And who wouldn't have done all of that
Je creuserai la terre
So in love, so in love
When it fact you were the one long ago
To lose me to this bed
Just send your heart beat, I'll go to the blue ocean floor
To hold her back would be a sin
Is it unfair to ask you
I've got it going X
Multicoloured, barely reputable
Water and glass
Imagining somewhere
¡Calle ya a ese perro no lo agunato se lo ordeno
Then I drew your eyes very blue
The night
'Cause we'll be there before too long
I've become amused
Will you see me in the end
You're the one who loved my tired bones
I'd stroll around in synthesis
Turn the headlights on full
Forget we're dead
That there's something that she knows and could teach you
I'm not scared of death
It's tying you up while you're fadin' into your lie
And the moon is so full
They can't pin you down, whoa, they can't pin you down, whoa
You're just throwin' it all away
And hold it till the end
The water makes its way 'round it
You took a long time to make it
Is the burden of the blame
Baby never act wild
As they steal your best memories away
Chorus X female singer
Down, to give over control, the soul's solely yours
Some will try a trick, but you just look them in the eyes
Build an island between me and you
She rubs against the weatherbeaten frame and asks the angel for his name
Then you moved away
I wait in the shadows
Would someone take these guns away from here
Grey steel holes
He says my destiny
You must leave I understand
And I'll promise to fight the wind and waves for you
They'll play it on the radio all week long
When does the ice break
I have a love for you that nothing hides
That you couldn't help but care
But darkness descends once more into my life
I will lose my heart in the sand 
Trying to quiet the unrest
We're as cryptic as the moon
They'll be firs to turn their backs away
That's taking place
My guiding light
And everything will be fine
But on and on from the moment I wake, to the moment I sleep 
Felt like I was almost signed when the shit got cranked
But I know you
Please believe me when I say
I got a letter from a dear friend of mine
It's you and me now against this whole wide world
The taste of something that good
To say you don't understand
But I'd be begging you to stop and stay
Things are never twice the same anyway
To what I did and said
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer 
So in love, love, love, love,
Trying to feel what's coming next
I need someone I leave through the front door with
Elle a mal et tu ne t'imagine même pas
Lips pressed to my neck
And though I hate this, I'll still want you,
Make me feel so much hate
I lift my head up and I face you
I'm filling in the empty spaces
I was standing on the edge
So I'm hoping that you'll fall in love again
I used to think the world, could be so kind
And now all this time
I can't pull myself back from
Here is nothing left for me
You'll never know it's there
There's still a path I haven't wandered
Now you go your way, BABY, and I'll go mine
Oh, I hope you don't mind
To loving arms of my savior
From the dream come the vision
Sometimes a dream is all that we have
Or did you trade it for something, somewhere, better just to have it
So I've changed my plea to guilty
I�m a man on a mission and I�m all about her
The taste of your lips says we shouldn't have met like
Now I'll have to go back to that place I know best
Blasting their treble tones
I would warm him on my breast 
And she's wiping tables down
Don't try to make it work for me
With a tongue of secrets
For I know that there's a man inside the boy
Ask her if she wants to stay awhile
They say it takes a ring of gold
That I don't thank god
Sounds go through muscles
Combing your hair
Now anything you ask me for is yours
You know my father, the bartender
I was about mine, fantasize housebuying
But what I can't carry is my love for you
I can identify
No need to run, no need to hide
What are we if we're not in love
Just that burgundy smile you wore yesterday
Still we're deep in each other's hearts 
When I drive
The time is right, to begin
California, I hope that it wakes you
Copenhagen, you're the end,
Spend the day with my angels at the beach
How come I can walk for miles, and still just love You
The world is gone
Full of love and new desire
*Heim acoustic version Fjarlægur draumur rættist
Don't call me on the phone
'Cause it's all that I've known
Rocking, rocking, rocking, yeah yeah yeah
All the cuts and bruises suffered in whose name
Gumdrops and Saturdays
Can I just say I don't fear the light,
Cause your eyes tell me the truth
Hold my head high and walk away
Life was full and fruitful
If it was my last day here on earth
Mais tout ce qui s'est passé
I wish that I could make them stop
Running wild, running blind
A crystalclear canvas is my masterpiece
I think I hear the bells ringing in the square
You know you've got to
Was like a kiss upon the lips,
Safer than it was two years ago
A Young girl give me a good luck charm
Oh, is it a dream
It's a mighty mean and a dreadful sorrow
Lay my head against my pillow
You've never left me, have you
No solid ground to walk on
And I bring to you, lover, when I sing to you
A moonfaced memory with eyes downturned
Kiss me like you wanna be loved
Of how complete I used to be
I have never reached such heights
And the rainfall
Some days like rain on the doorstep
Snares for my hopes snares for my thoughts
And just when you think she's that one in the world
But I swear you wouldn't be so lonely
I won't forget
'Cause I am a fire escape
When you fall asleep
Pushing phat rides, it's no surprise
Then I won't understand till the end of my days
You wasted life, why wouldn't you waste death x
Make make me make you want to sing along,
The days are getting shorter
Oh, when will you wake up and get it
So small a turning
And all the while it's free as air
That's the thought of a single day, without your head in my hand
There's two days, I had to leave
So I'll send you my words
While you hold mine I cannot wait
If I catch 'im, I'ma kill 'im, I made it my business
Just like it's climbed right out of my
She fills their mouths and warms their souls
A girl arose that had red mournful lips
There is a voice inside of me, I don't know
Humming a sad forgotten song
Strange fruit hanging from the poplar trees
Les mots ne viennent pas
Sick of sickness You're unkind and a liar
The lost cause kids are okay
All I want, all I need
How should I stay calm
Will it ever change
It seems it's been such a long time
But there's pressures from inside
And I knew somehow when you looked up and over me
Des malentendus
*Translation Let it be your will that my words of my mouth and the meditations of my heart come before you, God my rock my redeemer
Said please don't follow me
Once again someone cries
Some passing of family, frustration released
And please don't fall in love with someone new
A vial of hope and a vial of pain
Do you see it's no ice on my wrist
So she drives by the station 
Everyone's around, you stayed in tonight
So I ate Minithins to stay awake
This is just farewell and not goodbye my friends
Is everything we have
There's a love between us still
Is this what you wanted in life
And my words won't be done, They'll never be done till the end
When vitality is far gone
Spend my love, heart broke
A pure and simple honesty
L'étonner, changer de refrain
Down we fall
These days I don't hear you talk so loud
Don't acknowledge my smile when I try to say hello to you yeah
And I picked my way through elms
So I turn myself back to you
The nights are endless things
I'm thoroughly wasted
Keep it or just let it fall
The ones I made friends with
I take a dive and go as deep as I can go
We've had our doubts but now we're fine
als wären sie verliebt
My people no stronger
No more ribbons on their door
Refaire la chose que je préfère
She closed her eyes and she gently bit her bottom lip
You ready for the world girl, baby come on go with me, I touch you all over your body baby don't say no to me
I been down, I been worse
That makes the protections I've built around my pseudo world premiere
Paske nap we demen
And we stood where no one has stood 
And once in a while
To shine a light on your life
Or maybe as sure as
And I wish you Sunrays and Saturdays
No lifelong friend
So I offer myself and I'll just give until there's nothing else
And if so I hope it left a sunny day through your window
First whose heads are gonna drop
And then I can come down to the harbour
When I look in the mirror, you're the only thing I see,
To take your pain away
But you can't stand and wait on a miracle
So open up your heart and let this fool rush in
Tell my family and friends how much I love them all as well
Hey man, what's your style
And I built a home
Wait 'til we're somewhere closer to a lake
Just open up your heart and let this fool rush in
These lovers they ain't the game
Have to tell you that I love you so much these days, it's true
Always dangerous, she got me down on my knees
And I just hope that I have mine
The crowd waits
I won't fade away
So I find the time to write
Falter, no faltering now
Just rewind, it's all in your mind
As the pages turn, my eyes are glued
I look in
The door opens into your eyes
Let her have some fun
With you by my side
We'd fix the past and pave the way
Brother of mine, we'll be singing someday
All the cracks you see can be repaired
Everybody's talkin' 'bout the situation
It takes the one to have the other
Why can't you guess how I want to be loved
For I'll wed no man, so you must be refused;
If we could rewind all that's happened
And if I catch myself crying
We've got a dead ball in our court
Goin' away
Still I can see the light
It's another grey autumn day
Tell me lies
May your garden be sweet
Just because you feel, hollow inside it's real
We lost our world
I got none today, expecting none tomorrow, and tomorrow after that release the strings of nashville, and watch the songs expire
Things won't get better that way
During the day we could'nt talk about
And go high like the mountain tops
I'm here soaked right to the core
This road with my eyes closed 
This comforts so deciving all common sense aside This world wonders grieving but from the depths we hide 
It's not easy for a blind man, to see the Sun
And every piece will be consumed
Don't you worry I'm completely fine, I'm fine
Ko morehi no shita de 
He used to say so strong unafraid to die
I cannot guess what we'll discover
I dig down deep when I say "I love you"
Like a little bit of revelation
On a horse made of clouds, you will scatter the sands
I have seen a true nightmare
Just a moment in time
Everywhere empty roads
I thought it would be nice just to visit my grave
hon har sitt bo ovanför mitt huvud
And I have loved you beautifully"
'Cause every time that I try you will question me
When we're far away
More than you'll ever know
And a world at the window
And tonight, how their light sets me dreaming
Because before too long you'll be a memory
To do everything you wanted to
Desperation's the tenderest trap
'Cause I been missin' you
We'll make a future dream be ours
From being another loser helpless at her side
He knew, he knew
And though you cry at night
We'll never see her again
Nature will get her way
She's falling hard for me, I can see it in her eyes
And there ain't no place to hide
Oh the ultimate late night
Open your eyes, you're now a bird
Can you still remember
In situations it can be so bright
Lonely ain't lonely, someone calling at the door
Hoping what you need is behind every door
I love the way it's happening now
Only place she ever went to lose herself,
Every little day
Now it's all gone, one, two, three
But he could see over his shoulder
I was never one to solve whatever has gone wrong
Then watch your fear just turn into relief
No I never meant to hurt you
I feel weightless numb and sore
Around the fire, here we go
My love, I treasure you
I'm a fool for that sound in your sighs
Now I'm bordering bored
The buses are kneeling
Rookies around us, aren't you glad you found us
Because they gargle with the finest champagne
True, it's all in my dreams
Linked like dog to man
I don't fade away, I don't fade away, unless I want to 
Before we've sailed all the seas
Who knows
I feel every second is a life time long
'Cause when you're done with this world
Right through the crest on the breast of your school shirt
Clareando a aduana
Well there's a light
What are we going to do
I gave you all of my money
All I do is keep the beat, the bad company
Always watch them with bright eyes
Take up your wings
To strangest hand
And I swore I'd never lay like a log
I desperately try to remember
With your little head down in your hand
You sit on the bed
To make you want me
Were oh so vast and quick as I was on my own now
I know I can fly
'Cause I don't know if I can do this alone
A  domiciles fixes de Brest à Budapest
Well I'll never love you but I've got words to say
Sometimes I get so tired,
Feet on the ground
And I'll be outside, waiting for you
Du bist, was mich am Leben hält
For so were her father and mother before
When there's nothing to lose, there's nothing to win
That the ship will still sail on
In my skin
Everyone's a stranger
I'm gonna build somebody else
And you're talking about things
Red silver suns in your belly
The wind that cracks the leaves
And letters
The Upper Peninsula and the television news
I'm wandering
I've a feeling you won't look at me that way
They're the ones who'll spit at you
I know how you feel
You bite your tongue or chew your meat
Thrift store shirts and old haircuts
Tied up and changed
Con tiempo veras
The moment they got me to try
Me quedará el silencio para conversar
Do I start to feel like I'm losing myself
In the shape of a heart that they cut out of stone
When I said you looked good baby
When the sky is burning
'Cause round for round,
Than he walks to boozery
I've got a hundred million dollar friends
If you go my way you won't go wrong
Another year is stalling
Tied up in twine with the dead and the dying 
I want to meet them tomorrow
Do you notice I can't focus
I've heard them calling my name
Wearing wool sunglasses in the afternoon
Holds me down
I watched you grow up from babies on the floor
And the early dawn cracks out a carpet of diamonds
For nearly two decades this vendetta has raged
I know that you are liquid, for I'm the governess of alone
I miss you when I can't sleep
I want you to pick up the phone
This adrenaline rush is keeping me high
I'm getting nervous, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
und es zusammen zu ficken
She sits late at night by the light of a candle
Everyday in every way I'm falling
Since you've been around
He said, "Boy, are you ready to die"
Ain't nothin' that stays the same
About to rain down tonight
When he decided he was through with love
Et moi j'accoursMais comment te dire
I don't care who you run with, or where you from
Void of all the anger and the fear
That's the council for you every week
And tell me how do you feel
You may have been one
All for this child of mine
They need foregiveness
I must make it very clear
All of my life I've been in hiding
Outlaw man
Some people say that rappers don't have feelings
Give me the chance to say that I'm sorry
Clouds drift through his mind as he walks by
But I watched you going under
Above the line of the tress,
Who walk like dreamers
Some day it will just fill you
For all leaves and winds
These crooked legs, these twisted arms, these tired feet lost their worth 
Why don't you come here and stay with me
It's just for tonight
To show you what I have inside,
Turning to fall, I owed all my life
Don't always need to do it by yourself
My bones are inside
Niech trwa to przenikanie
Feel like things will turn out right
Myrkytän omani
Who can't decide which book to read unless the paper sows the seed
Feeling shyer, I'm feeling shyer
We come so close
If I may 
But it broke my heart
Because you instantly felt warm
I hope you stay
To show who's wrong from right
Barely conscious in the door where you stand
So I'll cry and people will stop and stare
But I believe in love I guess
And I woke up in the kitchen sink
Keep bumping into walls and taking lots of falls
I'll show you how it feels to be fucked up like me,
From the comfort of your burning beds
You're gonna let me down
They're not part of your close surroundings
They're hard at work, but they're hardly workin',
You wouldn't want to go to Amity Gardens again
Must have been morning that stole them
Mojique thinks of days before Americans came
So I walk away,
That could blow your head off
When it feels right and it's wrong
Words of hope and words of spite
All this I know
I breathe the body deep
Put up the house and bet the odds if it's coming from me
I once was fooled by cadillacs and honey
Let's say sunshine for everyone
Behind the frontlines
She says it's the best place in the world
Every day breaks, bitter river was a flood
His words shine bright like the sun
You close your eyes
My heart is full, and my door's always open
Asked to stop
Nahnahnahnahnahnah I hope I see you on the other side
And now shades become shadows in your light
I wrap my hands around his neck
Get a voice, don't get a doctor
Hey little one, think about our time
I'm trying to break this memory
When they made the new milk turn
I've seen the waters that make your eyes shine
Evey scar and weal
I can't move lives
An den Tag in meinem Leben
That's what you told your mother, didn't you
You keep leading me all the way home
Höllenqualen sind egal,
But time is like the ocean
Great waves of progress shall wet the air
y te llevaste el cenicero
City bird, haven't you heard
Shake it out, static anonymity
Almost anytime
You're always amazed 
Pin my arm to the wall
Compassion for your pain
Baby, you're the only one that can save me
Because freedom is wasted on me
Days are going faster than I ever could keep up
They converge on every side
I wanted to tell you how I feel
Towering trust, insatiable lust
And solemnly swear when there's love in the air
And I think you need it too
That I don't appreciate your love
I would've gotten much more
That one day you're gonna regret it
Happy it was you I'm photographing
Your heart is way beyond capture, flitting like a fly catcher
Alone I stand alone I fall
Like words in a letter sent
Fell from the sky, heaven replied
I was a teenage spaceship
One step at a time
What did you do
To the place you are from
Don't you fly
In a sleeping bag fajita
That I'm so easy to please, so easy
Beauty everywhere
Give me the chance to say that I'm sorry
Changed my mind so much I can't even trust it
When we were all friends
So come on in, take me on
She took my silver spurs a dollar and a dime
Hit the pass
And you couldn't if you wanted now
And there's no one to break the fall
I only did what I had to
Likewise in your eyes that find me here
But I push him away
Lost in a dream
He fell in love with his best friend
Never been so existent
And the shadows come to stay
I can't understand, no, I can't understand
Over and over the need needs food will human weakness
That things are reminding me of you
Vor dem, was du liebst
Or maybe it's not at all 
Through one thousand lives
Lower them down
It's alright 
So when I die, I hope I live in the sky
Bring a Coleman lantern and a radio
Ideas unconscious, made conscious out of the darkness
They look like they gonna fight
Je t'ai montré mon arrièretrain
Suddenly is soon, sooner than you think
One side is made, the other side too soon
And you say that I'm weak, so show me the proof
This damn machine, this damn machine, this broken head doesn't work 
Blinking and blind in the light
But to outplay is not to love 
She's yours anyway
Like they used to do
Out in the moonlit sky
But I'm going downtown like I still care
I've searched the world
They went down to the dance and grind
Will never rest
You're by my side, but are you still with me
Keep watching over Durin's sons
For a few days I am the only one
Ice in the rigging and howling wind
I'd gladly swap places, if they care to dive
I know you've been away, and it can break you down
Scales were gone and faces lighter
Hiding in the forest
I kill a magical child
The world is just illusion, trying to change you
What's so amazing that keeps us stargazing
Darling I know I'll be found
And maybe two is better than one
So I've come to decide that fate is telling me you will not go
Many with the notion that to share is to lose
There is still a house, a cage
Well they talk of your past, yeah they said it wouldn't last
Put a torch to his home
Et, là, je fais le tour du monde
And I find myself slipping down into that black
I seek the sympathy and I can't lie
I used to dream about saving the world
When panic lies just ahead
We went down to the store
And I wait with the plate, piled high with my love
That shattered feeling
You're sweet as green apples
Baby close your eyes until tomorrow
For the rhymes of an hour
And I faced the truth
By the cold
And all my bright tomorrows belong to you
Had never yet been with a man
Higher places you can't reach without me
I don't know why I trusted you but I knew that I could
These foolish things remind me of you 
Why does the night win me always
Didn't taste right
Down the track of loneliness, down the path of love
I had to think awhile
Und schon wieder lieg ich wach 
Can I say that to you
I'm talking and talking
Don't cry 
And reason and freedom is a waste
They all show love to my shorty doowop
What do you say, do you say to fate
And the grayest days the predictions told
How softly, the springtime breezes sing
I'm not scared of dying
They took you away in a police car
Täällä ilman sua ei oo mitään
I prayed so hard the rain would come
In case you don't know
Uncertainty, I could be bathing under artificial light
As the towers topple over ground
Unmatched to match the unmatched plates the sun sets in the west I really really really don't want to do this
Don't lick your fingers when you turn the page
I want revenge
Integrity is too damn expensive, discount the price but still
My heart stops running
I still owe you
Too many teardrops yeah
This is for all the lonely people
I'm feeling rage of a hurricane
When no one else could see
It would shake me till I'm still
Far more suited than here
Like the dream of you I had
I want to hear it on the air today
And all the dreams I dream, beg, or borrow
You need a soul to find you out
The flavor of your lips is enough to keep me pressing
Please talk to me, don't close the door
I whipped you off and felt so awkwardly alive
I've been waiting an hour and the bus hasn't come
Last night poor Dan had a nightmare it seems
I wish I woulda told the girls to 'drop it like it hot'
I've watched the dreamers find their legs
It's the best thing that you ever had
Cause you know I'll never let you be
Cause everything is gonna be alright
I loved you the first time I saw you
I don't want to
Remember me when I'm gone
Hey I'm too weak it's too much to fight off
Because maybe
Instrumental
With one dozen roses
But nothing happens
More than ten years to ignore, what they here for
Und Worte hart wie Stahl
You played the lead and never once you failed
I take that cocoa leaf and make that snow
One thing and another
All the while you're bones have gotten frozen
She said, "I love that Irish lad, 
Yes, I saw you were blinded and I knew I had won
My thoughts of you are drowning in the noise
Live in oneroom housing, with a roof to meet the sky
Stunning when you sleep
You misread the sign
And you're not gonna take what they've got to give
I'm gonna tell everyone I know
The water runs away 
I know a girl laying down 
And your breath's hot and gross, but I kiss you like a lover
She hath my heart in thrall
And I wait for it to pass
Summer's day
And she holds me in her small hand 
'Cause none of its easy,
And I am come to you
Did you hurt your hand again last night when you fell in the snow
But if you're alone then, say my name, say my name
Grounded by this ignorance
You are like a flower
That's no way to live
His voice is heavy and deep
And visits us in sleep
Till I start going numb thinking
What day
Your love
Will you be an astronaut or will you sail the sea
Take a different road
das sich zu über setzten lohnt
But none of them as wild as I've discovered in Columbus
I learned I no longer believe in surprised in surprise
She doesn't dream
For weaving their baby's new clothes
And another day passes like a dream
You've been left out I'd never do that
Isn't it time we get ready again
And all the world is green
Make you windy windy we were so windy
You know that I do
I'm an owl with tired eyes
Antarctica, I can't wait anymore
I wonder if, it looks the same inside
And I want to make much of You, Jesus
We won't be living this way
Of the living people living their lives away
Mm, but stay, don't close your eyes
Until it comes again
Und schließ meine Augen
Við tölum saman á ný
Let's run away from here for good 
To just believe
I heard them whisper your name
To wash away the pain
If anyone ever wonders where he went
You can't hold him back
Seus passos queiram se juntar aos meus
Play the song without the rhyme scheme
She holds a key to the room down there
Women, weed, weather, it's not my fault
And a bunch of fools drown in shame
Saying, you fuckin' them girls, disrespecting me
To stay within the shadows
So alive though our wolves might talk about it every day
And he walked away from my fleeting house
I'm lost for words
I'll soon be turrning the tide  just wait
My gun
But we're all just an end to a simple thing
And wooden shell 
Black bodies swinging in the southern breeze
Close your eyes, baby
Oh, wake up, baby, come and get it
I used to be your getaway
I spend my days beneath a perspex dome
Left with regrets I'm sorry for everything 
Leave the world alone and later
I will put them all back in time
My needings only fleeting
For foreign films and modern plays
From dreams he sold
And yeah I know they'll get you down
Universe cooling down
Yeah I'm your shorty boy but you already know
And I know it's a bit uncomfortable here in this door seater
When the time is right 
And the guns they grew louder as they made dust out of bones
If you love her let her go
Over and over in my brain again
The boys would laugh and tease about my black feet
I can't find forever in your eyes
When we made love to each other
It falls flat and it makes you crazy
Always makes things feel so unfinished
You're for keeps don't you runaway
I'm the one to forget
A little time, a little time
So fill it up and spin forever down the wall
I took the picture
That this poor country's known for the last twenty years,
I just made myself look bad
The dew will settle on our graves
In the car behind the carnival
You're not biting, you're barking 
State of gray, state of sin
You can trust and love again
The snow coming like a breath
I still see you
Yeah, I'm living up here where the air is thin
In the parking lot as the teachers bend the rules
donde hubo fuego, heridas quedan
'Cause it doesn't
There's a design to what I did and said
The gutters are dry
Are my sins, are they forgiven
Hath lulled the eve to sleep
Lean back
If we sleep together
So when you walk outside to see the reasons fall
We're all talk, talk
Thought of her walking, turned back around
Common
And remembering some pain
"You can't win me back, win me back
las cosas sólo son
The sun don't know, when its glowing
I had sixteen stitches all around my head
I'm a lonesome kind of guy
Got one good leg 'cause the other went south
Say you'll come and set me free
Every day gets worse
A thrill that I had never known
Out of time and out of tune
Happy years pass by
And we've danced these shoes to pieces 
Now they're cold and dark and gone
So that's why I won't wake you where you lie
Fear is blinding lights
And we'll sing our prom theme
I want them back
You don't know what you're talking about"
Baby is there anything that we can do
To me or anyone
Why don't you say what you mean
But it's something I've been meaning to say to you
I hear the sound of water flowing down the stream
You were always there to walk me home
To check my head in your pane
Yet I see them somehow
Hiding the more unholy things I do
All the way down with me
Can you tell me about the intuition I feel
Trust me and don't keep that on the inside
"Goodbye mommy shrimp
Of the dreams we dreamt together
You smiled, and then the spell was cast
She's better off staying asleep
I don't care what you say
No ending, no beginning
And there the advertisement
Both dirty, both mean, yes and the dream was just the same
How dare they distrust
I waited for the remedy
Sie verwöhnen deine Sinne und gewöhnen
Music stops and the spell broken
You've got your own homegrown philosophy
Four minute warning
Wont sleep the night before I'll be up just wondering my life
Restless feeling, I really gotta hold
I won't give up chasing love, son
And posters take the walls away
I feel alright, I found a face that fits tight
I'll change my whole perspective
J'ai peur que mon temps soit expiré,
And that moon is absurd
Bleib bei mir, bis der Morgen graut
So one of these nights and about twelve o'clock
We'll go our separate ways
Nothing was as bad as it is tomorrow
There's still a coat 
It's your truth
Feel everything
And you hold me in your young girl's hand 
The things that you will not
Just when she'd said it, that's when she'd say it
Take your time 
Sometimes when I call
C'est mon éthique, elle est plus stricte que les loubavitch
And a lovestruck Romeo he sings the streets a serenade
Take away their sorrows
I've never written a love song
And the jacket too, I always knew you
She�s got her life living in her heart
So close but you don't know
And abandoned, shy
Tonight I saw her again
I felt so bound by mindless ways
When you and I were forever wild
No one's gonna reach me here
When I say 
Siehe Wanderer Die Sonne fällt sanft durch die dichten Laubblätter der alten Bäume Die Donau rauscht im Hintergrund Der Blick auf ihre dunklen Wasser ist durch eine Staumauer und Büsche verborgen Sie hat sie einst alle angespült, die Verlorenen, die Vergessenen, die Ignorierten, die Verzweifelten, die Unbekannten Nimm dir einen Moment Zeit Setz dich zu mir auf die knarrende Holzbank, die ein paar gute Menschen einst hierhin stellten als sie all denen einen Platz für die letzte Ruhe gaben Lass uns erinnern Lass uns gemeinsam gedenken derer, die hier vergraben sind Sieh all die schlichten Kreuze, die einfachen Grabsteine Fällt dir etwas auf 
And you're still here
You're never with me
Nathan
Look forever to remind
Manche Wesen sind so schön
You wore no shoes and ate like a leopard
Grave attention is still focused
She was too scared to speak
und werd' gefressen von dem, was mich ernährt
I've never been the saint you wanted me to turn to
'Cause I know I won't ever see those eyes
Enjoa de vertigem, viagem de avião
And not a violent man
I hope she doesn't like me
The air is running out we're sinking much too low
His fading words were
You make me smile with my heart
Cause now I know
So many days in the wind, you keep on running round,
We just say life's so unfair
I can't shoot my brothers anymore
But your heart was always unraveling 
desde el fondo puedo ver que depende del cristal
Oh I will do right by you
 qui descend
Are we still nowhere
He slaloms round beer cans in his escape
Now we just don't know
Did you believe them when they told you they discovered you
Like a thief in the night
I saw the back of the stars
I've been walking around all day waiting
The storms made the pavement steam like a kettle
If you need it I want you to
These days I don't see you walk so proud
As if we ever needed anything to entertain us
I've got your words in me
Yes all that we were, all that we knew
Born without a family
For me to admit the way that I felt
Damn I hate a yes man
And I hope you're holding hands by New Year's Eve
Out of sight
My spirit flies to you now I can see your soul
Wanna be loved
Warding off all evil signs
It comes as no surprise
Then we'll be up in heaven's ground
Marimba sing high, marimba sing low,
There's so much to say to you
You shouldn't come around here, singing up at people like that"
To pull ourselves away from the lives we leave back
Take your time and back up a little bit
Versuch sie zu umarmen
And you may transcend the bad news"
Lips are falling 
Well, you know I believe in how ooh
The light behind the cracks of glass is so bright
And your hoping the sun won't rise
Hell no reason go on and scream
Will it ever change
Run, you can run, you can run
I think it's winter now 'cause it's already dark
Melting snow
Burdened bands gain strong hands
Let fear charge the gates
It is so clear I realize and here at last I have my eyes
Everything clean and shiny
Yeah some feelings they never go
Or leave you alone
Tender love's what you're giving me and
Love in the morning with this halo all one size
I know you want it too
You want to be by yourself and all alone
We can bring back the old days again
This is the sound of our days
To try to maake it work we did, we did
Just stick around and it may show
Falling softly to the ground
Your collection of tongues you keep framed in parlor with your bibles and guns, the fetus of Christ with a fistful of scars
She saw my silver spurs and said let pass some time
Than to say it
My brother had a daughter
For now it's home
As I'll be their friend"
I know you don't listen to me
But I missed those hills with the windy pines
I feel like a prize asshole
Tonight with one voice
Like she's the only girl you've ever seen
I found it all but I lost my soul
Not much chance for survival if the neon bible is right
The time when we counted every black car passing
Wrapped up in the pleasures of the world
Maybe I could get some sleep
It was dumb to hold so tight
A crime's a crime but I don't mind
I'll show you everything I see
There's a calm under the waves so I choose to sink
Well it's your hometown
We are the addicts
It took hours and hours to scrub it out
A thousand miles away
Know my spirit will be standing by your side
You may hear
It's even more a part of your life now that you can't touch it
At quarterpast the doorbell rings, the water faucet drips and sings 
"Remember, it's only the start"
My shadow days are over now
Ahem, sing with me
I drove for miles and miles
Set me in motion
It rained for days a blaze of Hail and stones
What's cold, you mustn't await
It's closing time
You gave us someplace to go
I don't believe in
Gonna go out walking in the morning light
Let the rain fall
Don't cry
I just don't know
The tattoos came alive right in front of my eyes
Awoken by a cloud of steam
I told my mom I'ma get up out of da hood
Next words that were spoken to me
I've had enough waiting
The night fills my room
es ist nur der Wind,
Still at it
Everybody's been there, I just live there too
Catchin' feelins is a no,
Once you really loved me,
Proves it with his eyes closed
Don't you go and let the world weigh you down
When it come to rockin' the rhythm like Marvin and Luther, I can tell you ain't no messin' with Kanman and Twist
I used to write so many songs for my girl
Pay attention, I hope that you listen 'cause I let my guard down
Was in your way I'd move it for you
Watch me fight the fight the laws within
Shine a little light
Ooh feel this city define you
He's working away on displacement
Running out of time
Lying in my bed 
Wish it was goodbye
I could be your suicide policeman
That I can't shake those memories
The end of the time, they're the end of the line
Brings virginity to a close
Strayed above the highway aisle
But you never even see me, do you
The sky doesn't clarify
Don't run with me
In pain and ashamed
Aishiteimasu *
You can turn me on
"Well, all I need is the air I breathe and a place to rest my head
Don't ever let it loose,
We all know that storm is coming
I bet I say something stupid
I should be on my way by now
That you call me to have the thing banned
With flowers in your hair
So I give up, waiting for someone waiting 
Leave me when you cry
And I have oh so many friends who talk you up like your someone new
And love is crushed like clay
For shame on you
And every city was a gift,
I'm coming home
Well are you
It's what I'm feeling
But you still won't understand
Everything comes apart
Well baby, there you stand
But in my dreams I couldn't love you more
Gon' build that wall until it's done
I can't do everything, but I'll do anything for you
Oh, I remember who you are
By the time you turn around
Have I become a tiresome bore
The siren sings a lonely song
If you would be my love, baby I will love you, love you
I'm yours forever and a day
The TV is your window pane
My spine is made of iron, my heart pumps out old red paint
Once I had a friend
"I will never again deliver bad news"
You get what you deserve
Now I walk for miles
If I did it y'all could do it
What makes me so badly bent
überall unzufrieden
Is it time to meet my destiny
Spinning your umbrella over your head
As scenery to his dreams for sale
istun tässä jo monta tuntia jalat puutuu, jalat puutuu
Then I will take you away
Then I'd run over to your house
Start a sick cult on mysterious islands
You gently lay me down
I'll be there by your side, just you try and stop me
If your friends were all your dates
Every beautiful melody
Nights dreams come true
Filigree circles round her young wrist
I can't marry you, you know
You want her, you need her
Ti do questa notizia in conclusione
Essayer de plaire à quelqu'un
And how they catch our every tone
'Cause your love
He is a picture of Jesus
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
On the dark side of town
I do not sleep
Wir lieben das Leben und sind dafür bereit
I think you know
But that's not the way that's not the way
In the city it's the only light
I wrap my hands around his head
She leaves her work and quits her job
Listening to the shore
 te regarder
Que tu comprendras
Things lost just lighten up your load
Searching for a piece of mind Hey
Wiggly days, wiggly nights
Your back against the wall 
Spouting heavy moonlight
Irene and Flocko and little Amy Khan
Oa, oa vento dá na vela 
That I'm breathing
From working the blackjack table at the CircusCircus casino and
Be me, be mine
You didn't have the decency to change those sheets
And she'll feel the burn
Never let is bring you down
Oh, I'm thinking about the needle
Doch mir wurden meine Träume geraubt
Please tell me that part again
I had nothing to lose but time
I found your photograph in a cardboard box in a magazine
Call you up and acknowledge you to come through
I thought I'd found my place
Sometimes I'd like just to ask her
We can pat ourselves on the back
I can keep a secret if you can keep me guessing
When I drive around the bend
In the daylight 
She's a rich girl, he's a son of a CocaCola middle man
Childhood was I happy then
And oh it ain't the same, when you're falling out of feeling and you're
Chasing that old dragon down
Hand me down my walking shoes
Gets colder day by day, I miss you
I lit my fire blew my conch, nobody comes
Whenever I get down
My singing bird as you
We were swimming on the night before three days
These days it's hard to meet women
To be me ooh ah ooh ah
It was a cold and angry sky above
Inside your own illusion
One of these mornings you're gonna rise up singing
Sporting a black eye
And I can't believe I'm nothin'
He knows how to ease down slowly
So I've one last thing to tell you now before I have to go
What gets said's not what's heard
Satisfaction is my mission and a bed is all we need
I'll make you mine if you would have me
We work late and I pretend that I don't notice when you're next to me
Can't get enough
It's not just the flying 
All my friends
You don't need to say it
Far from home but near my family
The air is filled with computers and carpets
If you're shocked it's just the fault Go your own way
Lovely Lovely, lovely
When he found I had no coins to bum
Well, I'll kneel down on the carpet here
You know, domestic drama and shit, all the attitude
Under a coat of night, it's ohsocomforting
And your children are reared by panic and fear
Oh and if you let me stay
She's washed up on his shore, there's no time to get into his life
Eu vou ficar com Jackie, oh
I should leave you while they're dry
Und hinter Dir, da wartet keiner
Look into your mind
The homemade weapons you're fashioning
Maybe someday
I believe that's because
A life upon the road is the life of an outlaw man
From way back when we were just friends
Run away, run away
Sometime at the end of June
Inside a sea turned from frog to freak to tiny red and meek
You gotta quiet them, quiet them
It's well known that the cross is only a burden with pains and trials
Love me as well as you know
To ease my troubled mind
When the sun came by you opened up your eyes
Saying nothing, that's enough for me
Six feet below, a world flooded free
und konsequent auf den Boden
I think I'm going back to California
And swallow the smoke in her mouth
These are the cages
Always I'll want you
We smoked the screen to make it what it was to be
'Cause I know it's hard sometimes, baby just give it some time
Far from the world and it's violence
Not a man alive you owe a thing
Junto a ti creo que aumenté más de tres kilos 
That won't stop this drinking
Her weary heavy head in
In the light they both looked the same
So amplify this little one
I saw a broken arm
Spine, shivers
But there is none
A lesson lost again
They tell their lies and something dies
Thinkin' that life has passed them by
Make you blind, burn your insides
The tourists stare at tourist stops
Oh with the wave of her hand
Than a woman who loves a man
I know he's out there, catching my faded flowers
"Everybody used to think of him as
So if you dreamt of me, too
And red brick walls blooming
This summer held no words
I think that I have finally come home
It was your fear that helped me
Let me in unlock the door
So lets forgive and let this lie
Ja päivä on auringon kultaa
But I won't remember anything at all
I've got to get it right
Cut out all the parts that held your stain
And everyone is beautiful
'Cause nothing
I'm still hopeless
When she was seven years old she saw a man get shot, but
Lifeless testimony 
Cast aside old doubt
I know it's ludicrous to be lost,
I'm not equipped to play this game
Beckon for the sweet, soft, summer breeze
Hanging there behind the trees,
Living here in shades of grey
You pick my heart with a smile
Who's never quite sure what he's moved towards
That's when they'll come looking for me and you
I know once I just hauled off and hit you
A hundred miles an hour on a brand new road
Nothing ever changes at the Parallel
No way to feel inside
If you think you're falling, you probably will
As we waltzed through the streets of Manhattan
Like winter in July
Your hoping the sun won't rise
Lies that cover up the sound
And touch your face while we're both sinking, stinking, thinking
I may lose my fear 
Wouldn't want to go
Because no one can be bothered when it's humid like this
In my mind a knot was gathering
A little closer than before
Hoping to hold a handful of sunshine
Down the streets I walked with you
Late on shallow evenings while their enemies slept
Guarding it from anything and anyone whose harming it
I'm not gonna look at you anymore, the same way
The way that I am
As the sun sets on another day
And empty out my heart
I never thought I'd find
I'd hold you in my arms
Dry your eyes
Shine a light on my life
Like a woman
A cold sound rustled in the trees
As I breathe
Just this one last sunrise
And I'll be outside, waiting for you 
From the palms on your hands
Io voglio regalarti la mia vita
And loves you like I do
And they all got answers from trouble they've known
Dreaming of the day when he can do the same thing
And nobody ever knows when you go
Many words, many dreams I've got to give
No one gets hurt
A kind of power, it can�t be reined in
Maybe bring just my mirror
You clipped you clawed to no applause
She says it to herself "Don't go"
Darling you're with me forever and always
It's a lot like life
Then we can jump and pretend we disagree
Der mir nach all diesen Jahren endlich nah war
'Cause change can be a beautiful thing
And got some pliers, held him, wound up, and yanked it out right there
It's time to let go
We're in each other as hand in glove
No, I'm not alone
Whenever you come undone
But now times led my mind astray, something was changed along the way
Step outside yourself
If you take all the sugar you will end up in the sulphur
 miles is very far through the snow
You changed your mind, you changed your mind
I would throw in flowers and branches
And in the salty sea, I find you're all but gone 
Hold together all these melodies
All of us are going down so
Show me your rainbow
But you are the never ending sleep that I love to treat
Your crashing waves came, took you away
You're a bird with a pretty mouth
Jaded, her mind in a daze
They search us out wherever we are
Secretly this feels right to me
Waiting for the big fall
My breath is soft, your hands are unlocked
nemt di keylim, lesht dos fayer,
But they're running pretty fast back on their word
When the fireworks in me are all gone
I don't know, hey I don't know
Refrain
Storm clouds gathering beside me
I know your fears and you know mine
This is the room where we always dreamed of grass and splendid evenings
I ain't jealous of the way that you're living
But our numbers they only get higher from here
And just stop talkin' shit
Everyone I do right does me wrong
A moonlight serenade
Unaware of yourself
But when it comes of course
He makes me dance
He smiles like a child
Essa menina tá dizendo, sim eu sei
I'm standing strong
I remember who you are 
Goes up into his bedroom
Conceal my weapon nice and easy so you can't see
Then there's me, a fox for your gun
I'll give until there's nothing left
Where's your man
In your castle all your candles drip on the pavement,
From the flames
Poisoning the soul
She is shaking out static anonymity sha la la la, temporarily
The roses are frightened to bloom
Since we departed back a month
This world may crumble into the ocean,
Your delay means eternal leave
I just can't forget you,
And now it's getting worse
I couldn't hide it even if I tried girl
And I wish I could leave my bones and my skin
Oh god, I'd give my life for you
Crown you in my heart
I'm trying hard to forget everything I thought I knew
In my hand a tangled thread
No, staring at his picture I realized
It's a harmless moon
So what are you gonna do with them all
I see all the faces
Still remember feeling nervous
This is just one day unseen
Coming back to you
Two hundred thousand miles
And you're the evening star
The lines are sinking in
With her indigo eyes
And please remember me at Halloween
Oh it looks like Romeo has found 
It is my perfect day
Not to fools like me
The last thought that you think today
Scared of a world outside
Need a compass but not a conversation
Lay by the wind and show me
Our hands are swollen We all need to sleep 
Singing whoa, please don't go
Jimmy could not wait to get home
I will commit 
Why everything is the same as it was
Holding down my feelings
Time passed slow
Six feet under, underground
Ich will der Eine sein
We're snowdrops falling through the night
But no one feels like you
And the spirit of life remains inside, inside
It took a lot of money to start my heart
And that's what makes my life so fucking fantastic
All of the feelings you can't help feeling
Were all in my mouth
They're raising your body from the ground
Me with a drink in my hand
From the sky, the train tracks look like stitches
In feathers and down
I can't believe, how pathetic we can be
Didn't know you got yourself a new friend
I know when his mom and dad broke up
I'd felt so insecure that night
Adrift on your ocean floor
And she had to bring here this
We lost our place
So I take a sip, wait 'til it hits
From these shores I came
And things that matter too much
Don't know what to say
But sometimes a mountain can sing
Lighten up, you say lighten up
Noone special
Shut up and shut your eyes
Wild flowers growing in the park
Still it's not really a weep
You know exactly what I want so
You're a coverlet
And so I come to you, my love, my heart above my head
Sometimes you may feel you're the only one
Burns like you, my damaged one
You were once my friend
Till a little color comes into your face
I find the same things
If we don't, well, there is no chance of that
In joining their forces and singing along
Fought about your taste you were on mine
Uh darling there's me no, no use in pretending
To sing our prom theme
Your reflex gets in the way
It was just a boring day that we decided to betray
Got a tattoo and the pain's all right
Searching for love
Something that you find, when we unite
The old man used to do a lot of things
In the name of something new
In the sharp gust of love
All I have, all I need, he's the air I would kill to breathe
That I'm filling in the empty spaces
Does it say, "Pick out your cloud"
Procession moves on, the shouting is over
But I'd change for good
Somebody touched me and whispered in my ear
And all our days were a sundrenched haze
And buy myself those things that I want
It's ok to run we expect you back
wo uns niemand sucht, wo uns niemand sucht
There's a breeze in the air
All of me back
In my memory when I go
It takes an egg to make a hen
Those guys from the folk band
I am the reason
E minha mente voa                    x
You're a late night faucet that's got a drip
The love that you have is still holding my soul
Last boat, stand in the river
Overwhelming, the bed I've tried to make so perfectly
Hey, boy, don't you get it
This feeling is not sadness, this feeling is not joy
And if I knew where to begin
I live here on my knees as I 
The saddest thing I've ever seen
We'll say the one thing
The angel rides with hunchbacked children, poison oozing from his engine
Velvet ropes around you if that's what you need
When I arrive it's gone
I can see, I can see, I can see a sunrise
Everyone's had it
In your dreams when the smile now comes
wir sinken in den Sand
I can't remember the last time that it was yours
What is your name
We are children of divorce
Dreamed to discover a new space
With all the cold that kept it down
Another disappointing day
Remember the song that played
And don't you even try to let it go
You don't see how your lies is affectin' me
I know it's hard to tell how mixed up you feel
And how I want
And I will pray and then I'll cry
And you don't have the right
I ain't rich yet, but you know I ain't broke, I
He realized there are times
Scared my love, you'll go
Behind your eyes
'Cause I will be gone
aber binnen Sekunden
Son why don't you come down
A mon intelligence ou pas
So hush now, my babe, please don't cry 
People say that I should
para poder verte a horas no adecuadas 
Less than two eyes
Nothing to discuss
She let me know that she'd be waiting
It'll go around with anyone
The dreamer has woken
I'm an old man, you're probably not interested I see
I guess he's better off than he was before,
Caught a bird and in a trap, had a lot to give back
I did it for you
You don't have to wander 
Well, it's got to be strong to touch my heart
And my eyes hurt, hands shiver, so look at me and listen to me because,
And the lava and the gas that we are,
Or put nails through her hand
Oh the last night on Maudlin Street
And I'll give you more than years
Shut up and go to bed
Yeah, I'm a young man with an old school, girl
To questions that are plaguing me
No, I'm not that kind of whore
And you fools in the back with your heads in your hat, what when all your fields are rotten, your waves of grain, amber waves of grain
I can't get any younger
A song for a heart so big
And we knew what time we had
You are so dear to me
Almost doing things we used to do
I've met your ghost, yes, he's proposed
You're not alone
'Cause I don't think I can keep this monster in
Why it is you still care
I don't know why 
In this garden full of good
Gardens growing full again with life
Hoping that I step on out
When you first saw me ypour face was agrin
Un mister love mélangé à Castor Troy
Will you run away
Healers always say
Don't you know 
They keep me in tune
On the highway I will run
Rush to the ground
That it wasn't really wasted time
The day time the night time when the angels are calling
Look at what you're seeing today, 
Susanne, don't you break down and cry
Who'd have thought I'd really visit
Lonely through the night
Break it, simply took a leap of faith and virtue
Then pale monotony
Which makes it harder to embrace you
In views of the city
Watching them pass like clouds in the sky
Cleave to the ground
Don't say that it's done
What is it that has my mind so hypnotized
It was filled, now broken up
The moon is gone behind the clouds
Take care
But a free ride on
My way home, my way home
She thought that she could buy happiness by, by the bottle
I don't expect anything
When I was three, three maybe four
Now show some pity
He had a sister named Erin, for sure was fine
And over the phone, he can never expose
Is a full moon that's glowing
Drive around and get my blood flowin'
But you were still swept back to me
Noye du sunul saranghae saranghae
A heaven of abandoned stars
So I must try teaching you the wrong from right
Mary applegate, roland grosch, bettina mischke, helfried wildenhain
Spell it out so everyone can see
The towel is on the floor
One more chance to gaze into those innocent eyes 
And I'll take my clothes off, and it will be shameless
See lean to the side in my ride, huh, yo
Moonlit river
You can't break my spirit, it's my dreams you take
I know what it means to freeze to death
There goes another day
Starring out at the stars, you feel helpless and so small
I see your lonely shadow running out of time
Is anyone alive
'Cause even the Gods outside can wait a moment guy
Of the new cobweb
From a sea that turns itself
Didn't know what to say
Kiss upon the lips
You'll come around to see the other side of things
Take my heart with a grain of salt 
Weighing so heavy on my body, body
It's all that I'm tryin' to say 
I will lie awake
Got broken wings
And everything
The degrees of separation close in
And fades away like morning dew
Your name in lights 
When I'm riding home at night now
Tension rising higher it's coming through my window
I can't believe that it's been three years
Dreaming dreams and drooling on my bed
The way I've come to ignore we keep colliding faces
You used to lean your eyes on me
Now you are the warrior who will conquer this land
And though I beg and plead with you, you tell me it's not time
The Robin's song in Winter
We must be getting old
And yet you never change your ways
With all of these memories
Will you remind where we've been
There's nothing you can do"
Y descubrí lo que significa una rosa 
And all the universe crawls
The city is a jungle better learn to fight
I said I was over you but I'm lying
Wade through the sand
And I even made myself the fool
She'd be white gold
Mon céans, mon céans, mon céans
The sun was setting to the left of the plane 
Asleep in my bedroom
I got the custom grill, I got the Brabus rims
Where's my gun
'Cause we can never undo
Open the window
'Cause everything you do and words you say
Maybe I could use a little help
Than to never ever know it
And suddenly we're all alone in silence,
You're honest
And as this sky is falling down, it crashed into this lonely town
And I, shiver like a child
Hondamendi haloa
Ich hab so fest an meinen Bruder geglaubt
Kings of the highway, we will be
Something kept an eye on us,
Pray that we make it to twentyone, one, one, one
Not a hand, not a finger
I've looked in the attic, the cellar and hall
I never find the words to let you know
That if you had thrown yourself down
Last breath, last scream
Your mouth against my skin
And I don't know where I'm driving to
I'll pull the trick and it comes true
But now you've got nowhere to run
And they're handing down my sentence now
Call me baby, baby all the time
I know you had no choice
This is goodbye, gravity
If you could hear me you'd do something
How many drinks till I'm happy
I'm so far away
And loving you is the one thing that I need right now
No, I don't see how it can while we are still apart
I cut the blue one
Listen to the sound of silence feel the freedom of peace
Always wanting something more
When aI look at my reflection
Still I wish that I knew
It's tragic, I make it happen, and all y'all Shaqtin'
My cousin Toot ain't have to die, right in front of his son
Call me raincheck, I won't fade away, I won't fade away
This maze I stand of concrete walls
And may no man's weight
Whoowhoowhoo, whoohooo, whoohoooooh 
Why tear our world apart
As to my only one
And there is no one to break the fall
Who's charm so endears that whole nations cheer and sigh
When I walked out in the sun
I'm gonna make it right
And the despair when you just won't go to sleep
"Treasure in the sky" and we had nothing but fun
Feel like my love life is finished
And I ran off and ran on to something
An angel without wings can hardly fly
When I was younger, sometimes when I look back
It feels small but I won't get sad about it
Nothing but bluebirds all day long
That's the one thing that makes us the same
And here to please him
But we'll learn just what things are like outside our heads
And a comforting wave washes over me
Reminding me of what is real
Until the next time
To this rarest of moments
And some people live their life
Starts whispering to me
You can never reach the heighst and avoid the hurt yeah
Go about our lives
If your gonna play with fire, then you're gonna get burnt
Wishing for life, gripping the light
And finding something else to learn,
Got my clockwork's company
Darkening the sun
I dig my hole, you build a wall
You got me, sad and lonely
And tell me I am still the man I'm supposed to be
You're in a dance and you must maintain until it's done
As long as she's got to have it
Things they should know but the things that they don't
Is it wiser never to speak
I pray that the Lord my soul will take but
Look all around, there's nothing but blue skies
I'd never do that to you, at least purposely
Make way for my girl
'Cause I know how it feels to be
But just a simple melody
I could run forever, dear
Ele quis lhe pedir pra ficar
I think I'll go home and cry
But she was almost forgetting
Drei Uhr zwanzig und kein Stern in Sicht,
Oh baby don't leave me alone
You can't take it back 
Oh, it's always
Now he's decked in flowers for me
Always keep dreaming
I said that's what you're asking, but you're gonna get more than you bargained for
I cut the red one
We dodged all the moving cars,
Gave it all to the man instead
The spirit of life will keep living on
I'll break my life for a song
Every other little day
And I tell you all the wrong things
Let me please know, oh oh oh
Forgotten days are heavy hands upon my chest
Once I had a man, sweet as he could be
I have become pure water x
The sea is full of sharks but can you swim
Life is nothing but a shadow
Oh, child
'Cause ya too idle
I bet you didn't even know
It feels like you're near
Is there really any reason why we take this crap
The weight is too heavy
I stand ashamed
Her perfume was eau de toilette
If this is love, ooh
Just wait for it to come
Bathe my skin in water cool and cleansing and feel
And your mouth tastes like sunshine, baby, but your eyes are all cool buried in my arms
"Swallow your pride", he said 
Can't set his feet through starry skies
See what I want so much, should never hurt this bad
You feel creepy like a worm
Program director on the radio won't play no music until the caller tell him so
Thanks to Martin for these lyrics
If you just believe that it's true
And when I come over and bend ya ass, you be bumpin' Teddy Pendergrass
And I'll never forget all the things I saw that evening
Even though I swear I've never been so alone
'Cause I'm tearing off the fancy wrapping
Ooh so speak easy
I feel I'm not alone
Tethered with tears in their eyes
Wonder, this time where she's gone,
And the women tug their hair
Her weeping I made into this song
Someone made you
Push the little baby down the
And I am over there
Ripping her fingers into the ashtray
Of the loneliness I hide
I wish you everything
But you are not here next to me
Can't get you off or out of my
You know it's going slow but it's coming your way
Alongside you
Skin untouched growing thicker for every step unwalked
I met you through a common friend
Oh let me spread your wings and come inside
That help you out of your shell"
und mal wieder nichts untendrunter trägst
You don't care you never did
And I sold them all for gold
And the smiles can last for days and
To come around again
Gave myself in that misty light
So much in love so much in love
I wanna buy you roses
There's nothing left, there's nothing new, there's nothing
'Cause love is so good
You sank into yourself and I got lost somewhere in between
I hope I see you on the other side, I hope I see you on the other side
We figure out the past through photographs
Tripping and nobody cares
We were linking arms and skipping around
Maybe it's time
Open my eyes and I'm next to you
Moody It's got me Mooday It's got me
Next she found a man to treasure
'Cause for us, there'll be no more
Dreaming my dreams with you
And you've already got me coming undone
I close my eyes
I'll love you
Halley's waitress
But 'til that morning, there ain't nothin' can harm you
I can sing over most and I'd gladly be the host
Don't stop thinking
Passado o passado, acho que eu
For my love feel unready
To work out all these cycles and why I'm standing here
He'll play a Beatles tune
Will try to wait and
It's terrific hate you day after day more
That's some sad soul to keep
Show me your colors, show me your rainbow
There's a chapter of secrets and words to confess
About Woman taking in all she can
How my dreams they spin me 'round
Will you just tell me please what the fuck is going on
Jealousy lay all your spells to bed
These screams, they wake me up in the night
ich seh alles
I am drunk again 
Didn't I warn you good
So find love, for to night for all nights to come
Oh my body is lost on the pity of bosses,
Take you far away
She handed me a broken memory
Wieldin' love as a lethal weapon, on his way to hubcap heaven
When you dove drunk with sleep in your eyes
With your head upon my shoulder
We could, with a word, become one
I know that baby we would disagree constitly on the basic things we did, we did
How many boys have you drowned
Cuando las almas van enredadas no hay más
Baby fall
But it's true, you know
I'm stll remember
You stood and let it crush you, and now we can't go back
You never know, homie, might meet some hoes, homie
Vejo a face luminosa do amor
A sun came
Your voices aren't clear enough after all
A four month old rat terrier pup
My heart is a flower
I disappear in those bodies of motion
Mort de n'avoir pas
I am, yours to mind
You're cheering me up and I'm thanking you
I see the doubt in your eyes,
And some song about Memphis
Oh swan pond, oh swan pond
Where I breathe
I can see all obstacles in my way
Why does her friends phone keep on ringing
Well, define my love, that lives within you
And mother and daughter may reconcile but their faces will never heal
He does not look down
It's sweet and it's free 
Please believe I'm never too far
Please singin' this tune
And I can tell someday I'm gonna say the truth
And until I'm with you, I'll carry on
Ne me quitte pas
Digging in caves to find the treasures of the land
A Woman's Heart
The voices say that I should stay
With his sword, with his robe, 
You will never do me wrong
You could kill a life with words
Wide world of sorrow
I know you're sick of working,
Killed by an angel
But much too slow
You've gotta help me out
You had your chance, but you never called me
Cross over and turn
Ally the languished lips
And don't say you've never been told
Your heart gets stolen by some mousy little girl
But I've got myself to protect
Quiero pararlos, quiero enseñarles,
His value declined when he offered his name
You're not the kind that gets out of your head
Krossinum hékk heiðarlegur einfari það var ég það ég sver
Deep breaths
I mean, do you ever just get turned on
I'll make the effort
Her restless body stirring
Strawberries cherries and an angel's kiss in spring
To take your pretty neck and see which way it bends
It was a little bit cold that night
And if you need me, I'll come and see thee, and be your visitor,
The alligator form getting up
Did you find your secret friends
Die Geschichte war
But I never forget you in my prayers
And when I lie on top of you, I'm afraid
Muted whisper of the things she'll move
Would you call my name
And I wonder where, your god was then
Don't know where you'll take me
At last, the skies above are blue
The one that I loved, wouldn't stay by my side
Under deep
This heart of mine was so beaten down
What I do is nothing
It still pounds inside and it's red
I care about you baby, baby
She didn't give a fuck
So I sent my wages to my home
Small girls with sun warm hands cuddle bring him milk
All things in town went, nothing will last
The way out here is trapped
On the good ship hope we sail but the stars above say
You and me created something special
So if I cannot tell you if though words I do not find I want you to know
Still won't leave you alone
But keep at least from now till then
You know your words,
I'm never alone, I wish they'd leave me be
Du hast hart trainiert und viel riskiert für Dich
The lights that come in and out of my life,
There's anthrax in the envelope I opened in my dream
Inevitable lie song
To reach the other side
All she wants is some breathing room
Of time
The signs were around
I just wanted to show you
The vodka stops to quench my thirst
But is it worth fighting for
I've got all I need spirit, hope and joe
Well I'd change for good
They get close in each other's strings
Well it still might kill me 
When I look at you
But there's a wife whos wondering where her husband could be tonight
She gives awards to some
Knowing you'll never walk away
Must have been insane, believe me
You're changing skin like I change clothes
There were bad times on Maudlin Street
Dance and whisper sweet breath
You know that you're wonderful
And dances with your little woman body
And takes the depth away
Did I sell my soul for this feeling
Somewhere down the road, you're gonna find a place
Jim Adkins & Rachel Haden
But the feeling will come back again again
It won't matter now
Last night for quite some time
I'll say it's the spray
You still can't relate to them
And you stood out like a ruby in a black man's ear
Take your hands and feel my heart beat
To join the other flotsam with the ripped up queens and knaves
Didn't I make it harder
Cut out the brights of the oncoming cars on the highway
My arms will provide
On the charts of rhyme arts and thoughts in rap form
He beats the earth
She had been here a thousand times before
You can't believe a love like hers
You see, every time Ra didn't show
It's a rainy night and your headlights hit the water in the street
While I struggle to breathe Is this all the
Anyone can make it two
But all that's dead and gone and passed tonight
Inside
I saw a shadow touch a shadow's hand
Light sleeper
Some people say that we are not rappers We're rappers
He tells me that even old flesh is erotic flesh
How many times will I sleep by your side
Whenever I'm alone
So maybe I'm doing something right
Flieg bitte los, hier wartet keiner
On the flashlight and the cold fortune
But I really don't care to know
And I'm bound for Louisiana, my own true love for to see
Pisspoor, ride in her sun bathing fireside
Worked things out
But I can see that star
Another sweet little girl with secret sea foam eyes
All these kids have gone astray
And springtime starts but then it stops
A full grown man
And I remember there's a life 
I might smash up all the windows
And all my life
All alone with someone
Not afraid to fall
Like some picture show
Well I never shall wither
The spark in your eyes is gone, somehow
You don't care much for a stranger's touch
To let all of the love
It's  in the morning in the sodium sky
Was a chance to let it grow
Ooh earth
Like we used to
So allow me indulge your mind with these words
Behind the frontlines 
River so clear and blue,
When I fall in love
Can you love the one that God does
I've got a picture of Jesus
At first I thought you might break this jinx for me
They're just not like that man of mine,
That you let me in tonight
She's something of a slut
They took while we were young
Nothing is quite what it seems
Some men die
And the things you'd forget
Hairy lung
And with Him we shall be forever blessed
If I'd only let myself
Tires rattle heavy walls the tides tonight
New order and Morissey
Building castles in the air
And I can't get off this spin
No family, no kids
Just a breakdown of the heart
Tell me why my angel eyes ain't here
Cannot feel a single thing,
Where nothing photographs well
That never should have been
Oh, you changed you mind, oh, you changed your mind, you changed your mind
When you placed your bets upon the bittersweet
Got the silver duct tape on my tray eight handle
From the dialaview
Just after I'd wiped away his last tear
A giant in the room
That break the strongest of trees
It takes two floors to make a story
Every step is
Time chasing time
They're just there to try and make the people free,
I wanna feel that way again
The girls are feeling sick
Och Linnea höll för hårt på sin moral
Storm warning, he made it pretty plain
You're gonna stand up
Baby, can I hold you tonight
I see the seasons change
I'm calling from thirty thousand feet above you
I don't wanna live like you anymore, anymore, anymore
Now that it's late fall
My man could be anyone
And the children, when they see me, cry
Killed by an angel
Each time I turn a corner
Thirty years, six months and two days ago
When you looked around I couldn't be found
Laughing as I pray
A downtown kind of baby
I'm under your curse, oh, oh
To sing you a happy tune, tomorrow
Somewhere downtown
All of the demons
'Cause I am floored
Do you remember baby, last September
The ships come in, it's Christmastime
For the one that you love
She worked at an Abbey in Iona
I'll cry to remember
I was wrong, I will cry, I will love you to the day I die
Forever must hold
Rosalie
A headstone on the wharf
And I know that I've been heard
You jut into the air
You realized you were not even close
Thought you'd make me feel it
And warm me up again
And that makes no sense
And you will be my ain true love
There's a world outside her window
Where I go I want to leave
Without your armor to fend off the world
The feeling sometimes, wishing you were someone else
And I never wanna go back again
It's a feeling
Under the water you scream so loud
Mama, take these guns away from here
Two lovers on their street
I don't do 'em, I just feel 'em,
And I don't want no other
If you want to have your cake and eat it too
Isolation will cradle the lies
Was built by white settlers seeking gold and other treasures
And you made life more real
Until the very end
Have left me broken
She will buckle to the sound
The way it shines for you and I
But the only thing I found was a desert
But I'm going Island hopping again
Never harvest or survive
Dying to get away
Loneliness
I come home late and I love your soul
Tore up my picture from it's frame,
Whatever circumstance
So much freer than we were before
Abre essa janela
Fiery rain and Ruby's cooling sun
There's a song beneath the earth
Who lingers on, who sleeps outside
You need not to reach for the stars
Every time I start
Yeah I wanted you to know
All the shadows say
Bringing a tear to your eye 
und wir erkennen das perfekte Glück
Hope it's right when you die, old and bony
I wish I'd seen you as a little girl
Den som lever flott och gott han lämnar inga spår
On saltcoats beach
We're fighting for ourselves
Throw open your purse until you're crying for mercy
Parting from the soup
My singing bird as you 
So till then, sweet fiend
I've been talking to Jesus 
From the desperate kingdom of love
The setting sun shines on your hair
For all feels like mine
In the little dance of tongues
The music dies
Too stressed to eat, too tired to sleep, alien to all you meet
I will comfort you
So do it, whatever it is, whatever it is,
In every skyline,
I took their wrong and I took their lies
Inspiration, look and see
Resonating your mask or feud
To stand before God
There is no one to pull you under
Come, come
So why deny that you and I
Tomorrow's just an excuse away
So wake me up when it's all over
I open my eyes in horror
All your love could hide
Only hope I got the message to you
All beginnings and endings, 
But nothing's alright
Heey, uh, ummmm, heey, oh girl, oh girl
I new a man who was better 
Such a sense of loss tonight
You know I never ever believed in love, I believed one day you were gonna come along
I loved about you
And I know what you'd say, you'd say
Because you have nothing
I'm one of those
There's never been a time like this
Wild geese that fly with the moon on their wings;
Was brauchen wir zur Erinnerung Einen marmornen Engel Eine Steinplatte, auf der die Taten verzeichnet sind Eine pharaonengleiche Pyramide Ein schlichtes Blumengebinde Ein Splitter im Herzen Ein Gedicht
Storied scars and faded stains
As we spend the last night on Maudlin Street
I need someone that'll help me think of someone besides myself
And the day they die
Around my smile
Remember those nights we spent, just you and I
So wipe the tears from your eyes
And I don't know how I'm meant to feel anymore
He was always there to help her
What's the use in dying, dying
Patiently you waited for a courting boy's embrace,
Sleep all day, it's fine
Fallen in love and I know I can't change me
I thought of myself beside you
It breeds a world of pain
The sunlight in your head
We're hanging onto
If you have any boubts of what my love is about
Jag saknar dig mindre och mindre 
Well she sleeps like a girl
Love into the light
You only wanted me to play the fool, play by your rule
And you can't take back what you've taken away
Ah, la, la, la, life is meaningful
Kom vi minns, minns tillbaka
It's loaded deep as deep can be
And you know me
Come and fight your corner
But I don't know why
It's your last year
Oh honey now girl, we can solve them
And after they suck all your soul, well, that's when they'll disappear
And you could take a real bite
My cosmonaut from Leningrad
And I don't believe that anybody
I still have a couple more years
Oh, they can say anything they want to say 
The fog was getting closer
Made of stone or of concrete
The vineyard the graveyard the grapes and the bones
My dress is torn, you have a black eye
But I am never beaten, broken, not defeated
And it passes by
We got lost
I spied a pretty fair maid, she appeared like a queen,
And all of the voices surrounding us here
How long I got to wait on my girl
de otros que no son yo
Settle down with me
In the halflight
Is this the sweet sound that calls the young sailors
Everyday you look a little worse
I only wanted love from you
The prison walls are dark and cold and grey
A million haters want me dead, forced to carry a gat
It was my perfect day
You are the girl
'Cause I'm so tired of a love
But so much to talk about
I'm praying to keep me from breaking
And late afternoon settles over the land
To some foreign land 
Me believe in you
I can live with all the stupid things you do
On our way we will have hope
Sweet child of mine
And it came without a warning now
Let the wind blow
Share your spoken wealth
They say home is where the hate is, my dome is where fate is
Freddie Jackson, everything, everything Well, well, well, well
As we floated around in space
Or I'll never fall
It's all you can do, use what's been given to you
And though my point of view seems sad
Es así No es verdad y nada es tan cierto
When all I want is down at the shore,
als wir raus waren
In the tower above the earth, 
When all the boys are older
My cousin died over some yay and I miss him
Guenivere
No one can find us here, fade out and disappear
I'm drinking for free
He stands by the doors of the Rex all night
Kissing my head like a brother and never asking why
You're the last of your kind, Mona Lisa
Watch the curtains slowly close
And getting all feared up,
I can get pretty sidetracked
To hold your hands
When it all comes
He who taught me to love like a beast
Won't you deliver me
I want you to know
'Cause our two
I can be the air you drink,
'Cause I didn't believe what I've been hearing
If I come home
To stimulate the mind
So leave your taxi waiting
 savoir comment
Feel the heat upon my skin Fire
And over there
She laughs at most everything, whether it's funny or not
I was sleeping by the wasteside of tomorrow, of tomorrow
With the world and those who lead it
Whatever the weather
You were mine and I was yours for one night
Can't let go
If not, what are we doing
All marks on my body vanished in a day
It's the only place I know how to bare
It is hard to hold without shattering
Whereever I go, I take you with me,
Don't patronize me sorrow
You run and tell your friends that you're leaving me
I'm out on a beach, sat on a rock I'm full of love
Sightless yellow highrise Bethnal Green, straighten
It's the windows, the doors, the passageways to the truth
Aw, the winds gonna blow
All of the while, I never knew
Why this now girl
She was going with a cinematographer
Shiny guitar hung on gold lamé
Were dreams that never lived,
Falling down for quite some time
Floats like a cushion on the sea
Bombs outside, such a small forest laughing at me
And I silently wish I was on one
When I cry
Well it's time to be wise
He's been falling
We're still clicking like bubble wrap
Erase this world
My lips and
Hey, newspaper
Just hours before me
Promised you You believed me 
Don't try to understand A life upon the road is the life of an outlaw man
And I replied I don't think so at all
I will drop to my knees
A woman's heart is filled with passion,
Never to come to your rescue
Coulours strong  it's been a long, long time
Would bring you back to me
Você quis partir, e agora estou sozinho
And I know who the hangman is
Can't change my mind, my troubles are the same
And there's nothing to believe we haven't already forgotten
Air goes cool and hurrying on my way
Pray to live a million years
They're all lined up to watch that movie "Maid in Manhattan"
I'm now required by love
Without reading the text, know what comes next
I don't even need to fight 
Slow this down
'Cause they've all got longing in their eyes
A fleeting chance to see a trapeze
It's too late now to stop
Feel you inside of me
I'm talkin' 'bout your tear drops
I love you, I do
And maybe to have learned this time
To all the good times we shared
And I'm missing what was pissing up the wall that I forgot
I never understood how you should feel
'Cause someday I'll believe you
Riding with them boys and girls and we're high
You look in my mind
When we're together the fire burns bright
To keep the dogs at bay
I'm gunning down romance
That there are roads left in both of our shoes
She drinks her frappuccio from a glass and not a cup
I know where you hide, alone in your car
I never meant to break your heart
So hard to be somebody
Someday those tears are gonna spill
Till your will is gone
Well thanks for the time, I had to think a spell
By all these people worrying about me
You'll write me letters
I'm only sure of things I know now don't exist
Do you feel what I feel inside
The hallow bright
She wished she went away
No, I don't mind let it all pass
I never needed you to be strong
For each one of 'em I've hurt and every time I've been burned
I'll never really learn how to love you
Mm, stay open
Hollowing soul
So when you finally taste, all of the waste,
You know I feel the same
Oh God, please make this last
What would you ask if you had just one question
My heart's against your chest
When all I want is your love
Intersection city coming
You won't matter anymore
And how I could feel you near
I plan not to ever return
High above the highway aisle
We can take comfort now
Are you still there
Gade kijan n'ape cheche demen
Out of breath, I am left hoping someday I'll breathe again
All the twofaced lies
Has made the lovers blind
Please don't believe her, she says that for anyone
No reason or rhyme, by chance or design
God wouldn't let it live
Thrashing over me in waves
And I was beside myself
For the first time I tried to really try
Being like you are
And why my angel eyes ain't here
And I sing evil, I sing good
But beyond where we should have gone
You're like a lover
When your eyes fill up with brine
Hypes fightin' for hits to heighten they hell
While the salt spray crusted on the window panes
It's your life
It brings me back to my childhood
Kaleidoscope and candle eyes
And realised the process, the ships and the people within them never differed
If there's a chance, we'll make it anyhow
Always feeling you
All hands up, salute the Empire State
And I know I took strange pills
Say a prayer for those you've known
And force cheap beer down
You go west for the black setting sun
Clear skies ahead and the dark day is done
But in the morning after the night I fall in love with the light
In our hearts we're all for one and one for all
An airline ticket to romantic places 
But you're ruthless
And swear you're right
Not one of them thinks about the way I feel
And everything you say is true 
Son ex Un playboy SDF
I don't know if it's already crashed on the shore
But their useless criticism
All the time  I'm sure
It was nothing at all
In the night
es ist verloren meist
Don't you weep my little man
Deep in the fantasies and dreams of the wits
If there's nothing outside, above
Say a prayer for me
I feel it on the shore,
Take back the line, go back  I'm sure
Something right
Butterflies
I done been in situations when I had to cope with all three, you know what I'm sayin'
No real reason to accept the way things have changed
Haunting figures around me
Sun is in your vision, possibilities emerge from the dark
I know something's got to give
To make sure that you've moved on
But somehow, I want more
No longer afraid of the shit put in my face
Maybe you were right
Tyhjä paikka aina sille mitä en ikinä saa
I try to smile but I can't remember
J'ai tellement changé
I don't want to know
Love would leave me feeling
E na vitrola whisky a gogo 
I have always thought
und nicht die Konsequenzen,
That's the common and pleasing
Forget about guns and forget ammunition
I am livin' out the life of a poet
Everything's evened out
Slowing down the everybody get along
Let us stay till break of day
"She'll always take you for granted"
Smiling faces try to understand
Tills solen har ändrat färgen i mitt hår
No one else can understand 
I hope that I haven't said too much lately, ooh lately
I could wait with you by the water
Why in the night sky are the lights hung Oh
That his whole life just changed
And mold it into something better
Of mountains strong
And dumb dumb words
I've been scolded for stealing 
You just stay in line,
Love ain't no way to share your time
With words like 'Lost and Found' and 'Don't Look Down'
Just the veteran taking the mic back
How you get your adrenaline flowing
Every song, every song
She tipped over
Over where tomorrow chases clouds away
I couldn't think of what to say, I had no ready reply
When you water down my name
I'm not gonna wait for you anymore
And stole a kiss at every street cafe
My little love affairs are all scheduled 'round the TV guide
Ooh and winter
Away from the ears that
Some cat says "buddy"
Had some eloquent graffiti
I want your love, I still need your love Too late you changed your mind
In the other I've got a gun
Always scheming
'Cause I believe we fly
Find your heart now
You have a piece of mine
Should things fall apart
If you look behind you, I will be there
Locked together
I won't be around
And tames you to feed from my hand
I'd rather be dreaming of someone than living alone
Roll the film with all of the car crashes and
As rockets flower overhead
The snow fell hard from five to five
I need to touch each stone
I dream at night ha of goin' home someday
And the ocean breathes salty, won't you carry it in
And you're a cold one 
She returned there to find him
I won't have to come back crying
What a wonderful world that this angle can see
I'll change my quills to break the will
When I open my mouth, I'm so brutally honest
It's affection always,
I feel your heartbeat
I hope you never leave my side
I sang the words I meant
Our shoes are wet, our skin is cold
I want to keep her dreaming
And ordering an coffee that I wouldn't ever drink
Baby our love will always persevere
No place in you for me
And we wait
Every touch every touch
My heart
Go do it, whatever it is, whatever it is,
Now I'm goin' home
I find myself alone when each day is through
And now you've shown as much as you can
For the places where the memories flow
How can we ask for a place we can imagine at
Scrawled on the pavement
It's time you realized
If you fall in I'll jump down
How can you be so impartial
It gets cold in there
I give you like they're falling out of me
Left for you, no one else
How the fuck y'all can't see I ride, when I drive, down the block and
My soul, my soul cries for them
And you wanted not to cry
And I'm sellin 'em for  a pop god damn it
The stars are aglow,
As your world continues to crumble, come to terms with the truth
I feel so scared
No matter how much of a thug you see, I still spit it like it's R&B, come to the club with me
I feel the blood rush through my veins,
So long ago we were dancing and singing
I was drunk again, causing accidents
Along a beam of light
And so I drive
I said don't be upset I know you're feeling sensitive
Talking to a friend yesterday
If you don't know, you're right next to the right one
But I won't compete with you every day
Dean lives in London, does the music business thing
Confined in mountain halls, we got too close to the flame
You don't have to say a word, it's crystal clear
I wish I was with you
And should the sky be filled with fire and smoke
If I tend to lose it and steer into old tracks
Forget this dusty neighborhood
And you can locate me where ever that dope be, gettin' money man
In the other night
I've got to find some resistance
Hearts will hold
Karenna kimi wa 
We decided to get hurt
When I'm feeling like this, I got nothing to lose
Hold me in your arms tonight; Hold me in your arms, ooh, baby
People are strange
Just bleed the bittersweet 
And some are realists
Under the waves, caught in a dream
Cold tiles beneath your knees, 
As we remember to hold the faith
Call me raincheck, on a golden autumn day
And nobody seems to know where you go
If you need it then I want you to
Don't criticize me for being in demand
It is not because I don't feel it in my heart
It's the same old, same old song
You bring me
But things are good, I've got a lot of followers of my faith
He never got nothing, in death even less
Regrets so scattered through our minds
When I lose for the last time
We're all just part of someone's elaborate plan 
The graveyard's in the backyard
Fill my life with pleasure
Me and all my friends
Remember the night you were with me
I fall deeper in love because I
Look at you you're blue black and through being that kid I knew
We make it to twentyone, one, one, one, whoa
Looking at your mermaid friend
You wear it well treating me like someone you don't know
Let 'em free and we will both go find it
These are good friends, these are mine
If you can, let it go
Suoneni suruillesi
Toda beleza se reconhece nela
And when you're swallowed up, oh, don't you cry
But the good ones always complain
And I'll be there just to make you happy
You're wood burnin' outside
And I should look after your heart
Don't make me say it over and over again
You'd never know it's there
I could stand with you with your snow boots on
The highway is my legacy
Future dreams can never last
I'm only safe when i'm dreaming
But I only have two hands
I dissolve and break and then away I crawl
And not return to the shame
And he wonders if the car will start tomorrow,
You changed my life and all my goals
Heart, set
You must follow your heart
'CAUSE I've done everything and I'm sick of tryin'
And the sun won't shine again
'Cause I don't want to end it
If you wanted me you would just say so
Lovers will go
So take my hand lets plan never to look back
I went cold
Don't get that face lift as a result
That makes you treat me this way
That you deliver, with conviction
When you're alone
And the Wallflowers CD ended half an hour ago
And the moon begins to sing 
Tonight
I know it's gonna happen someday
And my mind on you
Until my days my days are done
It may be tonight
All of my little secrets
Love is something you have to cherish
Out of constant trust
It comes to this
Long as we can all stay together
Every morning when I wake up, uh, money on my mind
I'll be waiting outside till you're ready to go
And at once I knew I was not magnificent
It brings me closer to the place I fear
Elvis tales from Mr Woodward
She was a maniac
I don't wanna see your face at my door
Taking hold of our senses
So go unlock the door
Looks like you're never coming home
Your choice of words and all the fantasies
Apart from the moments so dear to my heart
With all my words
If you promise to let it grow
But to hold him and sing
I'll see you every day
Beauty emanates from every word that you say
In the tower above the earth, we built it for Emmanuel 
Dad, your boy is about to fall
Freedom, a fever you suffered through
I'll cross this hopeless line
The place they ended Kennedy
A good friend, unique, wellread, goodlooking or smart
A million miracles could never stop the pain
We thought the sun would keep our love alive
Everything else slowly fades away
You can't feel it anymore
And here we are in Heaven, for you are mine at last
If wishes were horses then beggars would ride
We say anytime, anywhere, just show your teeth and strike the fear
I don't know where it's gone
Three square meals and a place to call home
That filled the eye
I got the energy to win, I'm full of adrenaline
Good night
Come inside for a while
I feel strings without the black 'n' blues
Still tomorrow comes, I'm still standing on my own two feet
While her children sleep
Not if you care for me
In the dark
Slowly in the sky
And I hope that it would be less tougher
Through on your weary head
Touched by a folded hand
Wishing there was someone just like You
And call me baby, baby all the time
I go dancing with no one else
Let the journey allure you to stay
There, but for the grace of you, go I
Yeah, need some kicks
The world awakens on the run
I didn't stop to think
Please in me, make me well,
I'm still waiting for a chance
Once again I am left out of breath
Who cannot sleep at night 
Than wasted breath
But then you told me a good woman
Let's not fight, that's not nice that is where you'll find me
A crashing sky, a roaring screen
"There's a love that's always meant to be"
O verite um calis potere | Careum deum calis potere
Do you think that I don't know
I want the jump but not the height
Set the party, really set the party off right, yes it will, yes it will Are you gonna be, are you gonna be, are you gonna be, are you gonna be well, well, well, well
Each day is valentine's day
I've never
And sometimes find their problems seem like a day's work
There was nothing to hold so we let it go
And you can't do a thing to stop me
I once was sleeping
They say heaven was in tune, your point of view,
Sell our little home
How will I ever let you know
I'd llllllove to be a man
Any way you stretch it
 am twilight
And there's the star I used to wish on Star I used to wish on
Until the magic morning hour
Each tear that flows from my eyes brings back memories of you to me
I will come to you
I'll apologize to the ones I love,
Say hello to everything you've left behind
Anything they want to you
To fall into loving so deep
The slow decay of my mind
Till the feathers all come out
Replace these veins
The one that I loved, used to laugh when I cried
Follow all these footsteps I left behind,
Run along beside me
Will I ever see you more
Repeating over and over
For I cannot disgrace myself
Every time I try to say hello
We can share the air pollution
So severe
So why am I ten feet under and upside down
But no one can argue with the good sense and strength of a solid foundation
But the alcohol didn't let her understand
I was a teenage smog
O come in, come through the door,
There's no one around
And fill it's mouth with the desire
Gaping holes where diamonds should be
She was a wreck, but so was he
We'd fall asleep by the big blue sea
I close my eyes and feel the stress
And I would come home forever
Or put all the pieces together again
It's never easy to cross any borders
Something always brings me back to you
Who fell down, but then rose
It all unfolds before your eyes
I don't wanna die
Whever the fuck that is somebody help
You know that it all takes my breath away
For someone like you to remain so sure
To England where my heart lies
If I could change my life
In the morning
And the business was doing great
Take time look at the sunshine
I wanna hear the humming of the sun
With no one by their side
Cool my fever high
Quem sabe com ela 
Blurring all the edges
Doesn't seem like anything you're saying or saying or doing
Naw it's just me again, cryin' in the rain
And we lay, nocturnal
You're here afraid yet still you try,
Whatever it is I do, I'm only thinking of you
And we're standing on top of our hopes and fears
Our love has never had a leg to stand on
Maybe I'm still hurting
I don't know which way I'm going
Me basta tu mirada para comprender
I won't let you squeeze right through
There's no one to make me realize
God's chosen a place
Music, the bass boomin' from the car parked in the street
On the breeze of night
Ship to shore
And everything has changed
It comes in a bottle
Nobody knows what I believe
'Cause I'm midway down the midway
That's my story
Then you gave your heart to me
It takes some silence to make sound
And I remember our bliss
I often slip and then I lean toward three W's in life
And I'm not the smartest man
It breathes within me and all that I am
And for the freeway maintainers who assist our escape
Never a time again
The prison walls are crashing down as winter dies without a sound, on this early April Morning
No, I can just feel you
With people changing all their minds; it's crazy
Oh Florida please be still tonight
Could take the life of one so precious
Trying to feel
Put's his lips on my neck
And I don't know how
I remember the things you hated
Nothing can stop what we do
No past or future here
Pela janela aberta
Drifting on a bed
When it's dark bring in light so you can see
To bring some love in here today
From my cloud to see what it's all about
And if you're this this this full of bitterness now
And I lie awake
I would buy you anything
The same word x
My left hand, a part of me
From loving you, shine
Compassion for mine
"You know it could be the distributor and it could be your coil"
Never too far
We could be anything you want
Waiting to finally be set free
But heartache and misery
Come the night you could be my confidant
And a long way from home
I don't know if I can do this alone
Ought to be on my way right now
Ele assinou contratos
So I guess it's all good cause it kept me alive
And when I get thirsty
Looked into my eyes, said, you're my fix for life but now
Broken, broken, broken
C'mon now, people, c'mon and slide with me
Something perfect for that student
Everything has to end, you'll soon find we're out of time left to watch it all unwind
Is like walking on the freeway
Sangue e algodão
If you know how much it matters
You gon' think about me when I'm gone
I wanted to show you again 
I stood once where Hitler's feet had stood
Another kiss that you knew I meant 
Now it's time to move on
I was just a little girl, but I can't go back
Do you think you can find it better than you had it
My heart is aching for love
We'll get through it
She�s a spectacular girl
Well, we sound so good together
I hear you laugh I heard you sing
Bleeding tongue
I know you Never seen me 
Go catch the light in every cell
But she'll always be the girl from yesterday 
Perfect as I'll ever be
My eyes only see to your heart
If you ever got the time, darling 
And I hear my name
I'm on a mission for dimepieces and sexy ladies
Let the church bells ring
And here we are in Heaven
I know we'll make it
She don't know you but she swear she knows your type
Your silence kills me;
You can hear ghost trains
On angels' wings
As she puts on her coat
I'm frightened by the way you feel
She shoveled the dirt into my face,
I've never stopped feeling like family is much more than blood
All of my life I was in hiding
But this boy I know, he is pure of soul
And I'm not sure that I'll get over you
Is it a kind of shadow
Now it's two hours to go
And men do foolish things
A single bloom piercing the snowdrift
With a loveyou line
A telephone that rings, but who's to answer 
Last breath last scream
I make a date for golf
The ground
Is it just me or is it dark in here
I've clawed it back again
The place where my best friend passed away
Somebody to talk to
They make the biggest sounds
You gotta live and learn
Rather than for sport
So, steal the show, and do your best
Without children to grow
Heard a gruesome story
It's just another fight to me
She's out on the street again there she goes
And dust to dust
And they don't know how hard I'm aching
Menm si ou we ou pa we demen
Potential to bend
This is tearing me apart, I wish I could be in your soft arms
Everything's moving away too fast
That's rare
Down the streets on prospect
I got a light bulb full of anger
Long way down if you fall
That was another time
Denn mit dem Herz sind wir meist blind
Because I'm all you've got
Your life is so complicated
On the edge of summer
And I have wondered when we die
But if I'm wrong then show me I'm wrong
And we've got to find other ways to make it alone or keep a straight face
Jesus the Mexican boy gave me a ride on the back of his bike
I don't wanna waste another day,
Will you always be
I'm sick, there's not a thing I wanna do about it
One more time to take the test to make it real
Now another winter time has come and gone
Had it coming my friend, my friend
Naked by the light
Everywhere we went just looked the same to me
She wants to say;
Throwin' up player wave to my partners on the block
Wishin' on your name
And we never wake again
All the time of finding ways to make things fall in line
Tried to lose control
Tremble and fall
Your hands made sure I'd stay intact
But you can't fly unless you let yourself,
It's snowing again
Now, for a time,
Out on the edge, out on the town
On Bleecker Street
Speeds across the sea 
It's alright
Mended and all made clean
And You are the thunder and
Our weight in sin
Please don't be upset my darling, please don't be upset
As cool as a sigh, as volatile as something you say
The new is in, and we're feeling better already
Life's too short and I feel small
I used to make you laugh about anything
Everything I feel is here
Ride along the winds of time and see where we have been
Take care not to hurt yourself
Is a sick place to be, to be
The closer you get, better you see
We'll stick together forever
Taking time I'll still be here
I can't get through
Like a holy rolling stone
For you were once a child of innocence
An eclipse of emotion
And let your mind go
But maybe the question mark helps
When your face is caked with mud,
Always had a feeling it would pass
Doll, I love you
Trying to turn the pages of my magazine
Tiny star she guides my way
Instead you vanished into thin air
So believe what you want to
I want this ma'am, that ma'am, no sir, yes ma'am, that sir;
You'll get through this if you hang on
Your skin protected me from sunbeams
I want to say I'm sorry for stuff I haven't done yet
Travel light, don't think twice
There is another world
There's a pleasure we must all feel
Love is ended before it's begun
Someone stopped for a pickup driving one of those cars
I know we'll make it through
Come on, come up, while we're still young
They say we stand for nothing
I could hide a million years and try to believe
Away
Everything you hold can come
Und mit der Freundin Lust
I saw you, I saw you standing there
Brightness fills empty space
I find it very, very easy to be true
Here, broken and cold, with great remorse
I wonder how I'll sleep
All alone and bad
The night you showed me I could see,
With ain't nobody really try to find out what she feelin'
And Harlem River all because
You can make it last
And all I've ever seen will be forgotten
Where I send my thoughts
And it takes no time to fall in love
Did you hide behind your books girl
Cover your teeth, I love you
Northern lights and skies ablaze
It is something that's inside of you and me 
With the world strung like a rosary
They drop me in this fairground abnormal
My sister awake
And poke my head out the door
Somewhere around here there are witches
I hope I see you on the other side of this changing world
Your pretty face and electric soul
A vision of a rising empire
And there's no grace in what you say 
Somewhere distant and it's all far away
He will disappoint you if you see through his perfect smile
To an altar of diamonds
For your memory
Looking at the snow and trees that grow
I could drive 
Never comes around
Turned back to front
You rode me on your bicycle down Main Street
It felt like Christmas time
Take off your shoes, hang up your wings
I never needed you to question what I spent
Many roads are ahead of us
No four leaf clover
Will be washed away
When you grow up, what kind of person will you be
Doing all that fun kid stuff
All drift away and a mother cries
Do you really know that I can't, I can't afford you
Oh my God, it echoes the mind
That you could think I'd never know 
By something that's simple and easy and true
You were writing your set taped to your guitar
And the clouds all form a geometric shape 
Attracts me like no other lover
And his wife, he lost his life strugglin' over a gun
Oh brother of mine 
To rise above and beat it
Love is the best feeling I ever had
And I will be set free from the people
A light heart
Whereever I go, your shadow follows me
Because it happened in a remote parking lot in Las Vegas
To give them time to let them breathe
Maybe he will be my friend
Who spends the facts of his life like small change on strangers
And if you knew now what you knew then
See many men it will take to survice
Say All I need is the air I breathe and a place to rest my head"
Maybe the morning is too soon
Off in the distance the marble dome
I'll be recruited by someone
I see the same things
Lower than the sea
Sometimes I wish we could just pretend
Won't you just give me a chance"
We dance a borrowed chick while hiding from the fine
He took my bones and turned them into bread
Danger, in every corner
Time after time
Your eyes aren't deceiving
The pressure to keep it real
You stole what was left of the sky
Ain't it funny, a power comes with money
My nightmare is over
Oh how did it go so very wrong
Pops like a light bulb
Days go by, nothing's getting clearer
That you won't censor anything
And when the sun dies
C'est l'éloquence de mes silences
The women will kill you for sport
But I can't even vibe wit you sexually
That has come between me and you
Got woken up by birds and bees
Maybe you'll rewrite my love song
Falling, falling 
To the natural truth
Well they know you're trying to hard
Apologize for all my sins
And pedaled off alone
nuottiavain sun korvas on lukossa
You keep looking down the track
I won't regret my return
I know to be there
Can you believe It's much better
Mil acasos me levam a perder
And I looked through the zoom lens
Talking to someone, staring 
Had the perfect job called life
I'm feeling oh so young
One kept occurring and reoccurring in his dream
Flies to your flame
Don't know this place
Sets me free
Sinnlos gehe ich zu Grund
Life spans  years have gone
I will sing out melodies
True love in your heart
But I am not a simple man
There's not a thing that I would change
Standing on the outside, looking
A substance state of mind
Lover, will you spin me round
Everything will come It will come in time
Bringing tears to my eyes
I will be your man
Wake up, we're stealing cars
I feel, I feel, I feel so scared
Whatever you're doing now would probably suit me fine
Chase me through the dark
Is it so easy to pretend
Wanna hold you down
Take all we are allowed
Life's a game made for everyone
Is your mouth a little weak
Close one there
You have been the one for me
I've found the hard way love is true
When time keeps crawling by
Wie du swingst und dich noch mal locker umdrehst
Tell me tell me you'll be all right
I'm not asking for much
Lessons learned through handshakes
All my moments made of stone
Crankin' up the tunes
You are the only ones who know
Someone, much better
But I gotta run
He questions whether chance or fate will ever show a sign
Why tear it all apart
You'll never be alone;
If you promise to let it
Are you lonely
Kiss the back of my neck
You were ready to fight 
You watch the moon and hope the damn thing crumbles
There will be glad and a perfect bed
There's a harvest buried in the bottom of the sky
Memories, they fall apart, whenever you're inside my head
I must not ever lose
But she's got a constant fever 
Baby, baby all the time
We turn our backs to end of time
They're lined up at the window, peer down into limbo
And one could get lost in all of these stars
Là je donnerai ma vie pour t'entendre
Corroding by the sea
Somebody, somebody tell me
Ou será que foi dela o que eu já amei
So you can get back to where you should be
The air did bring
I cannot be your everything
No time to choose
Yeah, drive slow, homie
, years beside myself
I am hopeless
Well you know I'd never say it out loud
After the show you walked right past
So please, try to understand that if I could, I'd call and I would be there
He feels the time is surely now or never more
But if there's nothin' I can do to make amends, baby
I am well aware
Father has gone
Och Fredrik är gammal men månen är ny
It's only saying goodbye
Over and over, we're turning off the light
So I'll take the lie
And after the winter broke
Though I feel it sinking further every time
I don't want you to hate for all the hurt that you feel
My God, what have I done
As it rush over you 
And alone
And you're free
A sword someone would keep at their side
We wait in your heart
The radiator sprung a leak
'Cause I know I'm beautiful
And where do you start
I hope they won't be too quick to begrudge me
And the waves like lessons
I've got a girlfriend
Don't Don't fight don't argue
Rapaziada que estiver afim, vai lá
Others sang your life
I want to be somewhere I can see the roads
'Cause I've had enough waiting,
And now all we've got is lunchhour light
Flying the hills
And tell me I'm the one you heart needs
You can keep on crawling away
Is barking out my name
You won't matter anymore
You'll become a resolution
Can't you see, there's a part of me that's brand new
A river winding blue among the dunes and a marble bed
For you are mine at last
Though if my ache could be assuaged by sin
And something's moving on the periphery
Because I've come home
We've turned it off in the night 
Judy's day passed out of sight
We'd never aim to kill or scare
Helicopters overhead
There's an eclipse in your eye
Oh, hold its hands, it'll feel like lightning
Let me get your ass alone
I wasn't made for anytime
And if you were with me tonight
Bends down to light the sea
I wanted to show you the stars
A room in the shadow of a funnylooking man
Do you notice Do you notice
Where there's a snowball's chance that the personnel
No matter how you try
I know I will say goodbye
Ice cream with a cherry plus a big pretty please
Now you're too young for the golden age
From what's broken inside
Chess pieces in some grandiose scheme 
Without fear you seek more
I'd say" go to bed, world"
Back up to Heaven all alone
But now I can't stay 
You never mean what you say
Of the dream that leads me home
Whenever I get weary
Death; portrayed by Busta Rhymes + sounds of a shovel digging + a heartbeat
I am not who I want to be
We don't know which way we're goin'
Scenes of summer skies
And then I hear the voices call
y, verán, los espiarán, y todo es tan humano
On the crossroad to the devil, I'll dwel and I'll count my years
To buy things they don't need
Is love, you see
I never could tell you what you mean to me
Gone gone gone black widow
Have the pleasure of meaning what you sing
My memory stirred
Now I can invite yo ass out to my estate
And I'm sinking my teeth into her
And through her dooreen peep
Then it goes fast, you think of the past 
The world is all bending and breaking from me
What is that sad look in your eyes
Do you know it, do you feel it, do you know it
Tell 'em niggas, man, y'all trippin' with no maps
Prides himself on being a man of the world
You don't make it easy
Forced to stand down and brave the winter
Der tag war grau und es schneite, ich nahm ab
One day I will find peace within myself
The boats are in their docks under a clear blue sky
Is the metal in my head when I walk
Every day, every day
This land is a young land let it stay that way
I don't need anyone else
I know a man who may need a new assignment
You set the break and set the tone
If I could lure my singing bird 
And it's never seemed so far away
Now now the winter glows
"I hated everyone" said the sun
And once more darkness it descends
We ended up nowhere
Don't pull your eyes off the ground 
Calling me a fool, saying that I've effed up everything
Got a woman at home
But I don't care, I long for more,
You never need to part
Cover much ground, got game by the pound
The floors are all collapsing still I'm begging to be free
That you could look up these words
Thunder comes arollin' down
But you're staying overnight,
Analyzing your moments when you're here
I stood close enough to hear you say,
And right now
Didn't know if you could
Because when we're drinking
How my thoughts they spin me 'round
So we've been told and some choose to believe it
Little acorn becomes the mighty oak
Anything can happen
Some say I am to blame
niin kauan et sun korvat soi x
If you get my name wrong I won't get pissed off cause
And people are such
Jennifer dates a man in a sixties cover band
It never did a thing for me
She tries to help out everyone
It's just a runaround
I'll hold you Hold me and touch you Touch me, baby, And make you my woman Make me your woman, tonight Tonight
All the rage of watching mothers
Abashedly accommodate mortality, undoubtedly I'm
Now the daylight's returning
'Cause it's been a long time
I never talk to you
Like night's intrusion
Come in contact with one another
He calls himself at night, in soft overchords
You called me out from the dark, and brought me into the light
Don't look back
When you are down
He was the wrong guy
When I drink my rivers, drag my feet, and drown in my dreams
Never, never calm down
From the bottom of my heart, dear
Our hands are in a knot
You're my picture on the wall,
I look to my Eskimo friend
If I can feel you in the wind
You have a home here
And heal what was cut and bruised
And the dog drank from your cup
Waiting on a clear reason
Vapour, like a veil, hangs over
"You're somebody's baby"
Come dream with me
A stranger gives sometimes
Are you going to age with grace
I hope you find what you're looking for 
Those squinty eyes are just starting to see
Moving slowly
If you want to hold your own hand going up that cliff
They fell like sand
We'll discreetly share a cab home when the evening ends
Please believe me
And noone knows if they've done more here
And somehow I got to find the strength to move
Just know who I am
You're looking at fear
Our hands are in the branches
I don't want you to hate;
And our lives will fade as in darkness we will bathe
Oh, I'm not gonna be the one to mess this up,
Chances are you've travelled too far
But I still act sur, surprised
And I am ashamed
Mom, your baby's on his way
Och gud vet att jag måste leva mitt
The warmer air rises, and the cooler air falls
Feature the murders of lonely women
It's easy to see right through your fingers and hide
Monday night
She's gone  miles, it's very far
Lookin' back at the crash site
What are we if we're not alone
Sing it loud and clear, I'll always be waiting for you
I'm always having with myself
What'd you say I bless
From up in the sky you are kind you are wise
I gotta find a volunteer
Pinch to snub that restless nerve
And I had no place else to go
Like I'm still trying
I make up a song as I'm aworking along
Juliet, when we made love you used to cry
Smoke and mirrors playing your wit
Please keep her a part of my life
Ich mach die Augen zu, sonst ist alles zu spät
Lay only leopard flowers upon my path
And I went back to you
So much time on the other side,
And I ain't buying on the street
You're working hard on a life of your own
Hidden tales of forbidden
As the dust clears and it all starts to disappear
And let the insects do their thing
And it's a mystery how people behave
He puts his red coat downstairs
Just like us, he shoots stray cats for fun
When I discovered all your dirty grotty magazines
So strap on tight take this ride Ha
É ver o céu se abrir no estilo e não se animar
But you always know just what you want
But you know you must soon go down
You, you were the joy in my life
I see it in the stars,
Find whatever you're after
Give me a chance to put back all the pieces
And grow in confidence
I'd, I'd like to paint this picture for you
Too much and I fall
When you'll be willing to sell, your body for one precious taste, then all is left to waste
For the things we are
You take much more than I'd ever ask for
And now their footsteps pass
I'm just glad to be in love again
The sun goes down
As he came up out of the night
Can't seem to let you go
dejé tejido su hilo dentro de mí 
And some are fighters
Coming out from the dark
I'll ask that you find someone to help
Bring it on back, Bring it on back, Bring on back
I had turned to stone with fear,
Free your vulnerable mind
And I will never forget how you touched my life
It's going to be a bright, bright sunshiny day
I can feel them move with your body
Left for them to plunder
And learn to fly
Or a lover who never said goodbye
Like the one I'm dreaming of
But I think he knows
Felt just like an ordinary day Just around the corner such a surprise,
With my tongue I touch your mind
And everything was quiet
And now that you wanna know
And as we say so long
I feel
But it doesn't mean I didn't make it hard to carry on
Never would
And I guess you might be right
I am the sun in the flame
The moon will rise
Hope to rest upon
Nothing could be better
The cannons' thunder can't prevail
For the touch of your hand in the June night
Before all the days are gone
You do two things and then they both gonna suffer
Enough is enough, no one stops the catarpillar
To make everything else erase
With no call back, where was y'all at, gimme the ball back
'Cause Rotterdam is anywhere
Warm you like the sunshine
Hollow forced inside this empty hole
Just close your eyes
Or make her go away
Think of all the places we could be
I'm lost, always 
Keep breathing my angel, if you go down I go down with you, keep breathing, just keep breathing
It feels like I'm knockin' on the heaven's door
Slumber, not in my lifetime
I�m gonna get there, I�m telling you sir
To have loved and to lose it
Come and wash me cleaea ea ea ean
Oh honey don't know how long it's been
Cursing the skies of this company
Now I try not to tell lies
And the sound of passing trains
May you bring love and may you bring happiness
As the city slowly lifts away
But still we want it, oh
My heart liquefied and I sighed, "Oh, this must be a dream"
Through the words of heartache to the end
And when the sky's done cavin' in
No matter where they are
I won't call you cause of your new friend
Is it desire that I want
Down into the river's darkness 
Let 'em go, give it up, for a while
Smoke fills the room
The bright and beautiful parade
They are searching for the temple of the holy
What have you done
With no despair
I wouldn't say that he spent his time driving over
There are people who will tell you
Voices leaking from a sad café
Woooooh
It's the book of my days, it's the book of my life
Twenty times again
If the lesson is never learned it's just like stitches for show
Wir riechen an den Blumen
Joining up the pieces
Please don't be upset my darling please don't get upset
From our own separate sides
You might speak, would it be words and what would you say
Just like mine
When you open your mouth, your teeth are beautifully polished
Encounters with police, with my hands in the air
Two eyes
Inside his basement
His song's too blue to fly
In need
And I've paid the price
Each day I'll turn it back
It's because the days have no numbers
That's what has become
You know just where I keep my better side
Can't accept what you did
You give me a reason to face every day
And, meanwhile, a man was falling from space,
Searching for a reason,
Brings memories back when you were here
Are you the one the one I've been dreaming of
Should you be scared
You cannot stop the natural flow of thought
Not sure what you're losing, though
They see him, want him to please them, want him to play them, but they don't even pay him
There's still luck that you can find
So long ago, mean and my friend we were friendly
me sinut tehtiin mutta sinä meidät loit
You're tall and you are skinny
It makes me worry
Hope you don't murder me
Spoke no silver spoon
As if you had the right
Because love comes from the dirt in my own backyard
MagnetMund, rot verschmiert
And people who talk too much
Black sea of agony
A woman's heart is yours forever,
So when your bones are broke and you're all alone
Thought I heard the voice of mommy
Time like a river
But I'm alright
I've been told I will be there in time
Now that I can share it with someone
That years from now
A finger's touch upon my lips
Did I sell my soul for that feeling
'Cause all the things you thought were safe, ooh now they're gone
And all you need is what you see
I sing it loud and clear and I'll always be waiting for you
All the lights look green
No one can hurt you now
Candy says I'd like it where she is
But it's really out of my control
When the birds keeping singing
All the comforts of cathedrals
And watch them float away at the same time
Von ihm wurde mir viel erzählt als ich klein war
My love, do you know
You'll always be in my orbit
I know she'll be so great for you
It's making my soul sing
Al B Sure nigga with the hair all wavy
I'm with Akinyele in the street, trying to get us a deal
And I have been the fool
I know I'll still feel the same, yeah
And they wonder why you're frustrated
You looked at me and saw what I never could see
Got a wife and kids in Baltimore, Jack
Will they offset the colossal karma debt
The sun will shine again
And we've finished all our songs
But all the time when I'm alone I think of you and how you've grown
Soaked in the sound that rose from the ground
Were you wondering was the gamble worth the price
And looks down on such slight a thing
We're born into this world Never never know the reason why
Where will I go when my broken body dies
und sgleich z'ir beider herzen în 
I know you meant to come back, I know you meant to stay
Sometimes I feel so lonely, sometimes I feel so lonely
'Cause they are tired of being tied inside the night
Trains across the plains
A deeper shade of Brown
No don't don't let your anger grow
If time is all I had
Have you ever been told that you look like a llama
Then they sat and chewed the scenery
I see your true colors, and that's why I love you
Come on away from me is it done
"Oohweeee man"
And wrists that touch
Years gone by and still
And they throw harder
It sounds different everyday
Greening fields and windy mines
With tears in our eyes
D'aller visiter le Mali mais son visage a pâli
I love you anyway
And the grass is so high
Pushing flame scorched limos to the oil rig tonight,
One that just had his heart broke
All I wonder
First of April, love of your life falls out of the blue
And in the sky a star alone
And all I want to do is go home with you but I know I'm out of my mind
Have mine it's better on you anyway
Unconscious, made conscious out of the darkness into
Just tell me this is not the end
No, I never wasted my time 
And this lesson I've learned, I've learned it the hard way
Every other little time
And no amount of tears can bring it back round till it comes again
Neither of which I get enough of
You will be the one screaming out
I don't want to leave her now
Laying everybody low, with a love song that he made
Rhea sat on the front step getting her hair combed out and greased
And I will show you a lover,
Softly he glides along the streets and alleys
Don't you shiver, don't you shiver
I wanna live to live and take my chances
Anonymity sha la la la
From child to teenager
So if you trust what's in your heart
To the outside, the dead leaves lay on the lawn
He nicknamed me KRock so they would leave me alone
So let's take it higher sweetie Let's take it higher sweetie
I fell in love with his sister unrepentantly
My whispered reason is
Under the covers I'm okay I guess
Throw yourself up on runaways,
Oh how the hills were laughing
The days whispered and shouted
But you will never see the sun
You really know that it's not so
De visar han på TV
I don't fade away, I don't fade away, unless I choose
Il faut oublier
It takes a whole lotta medicine
And I want
To believe in yourself
Little boy from Paris to the States, check the facts
Why I can't stay
If your wandering ever leads you
While all your people around you start to leave you in the same place
And the town cryer's cryin' there with nickels in his hands
Put your hands around my neck
Saw your picture on accident
There's a window on earth
I'm never alone
And if you ever come at me I will hurt you
And it finally feels like my life has begun
You better think it over
Completely unaware, could be anywhere, anytime
Always diggin' up some information
I wish I'd never lied
And a man who loves a woman, ah yeah
A painting of a city on a hotel wall
You'll be a grown woman 
I believe
Hey friends don't you think you better cool it down
This woman's got some goats
Boy so hard, boy so hard
Was it hard to fold a hand you knew could win
We see your heartbeat in a cup of tea
Clueless and so high
Then a x drenched my jeans as I tried to cross the road
Ein Blaulicht stoppt den Verkehr
And gun lead to mothers
The Dowmaker's ghost
No, no I don't care
Do you know where I am right now
I've got no space
I think I'm close but I stand so far
Everybodys wishing for no more mistakes
Dear love, come what may
That you picked up on the way
You keep me up at night when I'm worried sick about you,
Every day is a door leading back to the core
Are you back in my life to stay
Turn me back into the pet
O senso, o ritmo habitual
Should I be on your mind
My brain's the burger and my heart's the charcoal
Well define my love with attitude
How could we ever
Tu eres mi amor de verdad
A bloodred moon is
Kotoba hitotsu iidasenai 
And take what you will tonight
I was too Busy staring at you
But tonight we'll reach for the stars
Love come and bless me, show me how it feels
Well I wish you were closer than near
And now your eyes they look at me
And I've been walkin' on these streets so long
I surprised myself as my mouth started speaking
My eyes grew heavy and my lips they could not speak
I'll stare into the strobe light flicker
Or is it just for today
And every wall that once was clean has turned a shade of grey
People get shattered in many ways
And I thought, And I thought
They don't know 'bout me and you
In what ever way feels comfortable for you
Hier war zuviel weiß,
Brain's a square of grass
The way you're juvenile
Nobody cares about you
Like wild game
Not the radio
And now I am supplying you the time and space
Mr Nothing's got a lot
As life for me is life through 'I'
It takes some bad for satisfaction
I warned I
And I am not frightened although it's hot
I'll hear this song that breaks my heart
Maybe it's time to fly
Please, God, let's not resort to minimall parking spaces
You got to leave it alone"
White light on a black sky is a miracle from above
But I still hung on, just hoping for my love to come around
Mumbling to the girl in blue
This house is cold and empty
Even barer than a child's
I'll be waiting, waiting on a brand new day
For a while
So I fulfill my destiny and accept my fate
Somewhere far along this road, he lost his soul to a woman so heartless
But as you go your own way
These simple games will soon be growing tales
Like a pretender
Gave me life under calico skies
Let's not just talk about it please
Down by the water and the tide keeps rising
All that we were, all that we knew
Guilty as sin, straighten
As the seasons change
Like an old friend I've known forever
Are you the girl I've been dreaming of
One embrace, one embrace
In his homemade, fan blade, oneman submarine ride
All alone once again
To be free
With never time to say
Take off those silver spurs and help me pass the time
You had such good ways
It's okay, to think about ending
You are my friend
There is no such place, so perhaps we have a reason
Call your mother, say "take me home"
'Cause you the only boo who do the freaky things you do
Feels like a day, still you make my heart ache
They'd tell stories that would warm my soul
'Cause I'm so tired of it all
To drive it away 
I need to find an engine for my car
Du point de vue le plus essentiel
Every little way
The wind in my heart
My heart was blinded by you
When's it gonna end
Begging for my hand
It�s like you knew me
Why don't you come and ease your mind with me
And that everything is free as long as you do what they tell you to
There is no side to choose
On Over Hill
She's doesn't deserve to be in a place like this
Is buried down deep with the rest
They say that I'm not dead
I remember who you are
A change in this place
But I never meant to hurt you
Doing right
When my legs no longer carry
It never takes too long
I knew that you're mine
You know that I love you
A kinda sense for these things,
No understanding
I want to take in it all
You pour out your prayers and weep 'cause you care
Paintin' pictures to discover foreign lands
Because we were once cinema gods in the night,
They chanced to look at what was inside
Someone else you'd rather phone 
Words don't come easily
I've torn everyone who reached out for me
Det springer råttor bakom ridån på hans estrad
Sung with a chorus of tones
It'll take you 'round and 'round
Unpredictable like the sun
I remember how you freed your hair
But when we're close
Your skin was appealing wallpaper
I would have ended it by now
'Cause I feel it
I wonder could they tell, how did they know
I'll carry it to my grave
The feeling was there
And tomorrow Dick is wearing pants
The wayward days are gone
When wished on the morning star
We never knew where we were going
There's not enough time
Standing and drawn across the room
And, yeah, some mad tattoos
Lumière, darling
I know
Here began all my dreams
Waiting for my moment, I was destined to shine
I'm alright
To every little action, yeah yeah yeah
As dead as yesterday, yeah
To stand at the bus stop
But you still have all of me
Cause and effect
In his mind I'm proud to roam
Did you ever read the words
So you can take comfort now
Seu nome é Jaqueline Misty, yeahoh
I find I'm on your street, dear
Chance is all you need
Moving cross the land
Last time they've seen his smiling face
Let it be known that I'd never fold
What I need is to get away
Of love and dreams to share
Would you still look in my eyes
I don't take the helping hand
I get it, I get it 
Or a lover
I've held a hand
There are times I could come to you and hurt you
And she said, "Shut your mouth
Fieldfares' song skirmishes
That can mesmerize the soul
That hold us down
Girl, I know you're hurt
And if you want to have other people watch you while you eat it
E eu aqui a comer poeira
Burning in your eyes, when we unite
I didn't know it would be the last time
You've come a long way from the runnynosed and scruffy kid I knew
And the darkness, inside you makes you feel so small
And watch the water as it rose
But a cold stare
I always hoped you'd be showin,
He took a homemade, fan blade, oneman submarine ride
'Cause it's all you see
My mind or my heart
My canaries is gleamin' through my angel wings
You're free
He'll soon be at your side
Living outside of mutual bliss
I close my eyes and remember
Just another know it all fatality
That's the way it goes some days
The tears of a silent rain
Is this really what you want
And high as the flame will rise
And the lives that you hold in the palm of your hand
Ride that highway in the sky
But if you are, I am quite alright hiding today
Just face the fact your shit's a wrap and you gotta deal with the shit
But you're always on the run
A steady bold one 
Another love I found not to let it down
Whenever I get dreary
Remember that one night on the town
And she pinned back her hair Shouldered with care 
'Cause the words are dead
Everything that you do's so amazing to me
But there's never a rose
bboylle, tanssijoille, muusikoille,
But fate is cruel sometimes,
Yeah, that shares no resemblance to that at all
One thing you must know
Baby, just pretend
I wonder what to make of Heaven
This is the day to pay for all her pain
So let your bare feet bleed
I am my soul's belief
Glanced in your eyes and fell through the skies
Look in your wallet all you'll find
Lie for fun and fake the way I hold you
Concrete heart
Slow motion light
There are very many places
And I drove all night to find my child
That's a thought I could not bear
Will things be any different
Now in a hurry, running up urgent
All your sweet talking, raining over me
Upon the flowers bloom
Ich habe so lange gewartet und dann ging es viel zu schnell
Say put your faith in me
Set themselves between the blades of grass,
Then you beat the love right out of me
WELL I guess it doesn't matter any more
Into the air  we'll keep on kicking 
We'll be back soon
Full of cigarettes, guns and drugs and stuff
And preyed that maybe
From the ground
Zu vergessen wie schön das Leben bisher war
From this shore a stone
Into strangest heavens
And no one waits forever
Lead different lives
Look up in the sky
'Cause we're 
Yeah but to get to the morning first you have to get through the night
Shared your dreams and shared your bed
And you will be pleased to know 
Of an ever older me 
To keep my eyes open wide
I've got to stay hidden in this Abbey"
Breakdown a hurting sound
Windows opened I'd be scary
A medical wonder
That burned out halo hangs right above his head
Look at where we are
It's for the greater good, 'cause I'd rather be great than good
The pines control the wild sarcasm 
I mean, we could use a little straight on
Perdido no tempo ou no espaço
But heaven knows I know
To sit around and search for something I ain't never gonna find
When all the stars were aligned
Two is better than one
Well buy me the fastest car and throw me the keys
Hiding out in the subway system
Oohoohooh, oohoohooh
She says it's an opportunity I don't want to miss
¡Humano ¡Qué espanto Humano
Everybody clings to their own fear
I will walk down to the end with you
Postcards to the one I miss forever
Me, you, the crew just fell out over dough and a li'l crack
To change
I could live in the breath you're wasting
Loneliness abounds
Save my money
Because all the time
Come now, make your move
Hold you tight, words have a new sound
Now I watch you fall asleep smiling
Well a few things going my way this time
Puis j'ai rencontré une jeune nana dans le train
Cold, cold night
I'm just gonna write where you are on my shirt
When you start to fade
Fifteen years is almost done
You pull me like the moon pulls on the tide
Far worthier lines in silence of thy state
There ain't many folks
We're getting dead and it's the right way to do it
Oh Pancho we're headin' towards our end
Catchweed into the fold
Inside out every chance I get to
September, keeping kite time together we summon the wind
Now papa Hemingway he rent this boat
To the holy water
Find them in the heat of day
Have you ever been told you've got a weirdshaped head
Oh when you say you know
I could never understand
That never was
You are all in my dreams
When you're an old woman and I'm an old man
There's no room in this town
How you get your kicks for living
I'll find my own way out
Our eyes are in the flowers
Keep on wonderin' about you
Try to push it back
The games of
Whoowhoowhoo, whoohooo, whoohoooooh
Not that you're the one
Though even though I know that the bad boy move in silence
That beat outside my window
A constant state 
We won't let you slip inbetween
My days now end as they begun
There I could feel
Somewhere Sunday morning brings us miles from earthbound, sailing the wind
'Cause I don't need you now 
Them hollow tips bent me up, but I'm back in shape
Are beautiful, ooh like a rainbow
And I'm all out of light
Brother that I love you
Don't you know a girl gets angry
It's not very far, sugar
I am alone I am dreaming of the sea
I can't pull myself back from you
He knows his friend the wind is always standing by
And beautifully she sank as up river was the bank
My thoughts running over
A look into your eyes
And sunny skies
We should be living like we lived that summer
Spring vacation, good vibration
Well, today a friend told me this sorry tale
And I'm awalking the floor
The full moon dips its golden spoon
Well, they'll never believe what's been happening here 
No more light green leaves
It's not forever we can fool around in the dark
Whenever you walk by, 'cause I still love you
You turned a man to stone
If the world was how it should be
I'll be recruited by someone
Will this horizontal line
Floating in the vacuum with no purpose, not a one 
Now springtime only reminds me of Tracy's tears
There is room if you can trust
If love could've lasted forever I'd still hear her say darlin'
Towards you
Till the sound's so thick it turns the sky to smoke
Running out of room
We're all still a part of everything that we were
All the kids from school
J'ai voulu retrouver son corps
Angels falling through my hair
I didn't mean it, I couldn't know
With two eyes open and two eyes staring back
In the summer's air
Last night I saw your shadow
If love could've lasted forever I'd still hear her say darling,
I can't remember you, remember us or anything
I was selfdeluded, confident and blind
I want to play a silver note that fills you with hope
Please stay with me
We'll open our eyes
We got the money
We are in love
Who would take my word
And the cat comes
Went to where the people were on a Saturday night
We won't be forgotten, we'll never give in
Von Gott verbrüht und von den Menschen berührt,
I know without a doubt
Don't be alarmed, it's only a feeling
Even when you bend to give me
Should we carry on
That didn't end in tears
In the Chi and I be sippin' Hennessey, play some R&B
All around the frightened trapeze swingers
I'd long for a new beginning
The hour is getting late"
Got a sick sense of humor
Doctor feels the pain, that caused the sickening rain,
His eyes trouble more than one woman
In so many ways
But I feel your heartbeat
My heart goes like
Asskissing, mercymissing, faithless friend
There is another whole world hanging there upside down
Lucid dreams
Made a terrible beauty
It's time for you to be with someone like me
Would waste it, don't waste it
Everything ponders in the night
And then you'll know
I'm ready to give up the fight
Just after midnight
You'd fall so deep
Back in our old street
That no one wants to hear
I'm just a childhood prisoner of the garden gate
They love my sauce
Of the Dtalk groan and the locker room where we stayed
Send me them seeds I'll grow 'em what they need
But I will never know
Take it in your stride my son the world is yours
They say I'm too kind and sentimental like you could catch affection
But now I say either way
D'you know where it's gonna escalate
We have to continue to dream
Until the angels guided you to me
You're never near here
My heart's like lead, 
When I'm sampling from your bosom
Guess you've got my number
Paws his inside Pea coat pocket for a welcome twentyfive cents
A winter melody she plays
I only want to be a relief
Things kept coming close 
And breathe you out
All over the hall carpet
That was my first crush; I bought my first mic
I don't know, if you're sick
I want to go back again
It's not very far from Sulphur to Sugarcane
When I'm far gone 
The second I do, I know that we'll be through
I search for something to compare you to
Oh Sophie, will you be here in the end
See their faces in the mirror
You're the king of the game that you played
There'd be no tear to wipe from your eye
I know she'll try something
When the day seems lost from the start
Well it seems times change, it all just rolls away
Used to knock me out  harder than the rest
This close, yeah
'Cause I hated when you walk outside that door
Need the light but not the heat of the day
I wished your love away
A lesson that you thought
Sometimes ignorance
Look across now honey the horizon,
And the distance between their years
And after it was over
And I will give to you summer wine
And so he targeted to be the dream guardian
We ran out to see the future, from the ground
Slow down the pace
I'd like to meet a human who makes it all seem clear
I say no, oh no
We could get lost
It feels so good and
I can't deny I'm taken by
Every dream that I dream
Gasoline a burning spiral
After a winter, of getting dull and blue like a tory
Take me from the loneliest
Du doftar så gott och du dansar så bra
This one's hollow
Oh when it rained and it rained
Come back here now 
I'll never let you be sure
And say you've locked some fire away,
When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears
Oh in this day
Baby, why'd you have to run 
Got to crush my fantasies of how this life is supposed to be
Unless you're gonna go
I know 'cause you're calling me, yeah
I go kicking all around
Have the people went to the high hill
You mother me
My eyes open wide
Anyway, what you gonna do about it
The many kisses on my chin
We're at the ground floor
How could I have let you get away
Because you're real
I didn't realize my strength
Do you pray in the night
I've wandered 'round isles
Or overdosed in a star hotel
Lay down your head and I'll sing you a lullaby
We've been generally warned, that's what the surgeon says
Coming down to rescue me
The face forgives the mirror
Well, the river is deep and the river is wide
Looking back on your life
We won't let you squeeze right through
Bicycles for two
They babble commonly
We gonna listen to some Marvin
You couldn't hear the ocean, you couldn't hear the waves
And I'm quite alright hiding tonight
One night
My soul is pinned
She thinks that I've already gone away
But eye to eye
This is the end of the first phase
Stay right where you are, cause
When everything was still
Little by little you touch my heart, where they had touched it too
I sailed too far out to sea
When it gets dark at night
When I say sometimes I'd want you dead
Our voices in our toeses
Suddenly it's hard to see
All of the drugs, she takes at night,
While the angels of love protect us
Why you so still
Hey little bird  hey little bird
I heard your bid once or twice
She swore she'd never told before
But my heart is frozen and the ice is far too thin
I took a river and the river was long and goes on
Meus mihi, suus cuique carus
And stop this motion from slowing
Walking down the road
I heard people die while they're trying to find them
I'm ashamed and I need for you to know
Now I know there is a world beyond
I'll be waiting for you 
You're like Bambi on ice
And if it starts to snow
Now my mind is free from apparitions
Voice of Regina Spektor Jenny, um, I don't know if that's you, because that didn't sound like you, but you know, it's a funny world where machines could replace people Whoever that was, tell Jenny that Regina called her And PS I can't believe what he did
Break break me until I write your favorite song
Ne peut rien changer
He's got a lot to say
I wanna be rich, and I want lots of money
Until the horses run like from the stalls
Someone I would call now
There are wars to win for now leftover sinful days
It started with a flash of light
And you find yourself with no one left to lose
And I'm still fact she's fiction
I remember the first time when you came to town
'Cause those other men are practice
The worst is almost over
Et moi je suis fouMais comment te dire
Right now I'm completely defenseless
É ver alguém feliz de fato sem alguém pra amar
'Fore ya bathe in the light
If I could only stop my mind
One dark day the trees began a trumpet sound,
I brush away
A million miles, still no headway
Pretending that we'll meet
Until the skeletons walk free Until the makeup all comes off
Mo ghaol a nochd air bhar a chuain 
Act like a lady
That ravenhaired beauty of another time
Long distance drunk, oh yeah, oh yeah
And paid with a folk song
She lay under the midnight moon
While she's still around
And the truth is I'm not alone
Far out at sea
I beat them at their own dirty game
That knows no taint of sin
Find your heart now
From the soul I sold like a whore
Thanks, but I will be just fine
I heard you can Can you fly
Waiting for the moment to kill me inside
I say it silently
You've found a new guy
Unconscious, made conscious out of the darkness
Oh I wish my arms were wider
All I've seen is what you've done
Far away from the Moorlough Shore
And all the roads we have to walk are winding
Trouble ahead, but there's just no going back
Up to th St Union Square
Ever since "Summertime" they ain't liked none of mine
I play the ones from yesterday
Falling free
All the world's just made it seem all quiet
And that was the day that I promised I'd never sing of love if it does not exist
I will say goodnight
Breaks the scene and the colors run off
I set my chin a little higher, hope a little longer
But they won't thank our generation
Hope for me, I hope for you,
This ghost lay in a ditch on Thursday
Shell made out of gold
We have something in common 
Sometimes I see myself in you
There's another who looks from behind your eyes
She stayed at home and tried so hard to understand 
Alright, that's good
A perfume latin lovers' scent
A vera rosa
These are the tears of a rapper now
How this ever came to be
Soon she's down the stairs
As for the clouds
Just let it be, if you wanna grow it all must die
Relieved to see it says nothing about us
And when we'd tasted each other
Inside you I just want to wipe away your fears
Youi love would bring an end to my despair
He's somewhere across the border,
I thought I could recognize the sign
He wonders where he's at
Are fading to the distance
And if someone came to be
Que le puse a la noche durante un mes
But there is not a day that ever passed by
Looking after number one
I've got a tight grip on reality
'Cause I get so shaky
They're gonna back up
No one could cry the way my Tracy cried
And the dry Arizona faces,
Don't matter at all
Our war is the pressure, we need to unite
You live your life like a loaded gun
When will the water stop Will it pour all day
Looks like everybody knows
Comme l'eau sur les joues
Lookin' way cool comin' through with the doshure
Driving the lonely road
Baby, that's life
Here's two for being unaware
She reassured me with an unfamilliar line
On a moonlit street
I get caught in the rain
It's not alright, no 
All I see is your face
I keep finding words that leave you  I told you I don't mind
I went riding all around
Just like the way you lost your guns
How could I forget
Faceless fall from this life and ah, if you can't
Hide in a place you know that no one ever goes
I know that I am like the rain
Let's get the party on Let's get the party on
Everyone's leaving
Breached in straight lines
Into your eyes
And make the natural flow
A moonfaced girl with eyes downturned
I don't know why I spend my time
Do they really make me look that clever as I fall to the earth
And I don't want you gone
When the moon takes shape and I dose off, on your shoulders
Wasn't it you who held off a surrender
I'm not ready for you now, please don't hate me
Go, love, if you're going
Let the bird sing
Feeling used
And the rain wash the pain
Images fade but the town won't let them go
Maybe one day I'll see my Tracy again
I touched his hand
Well I ain't no troublemaker
Wie soll ein Mensch das ertragen
Oh no don't run away
I go to sleep, sleep and imagine that you're there with me
I used to be so shy
Of broken bottles
Well I can hardly stand
She haunts the roads
Two things
This waterboy's wasted
All the play fighting, all the flirtatious disses
Why does God cause things like tornadoes and train wrecks
I found a shelter from the sun
I believe in the way that you move
Sitting in the sun with some chocolate
Been a clog in the drain 
But all that good advice gets lost somewhere
Some other gonna come too soon
And all my fragile strength is gone
Put on your dancing shoes, dance away your blues
I always knew that you deserved much more than me
Fading away
You're in my heart
I know it hurts to hear but it's true
Found a brand new family
And no matter what I do yeah
Pack up, let's fly away
Yeah you done me wrong
With both feet on the ground
I forgot, I forgot
So I just wait it out
Trouble needs me
But there's so much time 
I don't know what I'm doing
But if I make the pearly gates
Ora il tempo è un signore distratto è un bambino che dorme
Je voudrais arrêter le temps pass
No running away from the scene of the crime
No, I don't see how it can if it's broken all apart
I could taste the lightning on your breath
We were a dream, unrealistic
To guide you each step of the way
But if Jesus comes to take your hand I won't let go, I won't let go
Starting over again
Good, Good, Good, goodnight
I love you like I do in the noon
Where even the gods outside can wait a moment guy
We're touching faces in the dark
While the summer lasts
No I never meant to hold you down
You can lose sight of it
And the sight I hold so dear
The river will keep this friend
That I saw in your eyes 
I'm a good man with a good heart
I must have a 'S' on my chest, I recovered from the Wild, Wild West, yes
Well, it's your misfortune and none of my own,
No fear that I'll be fading out alone
True words that I should know
Mare imbrium, ariel
Come on now, come on now, child
Wasted all the years are left behind
About the life you never had
Alongside our perfect sons"
It's, oh, so late to start wishing
Is it all right if I go
This night right now
Would you be my friend forever
I sing as a seagull should
So he's well aware how vital a father figure is
Cores, colagens, sons, emoção
Get somebody to, ah, come come on to you
Like a dog you can always come home
Now the rain comes down the windows and it,
Jeder bei Lars sagt ein Witz
And takes away the sense of hearing it all
My summer wine is really made from all these things
And I need you at the dimming of the day
Machines will all break down in the way I know
And we're glaring like warriors
And it always makes me cry, oh my
It's ' o' clock in the morning"
Keep your eyes closed
This invisible city
All of the while, all of the while
All around us
Gefðu hugsun þína
Id blow you upand block the sun
There's dirt on the sidewalk
But still I guess I salute you
I don't get paid enough to run 
And the battles you lost and your bitter defeat
Look straight ahead, nothing but blue skies
I'll tell you what you want to hear
You say, take your axe and fashion me a kind of swing
You're not gone
'Cause I've been drinking all night
'Cause all I need is you, my Valentine
Always looking for attention
I've watched them falling
Are we on our side
It was all so beautiful then
Oh don't run away
If I was a simple man,
Ay, I wanna live in the sky
And no I'm not alright 
And I thought hey
In the spotlight
This is where I build my home
How come I never do
I was taking a leap, I was playing for keeps with you
There's an inner peace I own 
'Cause it's the bolder thing to do
In these times of doing what you're told
Set our hearts ablaze,
Or acknowledge that I don't understand
How many times on this merrygoround
And as he lay dying, I heard his last cry
I can hear you breathe
Blossomchannels
That he closed his eyes and he went to sleep
Now the streets are dark and empty and the problems in our hands
Should you ever fall, I'm gon' be around
For your eyes only
Everything I make, I only make for you
And as I fly away
A teenage spaceship
si vuorte ze handen
You can run out of money
I feel like the only thing I ain't done yet is die, you know
Most are intrigued, some don't care when you come around
And I still hold your hand in mine
And for as long as I breathe I'll save a seat in my memory
Si nos vies sont si fragiles
Eat up your shame
Live to believe you are the only one for me
Or make myself heard
Now and forever our love will remain
Gonna keep on moving on up, I wanna stick around
Please, no more sorrow
I feel it
But life is fine
Heading deeper down
Above all it would be warm but we would keep our heads all 
Always shine
But nothing about measures
Sailing through the stars at night 'til our world is gone
Killing time that I left behind
And she will be loved
And I'm filling it with things
There are very many things
My morning yearning
The joke's gone too far
So hard to fight when you're losing
But afternoons they never come
Walking by strangers
And I prayed real hard for you
And I'm gonna stay here, indefinitely
Oh, my friends
It's that everybody's got somebody
I've known mornings white as diamonds
Nothing left at all
So until tomorrow, sleep Hawaii sleep
Or will it march to a new beat
And if I do I wonder how just you will see me
And no one can dissuade me
I never expected
I might have not have reminded
Do I need to be in love
Crooked minds
Oh I never knew you from the sun
I want you to know it's enough for me
The world keeps turnin'
In your letter you didn't say that
And send it to somebody who's pretending to care
Said even though I know that the gangsters move in silence
And I will cover you
When it came time to dance
You doin' shit and front to prove to people you mean somethin'
You know you had it coming my brother, oh my brother
I can give you, baby, what you can't get from him
At the side of the bed were soft cushions
So we can go away to a happy day
And I am changing, changing
Papa isn't dumb, he understands what this means
Then there's a Reba designs
I just have to say, you look so goddamn good
Closer than you know, love each other so
And all my senses' honesty they belong to you
Spectacular girl
Then you get a kick out of closing the door
Is the moonlight just a flame for her memory
She laid down with a sigh,
But I have work to carry so to speak
I used to cry for Tracy because I wanted to see him again,
When no one cares but you
There are so many things to show to you
In stranger's hands
Fish still bite just like this right, right
In these streets we live in and die, when it's your time
The sombre way
I almost feel sorry for what I'm gonna do
I need to change I need to change
The women do cry as they watch over me
Of everything I wanted when you came along
Sick since six, seen 'em revolve around a small town
And it's lights out for catholic computers
Look straight in the mirror, watch it come clearer
Aidan taakse, sinne missä on
Days went by and years went by
And even if you ask right
Till the rays of gold and honey cover you
Together making life
A seemingly Spanish dancer hands and heel
We returned and set the table, by the door
But he smart, he plotted a plan for Polygram
Shine down through the rain Down through the rain
Ten thousand waves in the eastern sea
So we pass the time and occupy our minds
Is it better never to start
Oh the loneliness
Die zweite sollt ihr Ziel nicht schonen
I sin nya fina Porsche
But not the strength to go anywhere
So close 
But Maybe they're right for a change
If you ain't running games
Some things you'll never forget
We'd forgotten one another
Moonlight came upon my worthless shadow
I couldn't spend
Prendre un thé, et puis prendre un bain
I'll turn the tide for you,
When I get home, I turn off the alarm
Angry and runin', and not cool
Sinking Moving deep beneath the water
The day is done, the sun has set in the sky
And all I want to do is go home with you
Sing to you, love is what I bring to you
I'm a wanted man
And he brings to you what he sings to you
And from the shelter of my mind
The inside out on the open
With a song and dance routine
Where some bodiless troubles would stay
This is Flytown now, my friend
I always liked rock and roll, it kinda moves me
When in walks her father and takes you in line
I wonder if you hear me
och jag hoppas
But we said 'Hey, ther must be an easier way to make breakfast'
A world of permanent tears
Known for that homegrown where I come from
You were mine and there is no one who's like me
When the rain is pouring down
Whatever you do, don't leave me tonight
'Fuck the valley' fudge, it's my hate and my love
I am an outlaw, I was born an outlaw's son
I don't need to spin the story 
Casper the suspicious ghost
'Cause I must remember to reject you
Callin' for help
Why it hurts worse than it did first hurt
Some are dreamers
I'm racing time for you
Someone I am made for
Blue skies smiling at me
Zen brain throw away your crushes
Jaganmanah pralobhanam namami nanda nandanam
I know you fooled me a million times
I'm biting my tongue
Could you make a flower grow
And where are you now
You long to see someday
Look at where you've got yourself now
They're swept away
You might as well surrender now
In the white light now
So overwhelmed by the ocean's shapeless form
"I'm that one who caused all this
He'd send the pretty ones to me
Away under the moon
Melt like snowflakes in the sun
O tera mi care | E divano tera care
You know I like it being in your family
This is over as soon as this fire burns through
I undermined you,
And their colors create my mood
I never really knew how to move you
And what will you do when your suntan is fading and the summer's gone
The end of the street
Life has a way that's unpredictable
These golden eyes
'Cause I don't want to know, I didn't want to see
Ay, man, I'd like to dedicate this song to my cousin Toot
Insures the death you're dreaming of
I'll take you everywhere I go
You said "I love you like the stars above, I'll love you till I die"
Find a grace to hold onto now
The ground beneath you
When I started ballin' I was young
I'll feel the toil it brought you
The coral leis of a conquering king
In the back of a truck
Can you appreciate the wind
On everything from how I act to what I say
'Cause you were hangin' with him and I got something to say, I love you all the same
I'm living up here and I'm watching your 
Just pretend
And I barely really know your name
I know you can't believe
Or threw away
All you gotta do is close your eyes and  and visualize
Hit the stop light, move it to some Isaac, his rims still movin' so I bump a little Spinners
And like the doors
Wearing disguise
You got your fair share of admirers that call your phone
I still miss you
If you could just make up your mind
If it takes all summer long
Now we know what's good for us darling
Dave, w "on fire" being sung by Jian and Mike
Your whisper's what I'm needing
vereinte die Macht der Liebe die beiden,
So thank you for the hours
Or how it was supposed to end
To the coming of The Swarm
We were running through the autumn leaves
The window was open but he was gone
You look good, and you smell sweet,
Like I found myself in pieces on the hotel floor
Forever and ever
I swear this time I mean it
For a while
Observing conversations, lifting them when they fall
But as you surface you don't really know how 
And now the hearts are breaking just a bit
Doesn't mean you feel a thing
As long as I've got arms that cling at all
I hate this face, the luxury hotel bed
Nothing is new
Spills on a tablecloth
I'll jump off and take a drive
Come see what you've done"
I've taken the air
I tore it apart
Could come from someone new
Your mouth should be working for me
Je dis qu'il n'y a pas d'porno chic
Eyes are falling 
It's fake believe
Keeping me down
Over here
Yesterday
Oh how sweet a girl like you can be
Wasting golden hours in the fall
"Well, all I need is the air I breathe and a place to rest my head"
Child of mine
And grow and blossom and rise
There is no one to break your fall
Turns out that it wasn't you at all,
Now, she's walking down Ellum, turning down Main
Saw the devil's servant, sent her home
And I'm thinking about the way things are
Give give give until there's nothing else
Don't you know that I did the things I could
Though I've a faint belief in everything
Because you're young, you're torn between
die am Friedhof standen am Ende eines Lebens
May you always be
Was the proper point of view
Losing light, a selfish kind
I'mma bring the cool whip, then I want you to strip
I've been told it's not the best thing that I can do, right now
I hope they won't make you blue
Obscured by clouds, or underground
Under fluorescent lights
You walked away, I felt so heavy at the start of every day
She wants to move to Kansas City
Turn into winter lights
Looking for love, and getting
M'y tenir, essayer au moins
Your sister and me will keep your place clean
From where she came it's hard to say
Cause love has no aim
'Cause you gotta be seen to be playing the game
Just look at the state I'm in
For a blind date who never showed
The way I'm forced to dream of you
And ever since I saw his face 
Been carted away
And I believe in the secrets you're keeping
The only thing it did was it made me wise
Helplessly just watch it fade away
It seems so far away but so close
Keep both feet on the ground
You watch the city move and breathe and migrate
There's no getting off
With a bag full of bones
In a clear night under the stars
It's so full of change
Catering to your disasters every need
This is the voice of our past
Ooh ooh but when you take my hand
Of a world
To keep me hanging in suspense,
I got to stand here two more hours 
Been thinking dirty thoughts about you a thousand times
Inside this room, time will stand still
Than I ever can
Pacing deserted roads to find
Birds in the sky
Sleep walking, see you talking
When I don't know I'm alive
You've got to lose yourself, but not let go
Your lullaby for all the times
And build a house
Tonight could be the night you crash
Leave me with some kind of proof it's not a dream
From present and past
And the tears come streaming down
Falling free into love's ocean
Like it would take forever
Have you heard the sea
He slides so gently off her hand
What is in this wine
What do you do when your career is buried
Mean more to me than my crown and my bracelet
That goes beyond control
But when it is all over we will still be friends
A time to live a place to go
I've been wanting to tell you this for a long while
Now there digging soft ground for your grave
Sometimes I wonder why
It's like the last days of Rome
Stop hiding behind the door
While you stumble home
Over land over sea
With you kneeling beside me holding me
Ships in the night
Internationally fashioned eternally
His name and his surname, in letters of gold
Water falling from the sky, the sun that's breaking fills my eye, and it came without a warning now
See how my hands shake, I was raised on it like a drug
To understanding more about what intrigues me most
Were stars
And you thought I was happy
The silhouettes that pass us by
Try to forget all the bad times
In the end
You are there
Grind me down, grind me down, grind me down 
I'll pull the trick if I want to
I'll never get it right
Grey conquers eyes
Do I drift further every day
From the want and the waiting
We dream of a ship that sails away
A wide blue sky
Always shine bright down on me
And there's no need to hurry
All the waves of blame arrange as broken scenery,
Fucked around and got attached to you
You could teach it when you want
Take my hand and I will mellow,
Another moment
Can't believe or understand 
And go your own way
billot
I've been walking around all day laughing
And when you feel like nobody's on your side
Trying to set this trouble and problem free
We spoke of dreams that came to us
She would give you her coat
A symphony that gently leads you to sit and be still with me
Show me your colors
And my burden to bear is a love I can't carry anymore
Dans ses dentelles virevoltaient
Laughter and sirens song, in here I belong
You were there for us and stood right by our sides
I found a dream that I could speak to
Oh after all our sweet love has flown
I can't get away
But you just want to fix yourself
Chandler and Van Nuys
I'm sorry if I smothered you
But sometimes sometimes life ain't always the way
Everybody hopes and waits
And I know I know they are threatening
I need your name
My heart is in economy
'Cause baby I'm a dreamer for sure
It'll take you all around
Mother earth
Emitting frequencies, lost between the leaves and things
No life have I, no liberty
To keep you out of harm's way
When thunder rolls through my life
Oh, I know it's hard but you stay with me, oh, you got a memory
And you will be pleased to know
Got a darkskinned friend look like Michael Jackson
But maybe it's time to go
Every doubt every fear
Way down yonder in the old corn field
All good things they say, never last
In a green light
No one else can please me
Country fool that I am
'Cause I could use a little patience
Oh, it never ends
So much freer than you were before
You said you wouldn't and you fucking did
He said, "let's get in the car and just drive"
Because I whistle to a different tune
I will make it all up to thee
Down and down we go
Like I've know you all along
All the wounds that money causes
For someone with answers
It holds quite a lot of interest with your face down on it
Play it girl
Calling out father oh, hold fast and we will
Free beer and basement shows
Bird in a tree
You didn't know how to dance
I know the answer, it's four in the morning
Something you don't wanna see ever grow up
Like the days when it would rain
And for a moment I lose myself
Truly there to truly care for you
Every occasion, oh, one billion day funeral
Butt into that underwear  yeah 
I could be anyone alive
May we never fall back to ground
Then in the night, the sorrowing sigh
He's balancing a diamond
It's given us, given us this wonderful wanderlust
Or some waitress, it's a tease
Because I console myself that Hallmark cards are true
You made me feel more than I thought I could ever be
Forget me night
I look outside, I know you're there
Sailing over the sea of Maine 
You say you can't hold it together much longer
I don't wanna die,
Your skins delight
This is taking forever 
Like the wave was the only love it ever saw
I used to know this woman who had the most beautiful tattoos
Rest in my arms, sleep in my bed
Knowing that for someone you're an angel sent to save
And I've been driftin' on this wave so long
Before I turn this love into a crime
And it's not getting me any closer
And the conversations continue endlessly
Head on my shoulder, I'll pour myself a glass
'Cause now we say goodnight
Try to bring me down 
Hiljaiseen käytävään odotan sun askelia
They've got us on the ropes But we don't have to take it lying down anymore
I know I'll make it
And I'm all alone again tonight not again, not again, not again
Judy's staring at the sun
We could spend a lifetime
When we are together you make me feel like my mind is free and my dreams are reachable
 qui m'accordera
Now I find that I'm thigh deep
Just play it cool and keep it calm
Like a bird on the wire
With  glasses
Blinding lights began to set fire to our minds
Keep it by your side now
And maybe we'll get lucky and we'll both grow old
Let's say you found a gun;
And here I am still minin' gold
Tu as laissé son corps, je t'en veux
Should we just march without a care
Did Eric call by the way
I'll never roam
She was crazy
Well I hate to be the one to bear such bad news
shteyt nisht, brider, ot azoy zikh
You know I'm afraid, gettin' my act on
Orphans always say
Don't hold your breath because I'm coming up slow, this time
Nap rive byen lwen
Now these thoughts are haunting me
Now the days are getting colder and the burning of our limbs
It's constant as the stars
Has your family ever forgotten you and driven away
Touched by all of your grace
And I can still see your face
And focus as a poet has only just begun
That you're that close to losing your mind
My room too small
It all make sense
It's written on the mountains
And heaven
Give me your night
It's just hard sometimes to carry on
Ooh what more can I say
Ocean lapping voice smile coy as the brightest quiet span of sky
Where Lagan stream sing lullaby
Candy says she's made arrangements for me in the sand
And I'm trying to understand myself and pinpoint who I am
So now I'm looking for a lucky charm
I heard about your story from a friend
Under the wintery moon
His mother did separate the whites from the violence
To bring them home again
My work is just a web I've spun
And you heard my heart stop beating
Everything in heaven and earth is almost right
On the flesh rampage
His story left untold
Who sing on key
Sealgair nam fiar  
A nervous Juliet 
Why was I, why was I peeking
Toi, tu ne vois pas le piège
They hammered the soil, asking for answers in green
And I'll bleed for your lips
I love you and hate you at the very same time
We'll talk of what we haven't done
You can bet on your life
If only songs were sung to guide the doubtful ones
The mantles cracked
Why these phases change you
Sometimes there's one with big blue eyes, cute as a bunny
Ten years, pecking at a seed
They're runnin' in an out of the bars
And you are not alone
Someone caught us in the kitchen
But when that southern anthem rings
The strength of a tree begins in the roots
Champagne from last new year's
You know it's gonna be a long drive
And it feels like it's wearing you down
Bend the words to make it right
I'm ballin', I'm ballin', Iverson on you
Call me up, and that's all I need,
You were my best friend, going at it all
Jesus the Mexican boy, born in a truck on the fourth of July
Every now and then I cry
He dreams of days that he can still remember now
Oh ah You make it eaiser to be ooh ah
You're down for one more hour
Roots are sucking, thieving from my source
Bring your flat hat and your ax
By some miracle
Stranger than me
We'll have our disagreements
See my scars spell out your name and, you're paralyzing me nanana
Been the same since I don't know when
N'est pas la main qui nous étrangle
Painted us kissing in blue
After they are finished, I wonder where you'll be
From a bus you saw an old man
Drawing pictures with some chalk
Drinking the man in the box
It may seem
Goes back to the beginning
But you don't know how real it feels
And smiled at the cat, who smiled back
Tired ideas, broken values
Everytime I think I've finished being young
You said it was a flash of green
Every night for a while
If you won't change your mind
Should we take the day
The way you moved
The imitation of good faith
When the dog bites,
That we'll ever see
If nothing's so different
Went out to fight the good fight in South Vietnam,
I tried to run and save them, but I had molasses feet
Hör, die Vögel singen ein Lied
Do you feel afraid
Well she looks at the doors and turns
I always carry you inside, in here
It's common knowledge that you've been dead for a while
So far away  so outer space 
Go write a message in the sand
Has got to last us quite awhile
And I will surely be alright
And I'm swept away by the wind
eu queria te escrever um som
I hear the drizzle of the rain
Everything in no time at all
Under the wide, wide ocean
So you know how much I need you
Can you feel my heart in the palm of your hand 
To be gone EP
Like when the houselights are dimming
This far down the line
To get by without the help of alcohol
Are you saying that you'd really listen
Ella lo lleva a pasear y él va dando las gracias
Her mother is frowning at something she missed
I'm alright, yeah, I'm alright, I'm alright, yeah, I'm alright
Hell stand up, up
I drink much more than I ought to drink
If that's the way it's got to be
 quoi bon mentir Si tu peux me dire au revoir
There were a million stars at North Point,
And hallelujah to the one in our bones
Down deeper down, yeah
In the morning sun
And you're dancing, and you're looking kinda crazy
In the distance
But I know the deal
I know we haven't said enough but I know I've never loved this much
Drums too slow for a funeral beat
hur mycket jag älskar dej
A holiday in Rhode Island
Beyond the moon
You've got to fall apart and put it back together again
Come home late,
Why did you listen to that man, that man's a balloon
She's gone to the movies now and she,
rähinä on taas täällä Bring it down now
A monkey and a man, a marching band
If it's a broken arm then brace it
Let the hours pass all running by so fast but now
Yes, I'll admit that I'm a fool for you
Two teardrops for somebody's hand
And he called up down one night
And grief doesn't frighten me
We gotta make it through
Everything that you do's so amazing
And my mind gets slower too
We are the season's new collection
me llaman, me llaman
As they ask you, "Are you who you say you are"
The laughter was like music
bin allem hörig, was mir gehört
Gone are the dark clouds that had me blind
And our love is a setting sun
Is no life at all
What I know is what you know is right
Run, run away
You teach me how to love
Nothing but closed down bars, no one helps you when you fall
I miss you more than I loved you
I wanna meet them tomorrow
Broken pieces without glue
Let me drink in the sea
To sleep in my room
'Cause I am a sinner
Ice, Ice dripping, cold sweat
It is gold inside but it has crystallized
Couldn't make it up as we go along
Don't wait your life away
Everything's confused harmlessly untrue
You don't know how to ease my pain
It saps your strength  it has no exit
Your word against mine
What have I done
And been through my fair share of pain
In a half life
Though you're far away
Wanna keep on moving on up, got to stand my ground
Aside the lions and the ladies
If this is to end in fire then we shall all burn together
Back when we rocked Ellesses, he had dreams of Caprices
Yes, you gotta be seen to be playing the game
I promise to send word
But I've lost my way
He closes his weary eyes upon the day
maalikoille, djlle, peinttareille,
Orphan joy
I'll love all of the hurt away
This essential child
True love
And hope to God she's listening
Nal saranghagin hanyago
Her hope gets so high they're too hard to handle
Your ghost has shown me
As I'm all by myself tonight not again not again
Keep it in your sights now
Walking towards a light
And the rainbows danced in her hair
Took your soul out into the night
Any word of affection
They fire red warning flares
But in the morning you'll be on your own again
Into my sheltered home
The shelter I've sought from the storm
Go out in the light
And let me heal your beautiful pain
She lied and said it was her birthday
Can we keep afloat until its back round until it comes again
There's many that you'll see
And these are just thoughts
As they break their back
To get back to the feeling of when we were fifteen
Dead of the night, oh, we'll be peaceful
Din midja är smal och barmen är trind
He'll be over the horizon,
'Cause it's such a night
And that way saving me from grief
I just want to be sure
Far away a good bye, good night
Do you feel what I feel
At least you'd have something changing you
I'm a G prepared to die for what's important to me
Of eating up entire days
I don't want anyone else
Somebody help hey
Grip the heater twice as hard  it's this reality I battle nightly
I've got a lot to teach but even more to learn
God is everywhere
It's slowly fading away
Back to the years of looli lailay
Meeting is such sweet sorrow
As I come from Alabama with this banjo on my knee
She was aggressively passive to the point where she
No I never meant to cause you pain
If this universe is really shrinking
Live like you're dying and never stop trying
Your getaway, your dream, I was everything you needed
When every things so uncertain
Is bawling goodbye
And all the universe knows
Trouble me or I'll go, yeah I'm human too
I can't find the need
We leave with no regrets  we will never forget
I've got it going on X
Who waits for the tide and the town to get high
Sometimes he takes himself so seriously
I'm the scarecrow in disguise
I don't know if I'm sane
They are coming to get us now
ein ander z'arzâtîe
I got a picture on the mantle piece
A promise of a new year
On you to move in and we can play hard
Relax and all these whores will lick the membrane
Diamonds in the snow sparkle
I know another love has come your way, just listen to me when I say
Or bitch I'm Harden, I don't miss nothin'
These things are dear to me, they seem to bring you so near to me 
The summers they ain't the same
Where my days are strips of highway
That includes myself man
Tunnelma lämmin ja surullinen
I don't want you but I need you
All you have to do is move your body
You would rather that I wasn't here 
Who let the dogs out
I don't know where they're gonna lead anymore
When you walk, you move like Moses
I will never know the names
But don't take her out of my life
I said "that's fine, I was done trying to be good"
And I'm just so cold I want to cry
And if you saw with my eyes you'd see what selfdeception means
Iça, iça Vela do barco 
Or place for the rage
Kan du mer enn ditt Fader Vår
Please Mr Lostman �が�い�い
I carry it, your body,
A blanket between my boney knees
My heart today
I've never felt so close
We would say that we had found this man in a crack
When the sun shines down the hills the winds blow
And I was happy to fade
To find my people's tongues were tied
For tears my heart has caged
You're the ruler of my heart
Du siehst sie kommen
And the words are new
And you cheat, you lie
You're the one who should be feeling that
Don't forget about her,
That would be the way theyd remember me
Divide the dream into the flesh
New answers will satisfy but then you realize it's never enough
And you can tell the world what you want them to hear
Espalhe por aí boatos de que eu ficarei aqui
Here to stay
Oh I bury my head into his hands
I pray for rain, while the water's rising fast
Cause someday we may have to part
It shines forever
Where we captured all the fireflies
Try fastforward
In Dublin's fair city, where the girls are so pretty
The bold and the fair Suffer their share 
Ain't it funny how you only ever seem to want what you can't have
I got more I got no need
Falling in love with the taste of the ghost 
Don't know where we are
'Cause I love you baby, that's no lie
In crystal snow my palace guard
'Cause there is no time to lose
First star I see tonight hangs on my wall
Now I know I can't tie your hands
And you find everything there but the news
Maybe she should just pretend
Oh, you changed your mind
If only for the last time
Far away, so far
But pass the haze, I see your pretty face
The metal in my head clangs and clings as I walk
And the stories that were told
No one came for a long time,
A thread cut with a carving knife
An unenviable case of ring sting
Touch of a mother so gently aware
Christmas night, it clutched the light
L'inviter, manger plus ou moins
I'm face to face with my insides
I want to feel it, if just to know it's true
That you could want
Even the low are falling
'Cause I can feel that it is
I'll show you how it feels to be to blame like me
The seed that left the tree
Possessed by a fury that burns from inside
Mare undarum, Io vela
Picket fence, the windows stained
It hinges on the driver's seat
Weary and wasted
I'm sure it will always be
Counting stars again
But oh bird you flew away
It's a lie, lie
I' d hold you in my arms
Can you say goodbye, without ever leaving
Always looking for ways to love you
To be ashamed like me
You can get just what you want
No, the blue one
Keep on kissin' me, yeah
To steal away, the time is right
But I see your true colors, shining through
And I remember how fast we ran
If God passed the mic to me to speak
Though you had the world at your feet
Gleam and resonate just like the gates
Everything would be alright
In all the pretty things you could choke on
Over the edge of all our knowings
Moody It's got me x 
For news that you weren't getting better
And it's a pleasure I know
And all the while I clung heavy to your back
But love grows old, and white's so cold
Wir beerdigen unsere Vergangenheit mit Pomp in großen Mausoleen mit pathetischen Zeremonien Lobpreisende Grabreden, tränendurchweichte Seidentücher, Blumenmeere und ein Leichenschmaus Nach gar nicht allzu langer Zeit ist uns die Grabpflege zu mühsam Der Gang zum Friedhof zu anstrengend Haben wir nicht die nötige Ruhe um das Unkraut zu zupfen Und gegen eine recht ordentliche Summe lassen wir die Gräber unserer Verstorbenen vom Friedhofswärter pflegen Er wird das Laub entfernen und die kleinen Lichter täglich neu entzünden Unser Gewissen ist beruhigt und wir können uns zurücklehnen
The last time forever
And showing such fear at being found unawares
I threw a rock at a crow who was playing in the mulch of some rosebushes by the motel office
And all the things I couldn't say
But you're story tends to change when you look in my eyes
You don't know me, but I know you
Tender lovin' arms
That you let me see the world
They love the filthy way I talk
You left your black gloves on my table
Ohoh, no you didn't care, child, to see the light of day
In the ribbon of her mantle, there I did behold,
Now the fireworks in me are all gone
Where is the sea
I was sleeping, ladies and gentlemen
She'll never take you down or never give you up
Over
Saw the sign of the times
Baby I, want  to decide  by his side I can't, I can't
I too fear the change coming on
And you're young and in love
Be they fair
When I put on a suit and say "I do"
But I was happy to explain
And you will find, the day when they put your soul on sale
Beacon, don't fly too high
A hue and cry waiting to blow
A little run down,
The weather would be so dreadful
"One day I'll be as tall
May we see clearly in a different light
You've told me, slowly confessed your fears
I know you're leaving in the morning when you wake up
But you can't hold your man
I wanna fade, fade, fade
They violently fill my room, they keep me awake, I hate you
Never saw things going so right
But I couldn't bear the burden of never havin' said goodbye
Started crawling through my bones
That wind around your eardrums
That's why I love you
And the view from here is something to see
Or I may be imperfectly formed in this contradiction
You're gonna wanna have a comfortable chair
But you only wanted me
Something up your sleeve
The farmhouse is burning down
A pleasure sweet my body heat
Stand and move and walk across the water
Hot coffee in a clean white mug and a smile when the waitress hears
If I was gone if this was my last day on earth earth earth earth
'Cause you know that I won't be leaving
All so battered and brought to the ground
I'd paint the grey sky blue
It used to be it was all I want, my only care
So you turn in two, like I do
I've always been waiting for someone to set me free
Hidden in ice for a century
It's been broken but it's nobody's fault
It's nothing at all
"Don't go," she says, but he's sleeping
I want you back and forth
Know you wonder if the timing's off
For the sins of yesterday
 Lowered it's doors
You don't look back, you don't look down
I don't wanna be like you anymore
And if we find gold
And you're no better at swimming than you were in the beginning
And yes sir, oh no, and yes sir she lookin' so throw
Is right in front of me
I let him wake me but decided not to stay
We move too fast to remember
Take an inside look on the outside
Way down underneath
I know you'll leave with the kings reprieve
They're empty enough to pour in the skies
Under the table and you'll realize
Hearing songs wishing I was able, stable
Now the ink runs to your heart
Wash away into the rain
For you I'd wait 'til kingdom come
And she became the girl from yesterday 
The darkness of your kiss
A melody softly soaring through my atmosphere
To me some surprising day
And the warm wind chills my bones
I talked about September
I held your hand
As I went out walking, one morning in June
On the wall behind St Peter's
One more awful feeling
So I sing the blues
Tell me one thing I should know of your situation
And I have been left alone, with no answers
But I've gotta be frank, and baby
Let her get on with life
I thought I wanted to be part of you
And I'm only halfway sober, and it's not getting me any closer,
Butterflies all havin' fun, you know what I mean
Sweet suburban sky
Someone thought of that and someone believed it
I don't try to make love last
You come home straight and you come home curly
Praying to the wrong god every night
For when you need the same magic touch
I love this power that's crushed so easily
I see what's in your heart
Let the knife turn to rust
Like lace among the rocks
Miles appear
I am so alone
And you're dreaming, and you're dreaming, and you're dreaming
I wish that you were here to help me dry
He might be a father, but he sure ain't a dad
Down On my knees where I met you
I take your hand
We're fools to believe it
I hear my sister singing
I'm a fool in the fetter
Preachers always say
Sky bends, the moon's dress' slung low, slung low
That you'll gather round when I am lowered into the ground
Ooh ooh ooh, oohooh
Ain't gaining no ground
I should have wrote a letter
Just fix your eyes on one spot
But every suit I tried is too big around the thighs,
quiero ver las culpas sobre la mesa
Who's gonna stop the word from turning
With your arms outstretched trying to take flight 
We say Goodbye
Smoke one, palm trees, double D's got 'em topless in the sun
Sorry you won't fit inside my heart
She falls apart in the avalanche
Of those hours
Daniel you're a star in the face of the sky
If you're walking and nothing's turning out the way I planned
I run back not that strong now
J'en suis désolé mais, je ne crois pas qu'il t'aimait
Is a new world
Now all I think about is floating away
No pressure, I know you're real
And all of these people sitting totally still 
Hurts inside, no scars to show
Walk right up to the microphone
Here I am waiting for you
Hon dansar och blundar så nära intill,
And I don't need convincing
I choke on the smoke as I look around the room
I get to see the scene repeated
That you're spending with someone else
Set me free on a gentle breeze
Cause after this mess 
I know not if I sink or swim
And life on the road,
och hon viskar till mej
I like the nights but not the tangled wires
A faultline rips right open
Undead audio, yes we'll be singing someday
And I'm still surprised that you stayed with me
And it's a little in the conversations
I gave my hand 
With your ladylike ways
I'm on fire, I'm full of love and new desire
Pinpointing facts
My name is raincheck in the afternoon
But who are they to judge us
He left home to find his own, now all he has are lies
I throw it up just to watch it fall
The one who loved my tired bones
So is the comfort there
I trust belief belongs to me
And I don't know if I can do this anymore
Poor boy
And the devil makes good use of these hands of mine
There might be rain, but not for certain
I'm listening carefully
I could stand out in the hall
Let's get goin' once again
And then they went on to say that the pearly gates
It's a oneroom city here
Before too long you'll be a memory
When you said this would never be undone
Love me as well as you know,
My verses stand gawping a bit
I try to pressurise the parts of you I'm wanting,
To make you feel loved
I'm hoping that you'll fall in love again
For the White King to move
And I hope you know there never was
Picking up broken words
Like a sound of love and peace on Earth
Is it alright
Well only a stranger would think its impossible to let them go
Wind a spire survey the hours I'm secrets, secrets
So you see you can't arrest me
And I shouldn't come by, I know
Well I had no choice
Lift me up into that privileged point of view
From the deep silence of my mind
Stay alive or prepared  scared ain't no way to die
In your head, in your mouth, in your soul
What is faith
If I lose everything that I possess
But now I feel, baby
Still singin' his tune
'Cause all I do is wonder how
Am I lost in a world
I am the shadow on your skin and I'll be gone very soon
Y'see I always wanted one of those cars
Here's my word, take my hand
Who you are and where you're going
No one's watching me
Motor cars, handlebars
He floats the cargo down the coast
I don't wanna wait
Soon be what everyone is talking about
When the whistle blows and we pull out slow
I never knew it all 
Did I disappoint you or let you down
Nothing won't fit under there
It just makes me want you more
Car is parked, bags are packed, but what kind of heart doesn't look back
And while I wrestle with demons angels and appetites
Pretty bird, pretty bird
We got all the time we need
As the moon rose
Stop trying to change me
These abstract wordless movements
Longer than last September
We're all goin' places
Many times over for everyone I know
Your love is real, real, real
But you're just the right size, 
Keep me feeling so brand new
Tu ne vois pas qu'elle t'épie, qu'elle te guette
I don't know what I want
By the love my heart endured
Bittersweet
Whores and angels, men with problems
But never really kept you safe
'Cause I've been laid up
Drive wherever the roads will take you to
Its wings broken so like wisdom
Not an easy ride
I'm a fool for your belly
And my tongue gets tied so quick
I look high, I look low
für diesen einen Moment
It makes me feel like dirt
A part of you and me is torn
And you better bring a change of clothes
Und allen Dingen über die ich verfüge,
Je vais fuir sous la terre Si c�est vrai que tu ne m�aime pas
No there's nothing wrong, you're learning to be strong
To heaven, hell, or beyond to that Great Vast
Squeeze my eyes so tight 
I don't mind spending every day
Or have you moved away
Putting all the clothes you washed away 
Snakes of smoke are dripping from your fingers
If you say the word, we will beat those birds
And the rattle of springs
But I can't forget it
She was all of this
And my best friend
"No," said the Hobo, "No more tales of time;
Reminds me of you
And tomorrow take it away, oh no
We sing as the sky collapses
When I see her face
I don't mind let it pass,
And a warm wet smell
Continue frontin, like it's nothin' while you live in denial
With despair and desperation
Running through my life right now
Holy water cannot help you now
Fitting on past me in the lake below
I never get used to this
Goin' down
And I'll shake you, ooh ooh
Make it just like new
This broken place
It is out of her hands
Hey, hey, little fighter girl
I hoped to be singing to someone new by now
I wanna take up your love, but it's locked in a vault
We stand on shoulders
But that was then and she is now, I once was lost with her I'm found, on this early April morning
Knowing that we'll never be the same
If the sun can shine
But you're not here to make my sad songs more sincere
How I wish that I could be like any other man
So I walked into your eyes without a raincoat on 
I still dream of you
I'll wait for you tonight
Although we're lost in space
Hunted down, I came upon
And share the love the godly must
I hope I can see
Regardless of time or weather
Whatever it is I do, I'm only thinkin' of you
Can't turn around
Identifies needs and feeds our desires
The sun goes down as the city lights
I just wanted to stay
What honest words she can't afford to say
Don't it sound clever, come and play
You'll bring that blessing
You never have been young
Seen fortune in my lifetime
The cartoon trees up to the sky
At the time we thought we should
Are in my hand and just up the stair
Moins de clopes, plus de somnifères
Maybe it's time we went
Oh I'd wait for the seas to part
But check your résumé, you must have some other skills
'Cause I know where it began, and my heart still pounds twice as fast
All of us under its spell
This time I won't bleed
"The boys are here with me"
Or maybe that's the reason that it hurt me so
Just a memory
Daniel my brother you are older than me
Sometimes she robs the chief goatherd
Only love can be both heaven and hell
Oh why do I hear you and believe
This is my perfect day
Ah heaven
The glass hidden motion 
And now I'm comfortably blind to what goes on outside
Hiding all the pieces of my broken heart
That I've always been the one who must go
Why I never walked away
I wonder how different I might see them now
I am as I want to be and I know I never
Et j'ai laissé passer l'été
Mean Mr Mustard says don't be
Keeping out of trouble, never learning nothing
I long to be a picture of Jesus
On what to do when your career is buried
Went down that Georgia line
That everyone's phony
The world is yours, the world is yours
Don't change a hair for me
Ah they're shutting down the factory now
Oh Lord, could you help me find some shelter
I cannot stop
Down, to reconsider, I'll stay if you can make a promise though
The streets were made for horse and cart
Snow drifts through the pine trees
I was afraid how it could hurt to leave the safety of above
I'd fall for you
No going back no going home
Weather the storm, drain running rampant, just stamp it
And all my uphill clawing, my dear
'Cause they have faces
When we're older and the memories fade
And the wall won't come down
Covers you like sherwin williams
So much love to give
And I, I wanted to be
Fun for all that children call
I'm a vessel between two places I've never been
I can not see my way out
We once had dreams of being something useful
Sometimes when I lose my grip
In a purple room
I was younger once and I created a lie
Mais comment te dire
You know it'll shine until we fly
Remind me who I am inside
But it takes you years to know what love is
I don't feel you anymore
As my life just fades away
Oh, you are the roots that sleep beneath my feet 
Yeah, well, it'll leave you feeling hollow and helpless
When the chill creeps in your blood,
Sometimes you really dig a girl the moment you kiss her
And dismiss your demons
My hand between your knees, you turn from me
I want him like a A x sex educate
Please Lord, don't look the other way
Have not seen you since I was 
My clumsy tongue will make it right
If I can close my eyes without a fear
I throw off my coat to feel this January air
Dark pink scars
Can you tend the soil inside of her
I waited on the steps for you and I hid in the bushes whenever a car pull into the parking lot
The darkness in the pylons and the smoke and creosote
On the edge of losing it
To the movie star and his sordid life
Live today, 'cause tomorrow, man, you never know
Darling tell me what's on your mind
I forget the lies
For the rest of my years
Diamonds, brilliant
Seeking someone
Give yourself over
I wasn't scared
How scared we are tonight
He's lost and gone again
My angel Gabriel
And further away from my home
Sag deiner Mutter,dass du sie liebst
And our hearts rest against the flesh
Memai ni dakare all around and around me
This has all become far too loud
Take back the fruit, I'm here to rule
I wanna get lost with you
The haunted and lonely technology 
PC for life and death
They can't get the grape and the grain
Don't you mind, you can take one, too
I shuffle forward and then back
Cannot help to save your soul
He leans back from his desk
Everytime
Lost in her memory
Gonna keep on moving on up, oh gonna stand my ground
When a time
And angels with their gray handshakes
You can't see it, but you know it's there, so don't neglect it
 qui attend
In the corner of your eye
There's a breeze
We gonna listen to some Isley
Come on please don't be upset my darling, please don't be upset, I'll do anything baby, just don't be upset
'Cause we won't leave this place any worse than when we came
Thank the Lord
I feel it touching me,
With your voice in my head
And darker walls are bent and torn
Watch me fight the fight the pull within
It takes those tears to make it rust
You give me direction, you show me the way
You light me from within
When he looked at you
I wish she would know
When twilight gleam is in her eyes
You make it hard for breathing
But there is nothing everlasting
At the comfortable glow from the porch, the one I will still call yours
A smile, if you dare ooh
And oh, I'm so scared
I am drunk again
I shot him down
Maybe when our story's over
And my only hope
I will try to dry my eyes, my love
I get in so tired
Well more like a bum, sort of, a musical bum
Incisions in my head
And learn to fly away
Only you can know, only you can know
There is a ship, its sailing the sea
& we'll rent a car & we'll drive upstate
When all the world was green
As a mother hears
Forgetting your existence
For the first time now tonight
He does not look back
Will go downtown in his car
To be with somebody else
I said a small prayer for the poor and the naked and the hungry
I'll be back for more
And though you play alone, you never get lonely, you never get bored
Rolling out of the blue like a storm
The dragon fly, and lions dance
I see, this is how my little life could be
For just a little death
I don't mind, was all me
Wir sind die Clowns
This is no, blind faith
Lightning bugs are flashing on the front porch
When I waver on the attuning
I see the light in me, searching for many years
But I found myself in trouble
She doesn't know what's right 
Hit the continent running
I've made a promise to never lose sight
Surrounded by everything, I am
In a world full of lies
And we don't know what we'll be getting
The way it brings out the blue in your eyes
O love, O love, O careless love
But I know
My friend
From all the commotion
I'm a new three
The time is all I own
As she wipes the wisps of dishwater blonde from her eyes
I'll become what your first class said 
With a burning wish to fly away
Goodbye mommy shrimp
Moments went by when we kissed
 meia luz a som do Johnny Rivers 
Ich sagte ab, denn ich war auf Wohnungssuche
Dejame saber
This is a song for you
So since you want to be with me
Filled leisure time with my inventions
Better I feel
I want it to be You
Lace up, learn a lesson
Someday we'll all meet
They're always there to protect me
Both take you to the floor, to the floor, to the floor, to the floor
My hands are down I can no longer masquerade
Siinä tuhiset ja puhkut pelkkää voimaa uhkuen
When everyone has gone
Your nipples and I'll
For they don't have trees to hang upon
All your love could hide,
And who could feel sorry for a drunkard like this
By the bed yes, I told you it was silly
Lower them down in the ground
But I believe there's power here, just not that I can find
You're faking it well but it shows
You were free when I was taken
But fear, if she can't dance no more
The lights will blind up with blues in haiku
If you set yourself up to fall down
Givers always say
And in my dreams
And say you'll come and set me free
You are so transparent
mesma esqueci o tom Mas sinto que
Every night in motion together apart
When the flame turns blue,
Just to find the warm bed of our lover
And the road you traveled leads to a dead end
Remember this in your head
Down the walls, you can't help the way you feel
But they know you're about to leave
And I'll tell you one thing that you should never do
And no one, yeah, no one could ever wait for you
Lights out, which way to turn
You say I gotta find my place
And it covers up the cars,
Simply 'cause our hair is long
That's the slickest marketing I've ever seen  a spiraling trap
Living in a home in the heart of the country
From fear and only fear
Num beijo então você se rendeu 
Please leave me your ghost
I've got your voice on tape
E se vai all'Hotel Supramonte e guardi il cielo
Reaching for the door
I am done with it
I found out I'm not the man
To my surprise a fever grows
Take me back to the stems of it
For the Lord's gonna come in his heavenly airplane
But now I've found a way to end in my salvation
I remember what you told me
You feel the love I have yet to find
'Cause I could not find it in me
To work out all these troubles and what there is to gain
String it up on a fence
You'll never calm down
Then rent a husband to keep her for life
Almost any day at noon
There are pages of conflicts that nobody won
Große Räume gibt es nur in großen Häusern,
Can you love the one that God does
And they both wheeled their barrows through streets broad and narrow
'Cause your presence still lingers here
He says he lives above me
I like the way that they reflect my thoughts
Ver um bichano pelo chão e não sorrir
Nobody will ever know, just the CEO to the CFO
Now all of them feel sympathy
The right way to go about this
And even if the sun refused to shine
I question whether she knows she's safe
Fears will soon fade away
For all your time, playful crime in rain
As time goes by I know it's gonna happen
Calling and over and over and over and over again now
By his heart and his head
Sleep tight tiger sweet dreams till tomorrow
To be the stars
From a friend
Pray that we make it to twentyone, one, one, one, whoa, whoa
Fighting for the freedom nowhere found
With no time to think
Everything changes to a point that it stops and it turns around
And I've got this question, yeah
Say you've kept some fire aside,
You touched my heart, you touched my soul
And all I ever think about is you,
Niggaz be schemin', I fiend to live a good life
'Cause my bones were made in the womb
But I do not fear the future
The two of us used to hang every single day
Love me 'cause I'm fresh and clean and so tighty
And the wheels just keep on turning
You know where she's gone
Though I wouldn't mention
If I could see you I'd take off your clothes,
I love the way
From drinking the ocean
'Cause Pancho were headin' towards our end
Open up my mouth and sunlight illuminates the dark
In the window of the tallest tower call
Because I never thought we'd part
Perdida num planeta abandonado
In its place stood a golden town
When she said I waited all my life
Won't you come back to my heart
Speaking silence
Seems like it could go on forever
You know the next is up to you
This is your anthem for tonight
Swan pond, oh swan pond
Aunque baje la sombra 
What hides inside me
Your day fell apart
Passin' by the hills 'til I hear the name
I wonder were you come from
There's no need for denial
Fall in love is an idea for sure
One evening, when weeks had passed since his leaving
When dreams made real become less sweet the orchid and the metal
I take it back you're panicking
Take me, take me, home Take, take, take, take
You got to seek till you find
Please Mr Lostman �れ�い�う
As this world goes slowly by World goes slowly by
There's always something in the way
I remember you said, "Don't leave me here alone"
It say go, I say go, she say go
I was thinking possibly or maybe
It's like a sonnet, she's so on it
Golden gate stroke Alcatraz
I feel, I feel so sad
Remember where we started out
I'd have danced like the queen of the eyesores
And you're down without a dime to see you through
What time
I breathe the neon
This is why I've been saying
And say what's on your mind
Oh brotherman is it that you'll slow down
Some days have no end
You always take it further
And counting the change
Dangerous plastic words
To the wind
Spatial movements are butterflies
Who's your only friend, kid
Drifting round and round 
His mind around geography
And how my thoughts they let me down
Something tells me I'm not meant to  I told you I don't mind
Men du skriver ord som mord i handen
I slipped away last night
Ich weiß noch nicht, wann verstreicht die Frist
I'm right here
Hoping that my voice could get it right
It will be forever
Flooded the skies
I live in America with a pair of Payless shoes
I think that possibly, maybe I'm falling for you
I mean after all the things that we've been through
Fallen in love and I hope that you want me
You can be anything that you wanna be
Your name in parenthesis 
Holdin' on to something when 
With the straightest face
Up comes the wind that makes them run for cover
It sure feels funny but if it's so
Stay, you can leave tomorrow
Oa oa vento dá na vela 
Didn't I say it slowly
You seem to know my secrets
Love keep me warm
I've been waiting for so long
She's softly breathing next to me
Baby love child
I'm drunk right now baby but I've got to be
Marimba sing high as the cemetery grows
Just place both your feet on the ground
Like I miss the ocean when I go to sleep
I ought to be on my way
Rushing toward a face I can't divine as yet
Every time I'm forced down
It may not last forever
We gonna listen to some Marvin Marvin
Instead we tumble down
If anything, they feel sorry for you
Headed for Oklahoma, I was ridin' night and day
Mojique plants devices through the free trade zone
Die Stärksten der Stadt ergeben sich
Giving you everything she's not giving
Sweet talk, back clap  oh baby
The match was struck and I was fire
Much better than that 
Would care
And I know you are gonna be just fine
A short simple way to reach you
It's my one wish, I won't forget this
This feels like I've fallen in love
Of our German engineering
Dreams are sweet when they turn real
Maybe I'll write this up or maybe I still look down
Let's just make this part go faster
But I'll be back someday
You search for someone like her 
I'll always be here for you
Spent a year on the road
Lets just forgive and let this child
Endless pointless
All my life there should have been
To search for someone
Disillusional shadow
And we roll in every summer like it's shameful to be underneath
We need it all
Oh, with no one to blame
Although I'm coming close to you
I look up to the sky,
If we don't look or just don't listen,
And we both feel them now
I know that I lost my soul
Never thought you'd fall
I will gladly carry your cross for you
With my head full of stars
Recovering days are heavy hands upon your breasts
Had an element of danger
So don't be hasty in your judgment
I'll keep a smile 'til my last breath
Rambling through the the avenues of time
It feels like summer is on it's way
You can say no, to being a man hoe
Anywhere alone
Som ser på deg fra skyggen
But she was already broken, and it made her blind
And I love you with a love so tender
I've become what I know not breathes
Isn't it time we danced the night away
My mind changed me so much I can't even trust myself
Somebody stopped talking
Now there is no story left to tell
But we know better darling
And this ain't no time for actin'
Sometimes I'll hear when she's sleeping
Another lifeless testimony 
Low to the ground
With you on my mind
You're not calling anyone
While I lay, I dream we're better
Once upon a summertime, if you recall
But this is for HollandDozierHolland"
El mundo esta perdido amor
So all of these prayers have to be going somewhere
hasta volverte a ver
You are a drug to me
The boats I missed and all the fights I lost, I really should have won
Then I will try to remember all ours, and, your memories I know
But this feeling's building up inside again
Fools rush in where wise men never go,
Shuffle shuffle shuffle shuffle your feet without looking down
When all the figures sound retreat the soft skin starts to shrivel
Why do we fight 
Like the searchlights in the parking lots of hell
Ya make it all right
Was not supposed to make you cry
Rescue me to come back
The price has been paid with a thousand loose shoes
Disagree on the sidelines
Put my head up in the clouds
And all that lamentation of the leaves,
Why do I love you
Song is made with sugar and lemonade
Burned nicely
They never tell you truth is subjective
'Cause this  Side Where they say Shorty rhyme
Ce qui est ouvert, est à être
Hear my song and please bring him to me
You were playing on the horses, you were playing on the guitar strings
Don't forget about me,
And the horse died standing up
Nobody can hurt me
It's time to wake up
My angel, my angel, my angel
Never coming
But this branch is all I have to show
So much more than my heart can hold,
Yes there's a chance that I've fallen quite hard over you
He's far gone now
The fine lines of your architecture,
Or lose faith in my dreams
Would you be an outlaw for my love
All the world is falling, falling 
Take the sound from my head
We play the blues with the curtains drawn
For a moment I can tell I've got you
Discovery my certain death
Don't play around now, take my life instead
You couldn't feel the sunlight upon your face
Yo, do you see that lil' bop in my step
But if the silence takes you
You get a case of party feet
Outside the circus gathering
I know that you are
To use a word like "love"
In dresses white, all set for sail
Step out of that life, it's nowhere near your time
And I'll be your completely
It's so beautiful to me, but it's nothing that I need
Stands in the shade of despair
It felt so real but it was just a dream 
Well I don't mind I don't mind How could I mind
How we fought and we talked through the night
But now I fight the angels for her halo
You can say I can see the light  roll
May it always surround you
With bitter bile and heartless fun
Everyone can see my youth
Home is somewhere I'm missin'
�트�진 tonight
It's safe to say that you could lighten up a little and then some
Take another picture off the wall
And the words tumble out of your mouth
As we sit here and drink a beer and do nothing in particular
Tunnel and sky collide
The sunshine seeping in
But the spirit of life keeps us strong
It may feel so real inside
Cause there's a whirl pool of information
Well, now you know
In the arms of the world on the doorstep of heaven shining down
I already know nothing
From the problems I speak of
Over the ocean
I can't see the coastline anymore
Are the ones I chose
In the neon bible, the neon bible
And we finally told the truth
Neon signs in the night
Not coming home
Sometimes I forget
Living in the shadows of a man I've never seen
Baby, if I told you the right words
Tell all my friends
Kein Geräusch durchdringt den Raum der Nacht
Und das Tal von Rückkehr tönt
And I know what's been on your mind
But now I know it's over
Deep into every atom and cell
Where the time doesn't matter
Been over
Downtown
Raking over the embers and what I come across
But what's to say
You are no angel
With words that tear and strain to rhyme
But you're never gonna escape
I never imagined you dead I never
Oh, this close, yeah, yeah
What are they looking for
Turn your head, feel the breeze
And wherever you are, land on another star
On a hill in Peckham Rye
With a good lovin' smile that's yours until the end
I was shopping for a wetsuit to scuba dive,
I can sense a world of heartache,
And though I didn't know it then
Oublier ces heures
Find a way out, find a way
When morning comes
"Shoot for your dreams, little girl, to the stars,"
Got four kids, the smiles on they faces
Now your skin is just peeling wallpaper
und wir können spüren wie sie die Form verlieren
You're in past your knees, she taps you on your chin
I'm alright, I'm alright, yeah, I'm alright, baby, I'm alright
Please carry me
Memories we share together
You're laying waste to Halloween
But that's all right
She wears a leather coat
I've been chasing your room
And you find your dreaming wasn't true
Look anybody in the eye who say he want it from me
Tiny move
I had a dream
She acts just like a nurse with all the other guys
If you want you can stay
And always love the smiling one
It's been seven days without a word
Baby, I'm alright, I'm alright, yeah, I'm alright, yeah
New Orleans and then Miami, party in New York
If you get to close your gonna know what I mean
I couldn't hear you sing softly to me
Won't get to me
I know you've crashed it  times before
On sleepless roads, the sleepless go
I just want to be living as I'm dying
Bleed this out deviled soul
My fever's getting high
And it won't leave me alone
und es fand uns wieder zum Glück
In the night, in the night
And I kept on looking for a sign in the middle of the night
And he's tired of being alone
Just look into my eyes, they'll never lie to you
I failed so many times
Genius to fall asleep to your tape last night
Tell me when it's time to open up my eyes
Between now and those days
The one thing that I still know is that you're keeping me down
Farbeit to explain what has been done
This time yea yea yea
Wait remind my life is mine so many travelers
All men would writhe
So what if this is a man's world
I will carry you home
"Say All I need is the air I breathe and a place to rest my head
In times without changes
That's what you did
Tu munjdo sin vecinos
And from where my hands are situated
Of all the dots and lines that took me higher
I know you know you know
I'd like to meet a mad man who makes it all seem sane
Walkin' blues have played a number on my feet
I keep talkin' all these crazy clumsy words
And I won't feel like this forever
Jamal Hendrix, what's happenin'
Was ich beherrsche, das raubt mir die Beherrschung
I know you hate it
Know that you're sore and sick and sad for some reason
I share along the way
Followin' deadend signs into the sores
 pour me demander ma main
I'm so in love with you, but you'll drown me
Take two steps back from all of this
So when the sun has died you dive into your mind
I never thought you would let me go
You're never in my way 
While our parents are on Fire Island
There's nothing new to think that hasn't been thought of before
He called his dog
And it chills to the bone
So I took what's mine by eternal right
She ran until her face was numb with cold and
What flies, what flies symbolize
You threw away my shoe
If we don't see what she's been missing,
My attends to you
Tu ne comprends pas qu'elle est de celles qui charment
You kept your feelings hidden like a psycho
Suffering so long
And you gave sense to my life too
Though the cloudy sky
Look at me when I'm speaking to you 
Our screaming in the willow tree
True words
I can feel that it's real
Odoru shinigami all around and around me
It's only human to wonder why
Amount to something more or something less
Do you remember the days
Let me see who you are
She's suffering
It might have been just a dark pretense
When at the closing of the day
Things we still believe in
'Cause as the highway unwinds,
This is getting old
I've been cursing my god for the lack of the sun
And you, you were the lonely one
Und in Bewegung bin trag mich
And picking up the pieces
It goes and goes and passes by
And talk about nothing in particular
Will you catch me, make it alright, 'cause I'm standing, on the edge now, see your face and 
Il n'a pas pris la fuite
With everything moving away too fast
Bittersweet taste of a time and another place before
Are the things that make you panic
You left Glasgow and your shadow
I love five times more then any boy from before,
Of the night
And I'm all alone for the first time
Go crank up that radio
Are you waiting for a lightning bolt
That I could be so foolish thinkin' I'm alright
Here come the sun king
You slice their throats, continue on your way
Blossom on the tree, you know how I feel
Everything but sleep
I won't hurt for you when all you want's a flawless victory
Somewhere near the end of our lives
I slowly open my eyes
Close their sleepy eyelids, say "Goodnight" to the sun
Do wake me from my place
Tangled emotions between pause and rewind
For glass lay everywhere
I've been sleeping for days 
And remembers a love
Keep it under wraps in the cold store
Thinking of a way to get you to stay 
And we agreed that it had been a long one
It feels that way sometimes
Ich weiß du hast dich zu Hause gefühlt
Cracks in the mirror and your mind slips
Who we are
Es war immer hier,
Measured time
Watching our every last word
Now maybe I was high but it felt so right
Your heart already knows
You cannot choose her love, oh no
You say my name
Tillbaka till sitt flickrum, hem till mor
Just takes a face
Take you from the loneliest
A speck in space
Along the way
I'm looking out for an ambush
Cause there's a whirl pool
The lines in your head have to all be replaced
Into my sleep
I know what we've been through
Coincidentally, that's why today you're not with me
Of love
Things were stable yesterday but now they're blown away
I'm coming up only to show you're down for
They will never be the same again
We'll make it out
When this world makes you crazy
And I know it's getting late
You can forget about what he put you through
You and I in a shameless state
Come out shining true all around you
This voluntary state of apart
Program director on the radio won't play my record until the caller tell him so
And leave the door ajar
Without ever going home
Sweet suburban sky, gonna miss you if you burn
'Cause I lit that flame, now it's burning me
Vaca, cadela, macaca, gazela
And I did not hear her stumbling
And then make the choice
It's my heart
My dad taught me the American dream, baby
And the spirit of life remains in light
Now where's my gun
We will raise our voices for you
Take for a while, your trumpet from your lip
I know you tell everyone I'm what's her name
All my friends say I'll survive
Hold the spirit near, keep it real close and don't
Trouble sure as trouble sees it
I make a meal for my friends,
Finally made it home
Brutal beatings and name callings
Is more than them fuck them
In the garden of love I saw
You want it, you need it
So right,
There are many things that I would like to say to you
Somewhere all the minutes stay around
Accident when we needed
I lost myself on a cool damp night
You've been biting bullets all these years, I know
So unbend
So drink up all you people
And weak in the light
And everything counted
So speak easy
Amplified by the distance
A love like yours
Don't pretend that it's okay
No one will ever love you honestly
Dread in my heart
They talk to mine behind close doors
You feel that way too
And I wanted that heat so bad
Last night our boy was out there
Sign of the time, you won't even call it a crime
But when you step up I feel so nervous I could die
From this building, from this wall
Oh that we could always see
Now everything I do is for King, Messiah, Deyjah, Domani
And I'm questioning the reasons why nothing beautiful does last
I get to be myself and I get to sing
Just say the word and I will disappear
The final dying joke caught in our hands
You ain't the star you were, fuckin' the same hoes no more
He's in love and hypnotized
As a place of infinite possibilities
And sailed back to the bay
'Cause I sure can
This pressure ain't for everybody
If you want communication
 milli on, that's a must, living in California
I can carry on fine
When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears
How does the motion make me last
Where the shallows meet the scratchlands
Tonight, our hearts will beat as one,
I know, I know, I know, I know what you'd say here
I can't defend
The curse will come from the underground down by the shore,
I was sleeeeeeahhhh
Dogs are barking as the kingdom fell
Es regnet und wieder nichts getan
Lower me down
Stop trying to change me
You didn't love the boy too much
And I walked out in the sun
And your breath smelled like honey in the frosty air wake
I grieve in silence
Can you love the lily of the field
Stay, oh stay
Just a song we shared, I'll hear
I promise one day I'll come back for you
Gon' build that city on a hill
Entre o céu e o firmamento 
We're in the privacy of our love
Forever yours
Questions I have answered, you are still asking yourself again
Fell asleep under a tree,
Up, up, baby There's blood on the sidewalks of this town
Just when the day finds you
Don't be scared, now dry your eyes
And a face in a glass
Deep in another dream
You don't control
Too bad that that's all I need
When you tumbled down 
Thinking in our heads 
Run away from the things you've done
Fingertips are all I have
Classic art we here explore
Like every night since our roads have crossed 
But when the war is done
And my loss was overwhelmed
And if you see her, tell her it's over now
Then I thought I'd heard you in the hall,
And though you say you're with me I know that it's not so
Tears away away away
I feel like I'm alive
And then only fireworks will light the sky at night
Well I try to carry the load 
So the peons can be gone and pee on their hearts
The dark that troubles you most
Gave all the vampires back to God that day
You would think that we've danced around each other long enough to know
Keep your face near the earth and your heart beat high
From the ledge that we've climbed
She's only one breath away
And in these winds came a change
Each and every day, true player way
We did everything we could do
Through the coppice and the chaparral
Seeing others doing things we do
Wouldn't you say
You came you saw you sawed her brain
E a manhã semeará outros grãos
You feel the cure
But every move you make
I've been around a long time
You may never see him again 
Just wait, please wait
Now sleep
Than live without any scars
Each day drags by until finally night time descends on me
I should do whatever will make you feel secure
Somewhere in the dark is your past
When I learned I found my eyes were open
Some people say that rappers are invincible
You've lost your sunlight, your body's filled with night
The calling of time 
I might smash up all these windows
Still here
Gives nothing away
Do you know where your love is
Because there's nothing to mend
With the waves crashing down on me
Letter I won't send
The target was your heart in the beginning
The name behind the shame
Are you gonna be, are you gonna be, are you gonna be, are you gonna be, are you gonna be, well, well, well, well
And I always thought that you havin' my child was our destiny
But I did not hear her mumbling
But I know where to start
The moon is a magnet
'Cause you're the fire, you're the one
And run away
Was founded on liars and selfmade men
And I know
I'm crying,
Like he could talk forever
On a life support machine 
Useless blackened remains
You know I'd give you it all
A smile from a frown circles round
And our love is an antique song
Times, times where the lamps were lit so low
Bring books
On an evergrowing list
And I know You know
I know tomorrow there'll be nothing else
How to live upon the solid ground 
How I move, how I move, how I move
Beyond the realm of being friends"
Yeah right now we're gonna slow the whole dancefloor down
Never to see your face again;
If you let me have my way, I swear I'll tear you apart
Shape my face how you want to
Bathed in breeze
The waves are bigger than normal
Healing comes so painfully
Might have been a while
All my life I stumble
For a saviourI know
Before you go, a few words for your heart
And I hear your name
We raise a glass to kindness
She's always shining
It's got a Heart in Your Pain
How can I love you when we're so far apart
No, I never look back Never look back
And how my days they spin me 'round
From under the covers he thought you whispered you want more
Our moments were chosen
You got from a giving kind
And I ain't talking trash neither, ey
Of getting high
Too big to really understand 
You'll be hiding behind the moon
Through the ice 
In D, I was behind the wing 
Lately you've been bothered by your friends
I've thrown away my nights,
I can see the red tail lights heading for Spain
Different lovers, different names
I know what you are, what you are
We kiss goodnight with a firm handshake
As a young boy daddy used to tell me stories
And I honestly never thought love
Can you tend the soil inside her
Same hair, revolution, same build, evolution
And all the roads that lead you there were winding
This city swells up like a symphony
When it'll stop, when it'll seed, when it'll bleed
You're allergic but you never said
And I got high
And he gambled away the rent
Who sailed around the world and found
Nigga you get in my way while I'm tryin' get mine,
Recollection on streets you used to know
I left her fifteen years behind
I'm restless from the silence in the air
What if God was one of us
I see the trouble in your way
We can go until daybreak and then we'll rest
It's getting late
Life is ill, again life's a movie
Deeper, deeper and deeper relax
It's not that she wasn't attractive, she was beautiful
Making phones that hard to hold
Don't say that you forgot the love we knew
I'll never hit a girl, but I'll shake the shit outta you
Apples or dates on marble floors
Costners back into the left
Give me your hand
I've got a lot of things to figure out
Further than we go
Nice and easy
Sometimes I'm crazy but I guess you know
Of rain that can change bows into arrows
Turn from the fear of the storms that might be
Like it was gold Upon a ragged wing 
And there's no sign of another
I'd like to keep you with me all your life
And don't it feel all right, and don't it feel so nice
But I'll never doubt you
Who is laden
The beauty that she brings, illumination
Tú me hiciste ver el cielo aún más profundo 
Only demanding the right numbers
I know you well, I know your smell
And from worrying 'bout this wasted time
When you look, you look like red roses
I keep my eyes wide open all the time
It was so extreme I controlled my dreams
When we looked and we found that it hit some other crowd
Bright eyes, burning like fire
I used to love to play my demo tape when the system yanked
I'm quite alright hiding today
Every time she comes, she cries
You never cared
I know that 
Love can kill people, can't it 
And there's something in the flash of your arms
We go on together
She's got a brand new set of reasons why she can't let it go
They leave her with her friend
October and the trees are stripped bare
Unless I was holding Taiyeh chainRest In Peace
There are snakes out in the night
You trouble me when I try to sleep
I've sold all my gold
Perfect beauty laid before me
She's calling all her friends
I'm call her shorty she gonna call me love
Vor dem, was da kommt,
Everything running through my mind
You can't wash out his desire
When all the numbers swim together and all the shadows settle
The last song say feel afraid
You say I'm not sorry that
A gull takes to the wind
Wonders if he's really lost his one joy
As we said all our goodbyes
For the women, weed and weather
All things change
Such heavy heavy heavy stoning stones
That was before you gave a view
Is sustained tenderly
Silence seizes a cluttered room,
, we're all waiting for the year 
I put this reel out, but you wouldn't bite that shit
From moments and regrets and charity laced with a lie
Shut your mouth and button your lip
I used to be afraid that I wouldn't find my love
Oh my darling, shall we dance
Oh Sophie, will you be my good friend
A lot of you niggaz don't plan on the day when you'd have to see me
In these frozen and silent nights
'Cause you didn't
Deliver me
I get so nervous I'm feeling sick
lesht mit ayer eygn blut,
And I believe it was you
Just look into my eyes, they'll never lie
Straighten up your life
Just say the words and we'll beat the birds
I hurry to the next stop
And another gets away with a thousand crimes
Just a slob like one of us
I've never been one to hang my heart on a thread
The tears will help to keep your need at bay
I would have kept you underneath my wing
Where the far reaches of this mind
Is covered in mud
Maybe then I used to dream of someone to love
We said out loud, we never said
Someone to love me
And I won't let you down
Bret, did any of this actually happen
Fed up on going through the motions
The missed call the missed flight
And should this be the last thing I see
Steals the feelings from a love affair
And smoke away the night
Except for across the floor
We've been around forever
If you notice that I'm falling behind
Oh baby you give me butterflies
In der Gedanken kreisen
Something we will never see
Here just a while
But why, she didn't know
Like my brother, the wren and I
And I love my lonely father
Over land
We need to unplug the dams
Let go of worry and doubt and relax
She is shaking out static anonymity
All of the moments you didn't notice;
Though I know you call me selfish for assuming
Cómo olvidar tu sonrisa
Your love set me free
Now despite my fears I dance for you
See if they'll put you in a show
I took some stick here
I can feel it in the rotten air tonight
You'll be in my life
I Cannot feel a single thing,
But night reveals what daytime hides
Still running 'round
Reach out your hands
'Til you came 'round with your pretty style
The sunbeams climb up on the wall
You go to loud places
You just don't wanna accept when it's time to hang it up
She's happy with the way she looks, she's happy with her gender
In my own time I am dying
The woman is strong in her warm, bed of lies
Sleep so deep, you wake up with a smile
Overnight, start over,
Maybe it's about the time
Try to remember
And the devil makes, the devil makes, good use of these hands of mine
Of the order of things
Oh momma, I know
But you without clothes
Every time you left me behind nanana
About the first time that you fell
Are the things that make you panic Go your own way
So I take a step away
Change our name before we even took a chance
It won't be long, but it feels that way
One more dollar and I'm on my way
Should you forget
With your kind of hesitation
Just think about the end
And we drive by fields
I'll wait with you a while
I'm in love with you
Take my hand, I will follow
The water's edge is all I have
Counting the passing hours
Somewhere along the way
The sunlight heal the core of your body
Me and Candice waking up to a heat wave
I move forward with my hopes
There is a tree as old as me
The hum of the motor gave way to
Never been so inside
Fading and gone on the wings of the storm
All right, my man,
I'll never let you fall,
Why is life made only for to end 
Check my logic, smokers don't like seeds in their weed, shit
My time is the right time,
Is the shape of things to come
Waft yourself to regions of stars and light
Longing, things I long for,
If you want it to
I've been asking for you
So count it on your fingers
And the feeling I forget
So sleep
Lying here with you reminds me of those days
I know I'm not perfect
You live your life like you're stuck in hell
Speak Cat got my tongue
Got a brand new crutch and a brand new mile
The mountains and the trees
I might be mistaken but I sometimes get the feeling that you notice too
Wish I could set you free
The cold coming through the walls
You're here just a while
I\'ll never know I had to go
Holding my breath on the way home
If you're far away, if you can't see my face
Your sympathies I'm ready to return
Don't you remind me 
Spend your days here
Mojique holds a package in his quivering hands
Catch your breath
She keeps on singing that
So let me down softly this time, and
I lost my job, I lost my wife
I never needed pain, I never needed strain
And upon new road I have started keep on, try to breath in
See how the breeze has softened
And I'll tell the world
It's  , someone calls your name
No way hell no, uh uh, if I'm wrong I don't wanna be right
I'd like to bring a little light
Hard to make me feel that I don't matter at all
'Cause I was made for you
Sexy girl, sexy girl
We can lay in the bed
Let the pain of yesterday
I'm the new  and I change out to my new s
For I could see for miles, miles, miles
When I first got here
And they all went down and did the porcupine
Out on the fringe
Six o'clock in the morning wipe the sleep from my eyes yeah
You're crying out your wishes I understand
When all the spirits burn in lies as center grief by steel
Destination unknown
Night falls am I dreaming
I know I'll see you forever
A woman's day is filled with longing,
If only I knew how to fly
The photographs without the faces
In stirring their hate
No one disturbing, that's alright
You sound asleep, but I feel pain,
Cause your daddy's all alone
Not like before and you let it all in
The noise just fell away
I'd sing to you just one more time
Fog's rollin' in off the East River bank
It took an hour
Pray to God that my arms reach the masses
And I could call it many names
Where true love never has to end
I am falling out of you
When my insides gush out there's no telling what it's about
It's better not to know
You fucked it friend, it's on it's head, it struck the street
Fuck how many millions I got, nigga, so what if I'm hot
"Goodbye house, forever"
But I saw man cry once, down on his knees
When I pulled it down, it flew from the ground
I don't think that you'll mind
But there's so much time, to figure out the rest of my life
You ain't never seen a nigga ago to jail and sleep till day 
And the unlucky dark cloud is in the middle
The future ripped from a tattered page
Is it love
But I'm still not sleepy
Let me wake, let me open up my eyes
Or ripples on a pond
Hear the wind blowing chimes
Counting stars wishing I was okay
To seek a further or former design
Don't wanna feel
It encompassed the condition of the human race
Sleeping together in the lion's den
And all my senses' honesty
The sirens followed close behind,
And you'll hear them call out your name
I'll make you mine
Until your candle burned my skin
You don't have to stay awake to talk to me when you know nothing to say
My skin is cut, my hands are knives
Sag deiner Schwester,dass du sie liebst
Days can be lonely
He swings in the sun
Dreaming comes so easily
I thought playing that loving game would never be simple again
Like something's gone
Scribes and tangles between their ears
I'm safe in a corner
Truth and lies
Oh, if you ever come at me you snake
I climbed the tree to see the world
'Cause this ride's 
He hears the phone and he knows his brother's dead 
Quando para mucho mi amore de felice corazón
The clouding, the coverups,
We're fighting for our lives
In blue There's changes that never stray
With two daughters, a son and a remarkable wife
Come and wash me clean
Whoa, I struggle to breathe to breathe
Det kan tänkas men han
I guess he just has to cry from time to time
No need to stay
We'll bring a child
And for there's nothing left to fight
And in my pearl and diamond shoes
Will you be there to carry me home
Left to hide, maybe then they'll call it genocide
Where every brother's knife is set to slay you
Spatial movement which seems to you,
A long time ago I left my home
But what if You'd sing me alive
How we'd love to fall more often
And I'm on my way to believing
So there's the corner that I sat on
You can feel it in the trees
That means no time to waste
Another light means another minute 
Looks like I've been a friend to nobody
O after O, you know, homie I'm just triple beam, dreamin'
And once again our love is real
With a calm fear
Morning seems so far away
What satisfies your mind
All he feels is emptiness from the inside
Submission for a ladder rung
Give give give until there's nothing left
What appears like an angel
That's all I get
Cause hope stays or it fades
We build our private rooms divine
Just call me up, because you know I'll be there
Changes that were not meant to be
There's nothing so I must escape
Claiming sovereign control
But I know somebody who can, Twista
Il y a ceux qui nous caressent
Don't be put off by looks
Lives in your soul
Do you really think that anybody will notice
You're the cover of my magazine
You hold the seven keys to my soul
It's not about control
So wake up And do it, whatever it is Just do it, whatever it is
And everything's bitter like sweet things should be
And boy it seems like everyday
Harro geundela horretaz
To be in command
Held you close, but, baby  couldn't tell you
I'll just sit at home
You do it every other day
Roter Sand und zwei Patronen
Kaum zu glauben, wie der Wind sich für Dich dreht
It's taken mine
God it looks like Daniel, must be the clouds in my eyes
And if you want her you can't have her
Practice everything you preach you nun,
Lord knows I've earned it
All we are
Is it wrong to think you might speak to me
You made me feel like a harbour
I don't know, break it down
Harlem River
But my sentimental melody 
I'm alright only in your arms, darling
All because of you
Unless I choose, I choose, I choose
I never needed you to be there everyday
If only I could find the words to say,
You overexert the little you have left to save face
Steamy glasspane window we could only travel at night bang bang bang on the door
And in your bones it is so cold,
Once I had a man and he was right for me
In your lost enchanted dreams
You actin' kinda shady, baby
In their life, he'll be playing the part of
Show some understanding
They're frightened of jumping, in case they survive
And my heart cries out for a little bit o' love
Where we used to live
Lay down your arms 
And your tree, it never grew any leaves
So that we could make much of You
But do you ever wonder what we could have been
Behold the pale horse got me trapped like R Kell, I bail and it
Doesn't seem like anything you're saying or doing or doing
That season left the world and then returned
They come here alone and they leave in twos
Flying kites and water fights
Forget all your doubts
We could head back to your crib
In the cold light
Today I may not have a thing at all
This sounds a bit like goodbye
In the moonlight we both still like
Power Team breaks flaming blocks of cinder
They had they Lincolns and Auroras, we was hurtin' 'em all
And there's not a soul around
But I feel a change coming on
I promise we'll reflect it right back at you
Always cry for love, never cry for pain
While the la sun beat out the night
But there's something you should know now
Eight days a week, singer's disease
Hard fought for some spare time
Starting to live the lies we tell ourselves
Flashlights when we're falling into the night
Poison seeps into
The people that smiled and cheated
Say you've locked some fire away,
I always want more
So sing your life
My name is raincheck, need a shot of rhythm and blues
Because I prefer her that way
I've seen enough to want to try and change things
And I'll send you my words
Spider, Spider, crawl on the lake, guilty and poison free
And hope to pay the rent
Lost words unconscious, made conscious out of the darkness
You are gone
A farewell to
The last I heard she took the bird
I built this sound
Self worth decreasing
She lays like a monkey unclothed in the snow
Forever bound
Desolation comes upon the sky
And you never knew
You know that we're not the marrying kind
Don't go looking for him lady,
You not just in dreams
You are the maid for me
She was more than this
To pass the time of those who mourn
This boy I know lives in a bell jar
When she starts to sway
But now it is, and what to say
And enemies and friends
And time waits for no one
Until the hammers fall
She's all right when everyone is wrong
Take a pill and swallow it
I give you crazy mad props, because I know I should
Our love is strong, with you there is no wrong
All that's wrong and all that's right
And we'd blindly pass each other
Warm embraces when I replace the one you had in mind
The turbulent one sheds a turbulent tear
We are the bruised and the tender
Whatever happened to those lights we found
Been on my mind
Todo me parece
And there are red flowers in your spit when you enter my mouth under the bed, down on the floor
These are the moments in my life that I seek
J'espère que vous pouvez me réparer
It was just right time
Why ask if you don't care
I'm like a fly in Harry's Bar
Strange the way you seem
The closer you get, the better I feel
On your heart
The plan of a city was all that you saw 
You do not look back at where you came from
If my red eyes don't see you anymore
It's all in the dark
You're from the past
Oh no, I didn't mean to say what I did say
Will never fill your lungs
Sometimes you can relate
I need a new heart
Play it down, play it down
Thought I'd never leave you
Won't you come
Don't do something you might regret someday
Woman don't try to love me
By people everywhere
And then I don't feel so bad
I can't wait 
And I always will love you Marie
Though many he's known
Sometimes I don't think
Full of letters, as a kid, I'd always meant to send
Ill drink tea sometimes when its cold
Now, something meets boy, and something meets girl
And I must remember you don't seem to
Put your faith in me my friends
And I'm feeling like a schoolkid
All winter, slept around until my heart fell a sleep
And I've got scars to prove it
'Til they are strong and good to fly
Keep your eyes open wide and beware of the sharks,
In the city only for a while, oh
And Death blows promises away
She's beautifully composed
No one will ever love you for your honesty
So much stays unknown till the time you are strong
And when my story's told
I don't want you, I don't want you anymore
Walk alone
White wash lies
Feels like a strong bond, I know you feel it, too
The city blocks can't hold you
Every single move you make
It was the final thing to do
I'm sinking
Small Instrumental Break
I wanna sing you a love song
The magic of that summer in love
There is no special way
We'll plot out a plan to take down the man
Wait for the day you come home
Taking things for granted
To get my message through
Goodnight my brother
In the mind of a madman
As man and wife
Just tell me what you need me to know
Antarctica, my only living relative
We are so caught up with things
It's nothing at all Thinking about you
I could be home by now
And is this my final chance of getting you
You know I need this now
I'd, I'd like to put my fingers on you
You loved me 'cause I'm fragile
You wrote me a song
There's so many things I have to say,
Time for me to accept defeat with my extra time
You lie down on the roof and watch the sun rise
Into a time of your design
Colonel Sanders' fingers
But when a southern anthem rings
And everyone is blonde
Paint sounds, electro conversation
Om vajrasattva samaya
Und alle anderen, die sich familie nennen
And it must be displaced
Sister, walk through these fields of delight
Garbage in a can sticks together
Write another song about how I wanted to
So without trying to breathe only the sound of little feet
Sometimes I wonder what we could have been
And either you're weak or you'll use brute forcefeed
Darling you're with me, always around me
You have been the one
They start off cells that haven't been touched before
A floating spit is hovering
I need you
Went out to fight for equality, hope, let's go,
But something's got to give
Held my head and said 'poor thing'
Picture of you that's still there
This is us intertwined and on fire
See the end of this
Running 'round doing people in
doch wir kommen nicht voran
Love me your best and I know,
And count the stars to form the lines
We were this close
Smile someday, smile, kid
Despegaste del cemento mis zapatos 
You're to me than any any son
State of dreaming
I wonder if you have the same dreams too
Finds a street light, steps out of the shade
Each one feels like the first one
A young girl, unchained 
We hold our horns like credit cards
Around the holy kingdom
My, my, my how the brave men do die
Somehow, I smothered rainbows
There may come a time when you rearrange
How that cricket talked all night,
I'm not gonna wait for you tonight
Like the sand upon the shore
Afraid it's so far to fall if no one catches him
Hold my head inside your hands
But I think I must have seen a ghost
It's so cold, under this demon's wing
No one sees me
One billion tv sets
You can only hold a little in your hands
I think of you wherever you go
But never stop to realize
He can't see his way out
I've got a symbol in my driveway
Fortune presents gifts
We got the money, we got money, we got the money now
Wrong move and you're not too cool, wrong move and you're not too cool
I want a horse, I want a sheep
Each day ends quicker
Because everyone has hopes, you're human after all
Echoed in a crowded square
Take his limousine, you gotta get back to me
She pours a daydream in a cup
To rake in that last night's fare
Blood, milk and sky
Storms broken gentle winds just like
Gave up all that fashion jazz and says that with a smile
And you sure don't know, where you're going
Qui illuminent, qui touchent l'infini
You know I'll chase you down
Spiritual mothers
Where we used to go
And no one needs to know
A tune that only caged birds know
Oh, the stories told
Is there a melody  that could lead you to me  like a lullubied child to sleep
Doing our best, no need to hurry
They know it
When it's worse than how it seems
When you said tulips
Are you wanting,
With blankets made of leaves from palm trees
It's a wild hope
Or if you want to just hold back cause you ain't up to it
We gonna listen to Donny Hathaway
But to send Your own Son
Yeah, we'll lay it down
When all your fears rain down
You're sweeping up these sorry streets
I hung around there wasting my time
I'd own no home, I'd own no land
Like a dragonfly
And my sister with her braids
Cold morning, I was looking out it was a cold day
If we don't take it on we won't get far
I had a friend named Victor
Han vill alltid va som dem
I can fell my eyes fillin', the Lord is my witness
Where are you going with this, Bret
And everybody can see I'm no good
Even though there's no way out, we'll find one
And would you call it to his face
Saying hello to men friends
Spoken in a dream
I think of her tonight
And I'm not the only one
'Cause you don't
Could get it right
And silence is danger, but it's not required here, so why you scared
Deep in the night for her
If I've been unkind
Take another sip my love and see what you will see
Lie to me, lie with me, get your fucking fix
Didn't seem so bad until I knew
There's only one way this can go 
I love you
A place of ferns and grass
The birds and the bees
We already know 
You should be in bed but you're here instead
Inside the mountain
And I remember my face when you stopped 
I want to be with you now
Where are we going, nah
If you know the answer tell me now,
'Cause I don't even feel it
Is it over over
I can be the friend you want,
And he pales up next to me
And we try and we fall
If we aren't home
There's nobody here now beauty above all
BattleKhaki personality
One day I will be
From all around the world for the Women, weed and weather
Remember you said you needed me there
Making up songs and words and singin' from the soul
The sacrifice is never knowing
It's just there's something in my mind,
Someday
Now you'd better put some beauty back
Leave the lights on
Ladera Heights
Or is it just a waste of time
I send them out of the house
And find a way to grieve you
si wurden ein und einvalt, 
Suddenly is soon
Was taken away, deliverance came
For the promenade dance
On the news at night, they talk about the abnormalities
Hard to say what's on my mind
A mutual friend's parents left town for a week
When it feels right
Come to me tenderly in the June night
Maybe we never should
Cause everybody knows
You hold me without touch
There's no one way to see
That just comes with the cost
Yes, I'll do my best to make those tears all go away
Bleed out the deviled soul
I never know what I've done
Now I'll tell you something for my heart beats for you deep inside
I never thought it would come
You are mine
So dream all right ha
Every other little night
You never guess,
In crowds of faces
I'ma be the one to take her back see girl
When I just wanted to stay
As you stand
There lies the truth of who I was
Und ich habe keine Angst zu fallen
From here for good tonight
Abraza los momentos lindos
For the very last ride of the day
Because you're right where you should be
The essential child
Sweeter than the honey
Where the linen waves like bleached silk
To leave us dark with regret
And when this game is over
There's gonna be trouble 
We were walking down the block when we thought the bomb went off
Singing songs of love, songs of love
Did I give my heart for that waste
Oh and the waves are going out
Chase his fears away
Sleeping softly while I sing
Ooh, it's a blue sky
But Fly Ty didn't have the contract we wanted
How long 'til I don't feel
Laten we samen niet bestaan
He sees the foreigners in fancy houses
Close your eyes and go to sleep
Some days I feel the same
Les mots des sentiments
I get this pain when you're leaving
Won't you let me meet you by the pool
I want him like a A x
A waiting game now
No non rivederti più
You're seeing it right over London
But never quite as fast as this
Comes back and begs me to catch her every time she falls
Did I love you just randomly
I can't go out in the world without a little fire in my soul
I don't know why, I was just looking for the sea
And there's a glance in time suspended as I wonder how it is
This cities just cementaries enhaced
Remember, you're gonna get hurt someday, anyway
By a hand tightening 'round your neck
Only the fishing part of fishing
Tire scraps on the federal roads look like crash landed crows
Your harmony's an open breeze
I never meant to turn away
When I crossover into the light
Faxing a paper displaying his name
And I'll remember you as the second or two artists I knew who decided to screw me over
And nothing is more powerful than beauty in a wicked world
And make me stay
At a time when you least expect it nigga
Where did we go wrong
No, nothing has changed
Make you believe
Well, you just might get it just right
I can't leave you see back home my house is falling down
And I would stop to think of what to do
Because I've noticed one thing
A bed of moss was granted,
Then we turned on CNN, watched the towers fall again
And you run from it then, now you can't escape
But you spun me around and you loved me instead
daz ietweder dem andern was durchlûter alse ein spiegelglas
Drove by the teachers, even more by polices
Look around, wonder why
Peace in your soul
You've climbed much too high to let the truth stop you now
Maybe it's all right
Don't suppose I'll come out to play with you
To be here and be bringing bad news
I fly away to another dimension
That Sunny Skies hasn't a friend
quand le soleil rouge reviendra
Well, she offered you this to do as you pleased
Maybe it's time we left
For the days gone by
But now your skin is bare
Gold it flew into my eye
One day that wall is gonna fall
Now your skin is just peeling, your skin is just peeling
Opened it slowly and started to read
I wonder if this rain passed toledo
Hanging on the washing line
Over and over and over again
In every part
I nasze szczęście zasuszone
I switch off the lights and imagine that waitress outlined in the bed
Better call the undertaker,
Laten we samen
That shows us where we are
Lay your head on my shoulder let it fade away
A cherry moon a night of fun
Past the eyes of those who care
Muddy river, high, eyelevel
As I take it all in the altitude has an effect on my skin
Can't forget the feeling of
Like diamonds
If I don't know when
Pushes me away
Which incidentally is 
Don't wanna think about when you were mine
His value declined
I keep finding words that leave you
You can't fool me
Call in the reinforcements
Without hunger and homelessness
It's dark again
You become your parents' parent
Are those eyes overrated They make me want to give up on love
'Cause I know myself
You look like you're alive
I know we haven't said enough
Our love's all burnt out
I saw a hundred angels
It resides within the dirt
I hope the mourners will bring plastic flowers
When you're keeping everything inside you
letras que dan placer
Like the boats pulled up on the sand for the summer
And I hope that you don't run from me
We'll pass out on the beach
Elle se déhanche, s'avance, se penche
A cigarette that bears a lipsticks traces 
It was good to hear him say
Als du mich verlassen hast
And you're more than I can say
Only when my hands went numb 
Here on birthplace, don't be nervous
Is this the way to be
Sometimes it takes a toughstrong man to hide
And you're lookin' down the sights
When I woke up the sun was shining in my eyes
Where the wind sings by the river
Violence or loving my way
Die mich zum Wahnsinn treiben
And compared your Jesus to a thief
Soft pyramids evaporate at daylight
When he was there
You don't need to talk to look good
I feel the warmest light comfort me
How we envied all those actors lives,
I know, I know, I know, I know what to say
Lifting to the air the floating world,
I just want to let you know
Tonight, the magic has begun,
I know it's all up to me
This your song to sing All of our debts 
And throw them in the air
About to come into the light
You know how to place your feet carefully on the ground
Down your shoulders and back
"Tell me stories," I called to the Hobo;
Dreamin' like a lonely child
Parking the sad car
Soften when I hear you say
Your words were "Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye"
Give you second chances easily
Revolution ain't a game it's another name for life fightin'
We are heading down
You are mine, and our stars are there before us
It's almost touching, it will almost do
Than anything else"
The kids all holler carols 'cross the water
The first thing
But would like somewhere safe to hide
And if my time is tabled and my clock is on time
You ain't got one word to say
I've got to get up and get over you
House lift up, trees lift out
Have you ever been asked if your hair is a wig
If I pulled a you on you, you wouldn't like that shit
I've seen you, I know you
When no one is around you
A strange glow in the sky
Under the volcano
Would I dare to be alone
I've cut your armies down
I took a river and it wouldn't let go
Outstepping
You said get them away
And it all meant something
Still too young to fail, to scared to sail away
For more than just a moment of truth between the lies told
And realized that our lives aren't so bad
With only a hope to make
And there's still a hat 
Think I'll leave today, I cover it all this way
I'd ask for the sun to never rise
To wet your tongue with the salty sea
I don't know, what I'm getting
Sitting clad you're feeling wild to blame
You must not leave me alone anymore
But as the morning rose
So I'm gonna get upcleansed
I've got scars, even though they can't always be seen
O love is handsomeand love is fine
It's tearing the very heart of me
So we forgot to fall apart that day
The fabulous freaks are leaving town
So poor, so dark
And showed me how to love unselfishly
You don't have to worry boy
Thank you for not letting go of me when I let go of you
I bet you wanted to be over that stone wall
I call my friends and say, "Let's go into town,"
I pulled the ends out for the tie that binds
Acrylic paints, acoustic guitar strings, a new bicycle seat
A flower in the twilight
Making each day a new celebration
You say darlin'
A moment of sun in her eye
Skin and bones and telephones and file cabinets
Say hello to the rug's topography
Don't you know it was better than sex, now, now, now
There'd be no reason to think twice
I stared 
und führte den liebeskranken Tristan zu Isolde
And we're fighting for words now concrete girl
Girl show me heart
Let's figure out how to make this forever
Then everyone would know
We were just this close but we couldn't say it
Thought I'd never dare
A cloak before the moon
So here comes a breakdown,
The word 'Hurricane' is the name given to nature's strongest storm
Feel closer now
Because she knows deep in her heart 
And even you have played a part
Find the hand that fits the glove
In this dream I found myself making love to a strange man
Sits there rockin' slowly on a chair
If you want me now
Instead you get absence
I lived alone but I was only
Don't be a toy on the back of a magazine, don't, don't be a toy, on the back of a magazine, there's a caricature no one reads
Burning inside
Said bring me your master, I don't want his dog
My creative liberty is tempting me to hasten to the point of penance
You got a bad old habit of making people dead
With children my time is so wastefully spent
 What a way to cut lengthwise
Jaded sickened by your ugly ways
Light the morning with the sun on the rise
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh but when we dance
Let 'em reveal how much it cost for this life controlling my vice
And it's been used very little
If you didn't care what happened to me
We were both in it and everything seemed so right
Five fingered leaves keep covering me
She was exceedingly liberal
And I don't know where to turn
I hope you find the love that's true
Says it gets old real quick
Vapor hands released the blade
When he comes, tell me that you'll let him in
No sign of a friend of mine
Hung on a firework
Is it a kind of dream
My darling, I need you
The morning will come
Someday your bird is gonna fly
Everybody wants to be cool
I wish I knew you
When the clouds move in
As I'm awkward as a wound on my bones
How could I ever take you home
The song of heart's desire
Feeling mountains rising out of makebelieve seas, creating typhoons
Let me tell you the story of a soldier named Dan
You come anytime you want, yeah
I know that I've got a sordid past
Sea creatures stared at us and we stared back at them
Entre o céu e o firmamento
I'd rather hide these teardrops deep down inside
And I can't leave my troubles 
Just let me love you
But in the right rays of the sun
Well I bled words onto a page for you
There were people around with the need to get down for good
Though you took her for a fool
That us down below
The sun is still there, except it's not
And you hate the teenage dad on his estate
Lying down I notice what you see below us
 gone without a trace
My eyes burn and claws rush in to fill them
Got your earrings in my pocket till I see you again
I need a little more time with you
Then you fell to your knees and proceeded to cry
You showed me all I could have
With Daddy and Mammy standing by
Flying way above the sea
I have a little house*
It's what I always wanted
Nothing so silly 
Daily art was dropping lines
Yes fate is so unkind
You've so long to get it
You'll be mine
You've never left me at all
I can remember the little things that always made you smile
Deep in his dreams at home
Calm down
C'mon, try
And Jamie picks fights but the weekend's short lived
Keep moving way up high
We went to his house and did some speed
The wind turns traitor cold
In this Sahara of sorrow
Have you ever been lost
But you've gone somewhere deeper
And you turn away
Throne of needles
She homed with thieves
To forget you
You can find another man
NASA is on your side
Without you I move at random
Is ask for things
The sun goes down
Shadows haunt and taunt your hand
It still hurts
You'd feel my medicine's side effect 
Take a long walk out of the hindsight start anew
Wise in the ways of the heart
No need to fear
I won't be fooled just like
Yeah, I know
Oh, truly I do love you
Ich glaube fest, dass Du's alleine schaffst
Number nine with my head on the bar
How not to fear
My dog said you ain't no freak so you 'bout to prove my man wrong
In a work light
Why don't you love me like I want you to
 hindsight, but how did they know then
They both got up real fast
And you waited on the rain
Looking for the summer
Te ver e não te querer
Yeah I'll always be waiting for you, for you
If I'd been a phoenix, raise us up through embers and fly
Come on love, love, love
It's so funny, we went down to the store
I think I'm gettin' lost for a while
Where soul meets body
Your card the sun
I'm riding recklessly through a thick and humid
The stars are all, aligned
I can love
I would catch bullets with my bare hands
And they'll stumble around like hypocrites
Or uncommon hearts
I just wanna know you
And we are made for each other
You're the sunshine trying to break through
They just fade out when you take a breath
If I could see you one last time
It says
Tapping on my roof and walls
Take me on a ride inside your heart tonight
Grey like the gravel under our shoes
Only love
I'm needing you there
Believes in me
'Cause I'm going to miss you,
Laid on petrified trees
Why can't we just sit back and feel the love between us now
Graceful swans of never topple to the earth
When you come around, everything else vanishes
I met a woman that night, she loved me for the stories that I told
I've seen it hide away
So when you were mine
Never would stop growing
Même si c'est dur comme l'iridium, nous sommes
Oh, it's okay if you don't want to swim
I'd give myself to please you
Take me back to the home
Oh that drink went down smoothly, just like the one before the last you had
The way you make us all smile
Can't go where I've gone before
To my brother Big Pun
I took a river and the river was long
A million dreams have passed her
I wouldn't change a single thing
No one's gonna bring me down
It meant the world to me
Two little ones
'Cause you're still a long way from home
Lorsqu'on voudrait qu'il reste droit
They brought me here 'cause I can't take care
All is faith
I've just got away with it
Like a coverlet in the summer's air
But it doesn't do a bit of good
Pass still
Cause there was a shift in the paradigm
I don't know whether to drink or stay at home alone
Stars and midnight blue
In the last strings of sunlight, a Brigitte Bardot
Thinking of you and the love I got I need somebody like you
I hope it's not too late, I hope it's not too late
I'm saving money
C'mon baby let's go
in diesen schmutzigen Sekunden
Of selfdoubt and illusion
And in that perfect moment
Create wonderful dishes
Who it was she never found in me
Und die Sehnsucht weicht der Zeit
You lost employment
And maybe all those secret times
But by some miracle
I promise baby, one day I'll come back to you
The way that Tupac, Biggie,  and Jigga got it
I'm getting nervous, na, na, na, na, na, na
Starlight sigh and shadow move
So don't give me the world today
Makes me want to give him my body
Should he stay or should he go
But the air's so thin and you're still polluting it
Say stop, made up, lying on the bathroom floor
What's done is done to me
Beneath the silver moon
It ain't a case of no one cares
Another humdrum grey day
While the telephone rings
The best advice I ever had was leave what was behind
Where you've never been and
Será que sou assim me vou sem ver o que não vi
The young smoke grass in grassless jungles
I don't get
I wish I had a very bad
And your eyes tell me we've made a mistake
¿quien le tendrá paciencia
I lay amongst the clouds
I never said I loved you quite enough
Here is a strange and bitter crop
And looking in the morning the streets are flooded out
The flower don't know, when its growing
Too many times
Uh oh, uh oh, down low, down low
But you'll never know
Who has to say goodbye
You don't know where you're going
No prisoner could climb the walls
And if anyone ever wondered why you did it
These ships were always full of people facing windows
Sammála um flesta hluti
From the moment I opened my eyes
I'm looking in on the good life
'Cause the love you used to feel is still in there, inside
Drive them away
You are the prettiest thing
They're searching for the stars they couldn't find
But every time the wind pulls back my hair
I get it, I get it
Where are we going
Captured by the moon
I'm crawling back again
Pelted on the second stair
There's a chapter on God that I don't understand
You know this ain't nothing new 
I know, I know, I know
Listen to me, why is everything so hazy
It becomes you, in a strange kind of way
Yeah one day soon I'll pull my head down out of outerspace
The automatic bought the years you'd talk for me
You take my breath away in
Egal wohin man reist
Oa oa me leva pra ela
And always keep thinking
Talkin', talkin', talkin', talk
The fear of pity is always awake
Till the next day
I've made a crown for you, put it in your room
Candlelight and all things bright come into our room 
Maybe she wants me, and that's
There are worlds within worlds, that keep rotating
Now he's just a mean old bastard 
I hear your voice so clear
I'm moving somewhere
Summerbreeze is blowin' through your window
Piercing into me and I miss your warmth
And to know you is hard; we wonder
Wake me up 'cause I'm dreaming 
Don't fight don't argue
As we moved out of the farmlands, into the grid 
Just do it, whatever it is, whatever it is
That you really didn't want me staying 
Only pain and sorrow
Goodnight Georgie, goodnight queen
A little run down
You hooked the stars with your eyes
I hold the thought
Even if you don't want me to
Maybe I'll see you in another life,
I lie awake and think of you
And I will have a game on the coconut shy
I'd like to stay in love with you
In an attempt to meet a harsh deadline
Tryna sit in the back of his whip
We sleep in the mornings
They'll rock your world
A man inside the boy
Crinklycut chips, bendy fork a vague sense of direction swang open
Reflecting from the glasses of passive of every page
See everything
It's only the start
You are the only exception, you are the only exception
To get to where it's at
My heart was broken
Ain't we all a little needy
Let's just make a move and feel the earth quake
I thought I would know what to do when the time came
I don't even know her 
All right, my brother
Take my hand and I will mellow
Dissolving falling down
Past meadow grounds
That say I love you
And hold me for goodbyes and whispered lullabyes
And give it away as much as I can
I will catch you if you fall
How bad I need you need you
We'll find a way
You can fall for pretty strangers and the promises they hold
And I've worked for breakfast
A wind in the shadow, a whale song
Il y a de l'uniformité partout
With love, with gratitude
When leaves have turned to brown
She knows a good thing now
And I know, I don't got the money
And watch it all fall right into place
I'm moving out, for a moment in The Springs
I guess it's true, what they all say
The closer you get
No I'm not a simple man
Sing a song of love to me
I can't breathe
Bear in mind, we all fall behind
Maybe next year I'll be better
Holds my love in his hands, still I'm searching for something
Take a look in the mirror
When I sleep with that picture of
To say over coffee 
So we convince ourselves that we're better off gone
I really couldn't say I mind
That shit goes on forever
Surrender and be witness
And so I hope when I am finally dead and gone
He says the White King thinks the game of chess is wrong
I see the crowds running,
When things become too warm make them a little wet
It's the one that makes you strong
She was a tangle of questions
I keep one in my wallet
Cause your love is real
I honestly won't give you an apology
I don't want to fight
Glance in your eyes
Commas, commas in my head, man
The American dream can be found here if you keep your mouth closed
I said don't go away
When you're smoking in tenfold in the morning
But you'll never hear a pistol
She keeps me from my sleep
Sucarcitanga candanam namami nanda nandana
I don't fuck with no hand me downs, see if you fuck then it's after me
The past is gone
That's why I won't let you
I am smitten and
They make me feel alive
Is it morning or night
So I look to my Eskimo friend
She said she want some Marvin Gaye, some Luther Vandross
Qui rend fou
Until it rains
They climbed deep inside of this woman's garden
When you take my hand
I know you're looking forward to them
Ser pojkar och flickor gå igenom kärlekslunden
We love to talk about how you'll come up to visit me
Jo, I know you would say,
I wish I could go so far away
Became a time he remembers
Spinning pictures, blue screens, and red kisses
I really feel quite sad
Chase floating fish through space and time
Since you are a shining light
You can be anything you want
It takes some work to make it work
How wrong could anyone be
Don't think I know when, he tries to bring them home, maybe that would be a way if he lived alone
Lamplight makes the shadows play
And now I couldn't lead you home
Do I inch closer every day
Of all the wants and hungers
You push me away
And while I wrestle with demons and appetites
Every time I look into your eyes
Say a little prayer 
In a rush to see the death of the sun
That leaves you unwell and thinking of me everyday
Call the ferryman to cast me off
That I've built up in my mind
The earth laughs beneath my heavy feet
This isn't righteous, it's a midlife crisis
I come up the stairway
I seem to see everything you do
Why everyone says that I look happier
I'm scared to let somebody in on this
Do you want me caring less
Even when I die, it will sing to you
Even when you lie
But driving west now, half past five
One day it's gonna happen
I'm never gonna get it
You were sweeter than the blossoms on the tree
That's ever been said
'Cause you won't let go of anything you hold
I heard you on the radio, I couldn't help but smile 
Don't know how to fly
Texas I be screwed up, Chi town I be really pimping
Fly girl shouts to keep it down 
I told you, weren't lyin', I know you aren't relying
Time taking time
Fool, I wonder if you know yourself at all
I promised I'd have you home before daylight
Is worse than something
Losing their sons
When I close my eyes
To say goodbye to life on earth
It was the wrong guy
Then I see all my friends, they're all in town
And those stars Those stars
My love goes free
And the people pass me by
With a melody that climbs and then falls, then falls, then falls
When we touched and I was so high
I got to bag it up
"The days are getting longer so I better get stronger fast"
But you know, the sad thing is the boys all say,
I'd like to remind
Looks for lights anywhere
You said I love you like the stars above, I'll love you till I die
Hasta llegar a comprender
A hurricane occurs when high pressure and low pressure masses of air
But I couldn't see the light, no I couldn't see the light
I won't know when to stop
Forgot to know how to grow
Forgotten pleasure smoulder
Or foolish
At the party at the club
Can't do a thing to stop me Dream, baby
We've been talking all summer
I believe in miracles baby I'm forever yours,
A fairgrounds painted swing 
And one step back
Distance just makes my heart grow for you
para escapar los dos volando un rato 
I stand at your gate
I know I got issues
So I don't lie, I don't lie no more
Babies underneath their beds
And when blondes and beautiful are multiple
If God had a face, what would it look like
Pancho please forget what I said
We shall be one
It makes me uncomfortable
Never need to part
Dass du mich liebst, weiß er nicht
See the star, probably gone too far
Under twilight blue, starts to mesmerise
And move
That you've got so far
A noite inteira passa num segundo 
I dream
I can't believe
I looked for you in everyone
Some people read idea books
All the good things that I've done
And this ain't no time for games
Papa, tu ne reviendras pas
He's elusive and I'm awake
Laying flat on the ground
So bright on cinder gray and spray paint
I know, you got alot of special things to do, with me I'm through, I know, its all right
In the drive onto me
Your sound is sweet, the mosquito sweep 
That's what we'll become
'Cause we were Pancho and the Cisco kid
It's a hidden law
My apologies fall on your deaf ears
Just for a while, I'd seen you smile
And he walked away from my fleeting house
A fighter in the corner with no fight
Not the foolish, not the wise
Business and governments just, watch as the innocent fade
But I don't wanna wear you
So maybe it's true, that I can't live without you
I pretend to think about my health and what's true
And sleep tonight
'Cause I believe in silence, our hearts speak the same word,
Foundation is crumbling away
With the sound of laughter came a sense of doubt
No one can see us tonight
Il est parti sans paix Sans même allumer le calumet
Yet we would go on, knowing the wrong
Remember this in your heart
You wrap your curve of delight
Has your small amount of success gone to your head yet
It only gets to me, in times like these
Control my every thought
Living under changing weather
Just hit the ground running
Now is the time
And pain gets hard, but now you're here and I don't feel a thing
They could not make up for distance
And she fights for her life on the train
Grounds for why I think we should end 
I served him right
All the young faces come and replace the dying ones
Send away for a perfect world
And the king is a hand
And I'll do my best to make it better
And make our hearts as perfect as new
You left my love on the line
Oh, and the ones who taught you how to live
Don't you run away, don't you run away, don't you run away
You came, you saw, you sawed her brain
I'm tired of talking to an empty space
Backed by drums and drones
Time seems to bring us together again
Outlines the dead
Nothing
Take back the pain, we got the rain, don't know why
We go blind when the stakes are high
Wherever you go
All I wanted was for you to believe in me
Sits down by the fire
Your lack of light
Your waist, your breath
If you want better things
When you think you've got the world all sussed out
And thought you were beautiful
Now you know what can come from dreams
Täällä ilman sua ei oo mitään, ei ilman sua ei oo mitään
In those missing times
primavera quer entrar
Or maybe number two
He's related to you
And I remember us now
Don't try to believe in anyone for I would change your mind
It's like striking a match pretty hard upon a powder keg
el mar, la tierra son
Ev'ry day was a cloudy day for me
All your insides fall to pieces
But you won't let me recover who you am
And feelings of aggression are the absence of the love drug in
Come with me and sip on some Evelyn Champagne, you ain't know Twista could work it like the Whispers
I said maybe
Standing the wrong side of the sun
Turn your hazard lights of when you see them hoes Drive slow, homie
Away away
'Cause when she comes along, she could be breaking it
Juliet, the dice was loaded from the start
There's a mirror to have a check
Scrape my mind with your hand
We don't need no father or mother
And say you've kept some fire aside,
I always liked being alone
Consider that the terrible silence
Bodies growing colder with the distance now
Does that mean we dreamt the same dream
And may you need never to banish misfortune
Yeah Yeah, shine on me
My heart in my throat
It makes me cry
Praise to the glory of loved ones now gone
These names live on your lips
'Cause there's a light in me 
Wake in the night
Of everything
The sun began to shine
Open up your mind
Faceless scrumbled charcoal smears
Gonna love you down and show you the world the world
When I met her she was standing by a door
Oh and he should know, he's been there enough
And all it really needed was the proper point of view
You're not seeing it in one area, 
Dry eyes in the pouring rain, well
I thought it was for good
You better run for your life
I am wild and I am free
I'm a boss I'll buy that ocean, ain't nobody fucking with this
In that when you look you make lists
Cleveland game and two fishing poles
But in the same old haunts I still find my friends
I wish I could step from this scaffold
All you want is what you hear
Oh she said, "Shut your mouth
So gimmie a little time and you'll be knowin' your good lovin'
Tuck the whole thing
Just send your heart beat, I'll go
Hmmm, 'cause I wanna hear you
That all that we did, you undo
Olhos de águas vindas
And it's changing the view
There is always one addiction
Through windows of our past lives
Put all the linen in it
But I just wanna see you safe again
Men bror, käre storebror, han
Just give me, give one more chance
Take me, take me, home Home, home, home
And by chance her eyes fell onto mine
Wasn't you who said life was like a plastic cup
Fragile like a sea horse
Every year for a thousand years
One day to the next for now it serves me very well
Feel what it's like to be new
She was a friend, stabbed backs and broke plans
Remember she is just as scared as you
The way the sea reflects the sun
Seducing me to stay
Wish that you and I were lovers
Nothing but blue skies do I see
She'll watch you drink yourself to death
And everything's cool as long as I'm getting thinner
And if one sentence is true
It's all I know
A world that I cannot describe
I can depend on you to send me to any destination
The painting has a dream where shadow
When the daddy got caught up by the law
Well we all write our own endings
Let the big band play as you tap leather with your fingers
But I don't know
Slowin' down I'm gettin' tired
It's in your stare and at your core
But don't you tell nobody else
When I am old, let the tension flee
I'm trying to get through
I forget how to begin it
Hold me in your warm hand
The wind began to howl
I thought I felt your shape but I was wrong
I give You my life
Friends of the black swan
You're always sure, you're always right
Can't do a thing to stop me now Oho
That I believe in you
But don't forget, enjoy the ride
We're still waiting
Please remember me happily
I'm in my little house
I had no choice
The secrets that we keep say them in our sleep
Your voice calling in
That was the moment that you lost your charm
Come on love, come on love
I took a river and the river was long and it goes on
The girl I described, she's as real as the wind
Hard times, let me be
Of faulty manufacturing
'Cause I must remember to forget you
The silence of a falling star
I'n the only one you run to in the night
Her smiling face
From the freeway
Our hearts speak the same word, the same word
Seem so thirsty, smell fresh meat in the air
Yasashii kisetsu o yobu 
He's been there since the very start
Something you're afraid to show 
No, I'm not a gogetter
Naked, the Judas in me fell by the tracks but he lifted me high
But instead we waited our whole life and I know that it's real
But today you blow my mind
And I cannot control myself
Shake the floor, move the room with the bass line
Sono te o tsunaide 
And all I do is miss you, and the way we used to be
Nobody knows 
He is waiting to meet you
Floating now where they want to float
I know you feel, you need to prove 
The brittle and bitter bones
Not cold and windy
Some whispers around the trees
Just don't know if I could roll into the sea again
Reading the future that lay in my hands
And it can't be stopped
Send our spirits soaring
'Cause I need kicks
Someone's gonna bring me around
'Cause my night is young
A million pieces
You're right next ti the right one
Oh god I wish it isn't so
In the deep dark sea 
Holding my breath through tunnels, 
I'm getting mesmerized
And I hope by the time that I'm done with this song that I figure out
They say I have done
So go, love, if you're going
Maya this song's for you
No longer making sense to me
If I made you blue, I've had heartaches too
I feel love's wheels turning
Because you act so tough, I totally lost control
Hang my head, break my heart built from all I have torn apart
The nightbirds start to sing their favorite song 
Rock and roll is here to stay
And the next day
Suddenly everything has changed 
It made me see what I want to see
I want to learn the secret my way
With thy alldimming hand,
And if you lost everything
We'll find our way together
Just like a wave on the ocean
You aren't
It's all I'd need
Brass buttons on your coat hold the cold
When you look in my eyes
And all of the bad feelings have disappeared
It was dumb, I had no sense of your size
Now he looks around his place and anyways,
The drowsy islands slumber one by one
Putting the needs of others ahead of yours
It's pulling me down the drain
Hash browns, hash browns, you know I can't be late
My final place
You are the freest man
And still I stand this very day
Do you remember the day we left the Earth
Is very near
Why couldn't I have found a way to say
And they get stronger
My forest of glass
Where are all those tears coming from
And I'll be guilty for the rest of my life
Yeah, you know what just to do
Writing songs I can't believe
Cobblestone and dusty feet
& although I am leader of this country
We are small
Through the eyes of a child
You'll be right half the time
All I want is your love
Are you late It's always hate, troubles in your mind
Take every moment, you know that you own them
So much to fight for, so much to change
Dyed my hair with your sunny streets
Then hold on, hold on to the ones you love
Under your trees I forget about me
The only one to see my other face
'Cause the words are dead,
Sometimes I can close my eyes
recordarte es un hermoso lugar
Somebody, somebody, somebody left your heart in the cold
Falling down, all the way to, to love
So many days in the wind, let them roll on by
We never thought to keep it shaded
You've got a devastating point of view
In der dunklen Ecke hast du alle verführt
Another light is another minute 
Falling around me
It's scary what you'll find
And watch the waves from its wake
Por trás dessa lente tem um cara legal
Moving like the sunlight in the alleyways
Fall x That I'm ready for the fall
Stricken with the winter cold, sippin' the burnin' hot
Light that has given way
Don't leave me stranded in your arms
No subtle men
I feel I am slipping away from underneath my toes 
Swallowing each new possession
You're here just a while
If you can't change your mind
This life owes nobody happiness
All my desire is vanishing
On one of them bad nights, y'all have a bad fight
Jag behöver nått att skriva om
Take me to your house
Yeah leave this city behind you
With you last night
So much for girl staying 
With all their illusions of choices
Draw the bath and remind me to eat
Under the waves, now that I'm giving up
I was strong
We get lost sometimes
She wants to get through to you,
When I walk around here drunk every night
Colors of my home
And there is fire, love, on the balcony right here
I'm gonna sex educate you, sex educate you and make you fall in love sex educate you
Beginning to laugh in his favorite place
Han lever inte för en framtid
We long to be a picture of Jesus 
I got a worried and a jealous mind
Having a good time, baby
We took what we had and we ripped it apart
Back away, come back away, come back away
Can you forgive me somehow
And slept with your legs apart every night
But the letter jacket wasn't yours to own
A young girl, unchained
And I'm feeling good
So this is goodbye
I have none, I cannot live with
The way a cold dark night invites the fire thief
So I never ask what's going through her mind
And when they asked us how we knew his name
I life and death my way through the sun
Close your eyes, wonder
Every gem is not a diamond
I now in silent pace
It's just it's nothing so simple 
To be with you, to be the one
I need, need, need, need, need, need, need some kicks
I won't make you, ooh ooh
Blasted in appearance and a composite of fearful minutes
Of loving someone so much that you need
Never no more to call your name
Whose mother comes and she sees her and she smiles 
Then you pulled away
I'm coming, please
Boned so much that summer, even had him a baby
Give me a reason
It's not over till you start again
He said it was a one night stand
A dream that I could call my own
That hand guns were made for shooting people
I'll always run away
während man stolpert und fällt
Than now is all there is
Honey, lovin' you is the greatest thing
The world I can see is a nowhere land
Trespasses stretch like broken fences Winding as they may 
That there is no reason why it can't be like you said
We began dismantling the stadia and schools,
But my guess is right you break like glass
Once I was your sweetheart,
All night manoeuvre
Pray to God that I live in the sky
I could easily bring you tears, I could send you to hell, I know you
And decided to give up the ghost 
If an angel could hold it in his polished white hand
But I'll always miss
You will be in my soul you'll be in my soul, in my soul
And if we're lucky we might see the end of the day completely
What you are about to hear are true stories
Since I stole this song we have made a new start
It's bringing me down
And they're scared that we know all the crimes they'll commit
Eu sempre quis fazer a minha parte
Everytime I wan't more
Because one day out there we will all be dead
My weapons left by the bedside
But it's bruising your karma
Oh, what I wouldn't spend to lend you mine, hmm
I wanna live I wanna live
Angelic child
Seven sunrises and seven more nights 
So I'm going Island hopping again
I went to LA the next day
Between doors, walls and chords,
You think I'm living it, living it, living it, living it up
They made it far too easy to believe
Everything, every tune will be played by night
For help and inspiration
Your eyes are the rain, just a soul that's changin' in shape
It's a loved one
You did not choose to be this way
Es regnet in Müdigkeit verstrickt
Constant questions from the start
Till I'm in the ground and I'm cold
With your hair piled up high I will never forget
Send her seed, a painful sound
I spread the bad news where I go
Just take a look around, here
The walls were gone but the doors and windows remained
Sometimes I suffer from distractions like
Quiet dark and small
Where it knows how to improvise
And we laughed with the new air
And the cabin was filled with an unearthly glow 
Be crazy forever
It's hard to believe ooh ah
You were all I ever wanted to do
You're earth bound and I'm injured
No, oh, there's no movement
That's why I never go,
And all my earthly cares might fade away
And I can count five times off the top off my head where I sucked it in
Follow me into just one more Spring
No more crying, ooh ooh
Who made these customs I can't seem to get past 
All the stupid things we've done
Everything would be all right
I opened my eyes
We all want, we all yearn
But the songs about you keep coming out
If I stay right here and forever with you
Like their blurring into to someone else's name
As they die alone
The words, they seem to roll as one
There's still a place I wanta be
All alone and mad
Come on the lip only makes him bolder
Captain of my feelings
Or is it you ooh ooh ooh ooh
That still means someday you might be
Corner tubeless dark and wet, straighten
I think I'm falling in like with you
Out there running just to be on the run
Prendre l'air, parler à quelqu'un
Oh, don't cry
It might have been a while
Gaze up at the moon hanging low in the sky as we slip away into the darkness
But we knew you were afraid
Winter comes and snow
A whole lot better off than the fools he left here
And when some Luther come on I hope you feelin' me and still will be in love with me
Even though dead skin like stone makes me ugly
Intend to live
I want it painted black and red
So now they lie there breast to breast and toe to toe
All things strain
Before the singing of the
Was right there in your smile
If the world is cold, but the sun shines the same
Put you in a daze with Maze, fulfilling her with every temptation, slow jam, and havin' deep sex
He showed his mama and his papa papa papa papa papa papa papa
You don't even know my name
They keep saying I'll survive
Break it, so never they perpetuate the malady
And then she starts to sneeze
Look for clovers in grassy lawns
But no one knows me
I climbed this hill watching so still
Poor girl
This wall
We'll play on till the end
Into the night
I love you 
I see your stars begin to shine
Clearminded and blind
Trustless daughters
'Cause you don't love me any more
A hundred thousand words
den tranc getrunken beide, sâ 
Darling don't you know
I sing with the singer
Good times come and go
I taught you how to feel, but you just feel numb
Hey man, do you wanna hear a story about me
All I ever wanted was to be right here
Try to remember all the good times
And I've been needing to tell you
Clean the earth surrounding and cause the warm to drown
I wanna show you the peaceful feelin' of my home
Never will it show, sweet child of mine
With the disease
You'd help me find my way
And, now, for a time,
Better lock up well before they come
Don't know if I want you to see through me,
I've changed my plea
To warm you bones in the northern snow
We can cope did you know
Who can never be alone
It's colder in house than you think,
When doors forced open shut again a flytrap and a petal
It sheltered me, from nothing but the weather
Before you know it your life has run away
You gotta turn everything around
Sweet dogs, sweet rain, never come  I go
Give me your heart,
We'll be together in time
Despite my fears
Says the sign in the shop window
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
As your eyes roared with light
The river don't know, when its flowing
When my friends turned out, I found out
'Cause I fall and I break just as easy as an egg
And I feel sand slipping underneath my toes 
Oh should my people fall then surely I'll do the same
His tooth to his dog's tail, find a stick, wind up, and then throw it
Who cares about me anyway
I seen more places than I can name
Ist es besser, wenn wir die körperliche Hülle auf einer Wiese verscharren Ohne Pomp und Getöse, da die Erinnerung in unseren Herzen ist Wir brauchen nicht den täglichen Gang zum gepflegten Grab Wir haben die Liebe in uns, die uns mit dem Verstorbenen, auch über dessen Ableben hinaus, verbindet Das ist gut
To break or mend a bond as strong as ours
I've made amends between father and son
I don't know where I've been
And kiss your face just so you know
I gotta get over you, oh
In my pearl and my diamond shoe
nouse ylös, liiku sun jaloillas
Something of a sad one
Like something is falling apart
Going back to the sea
The weight of my words
You won't need a real job because I would love to pay for you
Put me on the top of the world
Otherwise you're only living for it
I kissed your hair
Flowers for the ones you loved
Looking at the things that passed me by
In a way I am free
You know why yesterday was a lie
So sing it now
Of goin' home someday
So remember all your days the world is yours and all the world contains
Trouble, more trouble can you get anymore
Is, "It's all lovely, baby"
And then if you continue you will end up in Virginia
You're free to fly tonight
And on any other day I'd be soul destroyed
But I sailed too far out to sea
What can't you spare
Refugee hands from a gin war
At the end of this burning world
It's my birthday, 
Reaching out and find that I'll never be late
That the order's alphabetical
Another man down if you let them know
Frantically, I run for my life
And there's a blessing in every moment, every mile
Do you believe me now 
I've made my bed, now I'm lying in it
And then it all came back
But I ran a mile in a minute and there's no going back
More than you do
When you go you are gone for good
And never look back on what might have been
I wanna do what I want if it kills me
It hurts me every time I see you
Somewhere over the Earth
Take me wherever you go,
Yeah but I've already gotten over you
sieben mal alles zu spüren
Well it sucks to be honest
And strike without warning
Haul away from here 
Und vergisst,
Lies in the hands that set me free
Help me get a hold on you
Remember us and all we used to be
If you wanna ride, you can come out and see me
And even though we feel bad we won't be seein you around anymore
Oh when the storm comes,
I got to handshake
Second chances are slipping off the cliffs of this defeat
Believe me
"Carving my initials on your forehead"
You stay on my mind
Forget your scars, we'll forget mine
Your arms, your sides
Got some whiskey from the barman
Ooh Another love has come and gone
No I don't think we should wait
I'm alright here in your arms, darling
I have to keep you and Paris on my mind
All of a sudden, no time for waiting
For someone like you to remain on side
Where you parked your daddy's car 
Water reaching up just to swallow me whole
But in the end
Confessions stuck in your mouth
Or are you just letting it vanquish
The dead are haunting me
She's looking for someone to settle her debts 
Sobra tanto dentro de este corazón 
He got that a time,
You occasionally cross my mind
A comic relief that makes room for my decision
They say that they don't see what you see in me
Vaca, cadela, macaca, gazela
And she say, muhfucka, yo mama's a bitch
I taught you how to feel, why do you feel numb
Theories fly about
Need I say
Who knows if it'll go our way
From my lips into your breath 
I know I know you speak in different tongues
Por ahí parece haber asomando un cuerpo
I'll get the gun
And leaves us behind
Birds were singing
I promise one day I'll be coming around
Don't you mind, don't you mind
But the feeling does come back to you
She holds the hands of someone young 
But an easy ride
What various paths are followed
Rosy, blossoming, intoxicating
It was gone for a while but it's coming back in style
Why in the night sky are the lights hung 
They've got me on the wrong route
But it will come as sure as light
'Cause your love, our love
Keep her awake, Give me a fright,
When you're around
You're closer than anyone has even been
Id spend the day with my angels at the beach
'Cause I'm killing them all on my own little mission
In them juicy fruit jeans bumpin s
Removing all your skin
Where can you run 
I gotta find a new career
You know, this real shit, feel this
There is no one to keep you caged in
And it's hard to know what you want
Lay down your heart on me
Don't you remind me
And the oceans shall rise and slap of the shores of mountain sides
They were giving you garlands
But I think something's going on
No longer easy on the eyes
By the wonder of it all
L'amour de Dieu n'a pas de frontière
I'll buy a magazine searching for your face
Old Gideon's Bible in the nightstand drawer saying, "Go on, open up"
And the shadows on the floor
We may get tossed tonight
We are temporary arrangements
They glow unbearably bright
All the things that I couldn't say 
Acting their parody of love
We pass lost souls
Good times around the corner
But do you ever let your guard down
Whispers, captured lies
Nothing left to fight
Harder, harder, harder, harder, harder
Or in the jewler switchin chains
I said don't be upset it's only an octopus
Away from traffic and smiles of tire
In houses lights are glowing
I've yet to break a sweat, I'll make your past regret
And if you're wondering why
The love we share will never end
As long as you're with someone and never left alone
One heartbeat in your body is a miracle of love
We're leaving things unsaid
We send our deepest sense to climb
Some people live their lives with a violence that's pure and clean
Because you're young
Don't think I ever have
Clinging a shoulder a leap begins
And every moment controlling me, I love the way you be holdin' me when I be listenin' to Jodeci
You let her in
And things, they seem much bleaker
Breaking down the surface in the night
Lennart Nilsson, shut off those lights
You defer to the views of the television news
A halflife disappears today
Some, three W's only for a three day run, bitch
All feeding on the dream we made
And in the morning
Nature conspires to help you
We pretend not to look at the change,
te quiero te llevaste la vela
Make someone play
Singing right with mine
To see what I've done
The light will fill our eyes like cats
Does it make you feel good when they tell you what you want to hear
For the first time in his life
Swirling in and out of view
Where all of our precious dreams remain
Awoke this morning
Along with those eyes
When you can't make it alone
Ponder the vastness
I know there's something more
Correndo atrás dos sonhos
There isn't anything that you can say
Droplets glittering home
Seen through the eyes of rebel glasses
The last time I saw you
That I've been dreaming of
I like being alone
A vision too removed to mention
The coldest story ever told
How come, how come, how come,
Say we will wallow away in a world so mild and high
To tell you how to feel,
Is working you like a charm
How about doing it just like yesterday
I know I tend to get so insecure
Out what I'd be missing
I can't believe what's happening
And if it ain't positive vibrations, baby, than it'll have to go
Humans running for cover
Fallen walls all around 
Got that women, weed and weather
And we talk till the evening fades
Ordering drinks at the bar
Cold as a windchill
And we are breathing deeper instead
Let the bees make honey
Angel's wings carried him to me
Till the last beat of my heart
No need to follow
You see them fours crawling You see them screens falling
I never tried to fake it
Bring my broken heart to an invisible king with a hope one day you might answer me, so I pray don't you abandon me
And I wanted you to want me to stay
You have all of my heart
Landing at night
I'd also like to dedicate this to my homeboy JRue
She's my butterfly
Ah yeah Sounds a bit gay
And when the wind does blow against the grain
The sun will shine
You may see 
She's got a moulding
Terry Callier
To get closer to the sign 
Nur bis hier in geht der Weg,
This is my very first love song
The sky blue
Because you're acclaim
And then we understood at last
Sentimental jamboree
In every skyline
Too many fucked up years
Goodbye house  goodbye stairs
Turning half the heart into something hard and dark
The hazy window
Can't pin you down
Won't let the bastards grind me down 
She suffers an eternal night
Just what it was I had
Yes keep your wide eyes wide wide open
But tonight we feel like stars
My home on the streets
It was just before the moon hung
With ash in your mouth
I can't get insured for the state I'm in
ocean, oxigene, space
I got my dark green trenchcoat on
Tapping doors, but irritate
Drops onto the forehead of the waiting boy,
So that everyone can see
And where gravity don't bring you down
The interstate's choked with nomadic hordes
They shine for you
Another shot of something, warm to numb the pain
I love you love you first thing in the morning
You know how much I'mma make it work You know her trust livin' in her purse
The walltowalltowalltowall
Now you're gone, I feel alone
Oh, lay it down in the night, let it soothe this
When I reach those hills, boys
It was a mean to get away from this accident
Never let them go
So I'm just waiting on fate to come
But now it seems that nothing can change your mind
Out to the fair though I welched on a  bet
By many a ruined year
With some James Dean in his eyes
Leave the nightmares behind
All hands up, salute the Empire State 
Gave it all back to the life I led
Walk to the sea
Think about all the foreign places we could be
Runaway
And disdain the winter showers
But, I still hung on, just hoping for, my love to come around
Yeah they're gonna dig a coalface out of you,
Despite I talk about it, I ain't makin' fun of them niggaz
For my love
"Water, so much water is under the bridge"
And our bed and the dress that you wore
All crushed upon my skin
He is sorry for the wrong that he has done
In ways I always thought were new
Because all they cared about was whether you put out
Though I'm drunk again
And the pain you feel, I promise you, will go away with time
And watch me fall apart, watch me fall apart
con mensajes de deseo
When the mornin' sun appears, When the sun appears
So we play our games
Like "I love you", "I love you"
But I've been thinkin' and it got me back to sinkin' in
Don't want to make a rapper cry then watch what you say
Were you unawares
Wanted in the first place
Life is but a dream boy, you can be redeemed
When I was younger, I saw my daddy cry and curse at the wind
There is no end to what I'm saying
And two were old and grey
There's a calm under the waves as I choose to sink
Swaying to a gentle lady's breeze of ocean, sailing the wind
Found new life
There are no men  I'm the last in the chain
And as her body lay there she decided to stay there
And steaming yourself in the warm shower spray
When we were lovers
Snow is on the ground
I've got to get to you
And I always settle for the silhouettes
Forget everything you ever learned 
You and me always standing at the threshold
It's neither heaven nor space, It's just high
I feel, I feel so scared
So I got something new to see
With all the demons I possess
We still want to be reminded
Cool and unfazed
As life unfolds so does my faith
I'd write this song on the way
I do believe
I said goodbye to the seasons that were never insincere
That morning the sea was mad, and I mean it
And sways for you
And all I can say is you saved me Entertaining, thoughts are raining 
Now the pigeons gather 'round my feeding hand
Heavy sunlight 
Estrela do oriente nesses mares do sul
Sometimes you don't understand where I'm coming from 
Until you fall asleep then I will go
You'll hear the words He used to say
When was this
Look at the shape I'm in
Always condemning me
Floating Counting clouds They're slowly fading
And I know nothing sweeter than
Mästare och president
I am here for you, if you'd only care
As it was
And the ceiling fan still cuts a lazy circle
And I have been lied to
I can be free on the weekends
We'd lie and rest
They won't see the fire you have lit inside of me
You're my wonderful heaven sent down to me
Mother, mother
You can fall in love with me
Wait 'til we're somewhere closer to the sea
Too many times I've felt
Tearin' up the Beltway
If we don't wake up soon all we ever knew will be gone
Need your hands to show me how to pray
I believe it's not so bad
E una lettera vera di notte falsa di giorno
So long ago, it all meant much more than this
Yah, She's my butterfly
I got a heart that burns with a fever
You've made your mind up
Lost inside amazing colors
If the sky is burning
Looking through the window of your mind
And the birds are building nests in the windowsill
I have this habit of punishing things
I never knew that cupid felt like this
To walk down all the aisles
But I'd never get over you  Oh, No  So
Deep within my heart
So let me whisper in your ear
Beggin' till I'm poor
From corporate exploitment
Stars will shine on you
Will you ever let us carry on
Static when you're gone
All he was trying to do was get away
You know what I mean
There stands a young girl, naked 
Thought love had passed me by
So I slowly slipped away
I'm out on a beach, eating my heart
Yeah, I just stay in my home, in my home, in my home
I hope you find what you're looking for
You possess the power to do
I don't wanna sing at all
Then you take away the starlight
The people behind us staring
When asked know how to find
Couldn't stop myself if I tried
Animal whisperings
I meant you're outta line
Thinkin' 'bout the days, oh
An angel named Gabriel is watching over you
This boy, breezes in from the, South Wells This boy, sees his days in the Middle East This boy, eased his way up the silver turns but what is that this boy deserves, oh he needs love, an everlasting love Give him love Oh give it to him, he needs it now, an everlasting, everlasting, everlasting, everlasting love
You're all I dream of honey
And love is blind, but that I knew when
I'd waste it all on you
I see your face on every corner of every street
I was hiding in the light
And when the floods they come all rushing in
To the mouth of a serpent
But when I called your name you disappeared
True love is a fairy tale
Well it still is and if you stop giving into it
Call me out from the dark, 'cause I'm broken inside
'Cause I can feel your pain, in my bones, in my bones
I think you rewrote my love song
'Cause evil's not my cup of tea
Coming home
The movement comes in slow
As I lean over to ask her
Some things just happen because they have to be
I'll never know the safety of your arms again
If it was my last day if it was my last day here
No one's gonna know I'm gone
Inside your head
Are you needing,
When I'm down
And I was too proud to admit that it was hurtin' me
I've kissed your lips and held your head
Hit Lake Shore, girls go all crazy
Living our dreams
Se as meninas do Leblon
So lately you've been hiding  it was somewhere in the news
Oh, there's the night, oh what a shame
Following your aimless path away from us
But suffice it to say
Only I'm having trouble you see, because he's old and dying
I am the masked rider, give me some grace
I've seen the angels
If you're all done like you said you'd be
We are all plunging straight towards our own decline
You and I could swim beside
Sell it all, tell 'em hell is nothing but a cell wall
Find our ways to, find our way
I'm wasted on you
Your tears have turned the water black
Who needs keys when we've got clubs
For the end is a mystery no one can read
I will let you be
And if I stay lucky then my tongue will stay tied
I've no interest
But in this life
That night her mom said that the two of them, and the now dead guy
We'll have a few too many
When you take, you turn me over
Lovers it curves so freak what you heard
'Cause it ain't easier
So, I'm up for the little white lies
If you search it out it'll make you strong
So I must keep quiet, never giving up all the truth
To take to flight
Tonight cause you give me butterflies inside inside and i
Shock an awful thing to make somebody think
Oh I never wanna go back again
Sailing for the new horizon
And "it's all we need"
I'll help you shovel out my shallow hole
Across the wards as we both dissolve
Like beautiful clouds
Lay yourself in my bed again 
And you'll hear this simple song
No it's in my head
Frightened by my feelings
And the last time he saw Dorie, he didn't know what to say but
gehts oder gehts
Falling for a bad joke, you love to be the fool
But I'm quite alright hiding tonight
Are you who you say you are
Can you fly
What good are songs with no dances
I've never seen a night so long
Killing swans with twentyone guns
All this darkness cannot hurt us
Doomed like Odysseus and the labouring ships
When he kissed me I lost everything
Oh you, you, it's always you, 
Dizem que é ver pra crer
Kai tu mane glostai,
Wanna jump my train
Do the clothes make the man
That was there in the beginning when your daughter wasn't with it, oh yeah
I'll take you back a thousand times again
Yeah heaven
Oh, it rips through the sky
Summertime, and the living is easy
I hide in the corner
So it's different then for everyone
At every occasion, once more, it's called the funeral
You son of a bitch
Yeah, I'll make a wish for you
It's so hard and I don't think we're working out 
Away from the city
I read them tonight
Well I sound alone here on my way home, again when no one is there waiting
How someone who had been so close could be so far away 
Your little world, a little out of place
Satiate my mind
Oh I could not keep a straight face
My last thoughts
And lay my head on your shoulder
I promise I'll reflect it right back at you
A glint of white in the pocket of winter
On the arrow head
I would like to say to you
And the swans are all huddled together
That this navy blue bird was me
I want you up and down
But then again sometimes I get really sweet
You had light in your hands and your eyes closed
She said she want some Ready for the World, some New Edition
And grow a garden out of those
I'd never find
A reckless night, he hears me breathe
I know while this buzzing gotta be ringing in your ear
I wanna be the shops on your high street
When someone gets hurt 
You know you caught their eye
As you lie beside me
Your voice was louder
Blue light of morning palm trees in rows 
I know the feeling of alone
Falls below my heavy breathing
Burning candles in your room,
Has shaped her to what she is today
I love you anyway 
Would like to let go the hurting,
You were the lonely one
Who never believed it would end
Alone down here
Now it makes me sad
There was a good boy inside me
The reflection in the mirror in your hand
When their game made it so oh look alike, look alike
Say you're not around, am I finished
I'm sorry Mary but it's over you took the best out of me
And bleeds you of matter
Do you know any more than I do
I want to write a song about our love
Yeah just lights up in the north
Drank in the people, then came up for air
And you're bending my ear
And me, I need you so
Like a moth on love's bright light
You once knew 
All of my life
Speak to me with your sweet voice
'Cause all these prayers must be going somewhere
Oh, I know
Her features look just like my disguise
You're double rainbows
I'll dance whatever dance you need to dance
Live on the freeway, listen to signs
Let me think, now let me see
Prisonnier de ton enchantement
Children are unheld, I wish love was for sale
I won't give you up love, so fate can have its way
So, I will head out alone, hope for the best
I stand at your gate,
And can't we just pretend
Oh just feel your skin
I'm always so in love, all in
I am you, you are me
Not to do but ride it out
When you're not home
In a little box or a little book to be understood
If I stay right here, than forever with you
She asked the pisspoor "Why you lookin' for that
And I'm thinking about the way things were
Get up and hit up all the hot spots in town
And we swore we'd be best friends
With no command
Angry words that were spoken when I should have wept
A satellite inside me
Long ago I had a dream that quickly faded
I keep my cold eyes locked
And we no longer fear the voices of the brave or bold
And though I write them by the light of day
It's alright
My love oh my dear
Oh, won't let the bastards grind me down 
I am not what I was
Slow it down or speed it up
Especially when I have to watch other people kissing
Go on and fall apart
Strictly biz, she don't play around
Min bror, käre storebror, han
Lift my hand off your thigh and say darlin'
If you wanna try, you could come out and see me
We goners, moving on to
But in a way he gonna stay 
It's a new day
All of the good things, good things
Please don't try so hard to say goodbye
'Cause I never get it unless I'm fed it
You want summer and I'm a Winterheart
ir siechen Tristanden
The captain's just informed us that our plane is going down
Yesterday, yesterday
No, I won't fade away, I won't fade away, I don't fade away
Sailing through the city streets
You can't hold him down
Slows your mind mind mind
With eyes like Abe Lincoln
Ice dripping, cold sweat
Like a river that don't know where it's flowing
And got lost in the sea
Was is it everything you hoped it would be
As the cluttered streets greet me once again
It's battleship grey
Take the poison of your age
And everything's fine
Wherever you may go
You want it to change
This is a story 'bout the three of us
I wonder if you can see me
Winter  the snow, winter moves on
I no longer live like a man in the dark
Noye dusonul saranghae saranghae
Find a quiet place and have a good laugh
Sleight of hand
And these are the bricks that shattered my heart
Don't be scared, don't hide your eyes
And all I can say is you saved me
Her warm kiss is felicity
Who will cast the first stone
I say if the futures been drawn out then nobody's living
So now you know
I'm taking my time, taking it all in
Venezuela, donde estás
Ore di care deum deo | Ore care deum
But I know one day I'll find a new light
You looked so wonderful in your dress
And I know what I must do
You showed us angry
I would babe sing 
The people are pickles for sure
To feed your garden
But whatever you got right now will probably suit me fine
And your arms, are making little circles
But I still miss you
Won't you say my name one time
The world's been waiting, they've been waiting for years
When you just can't sleep
Don't forget
The show is rolling before my eyes
In another town
When you got no life to lose
Jeremy moved to Rome, Italiano style
You wait a couple months then you gon' see
For  years I've been trying to believe and confide in
And I'll sing you to sleep and I'll sing you tomorrow
For the kingdom, the power, the glory, yours
I was so young then
Hated oblivious to your disgrace
I need it in writing to believe
Ne plaisantes pas avec mon art
Thank you Louise 
And the moon is a horny old drunkard
I'm out of lines, girl, we're not getting any smoother than this
What did you see in me
When time wreathed a rose
Forever, and ever
I'm sorry for the way I let go
But I still think of you
If the sun refused to shine, I would still be loving you
Cargo trains rolling by
Don't forget, don't forget
"Black man ain't gonna run
When you feel
Scènes de ménages, manèges Elle déménage, s'allège
And the gentleman is leading her towards the door
"There must be some way out of here"
No wasting time
As they say it is
Hot summer days, rock and roll
She can walk on two feet now, she can go where she wants
I'm on the karma payment plan
When's the last time you baked me a pie
You're gonna be the one I never got that got away
To single out the ones
Won't you let me see the world 
This is taking you away from me
I'll never know what it's like to feel safe again
That you never will deceive me
Put it aside for his family His dream
No need to be sorry
But I must admit it got the best of me
Shaking in waiting for something more
But grace is an acquaintance of mine
Boys are staring and they wait for dances
I thought I might get one more chance
I don't answer the phone
When I give my heart
Ain't it funny, child
In her dreams so she thinks her
Break your day for pay and ration
I've looked everywhere, Mr Forbes
The way that it is in my mind
I love the way you smell
Just don't leave me stranded in your arms
But you like how she sings
I could fly them through your veins
We dance into the rising sun
Their melancholic overtones
You can't fly unless you let yourself fall,
Driedout earth comes to life again to life again
But there's no time, just stitch us up so we'll keep 
I'm not trying to find a way to get in your bed
Dich wieder an Liebe, die du kennst,
Then Hawaii like millions of times before
Into the empty space
And anyway the stars
Changing their shapes on me
Candy told me nothing really matters anymore
With all that I want
I hear you talking a lot of similarities
If it wasn't for the cinema
I don't leave the past behind
Sing your life
Here's a little story to bring a tear to your eye,
None of us forget about who we are
You hold it in your hands
Is the thing I can't help but fear
I sing and drink and sleep on floors
Never thought to ever think twice
Then I want you to have them
Oh, father time
Who wouldn't sing for love
I'm on your side 
Isn't it time
And your sweet clean clothes would go stiff on the line
Crying about his past,
I know a place where we can rest tonight
Know she'll be a part of my life
Making love tooth and nail
Hold me in your arms
So when I was out in the desert
Something in the way she moves
I believed that we would never say goodbye
Pretend there's casters rolling on your feet
The best thing you have had has gone away
It works for you but please 
And there will be a next time
It was way better than getting mean
Two souls intwined in the blink of an eye yeah And I had to figure
To lose your friends
I'm looking for a home in the heart of the country
A wild hope
Your baby's gone, and you're all alone
Have many things to tell me
Caught in the undertow
Let's just say that she never found out
In my dream you're playing with buckets of sand
'Til the last fleeting beat
So strange, you know all my secrets
A strange kind of feeling
And I tell you that some folks don't evolve
But your lottery touch feels lucky enough
With your golden key
I thought I'd found a reason to live
If luck is on my side tonight
Crying cockles and mussels alive alive O
'Til they wrap around your throat
Tearing life crops asunder
Dismayed and fazed and maybe I assay the prize
Now we see everything that's going wrong
As I surrender
I've emailed and I've phoned
Do you think you can find it, yeah better than you had it better than you had it
Sometimes there's nothing left to say
What else could she feel
I am the heat in an empty room
Thru life shun
So much stays unknown till the time has come
When everything fell from out your hands
Women seem wicked
'Cause it's filled with words once spoken
Hey, boy, you can bet it
I need someone who understands
Still don't know if you're near or far
A part of him has died
When I'm walkin' round here dreamin'
She�s got these eyes well where do I start
And a voice so fimilar
I miss those times when things were simple, and your heart was mine
It's a little one sided
It's given us this wonderful wanderlust
Sippin' sweet
Pris au piège par le souffle imminent
Your love for me turned cold
That doesn't mean that we have to part
Don't be shy, umm when it hurts to say
Comfort in the night
I got more TVs in here than where I live
And calm my nerves to look and find
There's plenty of time left tonight,
And they would think that I was he
Birds without wings
You say that the day
Flowers jake the sun afraid I'm blinkin' softly
Go and pester elsewhere, onecent rhymes
The lonely man cries
On a Saturday night
Hey girl now that I got you all alone in my room my room
Cars intersect in the middle of the sky
On the flesh rampage  At your age
You know that when that time comes and nobody is checkin'
Pain, doubt, and rivaling insecurities
When will the water stop I know that you can't say
You'll think there's a place where you made it
Ooh ooh
Oh look there you go again
But have you seen my country skies
En el fondo se me ve cara de no pensar
I feel the breeze
Can't do a thing to stop me now
Of island chains swept with the tide
Et j'ai laissé filler l'hiver
Peace in your heart
On a blade of grass
And the more we move ahead the more we're stuck in rewind
So many things happen while walking
Mom'll find me by the river
I got me some braids and I got me some hoes
Oh you know you had it coming my friend, my friend
Did you feel your elbows tied up side by side
I'd give my last breath before I do
With a wink of your eye,
Hoping you'll stop by
Oh, but then things changed
Sleepwalking, see you talking
Each time you curse at girls
Pretend that you don't care
The city is a million miles away
Open your eyes, belly laugh, fill up my heart
Take your broken heart
And I am like their mother
I miss my lovely mother
I promise one day I'll come back to you
You openly admit
There's no more denying
We're knock, knock, knockin' on the heaven's door
I've got to have your word on this
Some blood stains on your shoes
Just writing little songs to past the time
What a life we chose
Yeah something's got to
And everything I could fit in it
Oh, return
There was something going on that night
It helps to know that you are listening
Fallen in love
I hear the sound of whispering
If I spoke your name
¿quién le va a dar una mano
Nothing but blue skies from now on
Sleigh bells in the air
So we both can pretend
To help you give it up
Cold wet floor
A smile, if you dare
Now her ghost wheels her barrow through streets broad and narrow
Not a subject to control
Back through time, I know
I'll be laughin' all of the way
We'd be better off alone
I want to play you a tune that leaves you marooned and troubled
With the sounds it makes you won't hear it if I call
And everybody was feeling fine
We'll make it last forever There's something in your eyes I see
It's a beautiful world, it's a beautiful world to you
Don't you know it isn't right
So build that wall and build it strong
Changed all the things that have made me 
To get one last look at my baby
And the numbers grow and push you down so low
A mother told me just before she died
Take my hand
So I'll just give until there's nothing else
Unmanned and unvertical
I'm singled out
Go ahead
Behind her was a vision, a painful apparition
Our hands aren't tied now
Oh, we could build an island
in deine Arme zu fallen
About time you lost
The world is waiting to die
Your ties run deep
If God had a name, what would it be
But what I do know, is to us the world is different
There is no one guessing for me
I can'r believe the mess I've caused
You can hide yourself in so many words
Is fakin' every deal that it makes
Where gravity don't bring you down
I can clearly see your face in the crowd
They never say to come home
No I won't forget we're everything I know
Only to find dreams made of sand
Think tonight I'll give him the benefit of the doubt
One last long sigh gone
None of them along the line
As its worst it delights me
And as you turn away, I'm lost, I mess up, as forced
I wanted a puzzle with pieces missing
With your new life your new lover you've found
Tiny tiny vices
Just know that I will end up strangled too
Offer me a love so deep
When you told me to take you walkin' down the street
It's battleship grey outside
I wanna get up
His inflatable passengers of one, two, or three
Ooh ah You make it easier to be ooh ah
The town where she was born
I wash the dishes and I rinsed up the sink
And your word is yet done inbreed us all till we're all the same
You've broken the speed of the sound of loneliness;
When it all fall into places
Bark like a dog
I believe you when you say that you love me;
You'll see a thousand lost goodbyes
With your tender touch
About the moment when we first met that day
And with our song
Everyone has their obsession
I waited in the rain
We were glass
It used to be sit by the window, and stare at what used to be there
You know we've got to find a way
It's future, here's to you
zuo der kemenâten în
Let me dream all my, let me dream all my friends
A good used paperback living bible
You speak the truth, you speak the me
I just need you to know me
They interview the people who were witnesses
And the cattle that you laid down drip on the pavement,
In my opinion there's a bigger plot
If you let them in
Put that cigarette out
Watch me fall apart, watch me fall apart, watch me fall apart
Promoters ain't payin' and bookin you for shows no more
Looks like you'll make that road alone
All the weapons of war we despise
Metal fingers scrape the skies
Come take us high above our time
Oh, could you lead my lips to sigh
Stood on the sand in no water
Yeah, they'll freeze and fall on down
I know it's mean to say
So I'm going island hopping again
No one waits
Don't leave 'em nothing to work on
At me looking at you
Waiting waiting to be comforted
Why can't you just say to me
I kiss you and the sun goes down 
And maybe we'll get lucky and we'll both live again
And put them in the new
So don't you worry I'm completely fine, I'm fine
And fills up with light
You should have known
That you were leaving, absolutely, since the very first day we met
We know that it's probably magic
I'll wait to be forgiven
In a physical way
And I hope you know you'll always be
I see the city through the rain
Love turns 
And I've got more on my mind then I have on my plate
Gets colder day by day, I miss her
Put it on and sing along with you
I'd, I'd like to paint a picture for you
It's easier but I might still be pretending
Were you on my side
And graft my soul upon Your grief
And she's always gone too long
Sexless and comfort in your mind
I'm like the East coast number one playboy B
And you're just some melody
She's crazy as anyone can be,
And though you're gone I remember
Somebody tell her  sshhh
All that shit
Bound like an anchored chain in the sand
There would be nobody if we all stayed all alone
But I've a feeling you won't look at me that way
There's no words for this, I see
Like a trashcan fire in a prison cell
Why are you worried about the dirt
Say my name
Impassable 
All things past in the pickup
I'm caught in the flow of sound
We must always keep dreaming
When life itself is making you old
And I'll wait for it to come,
And to my daddy that passed away
Because when I am drinking I am out of control
We still move to hurt each other
Each road that I walk down
This will take you down
Dans son regard je voyais
Won't tomorrow come
It's like a speeding train is coming,
As the ground raced beneath them thirty thousand feet down 
My neighbors are slowly glowing maroon
Saw it around you taking you on a tour
To give her peace peace peace
I'll know the way back, if you know the way
Everyone, is gonna end, up there,
"It's real," you say, "It's real," you say Yeah, yeah
So we don't know anything
Oh shit, I can't let them see me like this
The dog in the garden road
Why do the stars glow above
Focused on what you feel
And it's time
I will give anything, anytime
And love'll make you give, give, give
I hear your voice and it quiets my mind
His days are long
And it stung my eyes, but I was too stubborn to blink and
No strumming of strings and no stamping of feet
The crowds slowly fade when you come around
All the women discussing what love is like, ooh you know the way I mean
For another twelve lines on this sheet
Can't do a thing to stop me
To go running from love again
People, places
But we still survived 'cause you and I
I built my boat from bamboo but it sunk
Generally we are alone
You're passing me by
We gonna listen to some Teddy Pendergrass Pendergrass
They both look the same, they're overjoyed in this world
Where your shadow blocks the light
Shake your head
Oh lord
I know that darkness before the dawn
My car keys
But this song about you keeps coming out
But I never changed my mind
Passerà anche questa stazione senza far male
These things deceive
Or make it happen now
Feels like I'm fade away
And even if I never do
I need a drive up san francisco bay
I rolled a number last night and walked in my sleep
Your whisper in the breeze
And I said, "Please don't lie to me, Mary"
You see the light
I told you we was gonna get more acquainted
Listen to the rain fallin' day by day
She knowledge by the pound,
If you can use some exotic booze
A symphony of runaways
I don't mind you
And all are drinking from our hearts
Under a lilac tree
Wasting time on someone
He tried to make it clear
Keeping me safe in these chains
She was everything
But I will come home again
Your image did deceive me
But when I die, I hope I live in the sky
Watching landscape roll out 
Knowing that this was forever
I know after a million times you get sick of all my lines,
So, how would it feel
Yes you say life's so unfair
But I bet for the moon
Men dansen tog slut och vart skulle dom gå
Moves with a dead stare
All these thoughts abound my mind
You tryin' to hide your expression from lookin' worried
Visions of better times
And everything I want for us to do
Stood here watching my own death
And this deep secret that hasn't come out yet
But I still chased after you tonight
The music spinning in our head
Just like everybody here
My name is raincheck, and I don't fade away, I don't fade away
Getting wet when the rain goes
What day is this
That you've got to sort through
I can't help you now,
I stand on the beach
Nothing else had a single part to play in my head
My thoughts are many miles away
They never tell you you don't need to be ashamed
And at the end
And all your words are misunderstood
Went from seein' how many bitches I could fit in the truck
Short simple way to reach you
And braking in snow and killing more
But you had me and I loved it
I can't go back the way I came
But know you're mine tonight
You stood still
And a place to hang my head, and convince myself there is no difference
Don't you turn your back on me
So please tell me they're like the rain
To give someone what they need
If they want to
Living like a mobile spinning off its line
In search of home and heart
The first time that you introduced me to your friends
But there you are
To turn you back to you
diz tranc ist iuwer beider tôt
Like a king in his court at his table, who is blind to the power he holds
Really need to say
Set me free, leave me be
Bring me bring me
ei mun oo hyvä olla yksin
Well I could find somebody new
Take their clothes off when they're tipsy
Décoller de mon traversin
Like birds of paradise
The only way from here is down
Makes me want a little sugar in my bowl
And I feel like I've been working overtime, overtime
Always
The saints and angels all agree
Darkness deep and vast
How I miss your heart
And they're swimming around
But I say
New cavity moved into
Like time was on my side I said
And hiding in the strangest pathway
Words mean more at night
Would you take it all back
And sometimes wish your room
It's you and me up against this whole wide world
And I'll write up a calendar for our countdown
These are the tears that we cry
And somehow it just don't works out lately, ooh lately
Is her middle name Cherie, so It's a Secret Cherie, maybe
Oh, in your arms safe from the storms
Then you turn and stop
Shivering and clung to me so tight
nagameru noni 
I'll find your list in a different name
Keep your eyes open for a while
Peace is long been forgot
I'm like a swallow that wants one long last look before flying east
And I will take this sickness and bury it down
Of when we had just started things
No solid ground
See the fool I'll be
On way back home wonders meeting all
At each and every corner
I'll breathe you out
Her head with pounding voices from home
And all the senses rise against this
And it feels like it's tearing me up
Well you have caused
gegen etwas zu sein
Or one more nail in this relationship make it
On the back of the bus
Now turn around and don't be sad
Of that cigarette would it be so bad
Caught a bird and let it go, had a rope and don't you know
Or perhaps he is gone with some other lover, 
Your mouth is watering as you imagine
And rainbows have nothing to hide
They bow down to you whenever you pass
Just a taste for the truth
So now we will rejoice
Light from above the mountain
No universal truth this time
Keep on kissin' me
In your father's garden, that day we did part
I don't know if I should drink or stay at home alone
I'm a fool for that shake in your thighs
You can put away your tool, Jemaine
Will I know if I stay here tomorrow
The sound of water makes her dream
To let you know I'm still alive
There's still time 
Cheques are always passing through
Alone with you
So you're proud to be a good one
With these hands, I will bring to you,
Are you ever gonna come back home
Sixteen years later, here I go
And hung 'round like echoes
Can you more than your Lord's Prayer
But something's changed and I don't know why
And if you need me
And I still owe you
And right over head a great orange mushroom cloud
And I don't listen to a word you say
The bridge disappears, the deer hunt is in the frigid air
Because I'm lost for words
Cover your neighbor, we'll be all right
Invoking the fates
I would'nt blame you if you turned away
Never really thought about it
Bror, säg mig vad som hänt
Means getting passed around
Stay true and sign the cross in you
And my heart held in your hands
Now I know 
To these hands with revolver
This day is getting older in fading light, it's beautiful
You have been my friend
And she was ancient like the Greeks
Things go up things go down
Don't pull the bag over my head 
A house upon a hill with no windows
The more that I know
Leavers always say
I prayed one day
You'd ought to try to live your life on Earth
Oh when you take my hand
With Him we shall be forever blessed
Dear Inspector  don't you know
Pulls me out of my lonely hell
You're along for the ride
Someday I know I'll find a way
Love, I hope we get old
I miss you in my front seat
We can find them somehow
So come on now, come on now, child
Dance the night to pieces
For a little romance and company,
Stop, you make me frown your little town
You didn't give up on me
A girl just like me
On the crossroad to the devil, I'll dwell and I'll count my years
I can be the right reminder at the right time,
I remember once watching her touch her own breasts
But you don't know
If you ever get famous,
That ain't no one's job but mine
It's a beautiful world, it's a beautiful world, to you
If you don't look away I won't look away
I'll get through this if I hang on
And from her headboard, perched so high
Caught up in wind like we were parachutes
When she's gone
And we're swimming around now
It's over, then I can go
Over the bridge and towards the sea
Go ahead and say it
Send my jam down the radio
And I got tired of this little romance,
She came back even from far
But where's the sense in that
I've finally discovered tonight 
In the shadow, under the trees
You need something to blame
So crawl inside my head with me,
I have been waiting for
If I lose track of it, help me find my way back
I said, She's my butterfly butterfly butterfly
Move it up, move it up, move it up, move it up, move it up
My love oh my dear
It's never going to end
So cut below the surface and try hard not to notice
Baby, I find it hard to breath
Oh yeah I saw it in her eyes
I'll Be waiting for you 
Mein Bruder für den mein Vater nie da war
Oh, but now is not the time to face his shame
Sometimes the girl is here
But he was playing on his violin
Where the eyes of your demons are gleamin
Mojique smells the wind that comes from far away
And needing to hide out from my mind
Would never take their place
Ich will dir alles geben
Sailing for the setting sun
Lovers on the landfill,
She said, I can put your mind at ease
And put the shadows
Ever since I was a little girl
Fill my life with pleasure There's something in your eyes I see
She can even move to Kansas City
By your resonating light
My love, my love, my careful love
His father died at 
And the song that I sing is of moonlight
They'll play my music and then they will cry
And some are reaching for reason to hate you
I'm in a car
We repeat forever, forever, yeah
And then leave me alone
Midnight cars roll past
To make them go away
How can you ask about tomorrow;
Would you let me know
I'm coming up only to hold you under
I'm not crying
And the streets are all in tears
You're here just a while
Forget about the world tonight
You never were 
Slow your breath down, just take it slow
Keep your eyes to the ground
All of the lies she tells herself,
My sex turns and claws rush in to spill them
My thoughts at the wrong time
I knew all about treasures
I know it's all up to me,
I don't say prayer for anyone
With two eyes open and two eyes feeling all right
It's okay, it's over now
You know how this shit go
I Don't care
Will I ever dare
Y si me dejas iré más lejos, ya verás
I stepped, I left and I don't regret leaving
But let them think what they want 'cause I know it will never end
Whenever there's a chance
I wonder where you'll be
These reeling emotions they just keep me alive
And a clock on the wall
I don't wanna think at all
Não há ressentimento 
Wondering if where I've been is worth
Trying to find the words to
It makes me mad at truth
Wish that I could stay forever this young
To my conflicted goddess
This boy, thought he had found his girl This boy, ought to have kept that girl This boy, caught up in the wheels of fate, this boy deserves, oh this boy, he needs love, an everlasting love He needs love Oh this boy, he knows, how to feel, the blood in his heart runs strong as , this boy only knows what's real, so give him love, an everlasting love Give him love Oh this boy, he's got a, heart of gold and gold's the most precious thing, you could ever hold and if his heart is made of that, what   be told, just give him love, an everlasting love Give him love
And maybe someday we will find
It is wonderful
I tiptoe across the squeaky floor
But I won't bow or take the world as you would hand it down
'Cause I saw the end, before we'd begun
And a voice calls out the numbers, and it sometimes mentions mine
You know they all have a lot to learn
Depois de tudo que não for passar 
They would shine just like the sun 
I watched them go 'round and 'round
Okok, all right all right, just fine just fine
With the sea in our ears
I held out my hand as if she'd never pushed it away
Show the trail of my love and I
Oh yeah, take it back to the old school, let's go
Far away we'd roam
Sometimes it's easy
In den Bergen liegt ein Tal
Am I something you despise
If there were no words
I'll hold each day
Inert flesh
Water may stop warmth, this do not forget
Um den Sohn meines Vaters endlich kennenzulernen
Reef and Matty C offered me a little money
With the radio and the late show
You're more than I could ever repay
I know more about this man
And rounding out will come
You and I, truth and lies
You took the air, you took the time
Cause somethings are better kept
Played by the gate at the foot of the garden
I've lived alone
You fell in love with a broken heart 
The things we know won't last
Frequency so low held on a string
Clouding the truth, both of us knew
I'll take every moment, I know that I own them
But oh no, no I see them falling
Major weed smoke in the air
A chilly wind is still blowing
It's greater than what's bought and then sold on the shelf
No, I don't fade away, I don't fade away, I don't fade away
Hold fast to the break of day light where
I've got points of icicles
But I turn back when I see where you go
I caught your eye with a camera's flash
My weapons left by the bedside, I
I'm talking about the first lady
Can't look below me, or something will throw me
'Cause I'm not that kind of whore
They just sit back and they watch TV
I can't tell where the journey will end
How can I think of tomorrow
And walked around the mall with his radio face off
Unless some hounds
I want to see what you're made of, see what you're made of
Join your arms across our nations
Better learn the difference between church and pray
And it's funny how time
There's never been bad, there has always been truth,
Darlin' please don't
You're always gettin' curious and leavin' town
You wrote "Charlie and Mary for forever"
And talk about how the love never dies
When everybody says no, no, no,
And the empty space
Look over here
Well maybe that's true 
I was young, I was surviving the times
Now you just say, "Oh Romeo, yeah, you know I used to have a scene with him"
Neither will admit we both just wanna say
This is not ecstasy, but it's better than cocaine
When a drunk girl awoke me on the train
Horren indartsuak
Heard his song up in the blue 
Rotten pulp inside and never well
How very close you were
A junkie's song, a dancer's knees
Beautiful, tragedy of who I was
How much of the day will I watch fade away
When it's over
You need not to cross the sea
Excuse me did she say
I just can't help it don't know why
Retrieve unconscious, made conscious out of the darkness
I need your words of wisdom
It's all over your face
I still have schizophrenic conversations
It could all end tonight
You can't get them back again
I got hurt feelings, I got hurt feelings
Let me carry you beside
Black Chuckas, black skullies, leather PellePelle
Closed off and broken
His only son is only 
When I touch you there's words on your body
I curse at the windstorms that October brings
Don't you walk away from me
Wanna know how it tastes for real
Before you came around
Turning and dreaming and scared
But somehow you let yourself in
Now your car's been towed
Their dreams with falling colors
And landed back home in a garden of green
Curse you, when it's our turn, so come now wash your face
Don't you go and, let the world weigh you down
A one night stand
Deep in my heart, I will remember you
David Letterman, even said he like that track man
Nude as the news, nude as the news
Will be laughed at the way you're laughed at now
The sight that holds my eyes
When you're praying for too much
Just another grey autumn day
The meaning of good love
If you have any doubts of what my love is about
And your vision is clear while you blind your own kind in a curtain of fear, your words twisted skywards distracted by stars
No point in asking 'cause I always dance alone
You know you robbed me of my sight, and light is what I fear 
Love come quickly
Go now on your high feet
No need, at all
Gonna be the beauty of County Galway
If your dreaming ever wakes you
You want me too, don't you
enardecida, me congelaba y me iba
For lovin' what was you
As we are to the world but I guess you would know that
Mirth growing less
Of God and Lucifer, a boy and girl
Chop down the cherry trees on Mango Street
It was the rocks you liked 
I'm outdated, overrated
She awakes
There's my point
That night you played me �Lit Parade
You had to drink to stay alive
Circling us as if they knew
With me all the time
When he found that bed so easily
Jungle growing anxious with the deep and primal
I won't mind
Though we may be miles apart
The sun will rise up, and I will wise up
And I want you to know that you'll always get your way
And cross sidewalks with an earful of white noise
Whatever it is, whatever it is
I took to the desert with your harshest words and they saved me
Now you lay alone 
You're all I need, my love, my Valentine
I am a mountain out of reach
Feeling my way through the darkness
Now I want to be free
Haul away for home 
In our hearts and in our minds
Can't believe the mess I've caused
We question of this hatred as we sacrifice 
I feel at home here in the middle of nowhere
So don't you go and let the world bring you down
Who I wanted to be walking next to
'Cause this life is anything but certain
To spend your time and pray
It is so wonderful
Sometimes you plague my mind a million times
Fish in the sea, you know how I feel
My foot in one the plug
The whole world round
We make it worse when we don't bleed
How could we be so right 
You know our love is stronger than pride oh
All the times I thought to reach up
Just come inside where it's okay
When you see them hoes, little homie, drive slow
Then he'll stay with me
It was five o'clock 'cause I checked my watch
En ehkä tiedä mitä tehdä
Try and start again
Try to manipulate your point of view,
So you can call me what you want 
Who let you eat in my face
Hands you a love only
It wasn't clever
Liars and fools, sons and failures
I recall, a time when I knew it all
Do you not cast a shadow
This black hawk can't find its place
Sometimes
If you lay your money down
That they're gonna throw it back to you
What is there left to say
I can't believe the state I'm in
Says something like, "You and me babe, how about it"
There is nothing left you can say, just get me get me
"Leave me alone," I wept to the Hobo;
Imagine a staircase standing in front of you
My eyes, my eyes
It's so beautiful to me, it's everything I see
"Ven corriendo con tu mamá , una tormenta se va a largar
So that you don't get bored
But once in a while
Those cards in sequence
Know 'bout all your hurt and fears
'Til we die we'll never be broken, we won't be denied
Ooh, man ooh, hey get over you, hey get over you
Now you think you're wiser because you're older
Right from the start
And love, it isn't love until it's past
I drove my car on June th
Sunshine smiles  even when it rains
I want you here with me
And if we died right now
And when the night is falling
I still feel love for you
Picking the straw from our clothes
And the feeling isn't even my time
I just wanna touch and kiss and I wish that I could be with you
I feel sure that they will
Girl I know you want this
Please stay
The roads wind towards windward side
Kickball games behind the school
And every kiss is a goodbye
Jonka jälkeen ei jää enää mitään puuttumaan
Or if you haven't one, rest in my arms
I want you inside out
Except out real slow
Sotto karada ni nagareru 
'Cause I know that it pains if he's gone every time he move over on the shoulder you crying
Well, don' you know me
If you feel you've paid the price
The darkest light before a darker night
It's harder than I thought
We'll grow old and lose our hair
My wedding ring 
Jesus the Mexican boy born in a truck on the th of July
It's just full of thoughts that act as souvenirs
And went for the sky
Dancing 'round
That look on your face
That I tend bury into you
The bulging eyes and the twisted mouth
Than what we're living for
You're a fashion tip, a living museum
How life goes on the way it does
Tomorrow we'll be watching a sad sea and star bound, sailing the wind
Just when you feel that
Sag mal, hast du das gesehen,
Don't know what I'm doing this time around
Your friends only like themselves in photographs
A kind of weight you couldn't lift
While the children sleep
Hand me your head 
Even when you are dreaming
No way out for you and me
Can I ask where you are tonight
All the cries of thirsty children
No need to breakdown
I thought we had a moment
You with the sad eyes
I had a vision of this place
'Cause it's hard to say what you've got
Girl, if it's done right
And every day is just the same
Hold together all these memories
Now he's just a mean old bastard
Hard to believe how people move
As long as I'm not aware of change
I've never been too good a change
'Cause how much
And then it's gone, so you get up
You can point fingers all you want
We're all out of time, this is how we find how it all unwinds
So I can use you for your energy
So cold were the days when I listened to you
The way the others do
In a simple border song 
Holding our breath
And barely heard
So breathe while you're alive
We're speeding into the dark
She made it rain
Waiting for the birds to come 
For free
No I don't think we should wait x
It's all I know
And I'm all covered up
See those rings on her toes
Out of my way, Berlin to LA
Why does she fly alone
Of our love and trust
A past so strong
I need you close to sing
On the shores of sorrow where the waves of hope crash in
But I'm getting something
I know it's gonna take some time
See me wave good, bye forever
But I couldn't get it right, no I couldn't get it right
Elle a mal et tu ne reviendras pas
Die Riemen rum
I never knew I could feel so alive
Actually in the drifting white snow
And this is me it's my life
Waiting in my room and I lock the door
And how it lost me all I wanted
Sometimes the good life wears thin
Went down for the company
Baby my heart and soul
All these thoughts that fill my head
Oh my army of lovers
Maybe it's time, maybe it's me
We miss you when you're gone
He bites his fingernails
Time will always slip through 
Outside, under, a road
To set light to me surprising day,
The drying wind
It's pollution only turns it to
I played Ready for the World, she was ready for some action
Nothing will be the same
I get tangled in the dark
Way too long since
Baby, you'll always be in my orbit
And now I stole the moon
It's what the broken hearteddo
There's so many things that I can do
But, we all welcome change
It doesn't we're not still sad
As we relive the best times of our lives
I'd hold you all close and take you with me
It's wonderful, no it's wonderful with you 
Ooh and the waves are going out
I hear a difference in your voice,
And finding something else to say,
Körde mig till ett kontor
You're going to break down and cry
Everyone wants body counts and I just want to cry
Light will fill our eyes like cats
Goodbye 
The more anxious that you get 
Well I held you with our undry eyes
You come to me at midnight and say, 'It's dark in here' 
With enough ambition and a firm set of rules you can have anything you want
Du bringst mir tausend Wonnen
From London Town I wave goodbye
And this ain't no time for uncertainty
Now, picturing a scene
They're driven by a strange desire
Take that away from me and my life is butt naked
And the smoke smelled like my past
May I say I loved you more
You dance like you've got
To be a good husband and care for your kids
Over and over and over and over again now
Till the night I held you
As the sky spills through our mouths
Don't you let me know
Before our bones become
Believe me, you do
Of your body next to mine
A lone pair of watchful eyes
Perdido num planeta abandonado
I just need you to know me
The early mornin' final edition's on the stands
And one by one the ships descended to the sand
Nichts ist wie es war,
You make it easy ooh ah
Smile, please smile
If you walk out the door
And kiss you when you start your day
And in a rare and lucid state
Please let me bring my man
Over and over again x
But if I had one wish fulfilled tonight
You say that you're still not free
And I must remember you can't seem to
Face down
No chains can hold me, no walls confine me
And all your pain just turns into relief
I just like to make you see that
Like droplets of doubt from yesterday
I don't know when
And you waste more perfect time than you tend to give
And we may not know the reason why
Siren fools no one but still she will sing
And all along baby it was understood
You decide what you're used for,
Ah You, you got a beautiful reason
Baby, you'll know what to do
Empathy and sympathy are sisters,
Showered and covered
From the right to the wrong settle
So I'm off on the road
I'm looking everywhere I go
Act like kids in love when the sun goes down
Down by the seashore
Och nätterna han varit borta
I've loved without loss, I've put down my cross
I wander through this world
That borders your back yard
I'm not a helping hand
An eternal resting place
Wander the great indoors
My work's won kiddie competitions
Nobody compliments the meal
Oh, into the dark
With all her heart and darkening door
Above the end of the street,
Don't need prophets or preachers
When the train was delayed
That you're drowned in despair
Last thing I remember is the freezing cold
Let your thoughts come in
Turn me grey
But I let the sandcastles kill my mind
And it burns but it turns out golden
What you want from me,
You know blow job need an application, eating pussy make appetite
Head for the sun in your belly
Say my name, say my name
Seems like it always seems
Ah but you did slip 
But now you're giving advice
Oh I clear a space in his fathers land
Do you know where the end is
But in our town there's just one stoplight
I notice this vaguely
The master races, the chosen people
Some are lovers
And how my thoughts they spin me 'round
So maybe you're all in love
There is no one left for me
Feel like crying
If only the morning would come and the world would be old and wise
No, you don't owe them anything
While I find a way
An emerald ring, a photograph
But I just got to know
You'll ask me to pray for rain
I'm dating ancient ghosts
You look around each corner
Sail through the crimson skies
But I can't let go of what's in front of me here
But it was only the start
Even though nothing was the same
Let's not be sore, that's not right that is where you'll find me
We're running out of gas
Be patient like a rainbow
Yeah, we'll suffer for nothing and we'll never forgive
And my chin in my hand
Left behind everything I knew
In lines as long as country miles
With this gentle sting between us
You hold up a sign that reads "Follow me", follow me
I've been avoiding commitment
The window is broken out and the interstate is far
I am your state of mind
Laid on your shoulders
Truly I do love you
Never saw the sun shining so bright
You can walk right out into the world and capture and kill god
The dysfunctional bastards of the Ronald Reagan Era
The sadness that comes in the night times will fade away
The image is cracked but so is the view here
Everything's permitted, nothing's really true
Been scolded for stealing
Our treachery is love, dear
But don't waste time
Do they know who we are
I forget but I won't feel bad about it
Look around maybe buy a new topcoat
In faroff lands on distant shores, so many friends to meet
Diane I don't say it but I know you know
Why give up our lives to the brutes and fools
Somewhere in the wasteland of your head
I want you to have them
It's terrific how the day after day hurts
Tonight I won't say tonight it's ok
If Jesus comes to take your hand I won't let go, I won't let go
My worth is the look in your eyes
But my coat's kind 
Blizzard, blizzard, blizzard, blizzard
I'm a crooked soul trying to stay up straight
You felt it so strong, but nothing's turned out how you want it
If someone came to love her
Wind down, wind down and relax
I know low and I know fear
Always be
She'll disappear before the night ends
I mean after all the things we got into
To make me strong
Running down the hill
Is never going to mend
I hear voices, and then the whisper comes
I need guidance on the river
You must fly closer to the sea"
I'd want to hear you say
To soulfully be one with your creation
For you around the bend
I know myself so well
You're the one who took me home
And hold the earth in place
War is over, I recover 
And bear all my shame
Thank you for the hours
A part of your soul ties you to the next world
Everything I think I need here on the ground
I'm done
J'suis restée prostrée dans le noir
I can't help thinking so much about
They look up to the stars and wonder where You might be
Forgive me if I admit that I'd love to love you
For Twilight has come
Come as you please, do as you may
Left him with a little somethin', sixteen he was stuntin'
We started with a promise built on highs
But every journey just leads me so far away
And as for the clouds
Where the stifling heat overpowers the air conditioning
When they had the chance
Move Don't hold back, my dance devotion
Friends can break your heart too, and
You made me feel like I belong
And it will glimmer like starlight
And all the little things you do
And I called you back to a place beside me
Our only choice was to swallow pride
People can do the most amazing of things
Scold me, that's all you've got to say
OK, I'm a bit intoxicated, but really I just graduated
Your heart's against my chest
It's gonna be a bright, bright sunshiny day
Take my hand, you're treading water 
Hallelujah's in the night
It left broken and bare
About a couple on the run
It's only human to wonder how
You better get real, real, real and realise that the situation is going nowhere
You're like a child that cries
Kind woman, I give you my all
You're like a star that dies
I fly away from these evil voices
And now that's it's over, I'll never be sober
Controlled by just my hand
I just need you to know
Even though you know
Far from the shadows that's haunting my day
Stack up the chairs, roll up the rug
Holding on and still waiting for that windfall
Set aside
We're just people living
Without a thought, without saying no
Still it's uncomfortably near
Sometimes I feel so bad
I realise if you were mine
In the end they are the ones
In these modern times, what your first class said
And tears like dreams can be
If your fortune ever fails you
To a place where you don't know which road to choose
I may be gone but never out of reach
There's so much time, to figure out the rest of my life
I try to see your point of view
You think the world is trying to bring you down
Want right away
diesen langen Weg nach Hause
Virginia moon
Setting the pace of our stride
I guess you never really tried
It's time to be with somebody else
Earthbound
Thank you for leading me home that I 
Smokey Robinson, Smokey Robinson
You don't have to be alone
Squints while he's showing emotion he normally won't
To give all the things that you've given to me back
Everyone's hiding their tears
The butcher walks home
Of this new emotion
Because it's only the start
I've driven
My hands are tied and I can't find my feet
If it keeps the love away too
And all you gotta do is not answer my calls when
Who told you you could get on this stage
Darling tell me, what's on your mind What you thinking
son las sombras y el calor
To catch one tiny fly
But you can't help how bloodlines slip
All we want to do is have a good time
There are colour explosions
Take me back to the days we played
More luck than good judgment
The reason why is hidden in our eyes
Deer in the headlights, there goes a weaker one
And if it's about where we're heading, 
Rendesvouz where to my place, say  & we can do anything you wanna do
Trembling noises that come to soon
I want to know if you were faking
If so much of me lies in your eyes
I sang old songs from nowhere
Softly, children
Sunlight pours in
Come what may
If you hold me in your warm hand 
And they've given you a reason to fight
Temaneku oasis on the distant horizon
You want to follow me tonight
Tracy died soon after a long fought civil war,
So no one else can have you when it ends
It was swift, it was just another way of a miracle, but no one, nothing at all, will go for the kill
I want a girl who laughs for no one else
Passed off an open glare
Somebody told me
Haunted all this time
And you mail yourself right inside
If I'd been a dreamer, I would float away and not care
I'll see you back tonight where painters
The waitress
Nothing else matters at all
All of the reasons why
When all the waves and oceans rise
An ancient feeling love
Fast when it comes to the gas
I always knew you in your mothers arms
No one, nobody can love you more,
Will I know I won't be just fine
ist der Erfolg nur Jonglage
Then why can't we tell people how we feel'
Speak to me with your sweet voice
And name
Where the words jump off my pen and into your pages
Because I still exist in spite of you
But when the noises overwhelm me
Been a million to one 
Sticking our thumbs in the air
Staying young forever
No words could explain, no actions determine
I had such a night
Why does she fly alone
But nothing like my hometown I'm forever living
With what was left of our fair city
Forgive me, I've created a monster
Ah, la, la, la, life is wonderful
Before this love affair began
Driving with my friends, yes
Your kisses ring
Falling in love with the prettiest sound 
She kissed the world goodbye
Ate their complimentary shrimp cocktail
Will you go ahead to the Aventine
You know how it can go
Enslave the native tongue
Om vi nån gång, nånsin blir som dom
Your true colors, true colors
Whatever it is I do, I try to think about you
Bring you back to the bar Get you out of the cold
All the stupid things we say
Hang it up now or never Hang it up now or never
I ain't running away from my mind this time
Hoist a new flag
Moved silently along the dusty boulevard
'Cause I believe in silence, our hearts speak the same word
I long for solitude and peace within me
Up till the sun rises
Fought in places
While her children fears
So put your faith in a late night show
Whole life ahead of her
Of your hand, child of mine
Knock, knock, knockin' on the heaven's door
Live outside the law boys doing what to do
In the darkness I will meet my creators
Some men call me Cain
Come into your room 
It seems so far, but it never is
With the girls a lot of flirtin' involved, but dog
But the strain was too much
You gently nourish my dry skin
I didn't know I was lost
Dearest constellation
Grandfathers, nephews, cousins, uncles, fathers, and sons
Chase me down with your knife
Silent from a night so cold
We were here to sing
You're the crudest oil, let your vision boil,
With the ghost that was there
'Cause the city ain't kind
And I second guess what you don't doubt
Dark, spilling universe
It makes no difference, wrong or right
Bring your loving, smiling, face over
And I held on brightly, crushing quietly
The streets are all narrow
Say hello to all the apples on the ground
Standing at your door
Happy to see it says nothing about us
My funny Valentine
When I got prices on my head, feds rushin' my spot
Leave out nothing, tell me everything
They can disappoint you if you see through their perfect smiles
With these waves crashing over my head
When the rest of the world
You deserve more than nothing
Spring appears bent and unaware
Peaceful nights, strangers at the door,
Are the things that make you blow Hold your own, know your name
Suspicious corpse without a face
Feel your mind and body
Whose day is this
I wanna walk through the morning
Strange and lovely facts for us
When you expect flutes it's whistles
Oh, grieving sky
And man, did I lose you
I left him outside in the cold
And everybody she knew was gonna get the twist
Was you to want me
You will fall in love with the very first man you meet"
And when I look in the mirror I feel dead, I feel cold
And as I breathe it in
Oh the sound of distant carnival drums
She is over here
So you killed more precious lives then you had let live
Now I'm not a saint, but I'm not a sinner 
Used to wear a suit to work
I guess I'll try again tomorrow
No one else, yeah
What has yet to come
I'm damaged, as I'm sure you know
I've been starting fights
He's listenin' in the fast gaze, I don't care now to see the way
I trust that I will get what I've been hoping, waiting for
To spend my youthful days 
I've been one in a million 
You and I, in clouds of ecstasy
But on the left she had a mirrored image of the same female
Though we're worlds apart
I followed with the sideshows to another town
Shh, now hush, as you're dreaming
If I call on very soul on the land, on the moon
Guess I'll take my chances
In the light of a golden calf
So when the stars look bright above me,
Mimi lives in Hamburg, that fishy harbour breeze
If we don't wake up soon this burden will be long
Speak to me with your soft voice
Och fullmånen lyser som var den av glas
This Rubbermaid's had better days
On every boy and every girl
Here and gone
Put it to the back of your mind
The best friend I had in Tremell, I lost that
Steady and in control
I'm swaggin', I'm swaggin', I'm swaggin' oh ooh
And I can't stop this rain
And have the pleasure of saying what you mean
Looking kind of anxious in your crossarmed stance
Play the game
And oh my papa
When you said I'm lost, but there's still time
You spent the night with me
Whoever you think is watching you dance
From the innermost secrets we hide
Who's gonna save me when the sky is crashing down
The naming of killer boy
So come on, tell me, is this the end
Was to wipe her tears away
It's never made it all the way from shore to shore, from west to east
Proceeded to arrange your soul while I prayed on my knees
Goodbye,
Aus dem Traum den ich verlor
And I can feel your pain, deep in my bones, deep in my bones
She had some trouble with herself
I can't turn the other cheek
It's come in time to face the truth
City sky reflects the silver street below,
"Gold'ne Nase" heißt sie auf der Szene
Gone gone gone in a dying meadow
Still I've got cobblestone joints and plate glass points
"Follow your heart", he said 
Gone forever, the writing on the wall
And if one of us makes it big
I lost the plot underneath the fire
It shows, it shows, it shows,
Until you're walking down the isle and she takes away your smile
Every kiss she gives away, might be a good time,
Show me an ocean
It's not easy, she would say
Sleeping on a bed
There is no fortune to be made here
Says, "Girlie girlie, you're at your best you're at your best when you're sober"
Our hearts too exposed, the air too thin
My animus was lost, I found when I looked back in time
I'm feeling dizzy
Could never have had too many of these
und wir sind echt
Stop moping the rain's gonna rain through
I watch the window and listen for the sound of cars
For a job in the fruit trees
In this concrete world around you
I know it all
Makin' you cry
Do your thing and sing the world is yours
There's a pressure to deliver here, your gonna get hurt if you don't play this game
She always belonged to someone else
Through the crowded streets into the fading grey
I'm drunk and so is everyone else
Not knowing knowledge never ennobles
Das ist das Schicksal von dir und mir
And love was breaking your heart
Sometimes that's all I need
Or if you want to find somebody else that's better
All that really matters now to me is that I could set you free
Inside his eyes
And do it Whatever it is, whatever it is,
Where the bars are filled with people
Your body broke your fall 
The angel rides by humpin' his hunk metal whore
Somewhere fear has no place
Molotovs
Closing my eyes to feel the warmth come back
But You are the strength I hold onto now
For our lives to end quite yet
Please let me go back again
Under the nails of a workin' man
Oh, I'm faint with fear
But I'm overjoyed and it's no surprise
But it's all in the mind when you cannot see in the eyes
And I'd whisper that I love you
He would come again
I realize I've been unfair to you
I'm glad we were able to talk about her vice and her evils
Disappear within my mind
That you should go on and kiss it, just a little bit Just a little bit
Die Haut so zart und weiß
I woke from a dream last night
Put that radio down
For the things you've done
All the fear and all the cares of the world
When the motion fails for the very first time
Hang it up now or never
No need to argue
One of these days
I need someone much more
Falling in love and going into the red 
Take the road that leads to mine
Yes they matter write her quite a few
Desnuda o mineral
Peace, hateful tongues
So just focus on the light
I'll bail you out again, I've got the readies
Just takes you further down
Streets are uneven
The stars begin their Busby Berkeley dance
To the sound of water moving
I've never taken the fall for deceit
But I got a feeling that makes me wanna ignore all
Can this be love
Konu tvöföld var sú synd hans sgaði hans
We'll always be up late
I was when we met
How would it be to love and feel everything's the same
I wanna be an astronaut and get high
Strangers together, your hand in mind
Take me back to the days gone by
Trying to keep you and Paris on my mind
She bared all her teeth and she moaned
Whilst the snowflakes covered
Having my moment, you know what I mean
It may be the faded photograph, but I know you care, don't hide
From Las Vegas to right here
I wish I Knew
I wait
Und im Garten blüht die Illusion, das kenn' ich schon
And then you wait for winter
What kept your world spinning
So now it limps and counts the hours
Never considers your dreams, selfish and mean
Come and wash me clean a nervous step into the future
I will get burned each and every night
I didn't know what to say
Get used to the feeling
Have a will so weak with a mind so strong
I need it so much
It's ringing harder than the bells do
The light's on in the window; she's waiting by the phone 
Run, run, 'cause you're not too cool
And all she ever wanted
Whatever you see
You'll never know until you try
Can't do a thing to stop me Dream
Cause all that you are is all that I'll ever need
Everything's going west nothing's going east, straighten
Where I remember everything you want me to forget
I've tried to care
But I feel that you're still near
The crazy days, city lights
And then I can come back to the harbour
Yes, we gotta be seen to be playing the game
Sing it loud and clear, I'll always be waitin' for you
Christ glorious entwined
He calls so late tonight, it is  am
My time, I gotta tie shoestrings, life's a trip when you want these things
Well, Honey, I'm flexible Oh, yeah
Is this feeling you
We'd ride our bikes
I know we're all different
How can we ask for a blanket and a habitat
Flying over bus stops and playgrounds
I know you think that you know me
So thank you, my brother,
That I clutched you in my arms
Waking to these sounds again
But wise men never fall in love, so how are they to know
I'm getting taken under
Yeah the words are dead
I've said goodnight tonight
Is anyone alive x
So lay back, and let me massage you, everywhere now
﻿Oh, but if I don't do it, you know somebody else will
The tiniest of things are forever
You run away
I'll always keep this secret
When I know why we're here
White lined and tarred
La señora lo lleva a todas partes con ella
The water's clear
Push the little baby down the spiral stairs
Now you can find peace at last
If I would believe I don't need
One moment there
I can't go back
We were as one
With my eyes on the prize
And as they all grow older the truth will be understood,
Then it all just falls apart
Nighttime at the boulevard
With a calm, calm, calm, calm fear
I work at the altar, I try to be good
Did you gaze upon the waves and did you consider yourself
"If you love her let her go
I've got your words in me
And that was then and she is now, I once was lost with her
There's too many kings
To remind me of how it used to be
Der ist unendlich viel mehr wert,
Not to say I'm right
When you're unwanted
So I go home to my
That's what I'm saying
If you knew now what you knew then
And that's the way
Your skin and the sky light
Hawaiian sunset peeping from the sea
On some bright tomorrow they'll all come true
It's okay  this'll help, inside
You said at least a song will come out of it
'Cause when you're left with nothing, there's nothing left to lose
To keep you close
All remains are in safe keeping
I know I may be dreaming
I was born in 
Speaking in Spanish making the rounds
But, but now I need you to do it faster baby
To see your true colors, and that's why I love you
But the taste is sweet
Lives in my town
The start of the journey
I know I'm in love
Back then, she was like the star in the movie
'Cause it seems all right,
I'm here to make you happy, I'm here to see you smile
Do it now, girl
I might as well stand in front of a bullet
It's gonna pass
Solitude sails on a wave of forgiveness
Want to know what's happening
But most niggaz don't, and they whole life hurried
Moments last and lifetimes are lost in a day
I'll see you on the road
Nonobody knows,
I know the place you left
Here I go, look at me run
Or hum at least I have heard one
So much to rescue so much you just can't understand
y a remplazar palabras por miradas 
Time passed and that was that
You'd be my sun; you'd be my light
And if you wanna let go it's okay
There lies a lady, she's gone and she's gone
That it's only a dream
Take away the way to ease the pain
If this is what they want
It was darker than English moss, green like the soft frills of a peacock's plume
Some make exhaustion a mode of expression
Many miles away from everything that I hold dear
Give me shelter, or show me heart
So I'll sing a melody
We'll never be this young again
If it wasn't for you, don't know what I'd do
In times of trouble, your words have helped pull me through
But I need his heart
My eyes would become so engaged
I stand, and I wait
Darling kings Of the highway We will be
'Til I was back in your arms again
Feel you like the last beautiful touch before a final rest
Says I, my pretty fair maid, wont you come with me,
And I failed to see your love
That this love could be
Where originates all the pain that leaves
Everything is fine in the end
Oh, I wish you knew the deal, gotta learn from far away
Seems I did something right
'Cause I am fragile
You can't use a bulldozer
You keep the children down
That we're all that we got
People walkin' on top of the sea
When the time will be gone
And you think that she must be the one
Maybe I'll walk the line
That the flesh had long since left just as the people left their homes,
Quem sabe com ela eu teria achado
I never said
And if I happen to fall
And both shall row my love and I
I'll be at your place in ten
Soon they'll dismantle them 
I see your eyes
I just want to go out
Underneath stormy skies
What's up baby there's alot of things I want you ta learn about me
And their burning in your eyes
We've been waiting too long
C'mon
Now Kanye, I know I told you to slow it, down baby
And there'd be sand in your pockets and nothing on your mind
And I didn't care for you
In your eyes I see a darkness that torments you
Baby, can't you see if there is such a thing
I just don't understand how you could throw it all away
Ghosts in the air that we breath
This day
Give me back my sadness
I'm not that graceful like you
I'm a fool for you love
Two sides, simple as that
'Cause I'm so used to living underneath the surface
They knew you fought but they never thought you'd fall
That I swore was everything but beautiful
Truth no lies, tears and smiles are locked in our eyes
I believe in the power
After telling her swallowing stories
Now she's waiting at the stoplights
All these feelings won"
And the snow is drifting
Red hair and blue eyes
So we wait for this to happen
When all is said and done I will love you
"Stories of cold," I smiled at the Hobo;
My words are frozen
Please don't be upset my darling, please don't get upset
Once you filled my hands with roses
They tell me I'm too young to understand
We can forget all this
Something in the way she moves Whoa, in the way she moves
Regina Spektor I was hoping you could keep me company for the ride home, but it's okay if you're sleeping
On rivers of ribbon and sailboats of song
We can never fall
I can fly
From a sea of discontent
Maybe you understand that, city bird
Passed country lines and interstate signs
We all want to have some faith,
It's a long way to haul
I don't know, don't know
It's not high finance, it's called heart and soul
Something I have learned
Be fighting for no reason
Freedom, to prisoner, to freedom
Remember this time, this room
And it just won't let me up
And it looks like the end
Vaan niin että tunnen sinut  But so that I feel you
I'm getting sick of everything
Watching the lake turn the sky into bluegreen smoke 
So let it break the magic beauty of your fragile mind
And even though we stopped worrying,
In need of a substance to steady my hands
Just keep your eyes to the ground
In a world of fading sadness
Like a tide
I'm all out of hope
A heavenly breeze, kiss in the trees
Can't trust just anyone
And so you know, everywhere I roam
It longs for me, and someday we
I've got a girlfriend out of the city
She said " I can't believe I've found
A selfish life
Jackson, Jesse, I've got a son in me
But don't say there is no way
How such a girl could dig a hole so deep
I'd like to rip you out of your skin
Hair swept out into the water,
To make it through each day you tried
The fact's uncomfortably clear
What if we were meant to be together
So don't rely on the starry skies
Nothing to run from
So over this
She stares as they fade out of view
Listening to the sound
I was wrong, so wrong
Never could apologize 'cause you died, that's why they say that
You've been going out of way to agree
The shadow I cast only grows, largest just right before
I thought that you were wise, but you were otherwise
Open up your heart
Then fell asleep under a tree
Does the pain outweigh the blessing
Are the details in the fabric Hold your own, know your name
It's just two of us here, or maybe just a few more
See the nightbird softly fly
Stronger than the sun
My, way home
Cover the floor same as be fore 
I noticed the hair on her head that's not real
I work all day and I wanna fight
This is the last time
Buy into quickerfix emotion
Sings a slow slow song
Oh why does hate bring forth more hate
Oh, was it all right, or was it okay
Please let me make amends
Laugh at every line
You're right,
All my folk who ain't survive, may they live in the sky
Looked in the bathroom stall 
If you can't sleep at all
Come in and slit him, I've got tokens
Like they're trying to prove it won't fall out
Warped door, embassy no  ashtray we would conceal ourselves in the missing light till darkness fell I awoke, ran downstairs
Put down your weapons and choose
And remember what your mother said
Que não vão entender
Breathe my love, get high
The writing on the wall at North Point
Know every part home 
Somebody's bed will never be warm again,
Just give right in, don't try to fight
That shines brightly
He'll be sailing 'cross the ocean,
Still I go to the deepest grave, 
No one forever young
So if separate ways we go
We never die
Yeah, you're still a long way from home
We're coming down to land tonight
They look so high
Let your hard luck end and make it new
You missed when time and life shook hands and said goodbye
But I am free
You used to open up and share your world
Picket lines and picket signs
I can be the right notion in the meantime,
But it's the truth so you might as well hear it
Of all the love that comes apart
And I've had a good time, have you had a good time
With my innocent hand on my heart
Remember where we started out 
I'm your friend 
y fue por ti que escribí más de cien canciones 
No, it's the promise of a better place
And so, you see, I have come to doubt
könntest du hier verweilen
When you look that serious
For if the dark returns then my brothers will die
Er wollte ein Haus bauen mit einem Zimmer für mich
To conclude our love affair
Beth Orton and Terry Callier
And for once in his life, it was quiet
And down she goes
Well if you're not married, say your lover's name
My love, wherever you are
Except for just a dream or two
Came to my town
Your eyes are fighting sleep while your mouth makes your demands
The thunder makes her contemplate
And I scream at the fools
Long days filled with sunshine
With their flesh and their bone from dusk until dawn
Some wouldn't even bother and then you came around
You're late again, you missed the last bus home
But I don't have time to solve this
And I've never seen you
The shrimp newspaper he read
Goodbye my lover
M'amuser de tout et de rien
Before a while it all made sense
Worth it being cold, roofing for the lanes
And wastes the day working
I hate what these lies have come to mean 
All your Summers set
Candle of life lights the blights and bruises
Bleecker Street
Every secret untold
Straightbacked chairs this is where we started each night you made me do it
God bless my family's keen gaze,
They're as close as family
I'll get through this if I hold on
Pick out your cloud
One tiny, tiny move
Now, don't you cry for me
Still he knows how to ease down slow
Time now to spread your wings
That you need no one to guide you
Flowers for the lost at sea
To peg my leg and to buy my eye
And something in your eyes
I know the answers
Nervewrecking, acrobatic backwards bend
And nobody knows the trouble we're in
I feel refreshed when I watch her sleep
Nothing will ever be as it was
Or if you want to settle down and plant roses at my feet
Well life, it is good, no matter how far you sink
Once more I can't breathe
When love becomes sacrificing
The channel, a professional liar
There are many in your life
When we said goodbye
É quase eterno, passa devagar 
I never have a bad thing to report
But home never meant very much to us anyway
When the day dies the night is for living
I'm one of few who's left
I have become pure water
It's here if you want it and
Haven't you noticed there is someone outside
And I hear them singing
But I always make my way
There's no one left but me
And I don't know if it's the cold intentionslide
That's when my heart would stop
He's dying to get away
We came together showed the world just how we feel
Everybody wants to have a home
You're making it worse now every time you criticize
It was right on time, he was just an old friend
Halfway between
I'll never be your love for sure
Whatever the season I'll be around your block
There may always be
A lovestruck Romeo sings the streets a serenade
The skies were blue and the grass was green
You'll never be a burden and my love for you will never die
To steer me back to my life
May you spread your love like laughter
The band is playing our song again
It was only a test
With her pair of old wings that opened just once
I only wanted things to go right
Alike their love laid low
Any more sunken treasures
The life endeavor
I remember when you did your thing without a doubt tastefully
I could wait with you for the winter to come
I wouldn't have it any other way
And the nightbird sells her pleasures
You caused me to moan
I'd fogotten how to smile
Yeah, I knew my time had come
Well life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes
Do me a favor and don't bitch in your sleep
Way back when
I guess I'm the girl you thought
Some years ago
Somewhere far above has a new day risen
Inútil explicar
All the things you don't wanna hear
Fuck with a nigga, ride with a nigga, let 'em know the priority order me
Something I never would have known
Yes, I'll remember who you are 
You of all the good times that we've seen
When we turn the dirt with our palms cupped like shovels
Don't want to be alone
Or is it the rain
Keep on telling me that time is no enemy
I gave my soul
I'm bored, you're boarding the  out of town 
Who is in control
You're a bird in the sky now baby
The Spanish guitar someone strums
Lie and sleep
And hang on our sleeves
I love her
Awaiting redemption for a lifetime
Just make sure that I'm remembered
And that moon is
There's nothing we couldn't do
Prey on the light in the room
Rainbows are visions, but only illusions
I've straighten across the line
But I will only let you go so far
And empty rooms tend to make
And all of the times you saved me from death
Burning rhythms and posting lies
Don't run away now now, ooh ooh ooh
For me to leave this place
His bones are broken
See you a lot near the site
Loving you is the best thing and the worst thing in my life
Never in a fore and only son
And helpless in your bed of thorns 
So let us go out
They'll never last
Don't tell me I don't have no secrets
Meet me in the dust cloud
Let's not waste this precious time;
From your eyes for me to see
In the mirror staring back at me
I know I think too much
My heart, sometimes
This nightmare seems so real
You caused me to leave my home
She's stuck in motion
I don't need you to save me
Heavy rains made it hard to load
With the disgust that you pretend when I walk on by
Ooh, at the right time
That lit my life
You'll never be alone
I'm talking Juice Crew, not what the word define
Swan pond, please set me free
Nor the one to make you come
Where time moves too slow day after day
Cherry blossom girl
And where are the stars
If all the words I ever wrote
I don't know if I know myself at all anymore
Interrupted by flickering candles
Go right at the first stoplight 
And ask that you stop
Oh, a light flickers on
So long since I felt this silent
That you are good at simply everything you try to do
Don't think I've forgotten, who was always here
We roll in every summer when there's strength in our numbers
Never will you hear them asking why
Steal my heart and hold my tongue
Bend to squares five to six times
I'll pull your arms tight behind your back, use myself as weight
Was she tryin' to make it back
You tell me that she stayed out, all alone
Checking out your girlfriend 
Is longer than it looks from where we stand
They say that it's okay, but I say don't breathe in
I can sing myself to sleep
To the blue ocean floor
With Him so many prayers rest
An' all you touch
Please keep it real close and don't
When they close the final curtain
Oh, stupid you, I bet' told the truth
It was just mean't to be
'Cause the truth is you're not alone
Of all the things I've said, I like this the best
 a bravé l'espace
Could I be the one
So don't tell me you want the rain
Stay in the night
 toutes les filles qu'on rencontre dans le train
Like shards of glass
Judy's starting at the sun
It's you or none, my damaged one
I can't see right through your lies
But you should have known,
Party in the sky
Nothing ever goes as planned, so don't take anything for granted
Among the fallen trees and fast asleep
See the leaves beneath the trees come into our room 
You don't owe them anything
It's so heavy a heavy price to pay
I can't tell if it's you or me who's drivin' us into the ground
The theme returns so deep
So come and rescue me,
Oh, I just need a little more time with you
Not before time, not before time
You can just buy one
You wouldn't want to go home
Da waren Menschen in den Häusern, in denen wir leiden
You better come up smelling sweet 'cause you're a long time stinking
But you can still be free
Drug in by the reign, of the crooked ways I think
Jesus, a friend of the weaker ones
Candy says she wants me with her down in Candyland
I never thought you were here
This sordid affair is ending in tears
With every hag waves me on
Father time
Bluebirds singing a song
Drying up in conversation
Is it you ooh ooh ooh ooh
And drift into one moment somewhere
Could be the biggest mistake, that a man can make
men när hon andas på mej
Only one thing I need, all I need
"Baby come on home", daddy needs baby
There's something in your ways, that makes me wanna stay here for a thousand years
Now I gathered up my sorrows
I know my soul is battered
I wasn't waiting
No one really knows about your soul
If I was back in primary
Are living on a little rock with no place to go
My prize the smile playing tricks on your lips and I wonder again
In the corner of your eye
If you were faced with Him in all His glory
It's when you cry just a little
I could taste the fire on your breath
And look at what we've got
Oh when you came back from the scene it's true, you brought a melody
con tus tantos dulces besos repartidos 
I never ever thought it otherwise
The wax and the wane and the throw
Take me home
You're so flat and one dimensional
On a very tight ship
Over and over again
Don't be afraid should things happen to change
la falta de agua No le han echado asiduamente
That looks at you from the shadow
She dived beneath the water's icy skin,
What do you want from me
Everything loses its legs when you come around, around, around
A lie it only covers
You say my love for you's not real
I'm gonna try to live my life on earth
BUT I guess it doesn't matter any more
jag hoppas att du orkar
Schlaflos, was hast du mit mir gemacht
Shiver while you breathe in,
So try to sleep with a smile
I must stay with you
Hope you've found your peace somehow
You don't know what to do
Any other way
Can't do a thing to stop me now Dreaming
But I'm not quite ready to let go
Don't feel bad for me
Trying to fight the cold
There are reasons, there are reasons, you can find out
The river is deep and the mountain high
Got a nice BM that he drives all over town
As a wish and he's all mine
For her to open her eyes
'Cause when you drink
Avaa suoneni
So why you cryin
You killer of mine
Experience brings,
And we collapse on a road
I said goodbye to the river
I'm fast asleep
I don't know, shake it
In the morning when we're through
wie dann die Worte verstummen
He won't be coming back this time,
We will find you a sweet wife
Thought that I'd be different this time around
Or run away
She was true
Sweetness comes and goes and I'm always here to stay
You hold the seven keys to my soul
Sinking self so sweet
You cut out my tongue
A flower unfolding behind the mirror of your eyes
The long straight highways from dirt road to tar
With thoughts of you,
And was crucified by gun
She said, "i don't mind, no, no I don't care
Tired of walking on my feet
And that one little thing well it's driving you mad
That you chase around
You're breaking, you're wasting me
The one that will protect her
I've lost count of how many times we've disagreed
This is the line that we cross
Our faces painted white by midnight
This is our favorite song This is our favorite song
We are their mortar
I've lied to you
When words got me down, you keep me up
Let's tell the world what we're feeling now
To show me you were on my side,
Some frozen stuff begins to crack
While I'm layin' back and smoking on my cannabis
And his modest home
Those simple words, those lover's sighs
We got nothing that ill say
There, s a time and a place for everything
I've no idea what's right sometimes
Words that aren't enough
With your costly fine robes and your mantle so green
Here I cease to run
Maybe to forget you
Gonna get on that airplane and wave bye bye bye bye bye bye
All alone I watch you watch her
I waited for you but I never told you where I was
Only a few things
I've watched the end of the thing that had no end
Is there something I'm not
When all our time was fine
That tastes and sparkles like wine
And so poorly sung alone
So I don't cry no more
I was waiting on my angel to come
The captain cries "Here comes the rout"
I forgot fools run
When you're looking
Walk through the dark
Maybe it's nothing, maybe I just need time on my own
They're hard at work, but they're hardly workin'
Some words are best unspoken
No more words
Get a clean slate and maybe we can buy a thrill
I tore the dreams from my head and tossed them in the flames
ich weiß dass unter uns beiden der Boden bricht
 Unkind
But the btch next door complained
Keep me safe within this room
Faces come out of the rain
My road's uncrossed
To fix all the defects and strengthen these Seminal ties
You're the kind of person that I've always wanted to be with
For it is I, for it is I that is in control
The sadness that comes in the mornings will be washed away
Winds on the coast tonight
There's a girl here and she's almost you
Did you hear me laughing in your head, when I saw you stuck in a rut again
Somewhere so far away, yeah
Don't close the door
Love and other socially acceptable emotions are morphine
I struggle to breathe Is this all the
How can I know what I want
With two fingers and a rock glass,
Caution 'get out'
And you drink that whiskey down
Has to be non working
Here, in a world of my own
Mother's in the garden inviting everyone
And you see your soul
Dreamland is hell and I know it for sure
I was sifting through the piles
Everything I feel for you, is everything I want to stay with you
wann kommt es wieder zurück
Tears in my eyes,
If there's a shadow in your life then there's sunshine
So take my hand, I will follow
In the middle of town
He is sliding gently off her hand
Gravitated towards a taste
It just wasn't enough
You held your face
And friendship dwelled in western true
In love's valley of dreams
How'd he get the cash The day his father passed away
I never was a jealous guy
So look at me now
But it all seems to function
I'm so lonesome I could cry
Center the morning light when the world's so bright and high
So let every morning come
You can slow this down
When she awakes
The storm is coming, the storm is coming
But he's not talking to me 
But at least we're not the ones carrying
Stars when you shine, you know how I feel
There are women with no meaning to their names when we say them
Beautiful world, it's a beautiful world, to me
Encounters with police
Oh the things that summer brings
That Heaven is of honey
With his methadone
The carnival is over
Come on home
Now the days are gone
I'm digging like a miner North and South Carolina
I know there comes a time
I was happier then with no mindset
The rap world like, what's all this commotion
Pastoral scene of the gallant south
Yes, old age will distill you
It's all really matters
My army of lovers
Make all the wrong be right again
Neither one can tell
Trading stories of loves
The pressure will make you feel
That I've got you in my life
If these are your prayers,
Love is peace when peace is fragile
Mindless bureaucracy fails, hindering government aid
Try to keep from missing love
And you waited on the rain,
This melancholy
Armaggedon is flooding through the living room and
Even though I know you've had a bad day
Little did we know how the time would fly
This is a place where I don't feel alone
That you get when your circumstance is moviesize 
Go to waste in
If there is one thing in life I've observed
I know you played it a  times before
It was a dark and clouded night
Oh and the waves are coming in
That it was her heart that he was stealing
Like it's nothing at all
As if the mayor had offered me the key
Blue eyes and wandering lips
Now and forever till the end of time
Settling down in dark waters
A million times, my private gang
We run away forever from this misery
I never thought about it before
My gentlemen polite and proud
Don't trip, everything will end up just fine
Right under you, grinning in the dark
Cover the floor same as be fore
No one listens when you want to be heard 
Water, so much water is under the bridge
We proceed in stained bed sheets
So life's a joke
Well did you know you're an angel who forgot how to fly
And someday I had lost you
With the coming spring
I sold O's, and this I know
I want all that is not mine
You used to captivate me
Down beside a river frozen brown
Seeing if ill come around
Peeping sleepy faces off your tenement
From which true love might grow
It's like she's been away for years
And I felt the trembling motion
Said I'm rocking you, yeah yeah yeah
Just gets lost sometimes in his chemicals
To have such a woman with me
And we thank you for it all
Yeah you might have it all but you'll still want more
A fleet of golden galleons on a crystal sea
So I stretch out my back and travel a long,
The sun that's going down the bed that breaks the fall
De ställer för många frågor och jag, jag bidrar inte med nån
For children's carousels
The hunter is asleep
When you grow up, what kind of boy will you be
But he knows where
Mom may never understand why baby's come and gone
In things like Heaven and in Jesus and the saints
All my life
And I heard that you moved on
If I'd been a prophet, I would tell you how the future lies
I would sing you songs of innocence
But really I'm going places
You just need somebody to hold on, baby
Around, around, around
Not much chance for survival if the neon bible is true
Have come true
I know there's something more
Spitting into your own reflection gazing back 
Dreamland is calling I am drifting away
Even the boring
His poor mama and his poor papa papa papa papa papa papa papa
Wish someone done me wrong 
Help me forget tomorrow,
The falling you feel
To keep the vultures from your back
Watch me waiting, take my hand
What are you want to do
What the ocean gives the sky will take
Not a desire and not a need
Somehow our whole world has gone spinning in reverse
To calm down the flames but now they've won
And I've got another thought I'll keep to myself
I'm called Nelsito and I'm thirteen years old
Saddled my thighs around your hips like ropes
I don't get it
I hope that I find what I'm reaching for
Why deny yourself
You are still the rage, a rock
Oh, I could write a song about the way you say goodnight
That milky delight that invited us all
But they are not laughing
Is much more than you have
And the rain on her back that continued to fall
Long long way to the top
And let you see my eyes
Into the brave new world
The sun is shining bright outside
The monuments are whispering your name
Is when I had you my love
You press the memory, you press the memory to your heart
I'm here to lay you to rest once and for all coughing
For someone
Oh, I know it's hard but you stay with me, oh oh, we've got a memory
And it's safer to be inside
I've been waiting
Maybe next year I'll be good
I get thinking I'm wasting the night away
I pretended there was hope for you and I
That money buys everything
I could talk this over
And implicate the things I've done
The way I loved the way you moved
That all my friends come over and eat
As he hit the Earth, I left this place,
Only love can conquer hate
And I don't go looking for my sins you know
You know I never was a jealous type
Me coiffer, essayer au moins
Who have always been there in hard times
I found a dream that I could speak to,
But I don't want to blow it girl,
When all that's inside is poison to everyone
Whenever I turn, you are gone from me
Kivi yllesi nyt
'Fuck the valley' fudge, my hate, my love
But everywhere I looked all over the city
Life will carry
There is nothing left of my nerves
One more picture, one more god
I'm tossing the burnt out engine aside
Me  without clothes
Rest in peace
When it speaks, you know you will hear my name
I feel like a cartoon brick wall
All you need is to look into my eyes
Voices
To fight the feeling
Is a rule, read the guidelines
You'll come around to see the other side of things
Time, is like a dream
He's underneath the window, she's singing, "Hey la, my boyfriend's back
Savor the things that sobriety brings
And how big was the bag
Polished off the whiskey tonight
Can't I think what I did with that ol' skill and dye
But I know our filthy hands can wash one another's and not one speck will remain
Mojique sees his village from a nearby hill
Against the tide
My fingers so cold
Happier now, look where life finds us
Are you gonna be, are you gonna be, are you gonna be, are you gonna be, are you gonna be, well, well, well, well Whatcha know about the Isley Brothers
Been holding mine but I'm just fine
Your hills and dales and flowery vales
There's no reason to stop it
I don't mind spending everyday
I tried carrying the weight of the world
I hope we can find a way of seeing it all
Make her make me mean more
And there's no place to lay the blame
Digging me up to fuel rockets and risk
Tears away away away REPEAT
After the flight
Virá com ela que entrega 
That you need me
I turn and brush the birds from off my shoulders
But you came at just the right time
I know you've got a lot of special things to do with me I'm through, I know, it's all right, sing along
Away from my lips and the fork of my tonuge
Virá, pois ela estava ali
I feel the skin that separates us, start to fade
Something other than
Let me fall but catch me mid flight
I called it home, for a moment of my life
Are your thoughts results of static cling Go your own way
Personne sous mon balcon
I've never heard you cry I've never seen you whine
I feel it to the bone
I went out for a ride and I never went back
Let's get it over with
Now, the buckwheat cake was in her mouth
And they are not in decline
To cut you free
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountainside
Die Kinder,
We are heading straight
vibrando primavera di capelli
I awoke from a total sleep
Vinden synger de evige toner
Om vi förlorar varandra här i vimlet
That we might be alone,
Darling believe
Muted whisper of the things you feel
wie wir schweigend durch die Strassen gehen
I think we've got
That you would come back home when I call
And things I thought I'd never do, baby, ooh baby
Makes me round, D sound, push it down, move it around
Like all your loved ones played the best part of their role
When words got me down, you keep me up
But nobody believes you; and now you live as a liar
Harlem River talk to me
Fight your way through crowds and cars
Because that heaviness will steal away your breath
We're on both ends of the fight
What life would be what life would be
As a magical child
The procession moved on, the shouting is over
Come back my forbidden ghost
I Pray that the sun shines in the windows
You go higher than before
Sometimes we just pretend 
Can you hear the night's deep song
Our eyes are in the branches
Cause' I can see for miles 
Maybe then now and then I would want somebody
I rubbed your back when you were sleeping
I'm up against the wall
To the grave, to the streets, or to the jail cell
Waiting on the final word
And lonely sailors do their drinking
Everything is perfect now
Swept back
Till the windows break
For the moment to come
Are you who you say that you are
She taught us to embrace the light
Two riders were approaching
You are so hot
I was too Busy staring at youInto your eyes Getting wood for the fire
Sorrows are easy to hide in states of mind
All have been wept for husbands, brothers, grandsons,
It used to be lonely in numbers, impossibly weak on my feet
In the sweetness of the dawn
And we hang our heads down
Wouldn't even care but now you're here to see
Hey, tonight is your night yeah When you close your eyes,
We were born into the new year
When you see the sores you can't believe them 
He talked a lot about loneliness
We could build an island
We nibble and jest about things that drain and the taste of lust and
He's holding all the cards
I remember what he said
I stand alone without beliefs
River runnin' free, you know how I feel
Is your heart singing out of tune
I want to weave a musical spell
We'll start with that new future superstore and steal all their
Tomorrow when we walk in the cold, keep hold your hand 'cause you know I like it so when
Mit unter , mitunter glücklich
That's all I need to say
| Di care Di care
I want a girl who will laugh for no one else
How I love you
Our eyes met as you passed me by passed me by
With not much to say
I have jettisoned
Our life begins with this
And in the streetlights I can't see
We're just better off apart
When I'm kneeling at your feet
With any kind of sense
And I got a little fear in my soul
Never tells how it feels
And you kept it like a ghost forever
Caixa, bumbo e sexo
Changes in life
I can't believe what's happening now
Maybe I never will
If you don't know what to say, well, that's all right
Put it away, and take care of your heart
To one spoiled nun who taught you the names
So the hinges on your windows would rust and colour
When TV says the world is crushing down around us
Next to walls that jut from the earth
And all your shirts and jeans and things
Like a memory it falls 
That any time the girl in mind will come and rescue me
Gonna take my time
Singing such sweet rhythm and blues
And a cowboy tried to lasso me
And there are times I know when I will have to chase you
We'll never be the same
How we long for a life as a slave
This real taste asks for more
Just to keep you and Paris on my mind
I wouldn't do you wrong, honey
Meet them falling through my hair
You can't tear us apart
Constricts and chokes like ruthless vines
I can see our bodies burn but sense no fear
I am so tired of everything
Somehow I got to get up and get over you
And I will come
Lighting those swan matches to see
I wish I was somebody else
S'appuie sur ton épaule, s'accroche à tes paroles
We'll expose all the bicyclists who really are
während ich versuche zu stehen
There's a love that transcends
We can never be filled
You teach me how to feel
We've been swept up just by circumstance to where the coyote lives
We will disturb you, to make you talk again
Singing bye bye bye bye
They say we're not meant to be
And then leaves the rest to me
Feels better than it does when we talk
und worüber denkst du nach
Someday, I'm sure I'll get the picture, stop waiting up
That she bears a wingspan
The night I looked at you
Hold the slip and slide, taste the sweat, it's salty
For  years going on the th
My love
This is world as we know it
From the cities to the swamplands
A tender wind that reaches through the years
The road I walked home in the rain
Nothing that's worth regretting
I know that he has found another friend
When I was young
Feel you again, anytime I feel like I'm too far
And you swore you say me laughing
There are promises broken and promises kept
I have to go now, darling
Never drew the line
All of us are going down and
Brought to her those days
I didn't know you then, now did I girl
Return the words, the looks
The world outside leaves me behind by myself
You will learn to lose everything
I may be slower than some folks
Your bones crushed and seeded all the clouds
And I must of said the the right things
Cause once its gone it's just something you ain't never gonna find
Farewell to Sinclaire's castle grand
Don't try to wake me in the morning
A beautiful angel materialised Time stood still, face to face I'm
And no one heeds the crying
Than before, someone else
You need to pump your brakes and drive slow, homie
Blasting white noise in the convenience store parking lot
Coming on forward motion across the ocean
Emotion less war 
The newspapers call me the state of the art
I used to let you wear all of my clothes
You want to be one, to peak on the chart
Fearing he wouldn't approve, we made a lie that was feeble at best
'Cause I'm living up here where the air is thin
Gone with the wind and home is far away from me
Why are they falling
He was my chief comrade back in farmed Waterloo
Love is your dream
'Cause you're drowning in wine
This mean arena is all the things it seems and more
And it's the first time she ever spilled her soul to me
This scenery is evergreen 
Look at me, this is the life I chose
I get the space in between here
Seem to cool in the warmth of the sun
So many people forgot who you were
Fighting back the tears
Didn't she promise us stars
The thing that I've been searching,
Maybe I could be, let me pretend
Baby, I'm alright, I'm alright, I'm alright
There's nothing left to say
Because I'll be the preacher to all his converts,
And yet the game
Who are trying to knock it down
That time won't heal a broken hearted me
Everything haoppens to me
If you don't mind, why don't you mind
She walked into the party
And the morning temper runs
Begging please give me some more
He's fallin' for another, found a new lover
Strappy shoes don't match the Thursday drunks
Now I'm just a friend
Lack of sinsibility
Don't back down, nothing can be changed
But I recognize the tone
And this is not our fate
My flat warming got started
I know I waste my time
Well I wouldn't want to ruin something I couldn't save,
Gostar de quem gosta de mim
Always had a choice but I cannot be mislead like that
Should there be a stormy sea,
Won't you man up now
Why does the sun go on shining
I'm dumb but now I wanna mouth off about it
You make my whole world feel so right when it's wrong
Or how your heart is wired
Every night for a thousand more
And Jesus loves him
UFO's that come from other planets
Living underneath this guilt
Gonna be alright
If you let it shine, you can free your mind
No momento em que eu queria ver 
Give me your dreams,
Yeah one day soon I'll take that drive out
Around the street where I grew up
Like me, she feels uncomfortable in the clothing of her ancestors
Just pretend that you know me baby
Make something else up there's majesty in motion
Shorty get down, good Lord
It doesn't matter anymore
But I don't mind,
If you ever fall, I'm gon' be around
I know God
Never caring where one's branches have been
Everything else will follow
Lost my mind
You're the one and only girl for me hehe
The juniper bends
And we fell in love
When you're sleeping on the couch
Try to bring me down
The colored birds above their running
My gal's got a headhache, her ankle is hurting too
I will tell you how the sun rose high,
Now it's you and me who walk away
They ruin my summer
And we were bound to the city life
Another day, another chance to get it right
Good goodnight
Dad, your boy he used to run, you taught him how to crawl
I've got two tickets left, won't you please stay with me
And if that's all we have you will find we need nothing more
And I can't do a love song, like the way it's meant to be
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
When all the hard times outweigh the good
I can't make shape or form
It's a mystery how people behave
You could get yourself in trouble
It's as close as I get to love
Like I miss the ocean when I go to sleep; 
Nur wieder wie im Wahn ein Luftschloß aufgebaut
And I'm turning from all the lights tonight
You're the smile on my face
With you not here, the streets I roam
To have a better life
Where will they go, when the jet planes can't fly
It takes a hole to make a mountain
Well let me tell you a story
When it's falling rain on the ground
'Cause when they own the information
He was alone
Sit back, watch it turn to dough, watch it go out the door
And if I didn't hurt so much, you know I'd give you it all
'Cause you taught me to
And all the special things I'd like to eat
Jättäisin ja seuraisin
And my heart just skipped a beat
Left no sign, nothing at all
Eu veria as tardes
gestapelt wie in Kartons lebt man modern 
But back to the matter at hand
So cold  feel your ears burn
Why can't you believe
Were always done in such a hurry
Every time you messed with my head nanana
You think you know what brings me down
This wind is blowing colder and too soon I feel its pull
Every love is your best love and every love is your last love
At four in the morning
Der uns beiden offen steht
Close your eyes, sunshine
We remember great deeds performed by you
The distance and a dream
Please forgive me, 'cause I've been there
And I will love you so
Then I could help you out 
The tidiness of cry
Hold me in your arms tonight;
Hugh Hefner will tell you he ain't got shit on me
I will try to dry my eyes
What is my life about
And never show a single piece of my mind
Everyone should hear
As I'm walking and no I'm not breathing
With the fairness of your skin
Hardly becomes me
Swallowed by pain as he slowly fell apart
Surrounded by things
Thanks to mfait cox for these lyrics
But as close as I get to you
I want to get there but it's just out of sight
We were grateful for they both did their best,
But they're crying inside
But caught in my mind there's a way to get out 
You know how this shit goes
I can feel your heart inside of mine
im Silberweidenpark
Until the nextime with six hits of sunshine
And here we are
The screen light's a hidden dim
You can't fall unless you feel it
We both made the call that it was only my fault
When you smiled and slowed
And in your head where it dwells
And the balance hung upon the head of one who tried
But do I really have a choice 
Watching I was waiting for you,
Smelling of deepfried beans and whispering your name
Blood in the breeze
But, oh, my friend
Someone will call, something will fall
Of the way that I thought that we'd end up
We'll do this again some day
So I'll file away all my dreams
That meet a maid who lends one lively winking eye
I loved my breaktime education
But won't ask you, "is this really what you want"
Don't know where you are
Everybody's on the same page
Inside your porcelain fists, your palms begin to crack 
You don't know how to play the game
You are a vessel of light
Boys I'm going home
To pick yourself up and change
Passing night and day
But you can't fly unless you let your let yourself fall
Remnants of a deeper purity
If we rewind and start again,
We're at the ground floor
Drop a couple pens and some pencils
An angel was sent for keeping all troubles away
That will come to part us
är det för att jag ska komma
I sound the oath to sit
So if your thinking I don't care as much
And I knew too well
Got back to the car in time to watch it being towed
Do you feel a change coming on,
Sometimes you don't get a chance to ask where or why
Saints will tremble and cry for pain
For every living thing
As their up on their ties, lies, incites the tears to your eyes
All I gotta say is that I must be dreaming, can't be real
Is it ok if I don't come around
Oh, don't cry for me,
Of love, love of love
Your hair with their seals
They come out waiting, and I just get on and go
I lay still in the fire
When my coffin is sealed and I'm safely  feet under
The girl you once knew
And this is the advice they gave me
But together we wandered
Où sont ils allés
Because you're mine, I walk the line
Of the mountains on the moon and then a Jesuit
Can't think of one
Your hand on my shoulder
I have searched for you
You want it to be over that stone wall
The tongue on the side of his face meant
My head's been spinning round and round
Just trying to look right
And laid me down
Don't you care Don't you know about Love
Weeks at a time 
You set me free
God bless the seeds in the ground
"Oh won't you take my hand"
You rise and rise to the sun
Who needs sleep when we've got love
Just hit the ground running, I know
Let the moon glow on the fallen snow
If you conjure up a fear
Darling, everything's on fire
Go do it, whatever it is, whatever it is
That the pain is worth the thunder
As she wheeled her wheelbarrow through streets broad and narrow
That I'm an island in your sea
Los Angeles, Albuquerque
Talks to nothing falls apart
She wore her beauty like a cloak
Jos yrittäisin puhua vain sanoja
Choosing then to bathe in you
Sometimes, 
A marching band on a sunny day, two pretty eyes or a a pretty face
Is when I fall in love with you
Easier to be me ooh ah
Kid, please try harder while you can
Though the pages are numbered
Do you think that I can't feel
When I slam doors 'cause I'm pissed at you
My bones are aching for you
We were love at first sight, now it's crush, it's crushing
I will lay my head
I'll be with you even though we're apart
And it's crazy, like no one can save me this time
Yes I will 'cause
And I don't think we should wait x
Crying in the night
You move a sudden grace, a child upon the Earth
America got a thing for this gangsta' shit, they love me
Watch her smoking cigarettes in the street
So we can sing you to sleep
So I'm praying to keep me from breaking
Look at where we are, are, are
So let that be
Emptiness surrounds me
The brilliant moon and all the milky sky,
Everything you need
No matter the moment we decide to make our minds up
I need to stay alive and this ain't no cure
"If you love her let her go,
Oh, the places we could go
And holes, within holes, within holes, within you
Something left to do
When I was a sandy blue
While I squeezed you like a tree trunk
Homebird sing
Then the winter holds a bite we'd never felt before
Where's the day that never ended
She's gone to the movies now and she's,
But I don't know if I'll make it
Gone in the blink of an eye
But please come soon 
And as you flashed your backstage pass
Last night I went to see my love, 
Now fall off to sleep, I'm not meaning to keep you
I should have known better
I want to live where soul meets body
I bet she's down there having fun
It takes a night to make it dawn
They say we're all created equal,
They come back like they're an option
Who were born under calico skies
You come home late and you come home early
Only love, love, love
Spring at hand
One day this world will be returning to this prime
That's all I want to do
All living, all our sin the same
You were a secret, waiting to be found out
The houses at night
When laughing is gone my way
She's got everything I need, some pills in a little cup
But I enjoy myself; I got my friends around me
Or do all things end
Hold me in your arms tonight; Oh, now, hold me Just hold me in your arms, baby
Looking through our window when we sleep at night
Disregarding the fact your running's been done for a while
How the grass would cheer on
Sometimes I wonder if there could be really
cómo me hizo perder, la vergüenza, mis años
She was a wreck, but he loved her
Welcome My Friends
But I don't get disapproving
How you get your adrenaline flowing
Your apologies will never sooth the sting
Where I saw "I love you" all over the place
Why are there so many songs about rainbows and what's on the other side
You step to the door of the club and see that you ain't gettin' in
Raised in Liverpool by the sea
Warm is the sun
Undresses and folds his arms
Para amarte necesito una razón 
But I liked my seat so I kept it
Till my name escapes and I'm set free
I'll Bring it on back, Bring it on back, Bring it on back
To what's next in your journal of ardency
On the right hand she had a tattoo of a nude girl
But I'm happy this time  
Let the water creep over your face, I'll send it in waves
And the morning when I first saw you
Gathered up inside his mind
Something to save
Oh, rabbit wind
We are a part of
And you can't wait to get away
All alone
You talk in your sleep
In some lonely little town
Feeling scared ready to escape
Don't hold your breath because I'm coming up slow this time
Yeah all alone I watch you watch her
I never wanted to fight 
In a world of love
I don't want to make a movement
Unless you give me all of yourself
I'd still make all the same mistakes
When you grow up, what kind of girl will you be
Everything, ain't rocket science
So look at you now
I drove you home
I remember you there
Whoowhoowhoo, ahhhaa, whoohoooooh
I welcomed him
Sooner or later, sooner or later
Will you slam your fist down on the table
And I'll take you, ooh ooh
You try to act like it's just me, but I am not alone
When she said, "my love extends
In this world of wisdom
They traipsed mud all over the house
And it's okay to read in the dark
The closing of the doors 
I know I like her, I think she is pretty
Do you want to be a friend of
Don't just let life pass Don't let it pass you by
When we met, I felt my life begin,
Knowing well it means goodbye
Mm  Maybe What did she look like
If you cling to your pride
Bin ich der ich war,
There is no such place
Don't you know that the big Ferris Wheel is eventually stalling
Star crossed lovers
Won't you let me walk you home from school
Ain't it strange that I can dream
As I leave your side
Spring came, rain fell
She's the one who made you wild
Where has my ambition gone
And we share a name
And thought you're sick
'Cause I know
Sometimes I grow so cold, my breath is an arctic wind
It's no use, since you've been born
And over
But you never really had a doubt
The one you won't regret
For a closer, more detailed picture
We're moving but it's never going 
Will you be there to carry home
Of a million more just waiting to become
High on amphetamines
Then what really are we, what are we
Oh I remember you like yesterday
To search and roam around
Well, she's told, "Hold your buttons and look at the sky
Keep careful watch of my brothers' souls
This war we've achieved has allowed us to win
There's no use thinking
She remembered the beauty
When you come around, everything else disappears, my eyes disappear
But I know that his dad was a drunk
Did I say too much
It feels like feathery dust everywhere
Backwards rolling sliding
My heart cries out
An evil wind is blowing through the land
Jag skulle byta plats med vem som helst på sekunden, om jag kunde
I spend so much time
And I understand for that you had to go
And spending weekends on the beach
And like a lovesick lenanshee
Why the sudden change
Pou'n ka we demen
My homie Marley used to stay th and May
I let her go
Fault lines in her words
Instrumental
Where all my layers can become reeds
Stop BITCH See you in the afterlife nigga Wait HELP
From my boy
We on it, that mean we living for the moment
'Cause mine has come through consideration,
Shut down in a modern town
What's done is done because
I don't like to do a drop of work
Coldly hurt me and turn away
Saw me just come up with anger
And when my party's over
And even worse than that
Bring it on back, Bring it on back, Bring it on back
You don't stand up
We're born into this world Never, never know the reason why
For those tiny blunders made in yesteryear
To take me back to another time
I said, "Baby, it's scary
Well, I could use a little comfort
I hope there's forgiveness
This is when I start to lose
Shot up the whole 'partments, and still ain't brought back
Come and lay down on me
This close, we almost said it
The weather was bone dry
And I remember when you started callin' me your Mrs
Just a touch, a stain, a hole in your brain
I've got one week behind me,
So let us say a prayer 
Let's start living life 
I can live with all your downsides
Desperate clouds
Where you're free
Cantilever bridge, the drunken sailor
With a different house and a different name
Hoping for a little more than just another kiss goodnight
How would your bad side burn
So make a conscious try
Damnit, this Cat's on a rap song
So can I come to see you sometime
And all we knew we cared
One false move, baby 
Inside the mountains
A lovely singing voice
I hope to find it in the end
Is it a boy Or a girl Or a gun
She's eighteen, he's thirtyone
When we're together we stand so tall
Reaching into the night
Up in Syracuse
Above my brother, I and tangled spines
All these pages are burning
And I have learned that even landlocked lovers yearn
I surrender my hands beyond my head
You never know, homie, might meet some hoes, homie
I can feel my death at the end of my life,
Easier to be ooh ah
I love you say you love me
Are you ready, boy, for that ride
When you tell me that I'm the last one
I'll be there in your dreams
Every night
I want to take all the sadness
To the summers I never see
She accepted the news she never expected
And the fields they're under lock and key
You haven't touched your food tonight
Outta debt, outta dodge, out of breath
Bent and broken is all I've been
'Cause you're the only song I want to hear
But up on this height, a majestic sight
And you say that I don't have this down
All these things we were searchin' 
These messages you've been offering
Sunshine made my bare feet burn upon the road
It turns the world around
That got steamed up
Shadow rises and you are here
Je voudrais tellement t'empêcher
I promise we'll resume tomorrow 
You put the ache into make believe
I got two sets of headphones, I miss you like hell
The frost in my soul is so cold
Stuck between channels my thoughts all quit
Shall keep us apart
So vast that you could lose your way in it
There's no comin' home
It's all just a song 
No one's gonna stop me now
And all good things, they say, never last
Wearing stonewashed denim again, straighten
Pounding on the earth and yanking at her hairs
Remember the love we had x
Through the night we swim
And watch the water wash them away
You are a beast and I am serving up your supper Ohohohohohoh
It can be scary but kinda funny too
Now all my drinks and all my feelings are all fucking mixed
Sure she'll call you "baby", she'll look in your eye
And even if somehow he could have shown you the place you wanted
If I could see you one more time
The sky is red, and little kids are running, screaming in the street
And waiting is all I seem to do
And I feel homeless
No greed, no desire
And the clouds melt away into water
So then we were floating up, we were floating like particles into the night
A juggling of vices
You thought you'd just rest a while
No I never meant to break your heart
Now I'm bound by the life you left behind
You're still beside me
Underneath the grass will grow aiming at the sky
I'm afraid you'll never find me
Looking ahead with anticipation
Doves cried when she tried to fly
He knows just what it does
Time bends broken bones
One time on the stereo
But you find yourself alone just like you found yourself before
How I will protect and how each day matters to me
Have to say, your home's where you make it
To lose a little life with every breath
Now every heart has a blind side
But it'd still be less
When other people say you're someone to misuse 
Don't bite me yet, I believe in you
I'm on way home
E un invito all'Hotel Supramonnte dove ho visto la neve
You can tell by the rust and the chains
And you accepted as fact Behold a white horse with you on it's back, A bow in your hand, a crown through your hair
One second denied is a miracle of love
Than me, trust me your eyes will be ok it will be all right
Slip away
You don't need a thought to look good
Man it's gonna break my heart
Why make up a lie
I'm not sure I belong here anyway
And you know, and you know
I'll wait for it to come
It's our life in the city
Now if you catch my eye and you find that it runs down your leg
Don't hold your head so low
Carrying something wrapped in plastic, straighten
What ever happened to the young man's heart
Do que julgam o nosso próprio entendimento
Oh Lord, don't be far away away
Watch the time
And you know it
I felt your fall, your winter snows
Maybe we are the damaged ones
Waiting alone
¡Calle ya a ese perro no lo agunato se lo ruego
Passedout in the gutter, wornout in your head,
Ne s'épousentils pas
You make it too hard
Give them sunshine tomorrow
I wish you were around
Where do you go when no one cares
When most of us are sleeping
There can be only one like it
Oh, wait
But I don't care where we go
Carrying your heavy old heart
And show them what's beautiful
And throws it all away
And throw a storm of burnt flakes,
I got a sheriff's name branded where I should of kept clean
I can't see the sun, but I sense its glow
Maybe it was the rain
In your mothers arms, I have called you son
We're all that we got
Makes you want to get down crawl like a beggar
There is a son who
Someone like you
'Cause it can free me now 
How in the world can I wish for this
As death becomes a jest
Make me well, make me well
Away, gone so soon
Help me so I never leave
His tears have turned to poppies
Why is life made only for to end Oh
Maybe I, maybe I
Would you like to learn to sing
Cab is waiting
Carve out your heart for keeps in an old oak tree
Do you remember
City streets passing by
Please don't go, I want you to stay
Now, noone knows the year
You left a hole so big, Lord, beyond repair
sarva sidhi me prayatsa
You told me of crashing cars
Slide your hand
And expose all the lies
Beware the wrecking angel
Vou me perder entre as estrelas
In the northern snow
A torn shirt and a long dead cause 
That I was born in North Carolina
Lord, let the rain keep falling down
Oh so much sorrow,
I lay myself down to make it so
Ooh ah You make it eaiser to be ooh ah
Thin pixelations
Sailing to the sun
Giving up on his dream to be all about his kids
Our able bodies and able minds
It'd just be misunderstood
And it's so pretty and so lonely
And bleed into their buns till they melt away
You know, I love the way you drive your car now
All I need is what you give
Just the smell of the summer can make me fall in love
Don't want to say no more now
There we were heaven sent
And this sickening sky
And there's no use in burning out this flame"
Reflecting only shadows
Make Eden here
To me tonight
This ain't no place for a man of faith
I'm looking for a remedy
While I sit and wait for everything that I can find
In the distance between us
She said, "Your beard is woven of heartache
And may we all be brave
I loved your hair like that
She's still my favorite work of art
Ole pelottava kuin kevään liekki
And anyway
You're not apart of it You're broken now, like us
'Til we die this war we've achieved has allowed us to win
After all, it's always you
Back to the start and the scrap
Why don't you say goodbye
Good times around the corner, good times around the corner
You no longer keep me grounded
And she takes her pills, And she tells her lies,
I'm hollowed out but resonant, a void is amplified
I'll make it all up to you someday
It's passion pulls the pain
And 'Someone Save Temptation'
And as we opened up the door,
Oh would care would wait and live again
If we don't wake up soon this burden will be long
Why would give power to the ones who robbed you blind
When it's your time
I never knew I was given the best one from the deck
I'm, not inclined to meet anyone
Know you like I know my garden
We're ready for a new age of innocence
Raise your voice and close your eyes
Der Applaus ist vergebens
Look around
Go up the top floor
And smash on the floor
I don't think Santa's coming this year
What is truth
And give in to the man
The place where we meet
Where are you going
I'm walking down the freezing street
Towards you expectantly
How many ways am I killing 'em Shit, right around a billion
O tera di care | E divano tera care
I know better than to try
You thought that there was someone else, all along no way, no way
In a way I couldn't predict
China town
Some hearts, some times, leave blind
Something in my soul that they cannot possess
Passionless moments and we are homeless
In the back of the New York Post
Wouldn't let him near
Open your arms and sing
Fingerbobs has wolfed the lot come into our room 
I caress the infinite light
She was caught on fire
And they need every man
I was wrong, I didn't know anything at all
And I should go home for now
River runs and takes the boats away
Tell me something 'bout a lonely night
Fly me high on an angel's wing
When you're in love, my how they fly
If I don't know me then I don't know you
I remember cats on fire
Trunk open, screens on, neons lit with fifth relaxed
Is it all in my mind
And I loved that nigga to death, no motherfuckin' joke
And even if somehow they could have shown you the place you wanted
She be grabbin', callin' me Biggie like Shyne home
Oh if you find yourself amongst the lonely ones
Just look what you've done
I'll catch you every time you
Feel different one morning
Overlook
I don't want to be myself
'Cause loving you is divine
Yeah, that's my shorty doowop I love the thangs she do
I told you that I love you
She's holding a truth that she'll never reveal,
Le seul que je ne supporte pas
There's no way to describe
Lots of milky tea only onward, forward, inward, in, over a field I don't want to do this
If the world ends, it won't finish you
We'll take man's dirty deeds
I want to write a simple song that's so frequently sung
Yo, el verano
Without a care, a care in the world
I'm getting myself in love with you
Weights down so that you could move forwards
So for one moment in time, you'd find that you're mine
Life moves on
But anyway bird 
And I can hear when they're playing their love songs cause the kids in the yard stop playing with their toys
And as you turn away
When words got me down you keep me,
Yeah, I don't know shit about gymnastics I summersault bricks
From time to time
To straighten up your life
That you are slowly killing me
A lot like LL, Chuck D, Slick and Dougie
You know what you are to me
At the weekend
I can't coerce you into this one
Can't you see all is not right
Keep dodging lights
Why not use a rifle in most other applications
Would you still stand by my side
And all I've said was just instead of
I am living for the night we steal away
From the highways to the hills
Just say
Kill yourself to never ever stop
There's a mirror in heaven
As they passed, their huge bulks disappearing into a thin line
There's a word in your eye
The whole place is pickled
I try to stay drunk so nobody knows
Is the whole of the heart
How come nothing that I try to do
On whoever's thighs are warm
Will ever be the same
Playing games
And the walls are thin
To what you was supposed to be
That you're never gonna hurt me
And do that sweet, sweet thing
You know well when it hits me
Can't understand the reasons why
A long empty road
And you're always on my mind
But I haven't got the time
Put your hand in the oven there's A heaven in side
Boy he's on his job, boy he sure be having the marks on they mark
You know I can't refuse
About the stuff they never did
I told her so many things
I'm two steps away from falling
You don't see how our life was supposed to be
Round and round and round my head
It's so far, it's so far far away
Dirty records from another time
Till my time expires
And I'm gonna stay here so just let me be
I don't want to wake up
The bohemians of Soho did pirouettes
And I can feel all the nerves in the tips of my teeth
You're more than I can show
It is written in my face
My only hopes to see you
Who tells me that he loves me
Marie you are the wild blue sky
I never come around 
Sometimes sitting still is better than to try
Là, sur ton orifice ami
Put out your hand
Dwelling in the mists of cloud and rain
The things I do just make me laugh and make me wanna drink
And you walked away from your drink
She's never going away
And begin to relax
I like this resonance
Clouds roll by, laying up on the hill
That only love can blind
She was talkin' about the music all fast in the club you know
Oh and I can see Daniel waving goodbye
And beauty never dies
There was a dead mouse in your arms
I want to come too
Go away like you always do your entire life
We can clink our glasses still being entwined
Love sometimes leaves you
Ja yö on kylmä, valoton
Sweet confusion under the moonlight
There's an old flame still burns in my heart
Whatcha doing 'cause we'll be rendezvousing and
Jimmy's corner in Raging Bull
Then we'll work until we die
Gas hurricanes spread over Heaven
And it only makes you feel more lonely
May this day
On the top sides of both of her hands
rd and Lake it burnt away, the hallway
I left three days ago, but no one seems to know I'm gone
For one to hold and for want you
I never needed words, I never needed hurt,
These are diamond tears of a rapper
I hope somehow you'll know
I raised the sunshine
You wait with me, because you know
Don't waste another minute of my precious time
Unverändert liegt das Land
And today the people dress the way that they please
The lust of love, a brute desire
The feelings of rain down on the plains all dried and cracked
Laugh or cry
I am out of control
Girl I've prayed, oh
I will hate this, but I'll still want you
But now I'm lonely all the same
Is something to pursue
The days I saved
Oh, truly I love you
If this is all you want 
And I'm still at these races with my ticket stubs and my blues
At least now the storm can't blow me away
And it's slipping through the grey cracks
Out of the corner of my eye
I just want you to believe
May there always be angels to watch over you
There's so much more than this before we go
You can fall in love with me
You tellin' me with these seven years of probation
Ay get out quick or you too will be knockin' on heaven's door
On the way to the heaven's light
Revel in the songs that he sings
But I don't know how
And Harlem River swallow me
A love song, my darling
Get some tickets for the dance
And together they planted flowers of warning, fearing frost
You don't have to cry yourself to sleep at night with wet pillows
Uh there's me no, no use in pretending
Yeah I figure one day I'll snap out of this
Brown eyes 
For the wind to suck
Of the boundlessness of your freedom
Now I stole the moon
Clark Kent just signed Das, he didn't want us
In your eyes
Does the soul understand I do
Angel eyes
And You won't need to stay, but you might lose your strength
When my heart broke did you like the sound of it
Her eyes were reflections of eyes
The sacrifices he made for me His dream
So, farewell to my friend
I close my eyes and I can see His dream
I'm just a boy, not long for this world
Where it was going
Out of sight is out of mind
But they don't know me yet
I wanna make it right
You're just standing, watch me fall
His body's warm
All love stays around
Is older than the sky we lay under eyes
Don't even talk, I'd be glad to guess your name
Lies in the hands that set me, that set me free
The sidewalks are dirty
God said to no one to do what he did
And it's such a night, it's such a night
You're wasting me
'Click,' call it quits  bring all them walls
We can be a ghost now
And the sheep are all lost in the harbour
Phillip always said about the wheelswithinwheels
Standing on the wrong side of the sun
I looked at the sky for vapor trails nobody comes
Over and over and over again
Don't want to blow it all at once
Of faulty manufacturing
We'll hit that allnight diner
Baby is back on top again
For a fraction of this life,
When you're not around
Cross your fingers and dream on
I go home
But these aren't so rigid
Deal and dispose, but keep it real close and don't
I want to make much of Your mercy
Can you tell me about everything I long to understand
Our own decline
A string that only plays solos
And I will love you till the day I die
When she tells lies
But then there's me, a fox for your gun
All of my friends are strangers
And then he went to the bridge so he could fall
Blue skies
That shapes are for looking at
To stay inside with me
And I can feel
December come to me
Los cuadernos de don Rigoberto, Vargas Llosa
In my life
So now I stand beside
And I'll remember that summer as the right one
To say any way but lightly
Burning down through my veins
You can shut your eyes 
I've always tried to find
Backbeat the word is on the street
You did it so, uh, crudely, now
It's true I saw her today
And in these times that we're apart
You can walk away the freest man
The cars and the trucks are falling
Even though I like your honesty
Mal sehen, ob sich das Warten lohnt
You can follow me around
I started to dance, remember
Now or never
With equality and justice
Just for the last time 
Make up for all their messes, I could listen to you all day
You talk in your sleep
Though I feel regret, I know that you regret this more
No days were the same
I'll never let you see me cry
You could be my unintended friend
And memories of distant days come to life again
Olen väsynyt moniin sanoihin
So take me under the floorboards; I would love to feel like wood
Poured them out on into the world
But the mirror's broken
And when belief
My face is framed by the blanket of night
So let us not talk falsely now
Only the lonely
Our laws are fading,
Sometimes I cannot forgive
In the attic of my parents house
Down, down to a perfect relaxation
I'll say a prayer for your heart,
Entre o céu e o firmamento
Wanting love can make one do,
Asleep in dreams so deep
It ended when you said goodbye
I took to the fears of all I held dear
And changed your married name
We could kill a life with words
Imagine that you're standing here
You go to new places
And he found the old coat Hung on a post 
Over and out
I'm losing
Too many people just can't get kissed
He was her long, bright future
I thought I would know when to leave when the time came
I don't need anyone else
And the Red Queen was waiting for the news
Werf dich in jeden meiner Schritte
Will never be at ease
That you get what it's about
Mais mon coeur s'ennuie
In fronof the fading sun
I'll choose unloved instead
A royal bed a lovers' nest
Misspent with angel eyes tonight
I don't see me by the roadside
And I'll never,
Put a new shade to my thoughts
Tell me that you want me
Since I've been asking for
And I've always lived like this, keeping a comfortable distance
And you can still be free
Oh where's my gun
I turned it all away
Air on the streets, lights on the trees
I don't care what they think
'Who the hell can see forever'
I do bheatha sa tús, sa deireadh
Walt Grace, desperately hating his old place
Ou como ir ao Arpoador não ver o mar
Stars still shine stars still shine
I said it�s been a long time
We would have drove down
I risked it all against the sea
In love
Oh, no way, no way, there's no movement
It's not that we don't care
And in the arms of a stranger 
I know your brothers and your sister and your mother too
Should I be afraid of this face that I see
Damn nice guy, damn nice guy
I'll call you on the phone
Always till the end
That I once thought had passed me by Thought had passed me by
Kusuri mitai ni 
In my life 
Is written in stone
You make this world a beautiful place
We sure didn't see no man in that fog
But I miss the way life was
Well my place is inside of you
When all becomes all alone
Why does it matter how I treat you
Feel it fresh and new
Packing a suitcase with all of her shoes
Sooner than you think
Please turn red 
Only my heart did hear him
And I was making you a wish,
I truly understand Please, don't cry now
Hello, if you're there, pick up the phone
She winks and grins and 'Merry Christmas, friend' 
Owl said, "Death's a door
When love and trust are gone
Und halt nie wieder an trag mich
Like a river running dry 
Forget the story you heard,
The bloom closes its
Wander along together by the edge of the river
What did you say Was this your downtime
Do you tape them to your shoulders just to sing
My silver spurs were gone my head felt twice its size
I won't say a word,
It's oversensitized
And I cry myself to sleep
Feeling as though you never belong
Oh with no one to blame
They've come to my door
I hope I can find a way of letting you see
Breathe your life while you wait,
Ich verschwende Deine Zeit
When shapes are for looking at
I wouldn't mind pretending,
Is still the same
uno debió perder la vergüenza hace tanto
When I said, "I'll never let you go"
I'm telling our stories to myself 
Praying that it ain't fair
Even if romance ran out of rhyme
Like a child told it cannot play, whoo
Forever closing in
Wipe your tears from your sweet face
I'm dyin' in the shadows of this man I've never seen
Are the things that distinguish him as an adult
Books that last a year
Ride on, ride on now
And sings me on
I feel a dark cloud coming over
Thought again, of driving by, the place we meet
I made a meal of the lighting, this was exciting
And some people have pretty looks
When I look around
Deep in my heart, I will remember you
Slumped over like a dead man
She gotta drink water 'cause she thirsty
And away he gone dark 
Iscariot, you fool
It's only animal to run along the rocks
Lonely hearts, troubled minds
And in my own time I am losing fast
Black is turning grey, patches of his age
No one got raped here but the pain's still inside
That's why I know you are the one
Och stjärnorna vandra och timmarna fly
Will open your eyes, I've never known trust like the nine
And nearly savoring
But I couldn't see the light, 'cause I couldn't get it right
I have become pure water distorted and echoed
Now you come and you arrive by me
Stop, stop it
Essential child
So I hit the road and made my getaway
There's no way out of misery
Living next door to challenge
We have time to start all over again
If no one is around you
Open up your mind and it will sing to you
All this time I was finding myself
A voice in the back of my mind said
Far past these roads there is a place
I should take the time to just explain
You should just let go
Adversity
And the music carries on 
To the honey bee
These are the moments in life that I seek
Won't you let me see the world
The otherworldly manifestations
Of better things to come
A thrill I'd never known
And I hope that you're dreaming of me
Just to see them fall to see them break
Who wouldn't sing for me now
Rehabilitate some and just hide the rest,
Till my eyes have left your face
Straight through the ghettos and without lights
I still smell you, distance aside
I knew I'd run into you, I had that feeling
And I believe him
Hope I get the chance to travel the world
Do you want to be a friend of mine
I gave it my soul 
What's more than subtle in these lines
Nobody's buying so come up with the money boys or you'll be chocking on a barrel
And if the world's a stage,
I never denied you
The elephant sees
Boundless myriad shapes along the sea floor 
All your friends have come and gone
Whilst the books gathered dust
You turned out to be more than I bargined for
Please, please place final bets
I'll be waiting in line, just to see if you care
Oh, beautiful son, smiling light, good morning son
Like a lonely vegetable
My mind's hallucinating lucidity
I'm the manchild
Can't imagine how difficult it is, I know you suspect
To hold your hand
And this whole world
Is the person we are
I lay down on the grass
One day I woke to see her leave
Ach das Blut läuft aus dem Mund
Will be gone and I won't see you anymore
In Volkswagen vans with full running boards dragging great anchors
Sheltered thoughts and fears
To love or to hate
I've touched you once again
Than to drown in your love and not feel your rain
I've been up at nights to paint the house ghost white
The peaches snuggle closer down into the clotted cream 
From the street, rock radio plays Crimson and Clover over and over
I thank you very much
And I, I I don't say that you're right, no no
Sometimes life dictates what we hate
Lonely blue and sad times
Fall into these arms of mine
Ain't nobody like to be alone
What do you want me to say now baby,
Do you see me when you fantasise tonight'll be your night
So please remember me mistakenly
Until the sun comes up
'Cause I believe in silence, our hearts speak the same word, the same word
Oh, the grass Burn in bed
Does she come here for
Like a crooked tree
All I wanted was
How I love you so
I let you fool around
Our world is only what we're told
Oh jag saknar dig mindre och mindre 
Oh, nothing left to find
Meet me in the white light
Seek shelter on my broken pain
Let me make you say my name
Under the waves, deep in the drift
Instead of sister and brother
I'm just sitting here daydreaming about you and all the things you do
Why can't I just curl up onto the night,
But still I must die to get to you
We'll be workin' again
Watching the queens of the street
How could I stand here
Across the hills in the pop art blue
Heartbeat's at a steady pace, I'll let the rhythm show me the way
Dreh Dich nicht um, hier wartet keiner
It's a new life for me
Hell, no reason, go on and scream
Is it ok if I don't make it
So instead go ahead and say it
Vanity, dull roar die down
Faces look ugly
I believe in the way that you've touched me somehow
And every skyline,
Waiting nothings goin' round
A madeup story to fit the pictureperfect world
Maybe we should just stop here
I'm in your shadow again
I know that you will
And my mothers little heart will break 
And as I told her this story, in anguish she flew,
Chasing homeless cheerleaders,
I never felt this way before
And let's leave this earth
The pressure you know I feel
As dead as yesterday
And I hate it when you see me in this way
To end the doldrums 
Suddenly everything's ruined
Now where is peace and what is fair
Call it off now, dramatic as I'm ever going to be
Where all things make work of coming back
I didn't know there's only you
All your doubt becomes your own belief
He likes to read books written for girls
And how do they love what they fail to deceive
And all of those things we used to do
"Wait Don't let your dream just walk away"
River's bottom dark and blue
Hey man, what's your style
There's a band in our cellar, baby, and they're playing a song of the drunks in the street
You were betting on some lover, you were shaking up the dice
No, no, you just loved the boy too well
To keep it in the hot lane, I don't care about no scenery
While we're apart
Who has dragged you away Who's that carrying the rope
Pueden borrar mi memoria
Facing the ghosts that decide if the fire inside still burns
"Pick out your cloud"
And yes I know you're nervous
On a world
But the water looked so black and deep
I knew the years would move quickly,
Everything is exactly right
And I've come home
Where I was meant to be
It's the sound of my tears falling
There's no goin' home
If you don't know, you're right next to the right one now
Each of your reasons has broken
I'd be the father of your child
I am welcome
When all I want to do is stay inside 
Wakes me up in the middle
I had a conversation
Every night's a special occasion
Sitting up you're counting up your names
Someday I'll get over you
I don't think I can stay sitting around while you're hurting babe
Nothing so clear now that I'm here
Bulls jacket with his hat broke way off
Your pointless life will end
Of the living people walking up and down the graves
Sometimes you don't come home at all
I'd rather bleed from cuts of love
My name is William James McPhee
J'espère que vous viendrez me sécher
In a place, in a time of our own, yeah yeah
Still you got something to say
And I upset her
She reminded me of a winter's morning
Everything else can wait for you
Complacent
I wonder if my seed will find purchase in your soil
It's a beautiful day I guess for a bitch to roll with Andre I guess
I'm on fire I need somebody like you, I ain't afraid to die
When it raises its head and it threatens to stay
We'll forget each other's names
Head across the street where VACANCY is burning in neon still
I'm scared and I'm alone
There is part of me that's always true
Lying on the bright blue jumping mat
All I wanted was for you to believe
The bones of the plane
I did it well
Frozen, the ground refused to die
And summerbreeze is blowin' through your hair
Like everyone else
Shot through the sky
That your arms would hold me tight
When darling you were mine, all mine
That's no way to treat an enemy
Cut it down go put it away
That all the way from here to Mexico
Whatever you're looking for
That I will be carrying
All else is sure to pass
This was the centre of the world for me once
As we gazed at the wall
And some endure
I've heard it's pretty where you are
And nothing is more powerful than beauty in a wicked world
We're out on the road again
Nehmt Euch den Ring,
But he and I, we both knew
The sea goes on forever in a symphony of song
Can you love the lily of the field
So many times, just lovers you know, I know, I know
All that I wanna feel is
With a dayful of promises dead on her lips
Sheltered me, from nothing but the weather
I'll drink some beer as to find my way
They love my little mustache 
And you clearing my eyes
Like my love
Love me the way I love you
The second time this year
And nobody's laughing anymore
'Cause I'm not who I used to be
I like what your tshirt says
A sun that doesn't set but settles 
But don't forget, it's just a ride
And they get silly
So close your eyes
She only knows the pain that comes from waiting for so long 
Just to stop the alligator from getting up
Never let me go
With the kiss of lovers lips
He says "It's dinner time"
As he stood there trembling and turning pale
But if you would shine your love down here
Amy, please don't go
We'll face the winds,
Only living
It's how the tattoos smiled as they stared down her stomach,
And in those hours nobody knows our ends or beginnings
One that broke apart
And uproar fills the town
Well, something bad happens and a lot of people go
Through the fallen memories when that angel baby signs
You're not gon' be scared at all, oh my love
Schizophrenic conversations that
Pictures blurred in her head
As I dubbed myself a passenger
She's got me praying to the wrong god every night
And when you cry, darling, I wish you'd feel my love
Out where hope and the highway ends
When one heart enjoins
When you're down
Listen close
In the enlighttened night
I watched you shine
Fangs long as neckties
'Cause the bad kind don't even know
Everyday trying to make up for the one before
Straight through the land
And I am a ghost to everyone I know
Loving never meant that much to me
You're the funny little frog in my throat
De ton retour, tout ce qui nous attend
Lilac wine, I feel unsteady
You need not to climb mountain tops
Most of the killers never get famous
Our eden's a failure
She's got no reservations
T'es restée la même tandis que lui changeait, te brimait
I know you can win this
But it may be a new constellation
She shouldn't be dead, she was too busy talking
And coke's close as we get to sugar cane
I'm found on this early April morning
Don't let them see you cry
Delta Force plays on your old gray monitor
And I have oh so many flashback scenes that I can calmly walk straight through
I had a plan, was all made up
The closing of the doors 
My hands 'round your throat 
When travelling around the world
Wherever you are
Let love slip through our fingers I say
Today you may feel a little sleepy
Only you remind me
Yeah, need some kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk, kicks
Your burdens couldn't win or lose a thing
Which do importune thee,
I thought about them too much, allowed them to touch
But I'm gonna make it right
Every handshake
That I'm ready for the fall
I know I lost my soul
Of the old apple tree
Sleep my little child and rest in me
We slip underwater
When the circus came to town
If they call don't very soul, and the land on the moon
Freude und Leid das ganze Jahr
I stash it in my tiny house
I've seen you cry, I've seen you smile
I can't do anything 'cept be in love with you
All this hurt runs down to my fears
'Cause I'm being taken over by the fear
Just like a stone
Softly stolen under blanket skies
Just through your mind and away from you
He looked at me and we looked away
Caught away in clouds
Gold teeth and a curse for this town
Or I'll never give
We're not safe from the veil of the night
All boastful lies, no great surprise what shit comes out of my drunken head
The right way
Hey, I gotta get over you
Destiny turned her face
I didn't say all the things that I wanted to say
You know she won't make it with just any guy
Those who know whisper when they see us walking
After that day
I stand where I stand
Survivors in the night
So I'm calling for one last time, to say I love you
From across the room,
Crashing down was my biggest mistake
Yeah I'll give give give until there's nothing else
Take these guns from the street, Lord
Ah She's my butterfly
There's a chapter on loss and a ghost who won't die
To walk the world again
I'm caught in the flow of things
We fight so frail
This love's mine
The police said that they cannot help your daughter
fui eu Da segunda quem fingiu que
ich bin erdrückt, von all den Unterdrückten
We can't see the start
There is a grove, there is a plot
Yo Ain't no better man, for this hype track
You live your life like a page
Then run after make castles in the snow
And all I would reach is this mirror
Your more important to me than I ever
A bit more inside
Keine Angst, Du hast nichts mehr zu verliern'
Baby be careful, what's fixed as one breaks in two
She died of a fever and no one could save her
But no one else can see
How'd I reach this point on my own
I don't even understand it
Take them motherfuckin' panties off, you ain't no nun, shit
If you leave I'll still be close to you
Cool breeze and autumn leaves
es ist überall unzufrieden
Do you see that lil' grin when I talk, huh, yo
Then good luck came aknocking at my door
So they never can grow
And I forget, I forget, the movie song
Faltering, no faltering
And please remember me as in the dream
In a night without day, on a road without end darling,
The ache I feel inside
Down we fall  
Shuddering in myself myself
Growing colder
The sun and moon and all the stars
Well, this is a song for you
I'll never amount to anything
Let's just go to a show and hang out and feel good
Screaming and sounds of the shovel burying him to fade
I can see what you want
He gathers all of the urchins up in their filthy tearaways,
To touch your hand
And over time they all start to look the same
Standing over heads
I want deep space
Had blotted out man's image and his cry
That this stage holds our show
My mind's distracted and diffused
Make the devil feel surprised
Wrap your teeth around the only game in town
You've got me all tied up to the whipping tree
Let the pain burn away from our hearts
Please wait
They can bend it all they want
Smoking paper to the crimson flashing bars
Coils around your ankles
Oh, living for the city and it's always troubling
Lightning comes astarin' in again
Snares for my dreams drifting onto oblivion
And in truth I saved you
Oh, desire, it won't bring you back
This romance is fading
So count it on your fingers if we got it wrong
You're never near me
My memory dies
Discovery will knock you on your knees
The roadside attendant nervously jokes as the angel's tires strokes his precious pavement
I know that You're the one to pull me through
In His arms so many prayers rest
Love and other moments are just chemical reactions in your brain
The gates to heaven here on earth will open up again
Clapping with the human race
And came up when she started with zero
Every day is the day that you save me
When no one cares
Nothing so mundane 
Your fingers reach around the bone
My love's as fair 
Virá ou ela me espera 
Is passing by
When nobody else is around
Oh there's values and costs in the wondering if you should
She was no , it was cold, it was blue
All alone and twisted
Well put your foot down my brother
I probably will not ever be
Spelling Jesus won't you please us 'cause you seem a damn nice guy
I don't dare to think of you
Ihn dann zurück bringst unversehrt
It was wrong but you said it was right
It's cold when you remove the nails
I haven't felt like this in so many moons
My blouse wrapping itself around your trousers
To satisfy you is my mission and a bed is all we need
She brought the sunshine right in
But still haven't burnt any old
I need to focus on the girls we gettin' currently
She was the sky
I've been walkin' around tryin' to figure out
By chance if we should meet
Waiting on a brand new day
And forgets It takes two to tango
Now only ghosts
I bring it all back home
When people say you're dead
Crawling down
Don't touch the magic wall, the sign of the crystal ball
As he kisses the lips of the misses
You curse my name
Yeah, staying around here late at night
And it seemed like overnight
How could you be so Dr Evil, you bringin' out a side of me that I don't know
I said I'm a bird in your hand so take me as I am
I see you happy in the front seat
The call your life's been issuing you
She'll cover me with grace in all she offers
With one last breath
Far from present day reality
es war wundervoll als wir uns trafen
I'll track you on the radio, and
There will come a time gigantic
A creature born in listlessness
I know if you
Walk on the water to me
Wake me up if I'm sleeping 
I feel that I am fading away
I'm tired of people
A time for lovers holding hands in the rain
She said, "I'm tired of being homeless, restless"
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
te quiero pero te olvidaste abril
Oh bitte, bitte ja
Under layers of concrete are the bones of our past
How did I get here
Catch me drinking of your wine
I've journeyed here and there and back again
And all my stories have been told
Everything is fine
Go all the way, have your fun, have it all
Gonna keep on moving on up, I got to stand my ground
Everything's in a permanent
I would love to pay for you
In the privacy of our love
Oh you say life's so unfair
Now I got to wait on my girl
I'm just waiting in the cold, wet snow
I hate that I want you
Something in the way she moves me
Even the streets are falling
An' all you love 
No sign as yet, you're mine as yet
My brother is gone
My view stretches out from the fence to the wall
Perché domani sarà un giorno lungo e senza parole
And I would kill, I would fight
Smoking weed with you
But I'm soon returning
I look like a painter, behind all the grease
And they are gone, they are gone, they are gone
It's coming time to face the truth
And if there's something wrong with this
The lameness of an unborn child
Why does my heart go on beating
Then the sudden smell of burning flesh
That nothing else exists
And I held your hand through all of these years
It's true, what goes around comes back, you know
Smiling on the outside to cover the pain
I'm going to take these broken wings
At the Teahouse on the Tracks
And it's not my fault, it's how I'm programmed to function
Mit dem Mofa nach England,
To hide his face and cry
That way
Ill broke on the road 
With its glass eyes a blue formica halo
Sag deinem Bruder,dass du ihn liebst
She makes her movements mysteriously
And never quite alone
And I will hold you close,
And the newsboy yell
But it's myself I need to blame, if you don't know
Do you want to go
You got a new friend, well I got homies
And I knew I was close to you
So long ago, we were dancing and singing
I bet you ain't never seen a shorty so fly
I don't wanna spoil your night
Cause life is a war fought with tears
And nobody knows what state we're in
Oh beautiful world of mine
Neighbour's always smiling with the baby on her knee
I swear I really didn't know
"I love you"
I'm sorry I won't be there to see our children grow
No pull, no gravity on the ground
You will allow a low light
Are you dreaming me
When you thought I'd looked away 
And medicine makes us move inside a little slower
Oh, I know you're faded
For the rest of my, for the rest of my life
Unfurling hair
But my heart stops in a panic
But please remember me, my misery
Talking on the phone and watching "Cribs"
Because oh because
I stand on my feet when I hold her
Are you lonely 
You rent a oneroom city here,
Will you forget the scent of violets on my skin
I'll drink my rivers, drag my feet, and drown in my dreams
The story with no ending
And with these hands, I'll provide for you,
See it all come true, come true
Tired of getting stoned
The sky became mad with stars
I'll keep the dance floor warm
Och Anders är alltid glad, alltid glad
Oh you should stay in your home, in your home, in your home
Or maybe it just hurt so bad she couldn't cry 
She bought a country dream
From where she came it's hard to stay
To the soul you never knew
Yes, I lie crying on the ground
And I took his heart
That has me crossing over lines
Anything you ever need,
To the green woods I will wander and shun all men's view
And it's bending your will like a willow tree twisting
Believing stories only hearts can tell
And if we should die tonight, we should all die together
Id crack the ground as your struggle for sound leaps
A living hell for me
'Cause you're beautiful
Now we are stunned minds
There's a day in a month
This foosteps
Always making predictions 
Tell me boy boy boy are you tending to your joy
We could leave this town
While your reaction is nothing new
I'm going to stay with this
But when the booze ran out my silence left her ring hand feeling cold, cold
And I've got a thoughtless feeling inside
This kind of thing gets me down 
And he never speaks his heart
With transitory pictures
The concrete girl
Such a human waste your eyes without a face
What good are songs with no dances, I pray
It's ladies night, all the girls drink for free
Whispering this in his days
But most often I just hang my head and cry
Just once, I'm gonna go and get drunk
Too many memories
y te rendiste en febrero
He never wanted nothing, I remember
Gave me grace, not to lose
It's in everything
Where the world's ugliest boy
This morning feels like yesterday,
Flying around
But I learned from my dad that it's good to have feelings
We'll stand around forever
The earth is falling too
Tomorrow's coming and yesterday's gone
Though I still believe in everything
The God of small things
If you're riding around the city with nowhere to go Drive slow, homie
Baby let's just knock it off
Only a few things I see you, I see you
If I don't make it out
We'll make it out together
Standing underneath the night
Except for you and me who just came to use
Now I just pretend
I can't see over
In the darkened corridor
Love is a powerful force
Lay your head back in my arms, oh, I know your worth
That shines brightly, yes
Like I wish I could forget you
Just say you'll wait you'll wait for me
Swallow
I don't expect anything,
Le  mai Il signait un deal, tu lui dis oui, mais
I let you borrow my keys
All through the night
Hold your breath and pretend
What are we doing now
Won't spend my days in my bed
Believe, yeah
If you get lost I'm here to guide you
Everywhere I travel the pretty girls call my name
From high hopes to the ground
So you trying to do what they did
Hey kid, rock and roll
So we'll put you down
la gloria es verte volver, saber que un beso llega
And I wanna try for you 'cause
Frozen in the waking instant 
Now all of these voices
The morning comes
Will you say to me,
Could be rolled into one
Of everything you ever wore
Whose fallen for you
A Storm Swept into town
She's talking to her agent
Sinking deeper every time I fall
Sweet dogs, sweet rain, never come and go
This desert road's forever winding
Nameless was our crime
It's all right because I know my own way back home from here
What keeps you from moving, are you afraid to be loved
Well, that's how sick I was when JRue
See her walking down the street there she goes
Bite down deep breaths
I've looked in the studio, study and all
I want to touch you but there's history
'Cause you're the one I love
You're making it worse now every time you womanize
You are my best family so far
Let the journey entice you to stay
The hollow ring is only last year's echo 
I've heard it too many times to ignore it
When I'm left alone to my vices
It was the fear of God that led me to you
Searching the darkness
Then at midnight I
I will take this road much further
Come up on different streets, they both were streets of shame
I never wanted a fur coat or your cabriolet
Both ways you lose
And perhaps it's common fears
And when they don't go our way we
I guess there isn't any point delaying 
'Cause I'm still fact she's fiction
And you mix them emotions with tequilla
And I'm dragging my feet 
I like to stick to walls
Your kiss was sweet like an apricot
Never gonna stop stop, stop, stop
With these hands, I will cling to you,
I know the good, the great
I wanna be the gold underneath the stream
A vein that's open for the day
My girl's got a big mouth, with which she blabbers a lot
They ain't proud colors but they're true
no quiere ser desordenado
With my earth in the wind smoking fire, let me get ya sheets wet listenin' to Keith Sweat
You can begin to be yourself once I am gone
At least there's something good in most bad news
In the body of a violin
Softly sway, or have you lost your way
And did we grow apart
So, till I meet you there, I'm singing
In this broken world around you
Each time you get hurt, I don't want you to change
I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
And I love you, I swear that's true
Your house beneath the hill and up until
The way you want me to
My life gets brighter by the day
And wearing her heart on her sleeve
When he plays the blues
I can't get back to where I used to be
And this is like I have always dreamed
Through the chair
changera de l'acier à la poussière
I can hear your heartbeat
You're beating yourself up baby don't you know
And now you're gazing at the moon
Cannot hear what you're saying
And I say
Close to town but not to the city
One last long sigh gone
Always got to cosign, everything's a ten
Boy you wish you hadn't dialed before you wrung
Like a flame in the dark
I try to keep it to myself, but sometimes I couldn't it
Going to play with your heart
Send me
Turn to clouds
Keep your eyes open wide
A child in a train, tristessa departs
Till you surrender
Something inside you never knew
y fue por ti que aprendí a querer los gatos 
And I run, run, run, run, run,
You're with me all the time
But we got to hold on
Shine a light on me
In the summer sky
We'll play our air guitars
How can you be smiling, singing
Let there be no storm on the crossing below
Yeah I know
When he had the heart to ask her
Isn't it time we go steady again
When you're around, better I feel
If you need to find yourself
When you had it made, it was all good
Just speak easy
Here's two for being unaware, that you're gone
All in all, it's nice to be out
Maybe we're just sleepwalking
Send her seeds, a painful sound
That luck keeps passing me by  that's fate
How you held me tight, each and every night
I'm still fragile
Home home 
I'm overjoyed, and in the sun,
Yesterday followed me along,
Libérez les sons de ma voix
Too all the people underground
Waving its arm as the wind blows by
The smoke from the engine
Sleep in my bed, there's a design
If it's what you need
And they're gonna make a Death Star,
doch auch sie zerfällt irgendwann
Why this is the wrong way out
He told me don't rush to get grown, drive slow, homie
hat sich einen Dame vielleicht gewundert
Some people say it's over
Play with words when we cannot sing, this bouble feature means everything
What days have come to keep us far apart
Here I am, completed my whole record deal
Now and forever
The soul of the life I once had
But you know I would never waste those words
And now that's it's over, I'll never be sober I want to be the only one
I feel it by degrees
Oh please Lord deliver me
These eyes on your back, hands in your neck
He kissed her head
And I saw the mountain fall
I'll be hanging at the check out 
And there's the star I used to wish on
Pay my respect to drummy as he keep time
"Baby understand"
Keep me wondering why, when all I can do is sigh
You didn't choose to commit, but you're committed
Who goes straight back out to do it all over again
The bridge looked so high
 unverzüglich
Up against the wall,
Drive your car up to the pole
Chains are rattling in the attic again
You know what I told her
But I refuse to falter in what I believe or lose faith in my dreams
I've never gone
Holdin' on to nothing when you should just let go
Forever young
'Cause you'd be living in a world of your own design, undermined
You were fed and you were free
I get so hungry and I wish it never
I felt wanted
Well summerbreeze is blowin' through your window
In the morning after
We watch for bonfires in the sky
It doesn't matter where
One day a light will shine
I don't regret a thing
So I left your side and followed my own voice now
'Cause we never turn out the way we thought we would
The days start to fade out of the frame
Patience, time comes, she says
Shit, The truth is that we need each other, yeah
Don't need to tell me 
Sunset Spoken
And to hear what she might say
Han sungando nowa ttorojigo shipji anha
And his scaly glass shards
We saw them lying on the kitchen floor
In such disbelief I thought I was asleep when I met you
Something about the rain, it sends memories through my vains
Words that I knew were forbidden
And drift in space
So it shines when you finally come home
I'm a traveler  with one last mile my journey is complete
In my soul
Show money becomes bail, relationships become jail
Can't do a thing to stop me
Was befriended and was a friend 
The day I break your heart
There's no one doing it for you
Though my nights are lonely
I just wanted you to want me to stay
That blooms every hour
I'm under your curse now, but I call it compromise
I have seen the world
Before you turn, something to ponder in your heart
I'd like to ride my bicycle with you
The lighthouse's burned
With this desert around me
I awake in the future,
I cry everyday and so till time does heal every scar
I'll give until there's nothing left to give
Held myself down, just steering the wheel
I'll be with you till we're both gone
That kind of thing made me crazy
Goodbye my friend
My sweet, sweet Madeline
And this is what she told the gathered round
Every other little way
Cymbals crashed, the lights went blue
Good girls voices drift like anaesthesia
I want to make much of Your cross
If the clouds move in
Are you sitting comfortably
Hollow moons illuminate
And no one ever looked your way
I'm always running, chasing flames on a dare
And make you quiver
I need some kicks
Her leaves reaching for my head
Blue light is flickering
So in the end it all depends on whether you'll find
I tried, but the walls are too thick, too high
You danced for me in your bare feet
And I can't say and I don't know
Leaves you standing poring over moments in life
Don't want to, but I can't put
It's setting the stars all on fire
Bad times always seemed so sweet
There's no one in town I know
After all, you're my wonderwall
Got a gun and an eagles eye
And the heart keeps bringing you home to
Well I may never know
Deride me not, thought I seem petulant
A Storm swept into town
Must have been blood on my hands
You have lost yourself in dreaming
Circling down to the grass on the ground,
You've done nothing wrong
If the road I travel goes bad
Still I wish that I could see like everybody can Like everybody can
Ateu praticante, ocidental
'Cause the record bin's been replaced
I said before too long you'll be a memory
But to hold him and say
On my way to Ireland
And what will I know when I look up to the skies
I don't know, oh I don't know
But what when all your fields are rotten, your waves of grain, amber waves of grain When your days are done, I hope you've had fun with your game
So we can take comfort now
From the vision come the people
Without the courage to give a new thing a chance
Someone forgot the golden rule
All my angels made of words
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant 
Outside under the purple sky
And now the future's wired
But the seasons, they were sleeping
You're all I don't need
The light is fading 
Amongst us animals and freaks
Love keeps you warm
That all of your days are numbered;
This time around
I've got no need for open roads
It is so pure I can arrive without the fear of seeing my eyes
We can do it We'll get through it
I gaze beyond the raindrenched streets
You'd help me find my way
Together and be
Rain drops bouncing off the leaves
About the way I feel inside
I'm running
Passerà questa pioggia sottile come passa il dolore
All that we've known of ourselves,
But the flames put a hole in my heart
But I guess, I guess you just ain't better than the rest
But there aren't any here
And for some unknown reason my watch begins to chime 
Sometimes I wish that life was never ending,
You've got to get through and lift the roof off your soul
May you sail fair to the far fields of fortune
If I started my own country
Don't ask me now to wash away the grime;
The kind of love you know that I can
Darling Kings Of the highway We will be
Your shoulders and
The longest train I ever saw
And the foundation's breaking down
I am breathing,
Has grown a Peach Garden
You fed me with lies
Modern cocktail drinkers
I'm pulled to the side of the road 
But I've been feeling closer day by day
"But you is a seven time felon, what you doin' with that"
I can see clearly now the rain has gone
But water moves beneath us 
Let's all pray for rain Let's all pray for rain
Forever you
This fool you love somehow is here with you
It's been, it's been such a long time
In winter their lips leap
You cut me deep, bitch, cut me like surgery
And I could sleep with you tonight
Ich kann nicht mit
Or fake your death and only tell your closest friends
To save everyone from this brilliant light we've won
I hope I'll never change
That never was,
This I'm always prone to do
Are you gonna be, are you gonna be, are you gonna be, are you gonna be, are you gonna be well, well, well, well Yes it will, oh, yes it will
Been the crawl of a mountain 
It just forces me to look at myself
Ooh ooh I'm just like you
So tell me, how do you feel
Caught a glance in your eyes
Christmas time is here
When the earth folded on itself
Going back to Paris on the train
Than I'll ever be, I'll ever be
I've been walking around all day thinking
But I how I miss your voice
Just let go of stress and tension
Close to fulfilment
Because I never even told you
And with a onetwo throw me over the bayside bridge
I often dream of heaven and I know that Tracy's there
Halfway to the bottom
That he couldn't find a door in the morning
I found your house and I saw your car
She was wise, full of magic and life
The stars keep this fire
I keep thanking the Lord above for
It isn't very much, but
I'm light as a feather
I'd still feel for you
Han flyger upp bland alla moln och glömmer alla år
And oh tonight I will retire
Like way down in Pollyanna where the race runs wild
Dear unlock the door
Scratching the swingadella's dance floor
Dorian, carry on
Sigues continuando, subiendo, continuando
Neither one listens to "Brothers in Arms"
There are places in my head
The photographs of just the landscapes where we've been
When the sun's too bright
Roll away
With a big old hallelujah carved into my chest
Looking back to all those moments that we shared
But your wealth will never make you stronger
For ever their fair poems flourish may
And the sound I hold so dear
The voice might be one and the same
Or can I trace it to go home
I left her fifteen years behind 
I'm living but, really though, it's never enough
Nobody knows who I am
You'd ought to try to live your life on earth
I wouldn't cheat you, honey
If you're scared just think of me
Why do we fight at all 
I wanna be the gum on your train seat
Why is the Earth moving 'round the sun 
So many days in the wind, you been running all your lift,
You brighten up the moon and the stars at night
Sea foam like rainbowcoloured clouds
They lie with you when you're asleep
Winter drives
I saw them and I knew them all
Falling from the sun
And I can't let go of your hand
Turned off the lights and then you
Look deep in your soul
Summer weather, we're back together
Small steps, they don't lead to your heart
What is this chill at my heel
Still got sand in my sweaters
My barren heart and I
You're wet around the edge
Oh, my life is a setting sun
But sometimes I need a day off
But where are you now
And she said, "I killed a man, T
I see the road begin to climb
It's a cold night, beneath the street light, there's a man whose pants are too tight
Love, I hope we can be
With some scrapes on my arms and a mouthful of hell
I hate that I love you
Juliet says, "Hey it's Romeo, you nearly gave me a heart attack"
So that's all you want
How could you be so heartless
Is where the life has left your eyes
No new chapters
Over where the rainbow meets the darkened sky
I'm in love now
He was late this time last week
When I ask her what she means, she says I ought to know
It's starting to envelope
And they love each other so
Spying shows your limbs caught in the rails
No matter how hard you try
They come for women, weed and weather
All the time
Together
My friends they talk about it and they said
And how my love it's let me down
All these faces faces
Women, weed and weather
You've stolen my heart it's true
But you're young and in love
But can your smile save our love
And everything's good
Pretty soon Vic was seeing red
I remembered Macha running faster than the horses
Just as long as you know I'm through
My brother I'd follow you in
These feeling, they don't mean nothing
He doesn't know when to rise
There ain't no stopping now
How long have I been in this storm
Guess you got my number
But we are going home
The burning sun
Laying everybody low with a love song that he made
A morning, so clean so pure
Yeah, I couldn't believe my ear
Every time he goes, she dies
The darkness that has been
Summerbreeze is blowin' through your hair
'Cause I don't understand you and why you're after me
Did you hear the wind of dream just passing by
But we climbed them so that we could be free
I don't wanna waste another day or night
At every occasion I'll be ready for the funeral
We can take our time and you can want to Stay in, go out,
A mother shepherds her young birds
We listened to passengers stamping old songs
Cold from the flame turns away
De ces amants là
Till slut kom dom fram till Cecilias grind
Tell me how you close the door,
Father, father
Ooh, grey
Give me mouth to mouth
Keep the nightmares out,
With the methadone
You have to watch for the smallest details
Go ahead and build it up again
Yeah I've fallen in love and I hope that you want me
Pour some liquor for those who passed away
Some surrogate brother I wanted to be
I was the best man in a size too small
To fall into thy chops Let others pray
I don't know anything
It's not always rainbows and butterflies
You're back at the wheel
Sometimes crazy people
For just one second that was true
Hey yo, I did some things but that's the old me
You take me out shopping and all we'd buy is trainers
And the arguments are disputed after school,
And snap around your fingers
Ridin' something candy coated, crawling like a caterpillar
About years that passed
And coming up only to show you're wrong
Awoke the dreams still sleeping in my bones
I look up to the falling snow
Ooh, we cut up our old jeans and go outside
Storm warning, feels like a heavy rain
Com uns passos mudos
Catching colds and missing trains
Everyone's at it
I don't care what you do 
Found himself involved in a sea of blood and bones,
Don't come around no more
We didn't lose, we didn't win
The morning brings 
Gone and made me a child again
Beside your graveside
Cause in my life
Wrapped in guilt, sealed up tight
gestern war es umgekehrt
Through on your pretty head
Hurry back reember last time
All over, all over, all over, all over, all over, all over, all over
From dry land, he rolled it over to wet sand
You say to me
I love the way you moan
I wake up in the morning and I wonder
And I waited in my fleeting house
'Cause I'm just a stone
And the business was doing so, so great
Or forget their towns
Still missing you
You're on to me, on to me and all over
Please, don't let me hurt you more
Wonder if you'd even recognize me
Felt the stretch of skin on bone 
Maybe I'll write this out or maybe I'll leave this down
"If I may make so bold"
Faith is true, she knows the way 
Listening to a sound
Just a dance to the music of time
Comes alive, comes alive
I used to cry for Tracy because he was my only friend
Too many programs open at once
explicação Parece inaceitável a
And douse them with a mouthful, put the baby down
"Everything is fine, I am here, I am here"
Who gave who the right
Sát mín þverr
I caress you, let you taste us, just so blissful listen
I think I see you standing outside
How should I know, so far from me
Cause even though the flower fades something takes it's place
Still won't wake
As I light my last cigarette
Fallen walls all around
We are small people x
I've seen the future and the end is near
All the times I've cried
But I really do believe that
Someone to guide me
Fat, ugly chicks in New York on the radio, saying I'm gay
Against my lips
Try not to think while your inside
And then you realize just how minimal you are
Don't be alone, Abigail, belle of Kilronan
Everything I've learned I have forgotten
When they get giddy
Coke machines, firemen, landing gear and cement
Feel from the world
She's been falling
You're not here with me, still I can feel you near me
Comes into your face
I think I can make it now the pain has gone
But when he goes to bed
As say that we tried
Beat like a rug, ashed out and clubbed
Now I say either way
This sweet old world will give it out until it's time to leave
In the end it's all you
Came home from the doctor
The things that hold us back
Amanda awakes in a moment believing
Just you sleep a little baby
I didn't really know what to call you, you didn't know me at all
Mettre une robe, saluer le voisin
There's still time
Choose your mood and then start to wreak havoc
I'm trolling food court for girls 
So call up, call up I wanna hear the performance
Deep in the cell of my heart
We'll go where it's always spring
And now the woods are burning
On the news at night, they talk about the disappearances
Oh, the cold wet wind blew over the heather
I will know you're
I'll never love again
I saw them, I saw them waiting
If you let it go
But they all sound right
Can we settle down, please
You want my love
Autumn falling from trees
Beating next to mine
And let the current carry us to the beginning where
I don't know, If I'm right, I'm right
It was all laid out just for me and you now
I'm crying out for more
Good times and get caked up, uh, sunshine coming through my blinds
Found in the Vedas
The lovers, the dreamers and me
It looked like heaven but the colours seemed to change
And on the street he'd surely die
The glorious age of Camelot, when Guinevere was Queen
To those who wait
What I need is a long holiday
If I'd been a loner, I would save myself, stay unaware
When all the characters full size and every moon is level
And if there's a taste in this life more inviting
One wild wakes through gates so sleep
They forgot about me
Who makes me better
And seemed the greatness of the world in tears,
Really 'cause that girl that you want
Such a stillness; calm as the owl glides
I'll look at The Sun, and I'll look in The Mirror
But you can say, baby
No one around
Oh, I want your love
It's mine
And by all that I've done wrong
When I am falling like a stone
Even though I'm seeing three of your faces
You alone, you alone and no one else, you were meant for me
I'm on the road to God, don't know
And every time I see your friends they just ask me where you are again and it hurts
I try to somehow let you know
Well I watched your black tied family
Stinger night gale
Bored with life
And keep my arms open wide
So many waves in the wind, I hope you find what you're looking for,
The sound is the best I have heard for a million years
That if you take away the sunshine
But I love the sound
All the truth that I needed
You come home big when you're feeling small
Here we are at last
You had a way of making it come alive
In times like this, we cannot say we have not been warned
My girl you make all the smart moves
No, I'll never let you go
United states of mind in troubled times
I love your hair like that
I wanna hold on to you baby
Enjoo de vertigem, viagem de avião
In a playground I would chase you
Alles war okay, doch das Gefühl hielt weiter an
And I still see her in the crowd with diamonds in her ears
Ribbon in the sky on the radio cause Stevie know I control
Come and speak to me
You look so wonderful in your dress
We're getting dead and it's the right way
Lonely, lonely hours without that
I'd keep standing by your side
Kadulla seisoo poikia, etsin sua katseella
Forget about your worries
Hinter jeder Bewegung
You don't mean anything to anyone but me,
There's a place for us, you know the movie song
und so vieles rauscht vorbei 
And words between your head and mine
Been completely dry
But I'ma be the bigger man, big pimpin' like jigga man
Oh, let me be the one to come alone
But I've been living underground,
In that stillness once again
I son you
The winds of fury pave the way to paths of glory
A girl with permanent tears
Why did God fail
Hello baby I'm pleased to meet you
All good things are defined by the kiss
The flaming hair across your cheek
Bid your farewell
You're doing your best dance, your best look
And let it break the magic beauty of your fragile mind
Now I can see the old wood hillside
Pero olvidaste una final instrucción
And I lied alot too
I'm foolish and crazy
It's in the middle of England, right into your face
And I'm walkin' home with you
You and I, we could live in peace like this, in peace like this
Because if we're lucky we might see the end of the world completely
Will ring in your ears 
Lets run away from here for good
But I will not allow anyone to succeed
This is just a test, take it with love and you will pass
I'm missing half of me when we're apart
Well, you left me here so I could sit and cry
But mother, mother, some will never know;
Keep him close to you so he'll come back to me
To take her place
I traced your steps through the city of romance lazily
Oceans of blue and a room with a view
And what can I say
And darling, you know I'll do the same
There's no universe for you and I
Let the poor find money
The next time I come by
& when it's late we'll say we're still wide awake so
And all his words keep echoing tremolo
'Cause they change your perfect dream
And I can't see the view from the eyes you look at me through, oh no
With red underwear
She opened up and laid it all right there
And my whole life too
Oh how we'd fly
Not coming home,
We can be ghosts now
Cracks in the hands of a stranger
Take the past and cut it out
Lost boy
I want to be a kid again about it
If mountains crumble to the sea, there would still be you and me
I would give you anything baby, just make my dreams come true
How many ears of corn in the niblets
Right after I'm gone
Do you ever dream of the world like I do
Julie, I'd do the stars with you, anytime
The apple falls
On my way by now
Here I am  the ugliest man
So everything else can wait for you to do
Didn't I warn you not to
That I focus on the flaws of man's offcenter tenfold
Keep it coming around
Because I'm guilty just the same
And even darkness won't stay when you come around, around, around
You wanted love to find you but you found it first
Flowing love but like water 
I don't know what goes through her mind,
And you're not gonna let 'em take your will to live
Her way to say it
Wait 'til we're somewhere closer to the moon
Blessing me with oh so much
Well, it is and if you stop giving into it
That wasn't how he liked to have his teeth pulled out
And that was where the Stones played once
The pond, it seems so quiet tonight
In a foreign place, the saving grace was the feeling
Reach the light inside
Try to make it delicious,
She wants a double
Sing me to sleep
What are we doing
Start to fingerpop
Take me, take me, home
And I shall not walk alone
But something keeps me hanging on
Wanna keep on moving on up and I'll stick around
Sometimes you'll have to do
What are you afraid of
And watch with me from the shore
Send angel's prayers
And everything matters for a second as we fall to the floor
Roll it up, baby come lift that dress then roll it up for me when I'm stressed
And he said something like this
Awaits strange, bizarre,
There's nothing new to discover, there's nothing new to invent
Mommy stumbled 'Later, kids, you'll understand'
The reflections of a thousand tangled views
Hush little baby, don't you cry Cross over to the other side of the water
You've got a way to keep me on your side
And you said I think I know how you're feeling
There is nothing outside our love
As the music swells somehow stronger from adversity
I don't front nothing
And for good I cry
Breakdown
Well you know it's got to be, something wonderful to me
That the morning is near
Let's never say goodbye
Your wings are broken
And they shall enter from the back
You looked so grand wearing wings
All dressed up like you're from some other age
As the sadeyed woman spoke we missed our chance
To stand
With anyone of all the young dudes
Teach me the way
Like the grownups did when I was a kid
He was a picture of Jesus
They don't know what we been through
But I know remorse so well
Med grabbar som han kallar bröder
Then you'll wander in my heart
From my mouth into your eyes
The small place I was coming from
That makes me feel just great, although 
Ooh, ooh, ahh, ahh
Open my eyes
Strange days, she said to me
This is the beat of our praise
And death by greed
I'm going back to the sea
She will buckle to that sound
I hope you find it
To wither the storm
Got strangled on the way
I asked a tedious guy if he'd tell me your name
We're Ships in the night
I can't breathe, nigga
Supper's waiting on the table
I gave you my hat and wore your sombrero
When I was three, and free to explore
And with that shadow upon the ground I hear my people screaming out
All the faithful heal, they're all praying
It's in the neon bible, the neon bible
I won't deny the pain
Never let it bring you down
They said they hadn't heard anything from you
How can you be sure I don't want you
With all the things that
Then in the forest I made my home
But that's no way to live a life like yours
That try to steal your breath away
Faith be true, you know the way
Looking down
When the winter was over
I think I'll drift across the ocean now
Is it time for the road
Your sentences never defined you
And you wonder when you wake up will it be all right
These are simple times
Into deeper down
She's down on her knees my friend there she goes
How many others have you drowned
Beside a setting sun
Oh, you gotta get out and get back to me
To feel so much tenderness
Or the kindness in the smile
So you walk around like you don't know me
Where you used to walk
On drugs in the dark with the one I love 
She got around
It has never been easy to cross any borders
I'll maybe tell you all about it someday
When our day is done, we shall be one
But I couldn't do another year
The snake in the basement found
Woman, don't try to love me
Or take your time
Sag deinem Vater,dass du ihn liebst
I've watched you sleeping for a while
I think that I may want a beer
The same way that I always do
The evenings fall, they'll drag me out the hall
I dream of you and
Black cars in a single line
Let's none of us forget about who we are
A hollow people bound by a lack
First to reach the stars
I tried to get up but I couldn't find my feet
Amanda said, "It's time to go"
Springtime was always my favorite time of year,
Open up next to you and my secrets become your truth
Let's down our drinks and say goodnight
My car broke down on the street
But there's comin' home
Internation space station 
Now we'll make a life
Now is there any way back home
Your only here, just for a while
Since the night he left
One second in your memory is a miracle of lies
With open arms
There when the rain came and settled on your skin
'Cause you keep you promise with me
And I bet she told a million people that she'd stay in touch
Don't stay on account of me
que está agrietado profundamente
To see you fly 
Follow the tracks
They've got a dog she named Trey
And the phone never rings
Hey kid rock and roll
It's okay, we're all going to end up dead and gone
This seed in me hasn't set
Because I've always felt lost in the crowd
A tender love as warm as May
Its thorn my only delight
Than to raise your voice
Never will be told, oh, child of mine
And love is the prize
May be just what I need
You've been sad for a while
Got no human grace your eyes without a face
And thank you for the courage
Under thousands of rainbows
I wanna be the grass underneath your feet
'Cause I don't know, what I'm getting
You cut your teeth on the lack of answers, and you
And please remember me seldom
Or has it all been done now
She remembered desires
Don't use my wings don't walk to far
One fine day you'll sing
If you let it all go, it'll fall apart
Bye Bye baby, so long next time
And love without a dream it will not survive
While trouble sings along
Don't wait for me now
Ought to be on my way
Same girl then, right now's a groupie
And that lazy eye won't budg
One step ahead, a thousand miles
You can only tell if remorse has done you well
Play the curv and get nauseous, watchin the spinner spin
And I'll give you the best lovin' that you've ever had
So come and rescue me
So what I am dreaming of
When I'm too drunk to stay up with you
No I never meant to let you down
And the strays are pining for their unrequited mothers
Some say there's a Jesus
If seeing meant that you would have to believe
Drinking cocktail wine or cottage cream and passing strangers' cars
She got tricks in the stash
The eyes I gave you
Forget about the coffee
So swim before we're broken
You see I don't want to be hurt by love again
I would like to think our paths are straight
You take my hand and I will mellow
A tragic ending
Wide awake at am
Groovy love child
Sheer disobedience
Find somebody who cares
And at my funeral
The night seems the same
It's passed the evil line today
Infront of friends and family
Faltering
Carrying your heavy old home
And you know that I will miss you when you're gone
It would cause such surprise, it would make all of their minds electric
Nothing compares to what you can bring
They can say anything they want to say 
Maybe a broken bottle if I had two
About this old coffee shop I love so much
No drinks, no drugs, no cigarettes
I will work up the strength
And all the way, you loaded all your dolls and toys into the car,
My tongue is scaling the north face of the neck
Thoughts unsung, and songs unheard
All through life
No, they can't take this precious love I'll always have inside me
Light is shed not a breath too soon
You broke another mirror
How we'd love to die more often
You're onnly lyin' to yourself 'cause it's evident in the proof
I want your flowers
And it's my life
Leave out nothing tell me everything
No need to worry
Outside and in
I wouldn't mind if I could get with you right away
There is nothing outside, above
Girl's laying down 
Your departed
I don't like how it feels when I think of him
Nothing at all
Here I am and I stand so tall
Walking away is the hardest thing to do, but I must leave
I get to play at being irresponsible
We say the wrong thing
Sol na nuca e o corpo dela
The only thing is that I didn't
No one remembers your name
Brings me words that are not the strength of strings
That have lived a thousand years
You knowYou know how it is with me, Baby
I just want to say "Hi"
She's got shine at the surface and coal below
And checking what mirrors don't see
But there's none of them can sing so sweet 
And as we talk, I go all red
And there's no more war,
He got it fixed and he
We've been in different scenes
No one is there to meet her
Is coming in and it's damp out and she's having cramps and she's so mad at me 'cause I didn't shave
And now you wanna get me back and you gon' show me
I write one more
I don't care
It's all just a game
If there's a glipse of it
I've seen the paths that your eyes wander down
That I am better left alone
Thank heavens what a fine situation
This wasted time on you has left me shaking in waiting
You're gonna see it someday
But when the bombs start falling you've got to open your eyes
Live, live, live because you love, love, love
Ja, da har du lovet bort din sjel
They were given books to poison their minds
You just stumble and wait for the attack
Might help to carry Jacob Marley's chain
Oh I'm so scared
You're the only good thing
There's a light in the room as you appear
He's got two left feet and he bites my moves
In pajamas and bare feet
There's something I'm trying to say
Until time does heal
The woman strokes his polished chrome and lies beside the angel's bones
Some bed of roses I have given you
I let the dance of nature inspire me
Never gonna be without each other's love again
Who's tryin' to see in the dark, oh
Surrender to the tune that's flown
Now his friends bring him up when they're drinking
And you don't even know it
And my li'l homeboy Poncho, and my li'l homeboy Rico
Und die Gabe von der Freude
Close your eyes, precious
I just run run run
Kick it but it won't go away
Sing a song, get you through the night
Ah You, you got a beautiful reason
Was hypnotized by a strange delight
You better hold on tight, you know
A lonesome figure gleamed
If ya ain't heard about your daughter, she smiles just like you
O carire di care tera me | O carire di care tera me di care
And she fights for her life as she goes in a store
The desperate kingdom of love
Why do these eyes of mine cry
Wave goodbye I know that I'll believe if you spell it out for me
You see the shape of things to come
What you really believe
And this one she explained looked like the devil
I'm feeling shyer
So carefree
I've lost my fire overtime
Following deep tracks, the boats kept passing by
And dressing so sweet, all the people to see
Just spin and drift and try to stay in time with me
So baby don't leave me alone
And daily there's an old drive shaft
Where everything you fear
And I never asked to feel this way, or put you off
But we ended up pulling in around the same time keeps passin' me by
There are days I believe I can heal wounds on me
I just hope that I have
Be a believer, believe everything
Has his love truly blown
Two, is better than one
They taught us how to feel, but we just feel numb
Brother, if you're feeling low
It don't matter anyhow
O come in, come in,
Like a knight from some old fashioned book
We're all misunderstood
They help me see that I've finally won
It's not too late for you to take a drive
Hell has no reason to smile
In my eyes
Livin' every fantasy and ghetto girl dreams
Travel a different road
Stay awake with the sound of my voice
It's  straight down, I can't stop my knees
Sunken with her party balloons
Underneath the missing roads
He's in love with tragedy, in love with tragedy
Fever I know your face just like a dove
I believe in miracles baby I'm forever yours, yours
At one time there was a rhythm on my stereo
We'd spend the whole weekend lying in our own dirt
And you mix that wit' a little bad advice
He wears his hat o'er his eyes
And when you get high
I still miss you so
I seen a thug cry
I like to come back now and then
Your famous last words, thought they'd never be erased
If the words make their way from your mouth,
Siamese, Portuguese, dirty knees, look at these
Something in the way you sing
When I'm wiser and I'm older
And they laughed at you as you packed all of your things
I've been living underground,
Kanye, it's, it's Foxx, man
You coulda said something nice about my profiteroles
There are no saviors in technology just quick fixes
Why don't we just sit back and enjoy the silence for a while
Who they'll kiss before they get home
They wont let me turn around
But last night on your birthday in the kitchen
And you can't make it right
Trocou o carro
Girl are we going down, I don't know,
To let go and make an end
Take us exactly where we most likely need to be
Last night I saw a ghost
Open this shit motherfucker what you doin'
I would love to go
Your heaven beckons me enticingly
Into the river we will wade
And I bet that Juliet was just the icing on the cake
I wonder what would happen if nobody left
We pretend not to look at each other
'Cause it takes what it wants and it find what's you hide
Over sea
To all the people underground
Pueden pasar tres mil años
Wind heavy on the ground
Loving the state that I'm in
So hold you close
You walk down corridors
Now we just sleepwalk We drift through the week 
So don't look at me
She shakes her face so fiercely that all her features go
I walk on down to make a stand,
And you're trying to remember, oh
Cause lately you seem less sure of this thing
It seems ill spend my whole life
Well I can't be sure where I'm headed after death
las praderas, los desastres
I'll be happy to go to the stars with you
Instantly forgotten
If you're looking for an unmarked place,
Without poverty and sickness
This time you'll find some other gonna mess your mind
From behind the counter he thought you whispered you want more
Of losing your heart
Jokers juggle in the air rainbow colored fountains of sugar waters flow
I phoned your office this afternoon
At every occasion, oh, one billion day funeral
And if the sun seems grey no light
I'm the answer, never question
Is just in our brains
And knows when yer lying
Our life begins
Why this now girl
But if you spread your wings
And the spirit of life is the will to carry on
Bless you with love for the road that you go
On my face
Tender eyes from sleeping
All the hearts they're messing with
But from here now baby I'm gone leave that up to you,
Back to what you really believe
Watch me fall apart
Oh, just place me in a box
What is missing inside me
Don't turn me away, don't tell me to go
Notes that roll on winds with swirling wings
Gon' build that wall up to the sky
So you take a little something
Because before too long you'll be a memory
She'll come in blushes
And let it wash over me
I'm begging you please, oh please don't leave here
Oh it used to be so easy
Mas você não faz mais parte
They cut you up and never let go
Would mean your life was over
Never forced themselves into my arms
Any fool can think up words that rhyme
With her costly fine robes and her mantle so green
In the dark changing place
When death creaps in to play it's part
I'm just trying to find a reason not to go out every evening
Then the room turns bright
And we could ride the tides
I ain't asking you to try it
sie sind schwer
Russell said I sounded like G, the nigga fronted
Hold on, hold on to the ones you love
'Cause I'm sleepwalking
But NASA is on your side
I spent so much time dreaming about Eleanor Bron
We're all bloodless and blind 
Can't we all get over ourselves
It is on its way
The stars keep this fire from burning out
I watched you board a train in the London rain
With your down and perfect heart
Our love comes back in the middle of the night
It's your last chance
That I have not been to since your goodbye
And these days mercy cuts so deep
Maybe we couldn't help it
Just another day
So is it true that only good girls go to heaven
It was written that I would love you
I don't mind telling you
So long my friend, so long
With body's jerking, but still I'm working
Oh way more than this
Hear the lonesome whippoorwill
Don't ever let it loose
As if the city speed
His gentleness flows and flows for miles
I'm tired of fighting, so I'll demolish
Sun's comin' down
They only tell you to deny
Touch these days and I'll kill you
Trying to find a fact to frame a fully righteous fire
Don't you call anybody else baby x
There's a new star, in the night sky
When I'm away she never leaves the house
Can't you hear they are singing
 Staring down the barrel of a 
När jag träffat gamla vänner har jag ingenting att säga dem 
Way cooler than me
It's a hustler's ambition, close your eyes listen, see my vision
He's kissin' on you
It was a strange reaction
would have intimidated any mitt that ever tried to catch her
I give thanks 'cause I've been blessed and I ain't one of them niggaz
Is from her heart within
Haul away for home
It's time to say goodbye
There are only a few things
I tell you in the kitchen about my day
Something old and new
What a time it was
Hand in hand
Your comfortable caress
But there's a calm under the waves
Says I�m alright
Soon we'll manufacture replicas
Hardening
That shines brightly, yes 
The littlest things that take me there
With choices to be made
Mr Nothing is late
He has the knowledge of the wind to guide him on
Maybe he's found the answer to all the April snow
Ah yeah, they're gonna tear your world apart
Through hot and nervous hands oh nervous hands
Irrigation in a swimming hole, nationwide loved the movie
Just take it slowly
By design, God gave me feelings
Everything's all right
Falling in love with some back lighted stranger
It was made up in your mind, could be anyone, anywhere
Every hour in the day you will hear me say
They only tell you not to lie
I don't remember it all that well
Calling out father oh, prepare as we will
In life
Ooh, stay open
Yuletide by the fireside
I wish I could fly
I get the feeling
Come back home and it don't feel the same
Got us started up again
I've got a planet on the line
Des perles du pluie
Shut in behind your young girl's face 
"Oh darling, darling, don't you be like me
I'm hiding away from the sun
Only someone running would run right into me
Floating right out of your hands
Oh, look
Until now, I knew this of myself
And it slowly goes
und dabei unverkümmert
Right next to the right one
De buen modo le pregunté "¿No se puede hacer nada"
In the city only for a while 
Nothing more to say, what's done is done
If there is a horizontal line
And all the lights that lead us there are blinding
Want to go to bed
Blending in with cardboard skies
I wanna be there, it's out of your mind
Waiting on my angel to come
On cartoons and in aeroplanes
I need therapy, they say
A rage that knows no right or wrong
And you dream about tomorrow
Heaven is of honey
You never really knew for sure
When everyone else is setting up to fall
That seem to fall every next moment
For the ignorant inclination, 'cause when there's nowhere
On breezy nights like these on nights like these
Climb three flights to tremble at the site of your already open door
Would we still walk hand in hand
Never no more to ever call your name
Longing for a night time to bring back my youth
A couple kids just wearing out our jeans, running
I'm just trying to make you see that
That it really doesn't matter at all
It's all I need and I jump over
Sure that star can twinkle
Lets just be honest and admit we can't go on
The small of your back
Blood falls from your vision
Even the brave are falling
I see that aching heart, but I was fly, I was so tall
So my love don't show
Our walks are now across
Between your world and mine
I can feel the salt upon my skin
And we can talk it out in the rain
Open my veins for your sorrow
Why do the birds go on singing
Even though the flower dies somethings by it's side
Particles scatter
Then I'm condemned to live my whole life on the curb
When you're turning out the lights
Spendin', I'm spendin' all my fuckin' pay
Who knows if it's real,
Just wanna be free
A sense of it starts breaking up, and its lies
We exchanged words
That whatever happens to you,
I remember how fast we ran
That you're always thinking of me
All you ever wanna talk about is your self and your comic books and your album and your tour
Were you ever called "homo" 'cause at school you took drama
How I want
But maybe you didn't know
And that is all I know
Stay for a while
Baseball cards poked in his spokes, his boots in oil he's patiently soaked
That the fire in your heart is out
It's your soul
And you'll never know
I don't believe that anybody
I thought I'd be singing a different tune by now
It is so clear I realize and now at last I have my eyes
That You alone are so worthy of
All of this will end
You get the feeling
So we raided their liquor stash and walked down to the riverside
That we know we need
But nothing could be farther from the truth, my love
You fill your bedroom up with trophies
You don't need to tell me
But it's midnight and I can't see at all 
Tried to take it slow
Your true colors, true colors, true colors
I feel like I'm weightless
I could see your heart, through your eyes
Like stick to the seats of the cars of mongerito
And proceeded to take my life apart
The water falling from the sky, the sun that's breaking fills my eye,
Baby, don't you know that it is understood
Been a fish in the sea 
Meaning we don't hang
'Cause two of a kind
Vessels of the sea
Respect when I'm good and love me when I'm in trouble
This love is real
Maybe, you have the wrong man 
When you remember the times the two us lay here
And we are here while you are far
Looking through the junkyard of your heart
Walked over to the window
Waited for so many lonely years
And maybe
On the way
On anything these days
That's how I know you are the one
Swears he'll make what he can of this
Sometimes we don't ask for what we need
I can't leave a house that I have built
To light, everyone's day
In her right dresser tied
I hope that I won't be that wrong anymore
Virá com ela que entrega
The moon begins to sing 
Oublier le temps
He tries not to upset the weight of conscience
To the sky in
That he had come to wound my door and jeer
Voice 
Det bor en ängel i mitt rum
It looks okay, yeah, but I've got my suspicions,
Pick up the beat 'n' stop hogging the feast
It takes a toll to make you care
und jeder Salto verlogen
Fell in love, whole loaf love
I want to live today to give You the praise
Above the sun next to us
I turned them all away
And if you look in his eyes
I sold you a lie
Why it is you're still here
I'll see your face in every cloud 
Because he's poor but he's happier than you
Innocent child
When you're living in an innocent world
Carols everywhere
I could not lie
I'm not gonna wear a ladies' wetsuit I'm a man
Will you hold me and never let me go
To anyone who'll listen
"Free ride New Orleans
Ya know
Making what is to come clear
Just never arrives
I'll prove my love if you would let me
You show
I met you on a midway at a fair last year
But I could still catch boppers if I drove a cab
She tells me things that were not her fault
Their skeletons lay strange and frail
Did you see your broken wings just flying by
And she takes her pills, and she tells her lies,
It's a long way to go
Summertime after our family broke
And I need
Get somebody to come, come on to you, then
Draped in water seduced to immerse
I went swimming in a black and silent sea
And thanks to you it will be done, for you to me are the only one
No use in turning back
When the fireworks in me are all wrong
To every song that brought you back
How to keep away
We'll sing the rest in
Go to bed half dead, what about rent
Then why do you always cry
Show me the beauty in all you see
'Cause I don't want to see you leave
My life I must live
Feeling a bit stronger
Are you who you say that you are, you
The smoke rose The smoke rose
Entre dos almas enamoradas sólo hay
My eyesight's fading, my hearing's dim
And two times two is chicken,
I could live in a different place
Harder than diamonds, we cut up the sky
Crypts and Bloods, Latin peace
Same hair, revolution, unisex, evolution
We are at war
So I think I'll stay caught up in a silent prayer
Oh tonight I will retire
They let him in by a backway
Wanna keep on moving on up to the higher ground
I know that you're tired
Someone will fix things if you let your face dry
So leave me out of all your plans 'cause I don't need them now
Frozen, the river that baptized you
All the things that you loathe
All we wanted for our love
O segundo que antecede o beijo 
Like an eagle testing her wings
Here he comes as you're dreaming
Don't worry 'bout a thing
There's forces that run so deep
Are you afraid, afraid of the truth
Stairway so unclimbable,
Something in the way she smiles
That was how he liked to have his teeth pulled out
Of his doorknobs and so he thought up a brandnew trick
You said every road is a good road
I'm warning, not strong enough to take it now
Just watching the trees and the leaves as they fall
We'd speak our minds and change the world
Some learn the hard way,
I fall asleep, you come to me
I have never known me this out of place
Ah, Bret Could you please move over to your right
And I truly believe,
Talking aloud as they sit 'round their tables
Open your heart babe and let me live
Let's me down so
Flieg jetzt los, bis hintern' Horizont
Everything merges with the night
Come happily ever after be
You say you got a heavy load
Yo, It's a black thing
If I stay, well then your tears will set you free
Trouble me or I'll go, trouble me with you
Summertime when it melts into dark
The white trash boys listen to their headphones
Summer in our sky ships, forever, sailing the wind
I come back too you
And I sometimes save the day
Believe in you, believe in me, we're meant to be together
'Cause awake is the new sleep, awake is the new sleep
But I don't think time is gonna heal this broken heart
I've never seen your love again
To find someone who
I saw her face on the back of the door
I will find something more
Oh, in its arms safe from the storms
They're content with what they've got
I met this guy he said that
Buttercups and the fishing flies
This is something that I can feel deep in my soul, oh, oh
A life that's not meant to be
Won't be believed by anybody else
Me and the universe
We'll follow the raindrops
Would you change me if I could
So they may have a chance
To lay yourself down and make it so
As he neared I felt the ancient fear
So don't you weep my little man
Fall asleep in her arms
I don't mind the shadows
It was just the last straw in her hard busy day
They kill their lives every day
And for this something that you find
And I can barely make a sound
What did I see
I don't want to see you leave
A killer is a cold blooded one
And it's crazy, it's like no one can save me this time
I wanna be in the rockin'est city
Such an infamous freedom, such a militant peace
Let's do it right here
It's late, so look straight,
And always know I won't be back
I'm breaking into pieces
Thank you, forever,
What in the world has come over you
And I'd find a way
Can't get you off or out of my head
I'm ashamed, and I need for you to know
That look in your eyes the brush of your cheek
Depended on it
You are here with me
You've been flashing white light
Through the blizzard, through the blizzard
You stood alone in the halo's haze
City bird, haven't you heard
Look so warm from here
Never be heard
The point of it all was to make much of me
As heaven blue her light fails
Together we shall roll until we die
Her baby skin, her old black dress
Oh my one, I'm so happy
They never tell you there's strength in vulnerability
Pull the courtains shut, try to keep it dark
I'm trapped in a state of question
Live seconds as a lifetime
Divine apathy Disease of my youth
And next week I'll forget probably
What I wanted to tell you, man
Away from me
Now that's the sort of smack that leaves a bruise
And then you just get somebody to now, now, come on to you
Be on your way the sun has set in the sky
The fourth drink instinct is taking over
Get back
And you've found a brand new life somewhere
Suddenly everything's ruined 
The way you roll your eyes, the way you taste
Head over heels and deftly
I've looked in the greenhouses, one, two and three
Might be something you miss
The excess disease
See her in the arms of Paul
At the close of day
That defines the meaning of their lives
Beyond where we should have gone
Hides the muddy grass no more
Who visit me from time to time
I love you in my way
Sydämeni
I wanted to be there
Olas y olas me llaman al mar
He feels the wind is lifting up his people
But then he tells me that everything is erotic, that everything is sexual You know what I mean
Carnival arms have
Kind woman, nothing more
Nobody callin' on the phone
For the bread of life is mine
Trade this hard heart for tears
Ain't it strange that I have brain activity
Loving you is the best thing and the worst thing in my life
For a better life
When I'm sick of all my choices
For some hint or suggestion
You could never be a face in the crowd
It's a long road to Caanan
Everyone's pointing their fingers
To locate the area in which you wish to observe
But you never even see me
A little girl dreams of taking the veil
I fell in love just once
Last of the pictures, catfish done hunting
She looked like a Parisian river
Or how the ghost of you clings 
And the melody's so plain
Oh take me all the way
It just reveals the perfect nothing
Bread and red wine
It's a bird, it's a plane
Why can't I just curl up onto problems and get missed of my own life
To waste it all on someone like you
True words that I should know well
Perhaps my friends will see fit then to judge me
If you won't call my name
False starts that draw the shine of rage
Call up, call up bring a rhythm and a chorus
Or a place so similar that I wouldn't be able to tell the difference
Will sleep secure, right free from injury
Even though the scene was never golden
Those words that we don't say
Where there's no one else around to hear
Although it feels just like the end
Drifting by the Spanish steps tonight
Please singin' his tune
You had your chance, but you didn't grab it
God only knows the torment writ large upon my heart
I either love it or I hate it
Them elbows pokin' wide on that candy 'Lac
You've got that kind of look in your eyes
And considering this I want you to know
But I saw the way he looked at you
Had a tough time, got a rough start
What flies, what flies symbolize,
Now it's white as snow
To emotional overdose
When did we learn to speak without works
The breath to forms your words
Sucaru vaktra mandalam sukarna ratna kundalam
Jackals gather, jackals know
Did you know that it breaks my heart every time to see you cry
A man of your success
Aš lieku be ginklo
And I can tell that you need to get away
As we are standing on our feet
It's all right, that's all the same
One mass is warm, while the other is cold
And his wife told his kids he was crazy
And taste its deceit
Then you can kiss me and say that it's too soon
y me dejaste el sombrero
Ooh ooh
Talk to me face to face
Oh, they know no more than you
I know that goodbye means nothing at all
All through you'd battle for the answers you were brave till the very last
Und der Fall ohne Netz
The finger of blame is pointing at me,
And I've not seen the night
Are we strangers again
Always in awe
A broken promise or a broken heart
Can't say for sure
Like Saturn with its rings
Oh, weeping night
I'm trying; will somebody make her shut up about it
Though my heart, it breaks, baby
Don't back down, there is nothing left
The disco ball in my mouth insinuates I'm ballin'
Everybody's born to be different
I'll always be there for you
Ma douleur crevait les cieux
No, I can't give you what you need, all by myself
I wish you well and hope you find
Bank account found minimal amounts when countin' cause of my now exwife
Oh, he was ready to impress and the fierce excitement
And I simply needed space, space for me to be
Living for only one
So do something
Müde lausche ich der Dunkelheit
To set light to me some surprising day
It's almost right
My woodgrain oak, I'm ridin' on Vogues
The purest light
They tore it to pieces
We sing ourselves to sleep
We laughed the happy afternoon away
And I'll be waiting there for you
If you push me down I will try not to care about what might me under there
If you let it all go, it'll fall 
You make it easy
When I come home
It's green and it's cloth
So sure that I'm losing faith,
And let your thoughts drain
We'll find someday
Rusty spring uncoils in a baby bottle
Give until there's nothing left
Look deep INTO the April face
Here comes the shrimp boat for
Train tracks
I can pray everyday
But in Worcester, Massachusetts
Our hero finds his inner peace
Now I can see the light circle around your reflection
Let me remind you
From the faces
Maybe I'll write this out or maybe I still look down
This chest is full of memories
Cause every moment, every second
Come ride with me on a wave that's tidal
Dreamland is showing the dark of my past
And I give you peace when peace is fragile
Because that's all you've got
The world on a screen 
If I fall, if I fall if I fall
For striking out the rain very clean
You came into my life
Baby says I can't come with him
Her beautiful heart is drowned in grief
You're the one I'm talking to,
Both of them dead and gone from extreme old age
Bet you thought you'd get away, didja
I'm not asking for more
'Cause I've been a bad, a bad girl
Feels so hard to say
They lost their faith
But never meant to last, the clowns that passed
Quizás será el cassette, ese que le grabé con el ladrido de él
My soul feels so old
Ins Dunkel 'rausgeschickt verfusselt sich die Zeit
There is no middle ground
Crawlin' towards the door, just the same
And I didn't know I was lost
Waking up slowly
Just you and I, a summer sky,
From nights we don't remember
I couldn't bear to let him down
The women in my life be confusion and shit
Now when I see you, it's so bittersweet
Either way it's fine with me
Nightmares and violent shapes
Channeling angels in
Stay strong, move on, keep on
You need that buzz to come alive
Never had so much, was afraid to keep
Even the season's change
We won't be afraid of getting lost in the sea of emotions
I don't doubt it, no
One day they will be as giants
Break it, 'cause honestly the lie "I try tirelessly" is cowardice
Know all of the things that make you who you are
Far too many of you dying
I know she's watching that star
There was a time, dark and divine
The truth is clear
I guess it's best we say goodnight
I wanted a mystery that couldn't be solved
Combine 'em just right to make fuck the valley fudge
And bring his victims here
You know I believe in how
If your lover ever leaves you
And let them all to cleave
Ohhh, and I'm on my way to believing
Of what I'm feeling
I see you with all of your front teeth
And nothing's ok
We are seeing the same thing
Strained in darkness
It lulled me to sleep
They make me look so clever
Que sempre me passaram
That just can not be controlled
Give me a warning
And set fire to the curtains
Like clouds in the sky
All the region trees go the same way
All that I know
A demanding physical need
Were the only three people who ever really lived in Las Vegas
Attracts me like no other lover Don't need no other lover
Still I wanted you to know
Zoramena
I would like someone to make a map
Everytime, I see you girl, it throw me off
Can it be we've run out of time
And up until now I have swore to myself that I'm content with loneliness
Comes to a dead stop
Life is designed With unfinished lines 
Until the end of time
Sometime I don't think
We've opened our eyes,
Ren som en blomma, skygg som en hind
I've got your voice on tape
I do bheatha sa tús, sa deireadh
She says it to the dark "Don't go"
Who liked to wiggle his tooth loose so he could show it
You're probably thinking that I'm getting mad at you
We'd take a Saturday and just circle the mall
At six in the morning the ice in the tree thaws into the millpond returns to the deep I caress where my lover once lay by my side before I turned inwards and forced her to fly we try to connect with the people outside they pass through our slumber like trains in the night I caress where my lover once lay by my side before I turned inwards and forced her to fly after the cold night the raindrops that froze melt into the thin air like the footsteps of ghosts I caress where my lover once lay by my side before I turned inwards and forced her to fly for she could not know me for I know not myself and without understanding love isn't enough
Depends on how far out you go
She doesn't know what's wrong 
That make me cry
'Cause all I own fits on my back
And you love them
und nach unten zu fliegen
But not now, maybe later
Like plants the medicine is everywhere
Look at where we are 
I want you so badly you know, that it's a pain to wait
You call upon a higher power
But I miss the blues, I'll miss the greens
I hear you say
Go to sleep my little man
I can't get her out of my mind
Just lay your head back in my arms, girl
Dressing doesn't mean a thing to me
But you and I know the reason why
I've seen with my own two eyes
To my funeral when my days are done
He'll have to walk home tonight
So take my hands, love, there's a burst inside our minds
The Earth swings
I'm cruising the town, diggin' the scene
When I'm far away
I'm the weatherman
Not so complex in design
I know everything is all right
Spoken Frankie, where ever you are, I love you
Our hair is in the garden
Dizem que não sirvo pra gostar de ninguém
Oh, be my rest, be my fantasy
Kun jäljet sotkeutuu liejuun
Could that have been back in the sweet summer of 
Tell them please, how could they know
It was a hot and sultry afternoon
Everybody's got a hungry heart
Brings you sounds you thought were gone
London, did you have to take my child away
You called me out from the dark, and brought me into the light,
Drag me down
x I'm gunning down romance
Je suis le musicien, le mec sur le microphone
Maybe this wind blowing in just came from the ocean
This whole town is haunted
December won't you come
Do your thing my son the world is yours
You were part of a dream
Sä olet kuu, mä olen maa
Leave the light on
Barefoot servants, too
Start holding us down
Reminding me that I'm alive
Happiness the goddess lover
Let me open your eyes
Like apples tumbling from a wild and windy tree
To share forever the unrest
Guess you got my line
So I can watch somebody doing something
With accusing fingers
You curse at girls
And then to have someone like you
To never move, to never chase
The hand is dealt, the cards are played
You need a dream to drown you out
To come out from under the covers
Step outside yourself and let your thoughts drain
Of her face and of her feet
There are very many ways
The color of lights and our lives become as you
It was way better than sex, now, now
Inside the mountain, I see fire
Of nothing
Ich hatte viel gehört über die Stadt der Liebe
As a reminder
Back past the place where we met
In a melody sustainin'
Well, a nation turns its back and gags
Onto soft green pastures, shopping malls, or bed
I see you shivering from the cold
Days, you gotta run,
Afraid of what I feel
If he could return the love she showed
Love at first sight may sound trite
shteyt nisht, brider, lesht dos fayer
Hair is falling to the ground 
If you don't know why
I just want some coffee
Off his grip was loose and just a bit
I feel I've lost my individuality
Through times like these
Just a little bit of rain
Where people are pleasantly strange
And if I were you, I would never let me go
We always somehow managed to keep a straight line I awoke, the dog
The sunlight swims away when you come around
They come to me
Filigree of time remaining
But the words just come and I write them as soon as I see them
Went out to fight for peace, liberty and all,
No requests and no orders
Let me hold you until the morning comes 
If you must make me blush
See there once was a boy
Will you catch me, make it alright, looking down I, see your face, yeah, if I fall now
The Buick's in the drive
Will carve a thousand leaves
With love is lord of all
You know how we've grown
See backback thenthen, if you had a car
To set light to me some surprising night
Won't find it in one place
Wipe the sleep from your eyes
Of your kiss, those moments after
At the shyness that surrounds us
Me and him are outlaws now
For the time of day
oder nur im Kreis
And the headlights, and the headlines
I want to wait until we die
They worked out so well
I was just so happy in your boxers and your tshirt
Yo, It's a white thing
I feel music in your eyes
Have I let youI'll never let you down
Was dreading the ride back to Little Italy
Young William O'Riley, appeared in my view
And never have enough to lose
Your silhouette over me
Wearing that smile
Nice and slow
And laugh when life amuses them
In the heart of the country
He took her hand
Everybody's got a hunger
A memory tells us that we're blessed
Make way for the lemon parade
To take care of each other
Come into your room
Are you eyes just singing the blues
In the evening of your years
One not subtle, one not on the list
You make my day
Smokin' pill and lovely too
When you're specially designed for crash testing
I'm still forced to remember
Left my dog on the ranch
All I want to do now, is to try my best
The time has come to return to Earth
Scent of the pine, you know how I feel
That she's cried while he's away 
There's just too much that time cannot erase
Keep haunting the bus with fees of favors gone
I'll keep you warm through the winter
Oh Lord, why did you forsake me
From a mountain of frights
Well I don't know I don't know I Don't think so
Let's pretend you've missed me for a while
To nothing
It has a wonderful way
Everybody's walking over you
Always keep thinking
Hanging over
The women knock upon my door in odd and even numbers
If the stars say that you can not love me
And we fall through fate,
To my people in the streets
You were like an angel
Bang van komen en jouw gaan
That lie near the Moorlough Shore
And I've been living underground,
But I know that it was not meant to be
There is no other way
And there are many who despair
'Cause I've been burning all my aspirations down
He thinks to himself, this alone is a wealth
My heart remais
Going out to colour them mountains
Come fly with me, let's float down to Peru
And I stole the moon
You cannot spell it out there are no words 
But the head's to the wall and I'm lonely
I know you hear me but can you reach me
And all you gotta do is find a sword and a stone
Oh boy
'Cause I can't even stand it
When we live without fear
She goes by the name
Was it the home, the car, or darling all those thing we thought we needed
My heart, still beats, for you
And she bites through necks like a Ginsu
All those girls you love,
And all I've got is your hand
You thought you had enough
I have water for my journey
Open your heart and let me live
Never miss an event, helping them with their homework
Remember the words of my life
The sunset cloaks
When I'm gone my little man
I have gone to the moon
I'm still looking, looking for the summer
Tear drops falling to the ground
But his feets never been on the ground
I confess I've overdressed the mess I've made of my life
Once again, they forgot about J
was ouch der vverlde unmuoze dâ, 
Ore di care deum deo | Ore care deu
Love can last forever
Never look over my shoulder
Say the word
For a thousand reasons that I know
And let me see those eyes
Says your cheapshots won't be able to break bones
I think y'all love me, but y'all place other rappers above me
There is a better world
It's your time
Something in the way she woohs me
I'm so afraid of losing
Free to fly tonight
'Cause I know one day you'll see
The sun is going down
So just reach inside your heart and pack your bags
Why bother to awake
Forgetting ain't easy
Have never screamed so loud
Why this frightened part of me that's fated to pretend 
I will always be waiting
If my time is tabled and my clock is on time
If you would shine your love down here
The scent of smoldering leaves
Arrival, new arrival
What a sound, straight through my spine bounced off of me
If I caused you pain, I know I'm to blame
And it's throwing your dollhouse world in disarray
And it's over
LA fever, made me feel alright
Ghosts stand waiting
And I still like you, the best man
Well what was he sneaking to you 
Kiss every comma in your checklist, commas in your checklist na na na
I'm far away
To make you smile
On an old dirt road, where the sun doesn't look like such a waste
Standing on the outside, looking, looking
Just wanna feel your kiss
I wish I could just get it right
Never said it was good, never said it was new,
Across a cash crop car lot filled with twilight Coupe DeVilles
With the lights out
The closer you are, the more I see
Could never, ever be enough
That's not what I believe, and it doesn't matter anyway
E ora siedo sul letto del bosco che ormai ha il tuo nome
The ceiling or a roof truck, come out and steal our thunder
I need the rules but not the regulations
And it takes some old to make you young
So your mouth tastes like sunshine, baby, but your eyes are all cool buried in my arms
Jag fyller snart sjutton, sa Cecilia Lind
To you in bed that day
All your childhood crutches
I see the fire, I see the end 
Is it over
Pounding brain
In a different place
Go off to school and don't come back
I feel I must protect
She's got everything I need; pharmacy keys
It's a grave that sings your song
I feel sick all day long
But it couldn't be any other way
In my dreams
But I was younger then
Like when you want it easy and you've got an uphill climb
It's the happy things
If it's a broken heart then face it
It's only been a little while
Up among the clouds I see my face miles below
When the blood cumma down his neck
And six beers later I was wild
Every perfect piercing line
I saw three shrimps in the water
Faith is difficult and murder them all
I'll miss dreaming with you
You don't have to hear my heart beat
Even in sleep it seems flight's unattainable
Who will take me home
And run with me
Of what looks to be an evil empire where shortterm earnings mean everything
Shock to my body as we tumbled in
And space enough to thrive
Do you feel the same huh
'Cause I'm a reasonable guy,
I'm getting bored
I'm gone, and you're still there
And long gone fevers reappear
To speak is a sin
The young people of the day saying, 
Through the city streets
Je sais qu'il reviendra Sois forte
There's this well of emotions
And finally now, believing
And the hours go by like minutes
And God knows I tried to leave her 
That your words convey what you mean
, leagues away catch up to you on the same day
Been over this
Is every bit worth it, I can't let you down anymore
Do you hear the silence I was far too late
You'd feel what hatred brings
I can see that I have kept you in the dark
Or right after coffee
Because I feel my selfesteem is caving in
This ain't the way you wanna live
This ocean of youth
Now boy, just use your charm,
The light that sets you free
I'm in love again
Following the river of death downstream
Give me a boat that will carry two
Sun been down for days
I've been ruined by destiny, lowered by fate
But with you there at my side
We are drifting and the laughs are few
Whatever you are
Positions himself in space
Forever yours
You know you'll get yours yet
For the sea like navy men 
And you're really a million years old
And I can guess how I want to be loved
Explanations you say I deserve it
Simple is something of a mystery
I won't you hear you sinking down
We would zig zag our way through the boredom and pain
And turn and close my door
Your looks are laughable
Your coming home but before you do
Just remember that you talkin' to me though
Blame me for the thorns my friend
There's so many changes, and tears you must hide
Your house, your house, your house I will explore
And touched you in a dream last night
I want, pretty baby, where the sky is so blue
Well in this lonesome meadow
I'm the man who won
Send a message to the unborn child
She is lovesick and ever so strong
Talvez eu volte a ver
Homewards, he dealed with scarecrows
And that's when I'll feel the sun creeping up on me
Been over and over
And her memories filled her with light
You're gonna be the one who saves me
Ungeduldig ersehne ich den Tag
Things turning inside out all the time
Red and blue city lights
I believe now 
Where tears are invisible
They wanted me here just to show you my face
This innocent child
John, you gotta get out and get back to me
You know,
He said each day's harder to get on the scale
Fake a heart attack, you gotta get back to me
I'm consumed with desire
We were giving up ties and everyone knew it too
Dust has settled over everything
So try to feel somebody
Of gold and silver tears
I admit it
Read in the news
Laisse le vent prendre soin de nous
I been in the ring and I took those right hooks
Looking further than I can see
All the colors were bone light and sky new
And did you ever notice
You can lose your fear you can change your life
I started searching for a better way
I knew you'd find that note someday 
'Cause I believe in silence, x
Ooh, there's a grey ocean
Sleep on, dream on, sleep on, dream on
It's the most alone you felt
Am bothan bhig san fhrith  
See here, when I die make sure I'm gone
I keep the ends out for the tie that binds
You'll get a glimpse of the truth
Skip the hills and cut yourself up on runaways
Your limbs will grow strong, your body light
Just Take a look around, yeah
This old house is falling down around my ears
Har startat litet företag
And all you want in your eyes,
The shadow grows without ever slowing down
And we do things do things over and over and over again
Yes who's there now, can I help you
It's about yourself and the life you couldn't bear
And the sun as it shines
You're saying bye
And beckon for the sweet, soft, summer breeze
But I saw it fading and I have some faith in us
Und ich hol Dich ein, wenn mein Glück mich nicht verlässt
Can't stand and wait on a miracle
Lesson lost again
I don't know why you think you got a hold on me
I wouldn't make you stay
And she twinkles
And yet I feel you, looking my way
We're all wondering where you are
Their song of birth and agony
I even know what it is
The sky goes on forever in a symphony of song
When we pass on the streets, I won't look away
I know you're not evil
Pictures of people that I'd like to meet, oh meet
It's the crummy lost at seasick with a floating on the waves
I'll break down if you come around
They tried to help but they didn't see you crawl
But still at least we never feel empty
And we'll say "Let's never leave"
And Sunny skies has to stay behind
I get so busy and I shut you out
Nothing seems real
Here comes the rain
Baby let's go
And it burns straight through but the devil don't mind
What we got is hard as hell
But this one's slit above the knee
We can live a life that's never satisfied
They've given you a reason to fight
Too young to fall
But it's better than sleeping by the wasteside of today
And touch your face while we're both sinking
I'm just a step away
I am here and your heart
You have no body, just a cage to hold your parts
So let me, let me go
Some men call me sinner, Lord
She was brave but she caved
Some future in my eyes, bright
They look just like me and a lot like everybody
Into the morning light
Voices have left me
With my sorrow in hand
Then they're gonna know now what never happened for sure
Hang on to your wallet, hang on to your rings
Aunque tengas preguntas
Can a lie never burn so bright
I catch myself having fun
Erwarten sie hier jenen Tag
I'd surrender all of mine
So, he drove me home in the van
Just how you make me feel
Man nimmt das Leben sonst nicht wahr
Bobby stands behind me, feels my pulse
And there won't be a party with weathering frocks
Open this shit nigga
Baby, I can't sleep at all until I see you again
That may never be
Your name here 
But I'm looking up the skirts of the stars
I'm off to the war
Als wollten sie entfliehen
Sleepin' peace when day's done, that's what I mean
Nothing told us where we were unconscious fell
Baby got 'em up open all over town
Hypnotic, it sounds melodic
Right after You're gone
Got to remember, morals and principles, reppin your name proper
I hope that I'll fall asleep
Like remnants and doubt from yesterday
Before they've come to grief
para ver deitar o sol
Why tear our world apart girl
Your head will swell
I sleep in these dirty sheets
Everyone's a writer
I need to hear You in the silence now
I didn't know didn't know, didn't know
Every time you look at me
They pervert the words of god and man
Whoop somebody ass, taking my boot out
You wait
Nothing more than a longing for being uninvolved
If it's so, well let me know
I don't want to hear it
I don't know what's right and what's real anymore
Like silver screen photograph
Ist der Weg das Ziel,
And I'm standing on ice when I say
And when the sun runs out
I miss the days when we were crazy in love
How can you love me then just leave me behind
Rest your head
Don't looking for him lady yeah
Olas y olas me llaman del mar
I'm home
She never said you'd only get one chance
We'll melt away before we land,
'Cause I'm ready for the fall
Bald Krank werden
Freeze frame this sedate moment
It's given free
You give and you take and take what you got
My shadow played a bass clarinet
She's walking away, she's walking away
Than you'll do
Wave a white flag, put away the pistol
He crawls like a rat inside her spine
And when I needed a friend you were always there to lift me up
You can have my heart
Miles away from my heart
I wanted love without the build up
Like an ideal falling, tumbling to earth
We'd spend out days travelin'
I'm ballin', money jumpin'
Overhead
She was like Shakespeare's Juliet
One step away
I got out my camera and was laughing
If I could just draw a line under this stupid way of life
I think I'm going back, I think I'll go back
Bleeding thoughts
I just think that maybe
How can you look at me as if I was just another one of your deals
Will you fade away x
The moment soon will pass
It's a love you'd kill for
In this honesty
But she never let him see her cry
I hate you I love you
And let the guards be terrified
We'll face the winds
Orange in the streetlight
Don't wasting what we do,
But I know the way I feel today is out of sight
I head for the shadows
I'll find time to throw us down 
Near there I spent my youthful days 
Sleeping by the Spanish steps tonight
And the fat man failed to get us passes
And the sunshine shone from the sunshine above
A place in the sun
I'm exactly where I dreamt
Don't have enough for the ride
It's in the season
Maybe I fear my mirror
It's the first time I see summer on the Westhill
I'll write I'll rerecord these times,
Girls hate when niggas go missing
I'll just think of you and you'll still be
Oh please, just a little more time with you
And if you should look back
Hold me in your arms tonight
And the saints, the angels all agree
We got to hold on
It's all up to you to do whatever you choose
And we'll heal our hearts
'Cause we got such an amazing friendship and that you don't wanna lose
And waved byebye as you slipped out of view
It's not me you're looking for
Bringing her down
I squandered my cash to pay the rent
Alright, you can cry
Deliver me, courage to guide me
Love, I hope we grow old
Into the night
Wait for one more sunrise
Keep it hidden 'cause you're not too cool
Always to thine own self be true
Where my family kneels to pray
It's here I must wait
'Cause I can see the light all night tonight
Underneath the lights of the city sky, baby, ooh baby
Seems long since summer time
I wanna be, I gotta be ,
Heaven and hell both take to this woman's womb
Leaving everything behind 
No, I don't want to be the only one you know
You love me yes you do
And slaps you like a wave
When the mornin' sun appears,
Mutta silti onnellinen
If you have any thoughts
How will they hold what they can never perceive
But I'm alright, I'm alright, I'm alright, yeah, I'm alright
'Cause you'r egonna be housebound there
And every time we kiss
Are beautiful, beautiful like a rainbow
I want to see us work, dear
There is no way to be free
Copped mad cars, laying back in the driver's seat
And I'll be there just to see the sun
How you get your adrenaline flowing now, now, now, now, now
My memory a traumatic sponge and sings to you
And sweet babies cry for the cool taste of milking
And as I count down from ten
For there are many here who hunger
I am sinner,
That's why I know you are the one x
Call me raincheck, need a shot of rhythm and blues
And you'll never forgive me, though I'm doing this for you
Oh it's always the same
I need a little more time with you, oh
One day closer to death
Pray to God when I die that I live in the sky
I've clawed it back
They want diamonds to wear
I know you had to leave me standing
For such a long time I didn't know if I'd find you
Deeply pulsing up toward the surface
Tell God I wanna fly, let me live in the sky
She's not the only one, remember that
But infinite sympathy's completely gone
Is more than enough to know
I never liked me anyhow
Down from where the trains go flying 
So heavy a heart for someone merely ten years old
They say
Vrajangana sunayakam sada sukha pradayakam
Open all your windows and let the music spill out
I wanna be like everybody else
You could never tame
To my people doin' time
You don't know if you can
That was Magical Max
Wonderful
So for one moment in time you'd find that you're mine
But till then no, Daddy, don't be surprised
I, triumphant, stand off dead and tense
Memories always stain, you can't wash them down the drain
Easy money, ain't life funny
And I'm open knowing somehow
And feel no shame
Down in the valley, the industrial estate,
That sing of alone
Have to come out soon
Where we'll sleep on the beach
Straight from your heart into their sight
And she fights for her life
Well I come from Alabama with my banjo on my knee
From the thunder that came, I was never the same
Everyday you feel a little curse
I'm a pulse wave
But in the end,
Watch its insides twitch and smoke and rotate endlessly
Someday you'd return it
Wall street is a ruthless mistress with a quick and painful judgment
So we keep waiting
Everything's gonna be alright 
And the world is yours
And feeling a little,
And I know in the cold light
und es ist schwer in den Regen zu sehen
The man needs a maid
Pick up the phone line
'Round and 'round till it breaks and
Wanna be on the right end
It came to us and us, we must, we must turn to
And our hearts nearly stopped at the sound
That I could never conquer
So fast the day go past
Die zweite soll ihr Ziel nicht schonen
All that I'm saying, a game's not worth playing
I don't know what more I can say
You make it look so good
Don't you worry your head 'bout a thing
Don't take a picture
Karma payment plan
But so hard to see at night
With roots that reached out for the sea
One heart in space racing on
Soon losing track of you
Within half an hour you
Yes I need you at the dimming of the day
And the bells keep ringing
You're my kind of girl, no diggity
Ever defrayed your soul
Ought to be on my way by now
Out of mind
To flatten the skyline and begin again
Poor bastard
Maite genuela elkar eta
The skies are blue, it must be tears,
Oh, wasn't it a long way down,
How did you know
And if I could believe what I want to believe
They won't know who we are
So in truth I saved you
And the birds as they soar on their wings
I wrote a song that I wish for you to hear
Everybody gets a little scared like this sometimes
I really want to go
Until it all just falls apart
I was strong, clearminded and blind
There is often a significant difference in temperature
Can't stand it anymore
Their face beaten and blue
Look at the state I'm in
Like they could burn forever
To tell me you're alone
And I gathered up the gold
It's a place that's not so far
Then there's me, just love me for fun
Leave the great indoors
If the world ends, I hope you're here with me
Meet me out when I'm want
He's captured at first sight
By now you should've somehow
Never to see your face again
I ain't even know what a record advance was
So I won't be afraid and the darkness will fade
Every other face is bent and broken
A little of yourself tonight
Come to me let's drown
It's completely normal
Don't throw away my broken telescopes
An angel kissing on a sinner
Please can I have the rules explained again
It's a long way back
Been over this before
And you'll spread your wings and you'll take to the sky
Tomorrow will come
Could blame the devil;
You keep an eye on the driver,
And the same refrain continues
My senses reeled
Here comes Dick, he's wearing a skirt
Not to make much of me
'Cause everyone is a fucking pro
With rap dudes, thinking wow she moved me
Baffled by the lies we blamed
Take their passage into night
I am done
I know you didn't bring me out here to drown
For your eyes only, I show you my heart
Nugutte agetai noni 
I know I haven't said too much
Lord I pray that you will listen to my plea
Dull, blank and lusterless
I hear the words you say
las piedras, los pájaros son
Rings on the water caressing your hair
Touching the very part of me
It wasn't open
Oh I do, I hope you're singing now
Trespasses stretch like broken fences Hope to mend them one day 
Ain't nothing but a tragedy
Strong behind your young girl's tears 
Long way down
If I told a lie, if I made you cry
I want to make you feel beautiful
And in the moment I knew you back
To bury the wave in the tide
So you don't talk
Love in these modern times 
This Butterfly Effect
All the pimps and prostitutes wave you down at stopping signs
I don't expect anything
For me to pretend that I'm somebody else
I'm going to stay right here
How you ever gonna pick up the pieces
But I just have to tell that I love you so much these days
I kept the photograph upon the dash
When will it stop
Don't come to me with forevers
Possibly regretting some decisions that he's made
If one swept the world away
'Cause there, there's a light in me 
Over a night
Is your figure less than Greek
That shit around you is lookin' dumb, it's gettin' hard to accept it
It's never gonna be the same
vorbei und verschwunden
Now I'm left here with those dreams you tossed away
Dog star taught a dance
You've been waiting to break since you woke up this morning
Whatever happened to those lights
For anyone like us
And it's gotta be here
We got the money, we got money, we got the money
As the world you know begins to cry tonight
Would you like to learn to love me best of all
All the people in my town would be born
Sometimes I forget sometimes I don't think
Don't you dare look out your window
And I won't care, I won't fight
It's a passage to another world
Don't you shiver, shiver 
And your breathing will be pleasing
And one turns into four
I'm standing in the street 
The things that you love
And who needs peace when we've gone above
In my life in my life yeah
Ao me ver chegar
You will be the one who cannot talk
You can run out of pity
Anywhere's Amanda's dream
My lovely protector
I'm losing it but you're the same
"You could be waiting your whole life
To show the things I feel and to tell you what I meen
Still felt like she could ask my time
Mean Mr Mustard says he's bored
Go away
The juice pouring well over
I don't think I let you down,
And sometimes I feel you
You carried my heart in the night
You're gonna forget 
January days and their scarecrow trees
'Cause I will be there with you
Down towards the happiness that you deserve
Thinkin' I've been fienin' for a taste of this shit
And capture the deepest thoughts
Zu der du immer wieder rennst
We played hide and seek in waterfalls
In the night, I hear 'em talk,
Cross my fingers and dream on
To light everyone's day
Rakennan sun sydämeesi taloa mä rakastan sua
Lost without a way
Barefoot at night on the road, fireworks blooming above in the sky
I can be questioning my thoughts
Never turned her way
He takes his chance with what he's got
Forget about the bad times
Is washed away like an oceans tide
I know who the hangman is
I'ma plan to make it, a prisoner of the state
We can't help to watch this whole thing crash together
Broken hearted, separated
Young wild and reckless is how we live life
Bin ich doch zu etwas gut
Songbird's singing in an old dead tree
Your face it haunts my once pleasant dreams
This ain't no game of kiss and tell
You kissed me on the forehead, now this kiss is giving me a concussion
Well you, quit kicking me under the table
Hearts will make it easy
You can make it last forever
Disconnected from choices we make
It's here his love is swollen in
Could have another use
Only love can bright your day
Today is the only day
They just ain't no use
Ist das Leben ein Traum,
You and I'll be safe and sound
Some small reward
And don't it feel all right, and don't it feel so nice
With hair down to here, and plenty of money
The three miles 
Like I miss the ocean when I go to sleep, 
All the things you did and you said nanana
What I feel for you right now baby I can show you how
Nigga you get in my way while I'm tryin' get mine
He's nude as the news, nude as the news
On the day that we met
And butterflies that long to tear away
I do believe it's true
There's something in your eyes I see
Would you take me for a ride
I wish I could have seen their faces when they heard the news
Nothing rad, nothing right, nothing I'll feel tonight
And I won't betray the things that I hide
Ich leck das Salz von deiner Haut
I was waiting, we were just waiting
She wants a moulding
And dragging back home under her control
She called the wind and then it came
You just left 'em with nothing to say
Wins a broken heart
Right now and right here
Plus he had his family out, let's say she the eyewitness
It's not that I don't understand you
He needs some time alone
To the dream,
How does it make you feel
Only uncool will travel on gravel ground
As I walk up a street
You look like a kitty
But its the way that she interacted
An' up the hills yeah boys let's strike for the hills
I just had no idea that this would be lasting for just one single moment
Hawk flying, is fooling his folly
It takes the dust to have it polished, yeah
Oh, my God, we don't got a penny left
Whenever I go, you stay with me,
So deep and so strong
E a manhã nos proverá outros pães
Didn't mean to leave you hanging on
Now I feed the birds Day after day
Bury everything you own
But you get the feeling
How do I know
At least for a little while anyway
Polyester, pink gingham  cracked my head
Go roll down the window 
So you live from day to day
I wanna be like that
To see the empty road at happy hour
You can take comfort now
One more night one more train
Is knowing when to let go of her hand
The hurt across your face
Reconsider what could be done
I think I'll go for a ride 
Took me away from sight and the place I know
In the middle of a wrong, dark road
Contemplation, grace, sensual pleasure, union
Well not really, but anyway 
Lately I can't be happy for no one
Every time I think of you
Please Mr Lostman
Mit dem Mofa nach England
To the furthest place you'll ever be
Close your eyes and forget your name
I want to love you, baby
And I'll dream a better dream for you
And did you ever think of yourself as a runaway
Please just chill wit the violence
All of us are going down
Just look over your shoulder I'll be there
Crank the volume now the song is all mine
Drive by the scene,
Think that you've worked it out
I forgot everything I knew
Now look
I've loved that soldier boy"
And I can love you till you drown
Used to be, was a part of me felt like hidin, but now it comes through
I don't want to fall another moment into your gravity
'Cause when I close my eyes and drift away
The air is thick and foggy
You have nothing to prove
Search through the darkest waters
Hatte Stress ohne Ende, meine Frau die war schwanger
Can't choose the situation and friend
I love you one, a two, a three shoobeedoo
Pakko saada aina se mitä en yleensä saa
And I believe we were friends
Who let you pick up the mic
In my life in my life
Lino, yellow formica we didn't know
Käre bror han vägra svara om
Wandering over the hills unseen
You're always welcome
You could move to a past time from the radio
A spoon of sugar sweetens up
Though they may just be absurd
'Cause love is around the corner
Confusion, all this is for the gods
Death's angel looming in
They love a man in uniform 
You could hold moonlight in your hands
Brother you were so right
Wap toujou rive byen lwen
You are the roots that sleep beneath my feet 
And all that famous harmony of leaves,
fand es wieder zu uns zurück
Dream of morning's golden light
To be loved
She danced like ninetytwo hundred songs back to back
On the brink of illusion, it's the devil in my eyes
When the one thing you fear
That they have to choose pushing for peace, supporting the troops
Please just let it go by
I can't figure out why I feel so ashamed
Adam and Eve on a log, you can sink 'em damn straight
Beyond my dying day
And if I ever hurt you it will be in self defense
I've checked the phone, no messages on
Springtime and turnoil
I'll stay inside and find a pitch that sounds right
Voices are here again
You buried him under rent and low pay
I'll give you the room you need
So, look up
Mrs Johnson never taught me those verbs 
Deep in the snow, breaking your heart
Don't make, don't make, don't make a joke of my art
In the purest and simplest of ways
You are the laughing stock
It will pass It's gonna pass
Jeden Tag treten sie ans Licht
Makes me want to give you my heart ooh
Her brother lay upon the bed 
She was all in white at the foot of my bed
Better at your game
But you're waiting, why're you waiting, why're you waiting
In das die Sehnsucht sich begab
And I know that I'm in a position of controlling, anything, I by that ocean
Each time I have that dream of you
I could call it many names
A sound that it makes
We can share our breath
These wars, we face only keep me in my place
I know you will
My hands are shaking,
Perché domani sarà un giorno incerto di nuvole e sole
You'll see the ones that lost their minds into their hole
So in love
And you know just how I feel
Of an overdraw
'Cause I can't be the one you wanted me to be
Oh I could sail the world
Ahhhaahaahahhhaawhoohoooh
You'd better beware ah
I'm not cruel and you're not evil and we're not like all those stupid people
I'd chase him round and build like that
Meu querer, meu dever, meu devir
Hasn't anybody told you
How come
You were still there
Oohoohooh, oohoohoohoohooh
Reactor reactor do you mind, straighten
May angels lead you in
And water rolls on off the round captain's belly
And me, yeah, where the sky is so blue
Till the end of time
Ships coming home
You make it look so easy, baby, babe
With their prairs, and loaded guns
I guess I've never known
Says I don't need you physically around
And you said it would be funny
Tennessee morning leaves you paralyzed
All those things you have
Lit by candlelight and chandelier
For the sun to rot
The light color in the room
Through the window you tasted much sweeter
Stay wait until tomorrow
Remember I breathe, I breathe
And 'Tell my mother not to worry'
And she taught him how to fly
For all love ambitions
Oh and now I wouldn't mind getting lost 
Loneliness confounds
Hope feels so unfounded
Lady future's arms are lily white
And at home, he's a leader, a father
Something has gone wrong
Colour she light a reason to stay
Describe to me how I look
And I don't fear death
I want you here with me
It has started
And what you do to me is unlike anything
Even if it's not what you need
I never stole a happy hour around here
That nothing could be further from the truth, my love
My horse was fastest but yours di okay
Divine purpose blesses them
No, no, not today
Hey little bird  hey little bird
I could never fall for an empty page anyway
And did what others knew
I hope I make it through the day
Take a trip, down memory lane
Let your mother's bible burn
Your body may be gone, I'm gonna carry you in
Nobody else above you
I haul up on my gentlemen,
Emptiness fills time
Burning the trees
I put paid to the devil
Let your unloved parts get loved
Still I continue
Slow down 
Is there something I'm doing wrong
And I do not want what I haven't got
We'll get out of this mess
And now I'm left with nothing
No kid, they don't give me a gun 
To say a single word
And when she reached the river her knees began to shiver,
Say you're falling apart
Every time I want to say hello
And at every light where the roads will cross 
I hope that you're only
For their song seemed to suit me
Little takeaway girl
Den mit dein weißen Steinen
Packin' my things
Who'll change their minds
Just promise me faithly
I'm happy you're beside me
"Baby come home"
And the consequence was a negative
If you've got eyes
And that don't make no sense, but baby, I'm the shit
And I can't keep my hands from shaking,
With your mocking bird hair
Didn't go to work just went to bed
I can't find one
Follow me down to the laughing city,
Please do not drive me crazy, crazy
That's why we're waiting
This gnarled, weird face
And if the stars should fall from the sky
Would you be my friend
Never be alone
All this time,
You make it look so easy
The demon had a spell on me
Which not right actions can withstand x
Turning over every stone
Guided by a beating heart
Can tell the difference right or wrong
How do we know
Slow this down
At Waterloo we went our separate ways
Are you thinking similar things
The world can be quiet when you're up too late
Can't I just sleep for now
The ones overfilled
It will pass in time
Where can I turn
You close my eyes when I just need to go and see
But now look, just another day
When I'm swimming in your ocean
But I don't wanna hear
She pours you a drink, the table starts to sink
Oh I had a friend 
I'm damaged, so how would I know
That Died the time we said goodnight
I'm sleepwalking
Dreaming for us, darling
The way it falls on the side of your neck
So fall in love
Always not suiting their needs at this time
You said the urn was half full when I said it was half empty
'Cause I didn't believe what I'd been hearing
Oh, love is so good
In a dream
I don't want to see you as the next in line
Come to the water, play in the water
Nothing's as it seems, you can be redeemed
In your hands
See you walking, see you talking
I wanna go where my thoughts
And everything I flip, you know it's something serious
The shrill cry through darkening air
Can you hear the beat of my heart
And away he gone night
W te dni to godne
You're gonna be the death of me
Can't go back
I knew that I'd found you
Same great heart, still away
It's just another day
How I will protect, and how each day matters
It is pure and clean and all I want
That chills her darling to the bone 
To cries of, "Amen brother"
I know that I'm alive
Look at what doesn't care
Still I took all my chances, earned myself an even score, tried to learn my lessons well
Doesn't happen quite as bad and the burnings dry skin
Always not to exaggerated fights
Oh misty eye of the mountain below
When you discovered that it's all the same
Ordering in all friends and lovers
Your heart will take you there 
If I wanna see the tears in your eyes
To bring my eyes open wide
It's a tune we both should know
Lay your burden down on me
It's a sweet summer's night on Hammer Hill
All summer and after fall
Not an hour from her home town
Yet you're my fav'rite work of art
And close our eyes and hope that we'll be fine
I love the way, try to call now
I'd hurt them and I'd go scot free
And I never react Never react
Oh when they pause to consider all my blunders
Oh, you're not a friend,
Well, the night eats up my body heat
The last lighthouse
With open eyes so we could see
Suspects a thing but I wish I didn't do
And I see your true colors, shining through
And I don't fall of the wagon you know
Wearing all your panic inside out
I must return to my body
And burn them good, real friends they would be understanding if
Or make me feel home
But I've got rainbows planned for tomorrow
Guide you to the light babe
While seahorses played
Let my shadows prove the sunshine
I see all those boys again
It is pinching the flame
Too much time spent
Instantly antiquated let's wash our hands
In the mirror everything's reversed
Under broken shards
Just gotta go with it
You're praying that you'll make it
Has the end occurred
What I'm fighting for
Just wanna warm my bones
Oh you'd have my heart
I told him I would have to say no
It's affection always
There's no way of not making it right
Put you back in and
Let the grass grow
Am I a burden to someone
Komm her, lass mich das Feuer sein
E poi scuse accuse e scuse senza ritorno
I took my darling out to the aquarium
Tearing down all the walls and love, the chaos
This house is full of secrets that i
I was selfdeluded
Beautiful things
You've come to save my life again
Then it's over like none of it ever was real
Under ice there's a world moving slow
Of running around
Tomorrow's just an excuse
Kun ulkona hämärtyy, odotan sinua
Then hold on, hold on the to the ones you love
And I'm still fact, she's fiction
I never wanted anything so much
And if you should nervously break down
Don't know if I want you to understand me
Where the pass over I looks alive much as anything
The limbs of life left low
Your fit of insanity makes me sad
Because none of it was ever worth the risk
It's part of the game, catch me in the coupe switchin lanes
I was sleeping, I was sleeping by the wasteside
But love is no dream
Then came the rain
All my lovely life I been waitin, hot heels anticipatin
Living on Sycamore street
And I keep on wandering
And I find peace when I'm confused
Fated obscured by the passing time
I fell in love with her longing
Until we fall asleep
Our love is broken
In the calm, taking in stories
When I've gone to find my ain true love
I got jacked in a really bad way
And fell through the skies
You wont know me till you need me
You happy enough to stay
The way you drive honey scares the hell out of me
Give me shelter or show me heart
Wander or leave
And how nobody wants honesty when looking at a perfect frame
And if I stay Lucky then my tongue will stay tied
Fall the gather, forward
I never gave him nothing I remember
On the radio, do you have to go
You run around and you front like you're still on fire
I stretched over to reach you
The way you say goodnight 
With no air to sing
unausgewogen wie Zeiten des Leidens
There is a house built out of stone
And we laughed all night when they said
I wish that we could face
Oh, desire can cause heart attacks
Let me run through the water
It's neither heaven nor space, it's just high
Beyond the silver moon
You plucked out my eyes
I'm gonna take you down
Don't break down my concrete girl
Mine inside of it
Angry sun burn down
And if you move to the right 
Or said, or how you stood that day
me dice que todo se ha marchitado
Someone to rely on as
Without the blanket of sorrow
Tear it all apart
There are only pieces, pieces
Tell me and take your time 
Could ever feel as unaligned
Try to find the other side of you
Speak from my heart
Beat me in the kitchen, and I'll beat you in the hall
No one even mentions my casserole
That this is the thing you do to me
It's so cold
On what a pair we'd make
So get it now
Read both your sign and mine
She sleeps like a girl
Now an unexpected peace comes to the day
We do a whole lotta laughin'
Take your time don't go running away from this
Or you'll never unwind
From the palms of your hands
Will the sunlight heal the core of your body
I was waiting, we were just waiting for it
Oh sing your
Forgive me but I think my time is drawing to a close
I use to live for the weekends ooh
Know that I'm just wasting time
Who turned your way and saw 
Of whatever room I can
Where will I end
And take me through another night
To this priceless ballet
Yah, She's my butterfly butterfly butterfly
They gently let me play
But your soul is never lost until the deal is signed
I won't let you slip inbetween
Wouldn't you say you were lonely
And two lives that stoop to notice mine
'Cause ten years ago we all strived to be twentyfive
As the wind chilled my bones
The brown shoes are old
And the sight of you is so in my body
It ended when I lost your love
I wasn't alone
There's a song on the air
Another top up for a change
When I've got nothing but my achin' soul
Like you've had a hard day
Would like to believe that someday,
Don't know if I want you to see through me
Smacked up again behind the door
Och Jonas ska hitta en mening i nån indisk by
And proud as Priam murdered with his peers;
This is so laughable, whatever happened to
And you can try to cut it down
Volturnus, Africus
So every lonely night, I sing this song
Bleibt zurück mit ihrer Freundin
You know we keep talking but it's so frustrating
Now I understand just what you're playing 
This one time I flip, call the radio
'Cept for the Pope, maybe, in Rome
You know I believe in how You know I believe
He's so far away
Just tell me one more time,
Girls love to fuck with your conscience
With my heart in my hand
But that's just not the way now
I fucked up and I know it, G
I wanna piece of the air when I breathe in
Than slow growing fear
Just take a look
And I can't expect that kind of love from you
No water views but so close to the sea
Now show some pity for the weak of will
Cause the podium's as high as the gallows are low
I will love you for the rest of my life
Right back and let it in
I promise I'll wait awhile
And I, all I really want is you
You're here to stay
He comes from east and west
It takes a thought to make a word
And when you cast away and you feel like home,
Unafraid of the death that left me hypnotized
I'll make it bleed fate, racing to the gate pleading "take me in," I'm
And who needs keys when we've got clubs
Masked as care
Every time I want to stay I go
All we are we'll never be
He's the type to fight God but not a vice
Just as I think it's done
We could ride the tides
It's our last show
A decorated splatter brightens the room
Evolving on a thought that you've half realized
Like frozen trajectories of superheroes
Num céu de estrelas multicoloridas
No senses
And she don't need advice that'll center her
Shine like broken glass  
Peace in your head
When I leave there's nothing left to say
You gotta run for your life
Let's see if we can remember
Powerless am I to fight this avarice, I'm
Some Minnie Riperton will definitely set this party off right
I'm insideoutsidein, I want subdivision
So many worlds inside her eyes
The joining of the tin man
Repeated lightning strikes
Outside in the distance
Must have slipped your mind
All I'll ever think about is you
I need everything I've done
Enjoy this life right now
And I dreamed your dream for you, and now your dream is real
And you know just what to do
That you didn't follow your dreams
I don't love and I don't talk
Float downstream one by one until you realise you're free
A little Anita will definitely set this party off right
If you want to find yourself by traveling out west
Beeswork
How we stayed awake all night long
The day I wept
You know your baby mama loose, but ha, what can you do
die Spur hinter uns hält uns zusammen
But my love
Came to an unmanned sort of harbour
You're toothless
Und irgendwo in Holland
To be perfectly candid 
But it beats the alternatives
I've put a spell over you
Nobody knows
By one who really loves you
Sure makes us weird falling down
Wanting bracelets, never had a rope on my neck
Oversee the living
Oh you know I saw a city burning Fire
Wiping my floor, wiping my floor, yeah
Seem to say we're the same
Which one is yours or mine
Snowflakes in the air
Honey 
They are dead, they are dead
The oak throws its seeds to the sky
Impassable
Never ever thought it'd be this way
I first set my eyes on sweet Molly Malone
Because 
For the women, weed and weather
But I've been there too, and I swear to god
I bring you, and I sing you
The good times never have to end
Didn't I tell you about the dream I had last night
When those sad eyes close
Smelled of childhood remnants of a dusty weeping willow
Momma's gonna buy you a glass eye
This world is turning too fast
These are a few of my favorite things
One more dime to show for my day
In the blink of an eye
Life is loving and letting go
Winding dying inside sucking outside
From the bruise of her lips
Show your face now and then
Drive slow, homie
Perfect starry nights
How many years since you found yourself
I couldn't hear you singing softly to me
I just want to run and hide
We are lost in the folds of one another's topcoats
Who lives in your house today
I'll come right back for you
To know you all wrong; we warn
You know it can't be bad
I feel music in your eyes
I didn't get turned on, I just got turned
Seem like all I got
There's no one in the world who could replace you
'Cause I want to kiss you and weep
I get so shaky
It was only a matter of time 
From love to lust
And keep your arms open wide
I'm lost for words that won't mean a thing
We have feelings We have feelings
I found an old rock in the dry dirt outside
Let me just be such a deep surprise
I lay in the ground, wait, lonely for you
Something we will never understand
Holding her small daughter in her arms
I'm just the kind of seafaring guy
I wish I was in a mood to die
They will say "Tom, he was such a nice guy,
But the stars are dancing bright 
Just let me love you
I was honest when I told you
Misteriosamente a lua sobre nada
Don't disturb this love of mine 
Are your eyes just singing the blues
Well, at least that is my memory
A tragic heartbroken human being
I wonder why she's making all that noise,
It's time for you to be with somebody outside
He's happy so leave him alone
Someone looking for or finding some
Wie der plötzlich immer weicher, nasser, größer wird
I'll be by your side
I will feel so glad to go
Well, I'm sure you could have made it that bit better on your own
And you and I can get through any weather,
And he feels like he stands by the gates of hell
And I doubt you was last here
As if they knew
When shall I see the sea
You're too good looking and mistooken
It's all because of you
I run, run, run, run, run,
But I would like to believe
The moon has blocked the sun
When all those shadows almost killed your light
Let you fall for every empty word I say
Not for good or bad just not forgotten
Never goes away
They couldn't believe that shit about you
Seeing the future
'Cause I'm a gambler that just wants to lose and be allowed to leave
Lighten up, you know, lighten up
But I know that I love you through the hole in the sky
You to feel Mine to feel
Hon följer i dansen precis vart han vill
The beauty in your eyes
Kill myself, the guy in front of me
But still you look down on the teenage dad on
Wishing that something would happen
You'll never hold that stance
Even if it's nothing they ever
And I remember your smile
There's a freeze on the branches
Consuming thoughts, consuming time
We are surrounded by all of these lies
You kept it together today 
His dream is my dream, my dream is his dream
Julie Christie, the rumors are true
We wear strugglin' chains, divided only hustle remains
An ache, a yearning
Of the times when our hopes die
Outside my window
Stories I've heard like a man on the moon
I was falsely accused
Susanne, don't you go on and cry
The fiends are just fiendin
I love you I love you
It's what I'm feeling, too
I'm begging you please, please don't leave here
Calling out father oh, stand by and we will
And be at my show and you'll see where I should go
I had not had any sleep
Oh yeah What was her name
Because truth this time is an ugly child,
Users always say
Visionless
River so clear and mean
Who's talking to tigers from his cafeteria tray
We can all control the sun
I come back too 
Ihr Business läuft hoch auf Tour
I'm walking away from you tonight
You will know, cause it ain't hard to tell
And too many moonlight kisses
I'll prove my love
But your coat is big and I am warm
And I'm swimming through the ashes of another life another life
It makes you look so alive
But your mind plays tricks with distance
When I put my arms around you
I come through in whips that make a young boy take the long way home
Minne, aller herzen lâgaerîn, 
Please ocean cloud
Hey, let me live in the sky
He's in the sand
Oh please machine, let's keep this terminal clean 
We've opened the door,
Someone lovely and she's bringing bad news
que a pesar de que dicen
Feel like I'm blowing the glow of the sun
But not so deep as my love for him
'Cause, I'm on my way, yes, I'm on my way
Tears will fade away
And our hearts were singin'
I want frozen lake
To get over this heartbreak
A cold sound in the air
And have no fear
Disappear forever, and ever
And I am a breeze in the still August air
And I can't fight them anymore
Oh, if you ever come at me I will hurt you
And help me realize that I won't live forever
Hallelujah's in the morning
You're my silent angel
If it's a broken part, replace it
Ooh, would you please lay your body next to mine, ah yeah
About a boy
How can a love that will last forever
I should've wrote a letter
You got to be my little man
Yeah the truth is you're not alone
I remember tears streaming down your face
From where we come
Could you picture Russell needing a check, man
Slowin' down, down, down, down
Burned our faces red
Neither of us wanna play the side no more
And everyday I wore your face,
Trough the door
I just want to say I'm so sorry 
Hand it over
The earth looked like it was lit from within 
When the ocean met the sky
Et quand ma langue se délie
If you're scared, I'm here beside you,
All you know,
And his friends said he'd fail if he tried
There's too many
I got to stand here two more hours till I 
You're never here
As if to see the light
Won't matter now
You've gone away
We must always be thinking
When you were mine
Are animals and things on vines
I'd go skating to the other side
Is all we've got
He has a message waiting for me
When we were crazy in love
Time, is like a dream,
You know I know who that you love
Changed all the things that have made me Entertaining, thoughts are raining
Your thoughts are colder than a stone
Our lives must change
Cry like a child though these years make me older
I made wine from the lilac tree
Bela como a luz da lua
We could smoke 'til the sun goes down
The music that comes from when playing with precision
And how the wind knocked you down
But we are nothing
But I've got lots of plans for tomorrow
Wherever you are, whenever you speak
No matter how hopeless
Dead water lies
As you fall out of your clothes
For another broken promise
Hey, I can't make it go away
Hey, maybe should we ask it could our friends be worthier
Silver wings in a fiery sky
Let's see who can get down
I watched you hold the son in your arms while he bled to death
Our love sometime will start and end,
Cracking boulder
Children, bring your kite lines to come and summon the wind
I was scared to call your mother
Of my heart
We've been waiting far too long
In peking there is someone who
allt det jag säger dej 
I'm and old show and I don't know what to do
Over that first floor, over that old hotel room
Pick a place to meet
But I heard something inside you with my head to your chest
The same old streets just a different name
But life's just one of the games we play
"There was a boy
Walking with me towards a midnight swim
Bits and pieces of love for you, so sweet and simple yet
You will be rewarded if you do your very best
And watch the sun rise
Cosa importa se sono caduto se sono lontano
Oh my God, look around this place
We can drive until daybreak and then I'll rest
You have a lovely singing voice
But it's a long long way to go
The wires all get tangled
Watching the day lie down instead
City bird, maybe these hands that feed you need you
The planet poisoned me
When people say it's sad
Puedo ver que en amor el inicio tiene tanto placer
Then I got up and did it again
I don't know if it's my illusions that keep me alive
And should I fall from grace here with you
They won't believe me
What if you were meant to be the one
Though I know not where it takes me
At every occasion, oh, I'm ready for the funeral
Let someone do your thinking for you
Har han varit där och jobbat
And kindly stepped away
He's running out of time
So I did him in
When you discussed your love for lust, just make sure you visit here first, Cali
I know you're worth
You store it up, unleash it, then you piece it together
And sit back down where you were sitting
I was workin' hard, but hardly workin'
How could you know
I want you to be mine
I have learned this from my mother
And it's depressing that I can't forget the tune the organist played
And I'll be your memories
That move so fast they grow out wings
Since you've been gone
In the holly red in the night
I hold you in like a deep breath
Never been so resisting
i Could try for more, I could settle up for less
And your sheepskinlined coat is eluding me still
I felt your shape and heard you breathing
And fly back out
This angelic child
Won't you come light the way and wash this away
Silently I fall asleep
This country's starved, it's void of feeling
One could touch the universe
I see it's really hurting deep inside you
Why are you crying
Is to know me all wrong, they warn
Ins verkabelte gepanzerte Versteck
I'm no light weight 
In this devil town
Down, down, baby Down in the in the center of this town
No instances from time to time
Is for their mothers and their daughters
I don't want you to change;
Give me no dreams of what the future brings
Let the moon glow
Great big place
Where we learn these values I do not know what to tell you
I fell in love and I needed a road map
I try to find forgiveness, in takin' what we'll never share
Our lower middle class directions
And I can always tell
So tall and wild and evergreen
I'm on the right track, yeah I'm onto a winner
Don't try to understand
The gate was open wide
All the times I had to give
And still my heart has wings 
What I need is for you to follow my lead
Found love, last summer it faded away
While he'd tie it to a doorknob, wind up, and then slam it
We know your only worry now is,
If a gentle rivulet of flame
Show me your spot and shawty I'll show you mine I'll show you mine
Your sofas' old, but I am new
I've fallen quite hard over over you
Oh here's your love token the gold ring I wear
If your lungs are aching
Heart of the country, where the holy people grow
You can compliment me on the style of my hair
To form imaginary lines
Who've left their pride on the other side of
The drowning down of man
And the bridges we burn, only light our way
In our garden of love we grew
I got yours
You might need too much
That talking is sexual
Mistakes that you made when you were down
And I can't help
Where it all began with all those dreams we dared
Sometimes a heart can break and make its own relief
Mm, when I was quiet
We spend the whole days all
Through smokefilled mouths
You bought him presents with my money 
You know you make me so lonely
But what I did made him fall dead to the ground
All for a happy end
Anytime she goes away, Anytime she goes away,
Her skin was darker than ashes
Summer's blowing cold
And if I leave today no memories remain
You say you feel a chill in the season
Take a look around now, yeah
Why do I do all this waiting then
Because there are things I've got to say 
Snug as bugs inside your love come into our room 
I was made to keep your body warm
What more can I say Welcome to LA
Your denial still persists
Gave my wife my devotion, when she died the ocean my tears
So be strong my little man
J'ai foutu ma vie en l'air
And though it was predicted
We sat listening patiently, the sky was near
I'm just a hazy girl
We'd never get it back
You need me to put you in the trees
One more dollar and I'm going home
First to slowly fade away
From a cloudy sky
I'm going home someday
But it was too damn hot to speak that much
A photo from father's aunt
We'll dance like flames for there's no gravity,
Peel the cover from the city
You're overcome, but NASA is on your side
Under the waves, falling away
Give me back your glance, give me back romance
Forever is
Like a shroud, it covers Bleecker Street
"If you were here lovely Nancy I'd be willing to die"
With nothing but disaster
For money they don't need
Of a darker world that no one should know
Might cost a little more than money
When you could just stop and let go
It's like I can taste opportunity near
I'm running late
Beside you I see myself
And tried hard to capture his breath
That's all fine for you to say, but I'm too shy to even speak
Burned our faces round
I know your tears wish me well
Alone in the mirror, you look at yourself and you smile
When you and I could still be friends
From wondering what I left behind
I'll remember who you are
Yeah see this jus st period but we got alot more ta learn throughout tha night
Wove with regrets Upon a golden string 
die liegen jetzt in meinem Bauch
I watch the coloured animals across the floor
Every day will be a holiday
Here I am all alone
Those eyes quietly tell me of a passion we could share
Star crossed lovers, we do what we want to
Like the moth flies to the light 
Flying Fairies
The evidence of those who failed
Bjartar vonir rætast
A lifetime melts away
I understand that you've been wounded
Even knows it in the dark
I was happy, just getting some answers
Don't get him wrong, and don't get him mad
Let it breathe, I control, California living till I am old
That I wanna stay here indefinitely
Although I didn't mention
Ain't that the way it always goes
Every day is just the same
Sunlight beams in your hair 
Lead off the big front line
You can't cry but you'll fall 
Better run back where you're from and join the mass
Noticing the days hurrying by
Barely breathing
Oh how we'd fly until we hit the ground
Like a fever
Get a new place out in the hills
Just beautiful lies
We pretend not to care for another
Of a perfect night
As soon as the afternoon has begun,
Try to find a way to make more time, but things are the way they are
And a gold world for me
They say that it's okay, but I say don't breathe that shit in
Like a prince in your little fairy tale
In sleep
You can just make out a lonely figure there
Sul tuo sorpo così dolce di fame così dolce di sete
I hear people singin'
Tha ceo air a bheinn 
It's like I can taste opportunity near
That the world's gone and left you behind
This moment's ours to treasure
I climbed a cloud
There is a view that reaches far 
Here on the path of love and meaning
Still too young to fail, too scared to sail away
I don't want anyone
And no one ever said it would be that easy without you
Now I have some shoes and a big coat
Sure babe, I'll take you home
Don't you remind me of someone 
What time is it
She sang the blues
You're so hypnotic on my heart
And hallelujah to the one that we love
The smell of anything
Come sound system make the rhythm climb
I decided we weren't gon' speak so
Vor dem, was du fühlst,
You led my dream to the horizon,
You can have the rest, you snake
To let go and forget
I want to tell her that it's ok now
You ain't got time to settle down
Well it's sticks and stones and broken homes
All of the while I never knew
It's just a ride, it's just a ride
And I can't see a thing
Riding on a wave of love
I'll stay here forever
Won't you tell your dad to get off my back
She said her name was a secret
Now we lie beneath the sky
You didn't like it, you resigned
Been burning through my head
I'm not certain how much time I may have left, so I'll be brief
'Cause I was made for loving you
Esta tarde de sol me puse a mirar
And you ought to know 
Now feels like forever
We are survivors in the night
You let me hold you tightly
That he'll be back someday 
But they'll never throw it back to you
Her room is painted heron blue
So we can let the moment stay
Dinner at eight was okay
For the faces
You can be redeemed boys, you can be redeemed
If you get lost
But I never look back Never look back
Bum bu bum bu bum bu bum bu bum bu bum bu bum
Like the diamond that cuts the light
We were looking for the summer
We both realized it was way too late
Close comes the winter, summer is no longer
Coral reefs, strange grasses and rare things
Someone has brought me a new straight costume in an asylum
Just to see them fall into the lake
Sempervirent, rosetum
I feel you
And it always
Restaurant talk of pick your teeth
You whisper signs
Come, go, break your bones
We slide down, deeper down
You trouble me
Inside of someone else's place
Girl singing
In strange ideas, in stranger times
Suppressed by all my childish fears
And your ghost will have to leave
We are like wild geese in Summer
It's way too late to think of
Like the fire needs the air
But I never got to grieve you
The snow came falling now
Win me back, win me back"
Rouge Gemey sur les lèvres Le soir tu fumais
And with empty stomachs and hungry eyes
And I've figured out with all that's said and done
Whose face is known in the territory
What was yesterday will reform today to retrieve lost life
Anywhere the wind blows
Can't afford the French Quarter high
Oh, this is the start of something good
Your mother is drunk as all
'Cause there's still time to change your mind 
Across the sky
Or that of my heart,
Depending on a prayer
And you got yourself a new friend
You've a reason and so have I, it's true
Feel from my feet
But you been hanging 'round
Everybody's happy
And you say not now, maybe later
Of these places that I travel through
So hush little baby, Don't you cry
And turning black
ja tästä ilman sua ei tuu mitään
En faire l'affaire de nos sentiments
dass da was Grosses naht
If you want it I want you to
Like fourleaf clover
You've opened my eyes
And seven years I will wait for him 
She says oh well oh well you do just fine
Of the love we vowed would never
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Because my destination's wrong 
Everybody's got a reason
For the lonely fool
A helping hand or a kiss goodbye, to ease it on it's way
Forget about your heartache
You lay there like a thousand mirrors,
Wonder where your heart came from
om tare tuttare
Never rest, never sure
The scorpio is rising high
Wasted all my days over you
Those days of fear are gone
What can I say any simpler
And trusting mind
Oh I wish she would know
And don't let it go far
I am a breeze in the still August air
Brown paper packages tied up with strings;
Tired of cheap flowers, cheap candy, cheap champagne
I never come around
And give you my love with sweet surrender
That is why I want to be with you
Don't back down, concentrate on seeing
They say the Carolina heat
Pretend I'm not up here, I try counting sheep
Until the day he'd see them
All my limbs can become trees
And we stared from the windows of school
Doch nur Schweigen in der Ferne
All that I want, all that I want
Some depart but a lot come too
Some men call me saint
Something's coming this way 
I held the stars to light where you are
Climbing until they find the rooftop don't stop until the icepicks
Their heads in the sand
You searched for this your whole life
We stare across the oceans waves
You looked like a princess the night we met
I wanted my life's work
You got no place to hide
All that you ask for comes for free
I know you've read, so many books
When you say your prayers tonight if you make amends
With all your friends she's gonna meet there she goes
It's easier to say it's over,
Maybe I want to, maybe I need to
I can't do the talk like the talk on the TV
After all, we were more than friends
I read all sorts of things 
And something is happening
I was flying into Chicago at night 
I don't need to look
Oh, how we try to wrap our minds
In the sunheat
Away, under the Moon
Or if I'm just looking for an excuse for us to break up
It only works to dilute you
Few emotions are shown
Vou sair p'rá ver o céu
And heaven is the whole of the heart
There is still a Lord
White Iverson
And she might love you for it
I guarantee you, you will never see nothing like this again
Tonight is alive with the promise of a streetfight
Gonna' show them
That someone really cares
I know, baby baby can't you see that another fella just may be the kinda man you need
It's just you and me now honey
And luck won't save them tonight
Like you're still right here
My heart is frozen underneath
Down, to revisit the dearest of my kinfolk
When noone stays to wait
If you just give me some time I can open up your mind
Clareira luminosa nessa escuridão
Does it matter much anyway
Grace and hope
The coldest heart you've ever felt
There's no need to be sorry for yourself
All my matter's expired so I run
But I won't believe that you were faking
Say it, I can say no more
But on the inside
Then you must lift your head, keep it there
You are too kind, much too kind
Patiently the fawn awaits the day the rain's gone
Homie I don't know, she's hot and cold
I need that money like the ring I never won, I won
It was who taught me how to write these kinds of equations
They've got 'em buried deep
River so clear and blue
Cover me up
Gonna make it alright
Looks like I've been the sole nobody
I remember you walking away
This world is just illusion, always trying to change you
Wind sounds angry
Your sea of doubt become your own belief
It's okay because one day we will be dead
But I can't get over how the sun looks on your face
Most are shocked, some don't care
Så minns att jag står bakom dig
In the corner of a darkened cell
Her arms red and injured
At the failing of the day she heard her father always say
Turn your radio on
Und mich, und niemanden
He got me a time,
You'll never be my destiny 
Believes in me
Mark my home and draw some lines that match
Would you feel the same
Jim Adkins & Rachel Haden w RH subdued
ich seh Dich an beim Näherkommen
All alone in this great big mall 
Sleep tight tiger  sweet dreams till tomorrow
But oh no, no the sky is falling
Just take my soul
When it all comes down to a sunrise on the East side
Oh so very slowly
Son, time is all the luck you need
Sich mit ihnen neu versöhnt
I'm alone but I know everything you feel
You got on the stars
Tha ceo air a bheinn  
Forward Drive Green lights Green lights
So just cry your fears, yeah, I need you everyday
Calling Intel station light
Dirt under my shoe from the old at heart
Now you wanna run away but you can't
Not coming back,
It breeds a world of anger
I'll hold you and touch you, and make you my woman,
Not knowing the truth
Just do it, whatever it is, whatever it is,
Feel free to touch me and we can play hard
And I wanna stay here, so just let me be
Send them home
OhDid you want me to change
When you touch me
Sind uns're Sünden längst vergeben,
'Cause the truth is I'm not alone
Of things left unsaid
Just checking out the scene
Ooh And the years keep rushing on
You want that girl
The sun is out but happiness
Even if your cheap career
A slategrey cloud
Are you still with me 
De outros oceanos
People say they're never gonna turn away
I could wrap you in your favourite clothes
Baby, understood, sunshine, starlight
Now don't say a prayer for anyone
If most of us are cheating
It may've been the first of mistakes
But you'll regret the day
Only simple truths
Oh, but still we want it, oh
The open road is calling and begging for us
And I'll give give give until there's nothing else
And all I want is all you need
Não me deixe ficar triste
I just can't let it out
And we'll never be apart
Slow motion daylight
But it's myself I need to blame
Get robbed and that's the part where my pistol ain't no help
I wished your love away
I don't know what I've seen
You may tire of me as our December sun is setting
Try to make you see that you're
Hanayo lives in Berlin 'cause she says the rent is cheap
They whisper in the top of my tongue
I'm sorry I never read them
Who makes me go
Came home late one night
But I know I'm out of my mind
Hands where you wanna go
But tonight it never comes
Way home
Should've thought of that one first
Riding on waves, walking on sand
For a legacy of love
Swimming Watching concrete eat the ocean
Damn I ain't never felt this way
A keepsake to forevermore say
When I get in from my work
Tell me love
So helplessly caught in your tide
This love tonight
The softest voice said to me all through last night
Some say its in the stars
With my childlike heart
I just got to see
C'est la vie quotidienne, ça se passe sous ta fenêtre, sur ta planète
Happiness is such a fickle thing
Oh sister, I am stumbling again
Something bad happens and a lot of people go
And we used to play the same pizza parlor pinball
Inside a sheet of flame
And that you're always late
That tug at the truth
And it feels like it's tearing you up
He broke his own heart as I watched as he tried to reassemble it
Modosetanara 
Mr Ex and his oldsuffering wife
Don't take her out of my life
Look for the girl with the broken smile
The role that he chose, the role in his home
I want blank
A little girl dreams safe and sound
This love's mine yea yea yea
I'm biting my tongue
I think I might give up everything, just ask me to
Just to let you know
Storm warning, storm warning
I'll put the shadows
When the spark is out, uninspiring
I won't answer my phone
If you feeling like you can�t believe
It calls me to his holy place
Just as long as you're out there bringing it in
The only truth I know is you
With broken teeth and busted head 
And I ain't wondering where you are
E se quiser saber
Wait to last winter, love of any kind
And though my face is smiling I'm really feeling low
Give yourself a chance to breathe
And I will get lost into your eyes
Hard times have helped me see
I mean something to you
Don't stay too long, I need to hear those words you use to tell me
I'm running, running
The pictures are empty
Where is someone
Won't you man up now and
The only thing I want to believe
I still feel you
I chose to act and it broke my heart not to rap
Face the morning sun
Alejandro Tremell Morgan, man, I miss the shit out you, my nigga
And times like these are getting to me
And I don't want to die
To never lose sight
For now I'm just a candle trying to stay lit in this windy night
Well maybe two is better than one
Feeling old, too old to fight
The biggest thickest ever sky
It'll leave you with nothin' to say
Didn't I make it clear
And the hateful memories
Play me first as long as we open up our eyes
I know it's there, I know it's there
Or turn away
Good times come and they go
And let the summer rush in
Everybody says
Each step is moving, it's moving me up
Like a poor man's Boltanski
I'll be here when you come back
The way you're busting out of that wifebeater
Lord grant me patience, I am burning up inside
Make you windy windy
En hljóðið var ekki gott
I grew so old in that house I lived in
Everything pauses in the night
Don't make no difference what nobody says
Involved in making plans for my soul
Picture yourself riding under the freeway
You say, lately I've been bothered by my friends
I try to reach out but it's moving away
What did you mean anyhow
Are the things that make you blow
And the only light to guide us
And it seems like it's always so hard
And I wake up everyday in the same place,
Oh, please fulfill me
With sticks and glue until she breathes
The moon is yellow silver
Leaving broken down pieces
And if you're still sore
I fell asleep in the chair by the fireplace
Like the violence in dreamdead eyes
Her fever dream a language on her face
And she will live always 
Today was gonna be the day
I was gone, so gone
We were giving up time
Staying in control
Realize how much I need you
Sitting dead the sinker and the string
Have you heard it breathe
Above we go on without knowing 
They'd be the same brown eyes
And even though it never worked
Tell me, why you're feelin' this way
And you haven't told me anything at all
Better call the undertaker
I'm yearning, I'm burning
And You are the Savior and
A spill will blister, learn not to leave skin exposed
'Cause there are quiet truths in pain
Amidst my foolish pride
You could lie in the face or the look 
Leaving them in silence
The sun will rise up, and you'll be in Freedom
No one never really has a clue
Maybe I'm just returning
But this shares no resemblance to that
Que le puse a la noche durante un mes
Like all I ever do
To get home to doc
To shadow an endless dream
Time to spend some time alone
Within my eyes
If this world makes you crazy
And this much I know
My veins are poppin' from this love inside
Yes fate is cruel sometimes,
I was here from the start
Some roads are straight and narrow
If you want me to be blind, I will stay here
All my folk who ain't alive, I hope they live in the sky
Everybody wanna visit for Women, weed and weather
I'd love just once to see you
Between mistakes and new beginnings
Yes, I remember who you are 
As the neighbourhood gets quiet
And they've just gotta hear it
Trying to be your friend
My nigga said he wanna fly out to get him
Chemicals can make us stay
Moving out tonight
I regret what I have done
Her heart is full of kindness that she's
When my life divides
Feat Wendy Stubbs
A long life you'll lead and The Way you'll under
But please remember me fondly
When all is said and done I'll still love you
Nel tuo ordine discreto dentro il cuore
Painters look to sea, the colors burn out
There could be a world
Ripped off in your marteau
I'll come right back for you, for you
And the problem's my honesty
I have to do this journey one more time
How could anyone tell them that some things are not what they seem
Either way
And he was my only joy, 
Your hands protect your eyes
And startin' some shit when I'm in the zone
Tiredness fuels empty thoughts
I like the way you work it
Unusual people
I want your love, I need your love Too late you changed your mind
How many eggs make up a pound
Zein geltoki zen,
But it has gone too far,
The best thing that you ever, ever had
Not afraid to close my eyes
Everything is so boring and clean
There's something in your eyes I see;
Well, she's washed up on his shore, there's no time to get into his life
Through the eyes of my parents' tongues
Is as meaningless as it sounds
Shake my arms, shake my head
And it looks like mine
The pressure just keep it real
If You Understand
For me, to be waiting
If there's a chance for me, then I don't care
Here I can almost live and forget you
Is it your heart
I'm talkin' to you now
Just because
With a hairbrush and an air brush
I can't believe you're giving it all up over me
Shine your light
Now I see the termites crawling into me
In a way it is I guess
Could you spare a coin and a Christian prayer
I never was the kind to make a fuss
It was Dallas to the library
And kingdoms fall
This is what I know of shame forever
Once I get you up there
You're so far away
Silent angel
I sing a new lament
We'd all stick around if we'd all stick around
A smoke ring rises up into the sky
I lived a lifetime, a lifetime with you
Fever I know you've come to take my love
Today we will sell our uniform
May we never be called to handle
And said the trapeze act was wonderful
All her children's fears
And how I wish I could talk to you now
Well let's go home
Where I go to sleep alone
I remember when you held my hand
Under your skin, wherever you go
From her mother's eye 
A specimen like you I would love to obtain
Her eyes were made from pieces of the moon
Me enseñaste a decir mentiras piadosas 
He's the last man standing on the track
Sweet little kitten on the porch sleeps in the sun
Let the water seduce you to immerse
If I fall, if I fall, if I fall, will you catch me
Left my family
I wanna love ya
While everything around me is breaking down so slow
Somewhere near the end of the world
That we should start off with a drink
While she's still around,
Lonely drive
All the plans and moves that we made
I used my paper telescope,
I said, that I come from Dixie land
I love you more with each new day
Even though this woman tries
Rubber band together in cashless bundles
Why keep searching
Out of this place
Come into my space
In your window
Is all that you can't say
I'm on my knees in the corner
Are really there, but I wouldn't hold my breath"
Don't turn me away
Until we fall asleep at night
Anything that you wanted
There's no need to be so uptight, straighten
I'll ask if I can walk you home
Tragedy he used to come through all the time
So call me when you get where you're going
Cross our fingers and dream on
Pockets start where I always reach
For the flag, what colours would I use
I'll start at your heart then move deeper inside deeper inside
But when it comes between my sights I'll let the damage show
If you don't know or care you'll be all right
Don't you miss the way
This is the price of our lies 
Cleaning the dream and it always makes me cry, oh my
What's on your mind yeah Darling what are you thinking
As you rapturously commanded
It was a dream I had
Baby, I just don't reply 'cause I can't find the things you need in me I can't, I can't girl
Close my eyes and kick the chair to the floor
You are my precious ghost
Some men say there ain't
Chanter et puis rire
What have I done to you
I had a friend I loved
The way our shelter moves above
While all the women came and went
Closer and closer 
When all the pain we've overcome
Or did it break you in
But I see the pictures of every life
And you never knew my name
Of her left hand
Personne à l'horizon
And tomorrow rescues you
But something keeps you faithful
I know you say,
Eu disse funk lá no Morro da Mangueira
And don't ever think of trouble
Every kiss is a goodbye
They come and they go 
que los años son sabios
Lost in these rooms
You need to watch the way you talkin' to me, yo
I believe now
Is a heavy gold one 
I don't know which way I've come
It's all replaceable
Subtract me from your heart
If it was my last day X ooh
Boys of melody
She'd take a shine to me
Let me take you along for the ride
Don't take, don't take, don't break my amateur art
And still we keep hoping
I've met your ghost, he has proposed
Never to be torn apart
Your were the one that did believe
And you'll be there when we are through
You're living in the same circumstances
Sweet and so new
We took the walk alone
Will not make you come undone
Sleep in silence, reshape
Up the ghosts of Saturday night
That I've always been the one told to flee
Offen für alles wie der Wind,
�Someway, baby, it's part of me, apart from me"
You'd better put some beauty back, boy
We're waiting by the willow
Fuck all that flirtin', I'm tryin' to get in some drawers
I hung around your neck independently
Ich bin das Eigentum von meinem Eigentum
Check to see who's around first
There's a chapter on fathers, a chapter on sons
You'd come to see
Luon rannanmitan valkeaa vaahtoa
To marry the wave with the tide
The good times, they aren't only in the past
Always left standing
For all the hurt that you feel,
So tell your lie to me
Watching you till all the work is done
I was in a train under a river when I remembered what
Scarf goes out behind
And we're happy to let you know that, we always will be
Have you, have you been keeping secrets from me
But that was then and she is now, I once was lost with her I'm found on this early April morning
I desire the simple things
We wait for answers, for hours and years
We've been circling for time baby
New lovers taking our place
And now my mind is free to walk the streets we used to walk so quietly
I never ever meant to hurt you
'Til sleep, she overtakes her
We will never forget
The many touches on my skin
How I want you, too
All of my lies
Baby you know that I love you
I'm a backstabber lady
To shine a warmth into eternity, this is an eternal decree,
And I've guessed what of me you need
Illchosen, disappointing
Flashlight as your guide
I stroll around the passages
And it's down to the bar
The train is leaving
None of it mattered
You want me yes you do
And the fog's so thick you can't see up close
Of all the parts of life that she made
I know everything will be all right
The sea was calm
All through the night 
The fish float through the room
So I choose to sink
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh
Carried my feet to the clear lake
They say I'm caught up in a dream
Let the sunset in
That you're goin' with another guy
I won't have no presents this year
Die Augen sind mein Sonnenschein
But sometimes horizons can close their eyes
Help is on the way
He's my sun, he makes me shine
Mind the wind, my love
And I'm thinking what will then become of you, i
I'm the night now but I will shelter you
And away he gone day
Jennifer left for school up in Boulder
So hold on until they return
To bring the ocean to our toes
Sleep to drink or drink to sleep
Oh my god
I want to move to Kansas City
This is the youths actually saying to themself, 
Yeah heaven is the whole of the heart
Wardour Street, not phoning packwidth
I could sing you your favourite song 
Rachel Haden
And the sound of your voice
Everything's confused, harmlessly untrue
Lie, smile, don't say no
Simply a lack of love
The stars for what they are
Still I feel it's not this way
As he learned how to turn in the tide
Some words sung are as solemn as true
My great love
This wasted time on you has left me
East side to the west side
We talk of the future
It leaves a bad ache
If this one wasn't enough
But I know I can't do that
But now we're fresh out of heroes; now we've run dry on hope
Harlem River I'm in love love love love
A way you move and hold your hands
Then an encounter with a voice that caressed me
All the things that your eyes once promised
There lies a seed
I'm crying tears of a rapper
All us people
Yeah we were running and how we were running
Your place is in the sky, how can I show you
And I will show you my passion,
It hangs above my altar
We flew over fences
Oh, beautiful world, to me
Searching for the stars they couldn't find
From all the darkness that I couldn't break through
But anyway
And in your bones it is so cold and sick
Who's on the pressure I had reason 
And you're just like a fucking ghostie
You say I don't deserve emotions
You could be the one to help me help myself
I'll meet the pavements down the line somehow
Over conversations Relationships are overrated
Taking breath of each other
But now the longer that I hang around 
Well this place is a whorehouse tonight
GOLLY gee, what have you done to me
When your heart's in pieces
Left you diseased
Now my nightmare is over
I feel cold
And forget who we really are and where we really be
Öll hans stétt ég sem kenndi hér svo margt
I'll be waiting in line, just to see if you care, if you care
Laisse le vent prendre soin de tout
I wonder what you dream, when you dream,
I bet you think that's pretty clever, don't you, boy
Close your eyes and drift away
Tell the Lord, they all I got, so please don't take them from me
Collect all your things 'cause it's home time
Und wie gern würden sie auch mal woanders sein
Flying close to The Sun
Between the next road and your last road
Your face has changed
Everyday my life's so abundant
Never alone
And it takes a road to go nowhere
I told you what I feel most
'Cause I feel you, I feel you near me
Brings me words that are not the strength of strings 
With my guard down,
Harmony, boys, is what we believe in
Get somebody to come on to you
Nothing lasting within inside
Your eyes have died but you see more than I
Fool in the night
With gloomy shade of thy still empery,
Of all the many things
Do as the beautiful once did,
And who knows how
It's OK, I know when you fake it
You are such a liar
Just trying to find a place to lay my head
That she was only saying what she wanted me to hear
And with outstretched arms
The winds of fury will lead to paths of glory
Now the lord is master
There's nothing left to fear
'Cause baby two is better than one
Take me into your skin
Seems I'm standing on the edge
I want him but we're not right
All we can say is we're still having a blast
Where's my love
Take me under, undertaker
My heart is darker than these oceans
I'm too scared to breathe; I might do something wrong
Under the covers you'll be
So the nightbird took him in
Our voices in the breezes
Your gran died and your mother died
el amor, la pasión, se quedaban adentro
It is all unreal in this world of ideals
The air is getting thick
I'll never be alone, no matter where I go
Messin' up my wet dream
Come fly with me, let's fly, let, s fly
It will pass in time
And I created a lie
Instruments of death before me
Though you've found a new love,
Pouring like the bullets of my AK
Gniew zmieni w kochanie
We have a steady confusion
Through a land we didn't know
Of imagination and too much looking back
But you're still a long way from home
Why doesn't he come home
You stole my passion, burned my everything
Do whatever you want it's our map
Fuck practice, this shit just happens, know y'all can't stand it
All my head is full with lines
Cause nothing yet has blessed me yet from
You know we'll be getting some getting jiggy just for fun
The wind comes softly blowing
A shining angel sent to me
Choking in clean underwear
Falling out of love with you
Well I could leave tomorrow
For for when you need remindin'
Me and my friend, we are not friendly anymore
They say everything is gonna be alright
Great waves
Because I've got these magical seeds and the trees are still growing
Long gone before daylight
Joni help me, I think I'm falling
But you know just what to do
All fools say, "Oh my God"
Like a longlost lullabye 
Take everything away
I never will
I know this journey's soon
Weakly mind, weakly
You can't haggle with your mother
Yo, funny how things change color
And I hope that you remember me
Cleverly concealing primal urges often felt but rarely seen
But I doubt it
Nut to my dismay, it left without a trace
Stop pushing Stop shoving Stop straining
Part of you boy
Step away, get me when I'm down
I'm gon' take off tonight
I remember you like yesterday
That true romance can't be achieved these days
The end of an era
And I wasn't sure of you
Drinkin' tea in bed, watching DVDs
My grip was loose, my eyes were open
When you did that to me, I knew somehow this had to be 
Clear as Winter, storms would be a sight to make us shiver
Make up a newborn colour
I'm out here, spend plenty of time on your own
I want to feel crazy in love
So we can go away
Somewhere I can never trace
This is your anthem for tonight,
To let it wash all over me
Why after all this time I'm finally worth it
I've got nothing left to lose, my dear
The kids are waiting, they've been shedding tears
But hope is not in what I know
There's only one way
Now he's moving close,
When you come around, everything else disappears, my mouth disappears
And all that you know
Damals wusste ich noch nicht dass Träume auch verbrennen
If love could've lasted forever I'd be with her today
All these tears are no longer mine nanana
And it never stops, no, it never stops
auf das eigene, entsprechend große Land,
Is there a melody  that could lead you to me  like a lullabied child lead to sleep
They can fill a cup or two and still disturb the peace
Well, we'll sleep in, we'll do it again
And move along instead of talk
With the falling rain came the scent of our times
That even at night overshadows the moon that sings to you
Would you remember me
"On with the show,"
Here I am, I'm stealin' you away from him
'Cause I've no time to start again but I won't to a bitter end
No I won't stay here no longer
You're feelng calm and crisp and strong
And the pieces broke and the people wanted more
And I drop my knees with all this beauty here
Down through the years 
They claiming that they love me
The pigeons feeding in the square have flown
Sifting through emotional rubble
Watch it shatter on the ground
Tangled up in sheets and love
Use either zoom or the microzoom controls
The ice is tinkling like a wind chime
Step away then from the edge
Hey little one, think about a time
I climbed your arms
Will take you higher than
Holds my love in his hands, still I'm searching
Sag deiner Tochter,dass du sie liebst
We know we can't leave this behind
But it's nice to make some love that I can finally feel
'Cause the past comes back again
Waiting in the checkout line 
I still know you, the best man
And the ring around her finger is only there for make you
Sag deinem Sohn ,dass du ihn liebst  x
The broken car parts in enemy desires
Run to the treasury and bring me back some gold
'Cause the love
In the future I will read at night
It's not here to stay
You want to touch me but there's too much history
There ain't no stopping now
Don't let me go outside tonight
But 'til that morning, there ain't nothing can harm you
It can't be done
When I look up from my pillow, I dream you are there with me
When you come around, everything else disappears, my ears disappear
Use your sword, use your voice
Niggaz around me so cold, man my heart dun froze
I'll be flicking stones at your window
Pay attention to the signs
One more time
Maybe two is better than one
I sit alone contemplating
Until the tyrants are dead and the patriots are swallowed whole
But there's only so much that one man can take
I wish I had one hundred thousand pounds
So remember this
It won't lead me to your bed
I'm going from strange to stranger every year
In the games
May your days be golden
I'm breathing,
The hell I've a lot to pay
I am free, but I am flawed
I gave up married women 'cause I heard it was a sin
It all just seems like yesterday Seems like yesterday
It's all about fast cars and cussing each other
The cold harsh Winter's
Then pass us by but much too high
I love the way you talk
Are you smart
The infirmary man may count me dead
Because you would rather that I wasn't here 
Mind your manners, wave your banners
Our future no clearer
This is one thing you can't take away
You could go all day
Yellow roses spring
To say you must never
She never thought her love could ever be as strong as this
Feel the future hanging In the air
The time has come and they must go
I know it's not right, but it seems unfair
I've never stopped trying
But I swear by this song
You've left your ghost until tomorrow
All her ideas were like smoke rings, I had to know things
But I don't know how to live
But the way that they're doing it, it don't seem like that to me
And if the atom bomb should end us both
Singing the leaving of liverpool
Should be precious, understand
And I even myself the fool
Something in the way she smiles for me
And the banching stream runs still
I live in turn
Down, down
The carrier was then refilled with ships arriving in perfect time
A million lines tried to reach me;
There will be no game today, she cried across the board
And there's the corner that I sat on The corner that I sat on
But I can only help myself
A dead procession always dragging its feet Well, come on 
Somewhere so far away
But please don't let me down this time
Fought my boys
One of these dayssdfsdfsdfsdfsdfsd
My heart feels like love
Defiantly real, there's nothing fake
You're afraid it's all been wasted time
Set up the day
Like a cloud of ink
Out of childhood into sadness
The eyes take on a certain gaze
You may never be or have a husband
And I woke up when I saw the sun
Lie down with me
And I'm just sitting watching hoping the boys will call for me
Don't turn your back
And everything you had is gone in the split of a second
I see the sun rising
Won't you come here and stay with me
Oh, it's childish and it's silly
Now to know it in my memory
Russell lives in Cov, that a really brutal place
You're the only one
I'll be around for a while
But now I can't afford to listen to a word they say
Like poison it succumbs her
And I can't deny the way that I'm feeling feeling
It's not the love and I quest the why
Other people who sign up for judgin' but can't take no
Wonder who you are to stay
Cannot understand her methods
And I might have if not for daddy's bad advice
This ripe swollen shape
You've had a hard day
I suspect a thing, I wish I didn't do
Feel it all come true, come true
Good times around the corner, I swear it's getting warmer
No car wreck, suicide,
Cómo olvidar tus miradas
But it's so cold
And that's a problem for some
To empty places on my own
'Cause something deep inside me wants to turn you black and blue
I hate to see you so down, oh baby
The life of the party
It leaves you cold and wet
I know there's something
It's so lonely through the day
Far away
Isn't something that keeping a cool head can beat
To build an island between me and you
It's happening, the sky is shattering,
Don't hold back, my dance devotion
That falls in your doorway
Keep moving on to higher grounds
Where winged feet will soar
Then he'll visit your seven seas
On my knees in a faceless crowd
dass wir nicht zufrieden sind
Yet another time
A disenchanted taste
Hey friend listen up their playing our song
Let's start living life
Here is the rainbow I've been praying for
You came down, hard that summer
For you to stick around
Would it make it any better
Yeah, I'm on my way back home
Gone underground
The joke is that we thought we were shooting a dog
One of your sunny afternoons
And save this room
I do not want to forget
Yellow, for the sun which shines my way
Cold wind blowing
A menor licença
He gets the all highlights
A long abandoned fruit
Magical child
In excuses you can find
Well the songs you sung spiraled
But am I something you despise
Quer saber
Generally we are alone
But it's hard to live alone
If you need to take some time
When the buried and hidden
And Harlem River give me wings
In circles 'round the well and where it spells
Pictures on the mirrors
Spend your nights here
Nothing but silence caused by doubt
But I couldn't look down, but I couldn't look down
From beginning to end
Know you'll wander
From every troubled thought
And someday I can't breathe
You make me want to cry
Rest your eyes
Don't you get it
som blåser värme över huden
Until I'm back where I belong 
Oh, deliver me
>From the bar to the car park
Oh, there's the day, oh what a shame
I was born here, I was raised here and
I've got it going X
Sleep in silence, reshape, today
But their values could be old news
But I wish you did 'cause I can't rid the thought of it
You're overcome,
Up on the horse was a weak, foolish child
I want to make much of You
I don't need you to show me
Feels like there's something broken inside
'Cause I drink
Whom I do not know
They want that shit, they often feind, I give it to 'em, but in between
That's it just let go, and relax
Is it's so thin, I keep sliding off to the side
I mean, I went and found the modern world
'Cause tonight at ten
I type a text but then I nevermind that shit
I'll hold my hand over their head
Depois de tudo que for verdadeiro 
They don't mean anything to me
And how today it sets me down
They wanna keep us away from one another
And the girls they are pretty
Like the king of the eyesores
Find my way inside
Har härdat sina dar som år, känt minsta andetag
En un solo momento un' eternidad
'Cause I just don't want to cruise
Hey baby, baby light that ass on fire 
Sweet music in my ears
Lightness is forced when you cut out the lines in the paper
Warmed my feet beneath cold sheets,
You and I belong in dreams like this
And I knew
I will give you my heart
I don't care about clever, I don't care about funny
My options right when I walk in, jump all them Jordans
So we keep on waiting
Can't take my love away, ah 'cause it's here to stay
'Cause I can't sing loud enough
I'm the last one
We used to get around
And there's no place like home for a little doll from China
What lies ahead is between
Some old news
'Cause me and you, we are one of a kind"
In our sounds and movements
Och jag kan ångra det lilla jag säger
I got deep warm drunk
Farewell to the foggy hill
And the people breathe so easily
In your eyes
Don't give up until you drink from the silver cup
A burden to keep though their inner communion
With her morning yearning
The drive onto me
She eyes someone who doesn't have the change 
So I walk you to your car
You can read my mind, I don't have to explain why it
And It takes some fears to make you trust
But harder to mind
 AM and someone calls you on the telephone
When we're standing at a distance
I'm still living with my mom and my dad
To change her life
Do you want me to stay and say I still want you
Ta ta we'll be in touch
Tired boughs reaching for the light
What if God was one of us
It may seem a little hollow
The sky is your blue kingdom
And neither have I wings to fly
Far and wide, sweet and simple Jehovah knows that I've been sinful
Coming back from Paris on the train
Dance in your eyes and fell through the skies
We had this dream
That I deserve everything that I get
But all you see is fall, fall, fall
When I'm far from home
Will we murder each other
Then on a bright day at North Point
How could we be so right
'Til we die our war is the pressure, we need to unite
And have time to play
But we'll do our jobs till we break down and fall
But I know in time
That says "where were you last night"
She dreams of his returning and the things that he might say 
I need you, you want me
Over the ocean to see you 
Let's do it serpentine any time
I belong with your arms wrapped around my neck
An essential child
Eu perguntava Do You Wanna Dance  
I took a trip down to
But they saved lives so many times
Something in your eyes
Wasting all our time
Just another red light 
Shiver while you're breathe in,
Even though I know
When you fall, when you fall
I can see the where and how, but I don't know the why
And all I want is down at the shore,
It may get harder, cause you just restarted
Catch his dreams today
And forget your name
For that woman with the tattooed hands
My true love did breathe 
And everything you love in life
E quanto a gente paga pelos sonhos que deixou
Why to stay
And her brand new gear
I want you to stay course I want you to go
Cling to the side and any sign of your memory
miré para otro lado y vi lo que pasó
And they're swimming around again, again
I heard from someone you're still pretty
'Cause it's the final thing to do, now
Baby, they know just know what to say, the trying to break us away from one another, but maybe their right for a change
Lay on the wind and lie my side with you
In previous lives, we were frozen sticks
And from the people come the power
So I don't cry, I don't cry no more
Always playin' one more hand for one more dime
We leave our homes in flames
It will seem surprising when I disappear
And I'm investigating other ways out
Since I met you my basement has started to bleed
Till somebody's lonely
I wish I had knew
We like to time ourselves
They say you curse at girls
I'll always wake up so confused
And you make it worth this ride to me
My ambers and my blues
She's crying as you're climbing down your claim
Du bist das schönste auf der Welt
I want you to stay and I want you to go
Energy spent trying to believe you're not worth it
Fell asleep by my side
Raindrops wash it from the walk
We raise our heads and look
There is a hand that can reach you there
With hopes of better days to come
Little one, how long I've waited here
So shy and enticing yet I fear
You can always tell
You never thought you'd be alone
I got my best dress on
And I missed my stop it was  blocks back
If you concentrate, mountains will move
But in the end it's still so lonely
But I've found someone
From the thought of you
und es zusammen zu flicken
Face in every cloud, makes me laugh out loud 
You sit up on your perch for the rest of the night
Lookin' for another fight
Saw you in a crowded bar, pale with hungry eyes
I just need a little more time with you
Our heart are in the blossoms
So I'll stand by all the things that I get wrong
So won't you hold me, touch me, and make me your woman tonight
Oh, the little magic that his solo brings
And make what we can of this
Tell you I love you and I always have
I cannot get o'er
You can't do a thing to stop me
And all the storms you've been chasin'
Show some understanding for the lonely fool
Can you hear it scream at the hurt that I knew
Life without reason
Or to land
But I want his wings
Salome dancing on my wall
Till death do you part
zusammen allein
When you come round my love, I'll be gone, finally done
All our dirty clothes that hadn't gone into the wash
And though you might be what I'm looking for
There's a boom echoes in my heart
It makes you think, it makes you sane
Of growing old with someone
So I can't look at you this way
Lose friends to the air waves and the airlines
Never seen you so unsure
I miss you, think of you everyday
DUI students who can't drive their cars
Spins like a winding wheel
When that southern anthem sings
To be free
Just leave the light on
And everything I've been thinking of
You're holding bits of styrofoam
Everybody says I gotta be crazy
Put my bones in an empty street
'Cause I've never been
What have I done to my paradise
He saw no tears in her eyes
Because I stand where I stand
I need to hear that you'd die for me
When we reach that awkward moment
Frankie, my darling,
And find what you are here for
That's what they say, they say of me
The rainiest days
Spider and I
The steelbelted attendant with a 'Ring and Valve Special'
And they'd bring him here to me
I will try and dry my eyes
Like they're holding the world together; like it'll blow any minute
I'm falling into the temptation
What it do I'm posted up in the parking lot, my trunk waving
Pueden robarme tu historia,
I'm always tired but never of you
Of a lady, with no heart, playing stupid little games
Write songs telling why he got blindo
It's everything
When I got in my cab I didn't turn and wave
Faded away with tears in the rain
I'll try to dream of you
The remains of my wasted youth
Tap on my window, knock on my door
Can we make what lies ahead of us a better place to be
Then she said her name was Cherie
But here it's dangerous, not like home
Too soon the sunrise will wake her from her sleep
I know that yea yea yea 
I wonder if the days I've lived through count
Faced with the music, as always I'll face it
I want to see this sky split
No I never imagined that my path would lead to you
Well, I heard your voice in everything
You're used the sound of a heart that's breaking
So now hush, as you're dreaming
And my feet don't move in time
And the stars refuse to shine for you
Yeah 'cause you need from me
By the season
Take me way down
Sends your ships to the rocks
And how it takes all the night
So I tried to intrude through the little holes in your veins
I'm sure that we will meet again but only time will tell
And we'll drink for the lonely tonight"
Are symphonizing their way
What are we gonna do
They took it to the heart and left for the moon
But I'll tell you anyway, about the girl who came to stay
I tend to be
I just opened up my window
I'll have a spring in my step
Or none of it is true
I feel like, getting it right,
Tomorrow Janie's wearing a dress
If you're looking for
Nibbling on the moon
I've seen the hand that rushes in 
And sends a secret message to that girl
But I won't be no fool
Start off with just a spark and suddenly the room's ablaze with new ideas and sunny days
Summon
I know that you are only one dream away
You can talk to angels
You know why
This is not my landscape now
Down on his knees
Our lives are buried in snow
Next stop, Paid In Full posse recruits me
Don't let them make you into something you ain't
Falling right out of your sky
Soul of my soul
Your breasts heave when you sing,
Everything evaporates when you come around, around, around
We shouldn't let this go too fast
I've been fooling myself too long
The time, it passes by
Of the white collar kind but just as ferocious
All I want to do is to spend some time with you
I know I never noticed then
Just dragonflies
Invincible, lyrical, miracle man, huh
Why do I love you so
You'll be all right
She gave you the phone, said it was for you
You gotta a bad old habit of making people sad
It's a oneroom city, yeah, it's a oneroom city here
Serum vials to help you when you're sad
We said 'We already do, don't worry we'll do the rest'
A worthless struggle to step back
I want to be where love is real
Till you see polices laughin' as they pickin' me up
I wrote your name on a tree along with the days
Generally we are alone, alone
We lie together when we say it's love
Don't fall down my concrete girl
Solitary motion in the wake of an avalanche
If I know you'll never stay
And those dreams that I hold
The sacrifice of hiding in a lie
And I just can't stop, cause
Feedin' chocolate to the dog
And I said don't be upset, don't be in a bad mood
I just can't seem to find solid ground
I'll be waiting there for you
No mountain can see
And I'm home
I'll catch what I've been chasing after
I go to loud places
The world is awake
Too many fucked up times
Think of all the people we could meet
And those who hunt thee down will fail
Or to concern yourself with the investments of
The crowd was bouncin' in sync with the pulse
The smokey joe is broken
When you're in my arms
Tell me that you love me
On our way we will have hope 
What do you wanna do now baby
I fell asleep on the table with your picture in hand
It takes time
Of feelings not easily made without need
And every note just shook the plaster
I know I could turn to something other than you
'Cause the nightmare is over
And my nigga said I shouldn't let it worry me
With my torch I light your way
I wanna stay here and never go home again
You know what our boundaries are
And it counts my time
I throw it off my back and
Vier Uhr zehn liegt sie am Eis
Ten tons slowly then again, straighten
Burnt by the steam from a better life
¿qué le viene pasando
We've been cowering so long
But her boyfriend did the shootin', judge gave a light sentence
los rayos, los árboles son
I walk barefoot where the water drowns the sand
No light
Where you are to go
Now we can be together
As she passed away
You're now a part of me
Once told, never burn out, it's best to fade away
There is no such place 
And I feel you scrub my skin
There is no such place, o yes I have seen it too
'Til there was nothing left
Oh, I hope one day you do
And I will walk on water
Help to carry Jacob Marley's chain
I wish you on your way
I'd write you a song
J'ai été jusqu'à faire l'aumône
And all the men are gargoyles
I told her to drive over in yo' new whip, bring some friends you cool with
Don't cry, my love, don't cry no more
I said venice
I'd say" stay in the bed world sleep in peace"
I'm sending this out to those
And then she gave to me more summer wine
Go looking for the summer
Wondering why
Fly away
Beeing needed 
Possibilities and sweeter dreams
Moussberg pumpin, shotgun dumpin' the drama means nothin'
And it takes a day to make you yawn, brother
Explaining what I feel, that empty feeling
I don't know why I do the things I do
See what I'm really looking at 
That I don't know how to live
And everybody was feeling high
You fell in love I fell in line
Better learn the difference between do and say
Don't you know that you're my pride
You just stand up there and watch
I glitrende solskin
We drank dandelion wine and we reminisced
A glimpse of religion, a piece of coming closer
She want's to get through to you,
Kings of the highway we will be
I'll keep a secret if you keep me guessing
Only a few things will we recall
You go north, walk the good red road
Perhaps a letter with a dove
Just think of all the places we could be
Always seems to return that 
We're searching for our parts
Diamond in the back,
hon har den vackraste av själar
I know he'd release it like a bird to the sky
Let's hold fast to the dream
A traveling song to ease the ride
Are you gonna be, are you gonna be, are you gonna be, are you gonna be, are you gonna be well, well, well, well
Stone throwing I've got nothing to do
I wish you could hear me singing
All time fell
Imagine if the friend that you thought you knew wasn't really true
And when it's time to take them to the slaughterhouse
The earth is our mother
I use the lock that has no key, bind you with chains
Look what I've become
And if you could step inside me you'd feel what hatred brings
'Cause they come out in the dark
Getting closer
A life, a journey's end in one
Speaks to a silent room
There used to be nothing in common, there used to be nothing to share
'Cause I know you're missing me
When we all fade away
By the view
And this house just ain't no home,
Cause this isn't all we could be
Sleeping on the way
Even though I've never had so far to go
The dust in my head
As for the past, it's all behind us
Turn around and make a stop
Into a stranger's eyes
In the mirror staring back at you
Don't walk away
We've been waiting on you
I've been going alone to the cinema
Where we see the universe, 
Watch the dancing shadows run away
Ain't it funny child
They look at you
So I blame this town, this job, these friends, the truth is it's myself
To the unspoken question I say
In my head and in my thoughts
Bitch I'm saucin', I do this often, don't do no talkin'
Goes to show how tricky things can be
Have you ever seen a robin weep
Draw near to my garment, and there you will see
I'm taking her home with me, all dressed in white
And even though she tried she feels the same
Humming melancholic lines
Break the chains
Nothing in particular
I don't cry, I don't cry no more
This is how we walk on the moon
I hear your voice calling me out of the darkness
And her voice it decays and before it does she goes
I want to touch you but I'm too late
Immovable shadows
To cradle back into slow motion 'cause it's all moving too fast
The wise man knows
We loved to dream aloud
And all words aside
Let you slip away
Falling down, all way down to oh, oh, love
Valoa lämmittävää
Are your thoughts results of static cling
I've never been one for goodbyes
The world has changed
I miss the love only 'cause they starve'
And waiting in the waves
And I'm back here at home
Where they go noone knows
Saving all the waitresses
Cause you wanted to know what's going on
It meets me, unwilling at the floor
I pray to God your soul to keep
Will never see the shame
I'll wait for you love
I know they know something
I don't wanna hurt your pride
Deliver me, out of my sadness
In the city where we still reside 
On that very last day, he said
We were so windy winding flying
Shut up and catch some ZZZs 
And they say, it's such a funny story,
And your tongue's still shaking
Gone gone gone in the deep slumber
Cages and alarms
Never would, never would
Than if you do what you do
Starryeyed
And what you least wanted, holds you down like a stone
Started to scare me
Yes, I'm on my way, yeah, I'm on my way
'Cause I'm just a whisper
Indigo is his own, Blue always knew this
We said our last goodbye
Got my hands all over you but not a sound
Wrap you up in cellophane
Always missing people that I shouldn't be missing
Forge something new
Maybe I, had too little love to realise
All that grace, all that body
¿Qué será de mi jardín sin agua que lo riegue
And all of this fills my aching head
I'm warming up
It all went for a good time and a song come on
A retriever with a frayed bandana 'round his neck
There's a golden key unlock all the doors
Till all the pieces scattered
How deeply, the distant mountain breathe
Gotta couple of merchants that I gotta meet
I'm gonna put something in you
By the look in your eyes I know the time's nearly come 
I lost my mind, never to find
And lose the one you love
Of God wears camouflage, cries at night and drives a Dodge
It was you all the time
That college town
I remember every look upon your face,
We do the best we can in a small town;
You can't fly unless you let yourself fall
I can't say I wouldn't agree
Carnelian stars and the bars down below
Would just fall apart and slip through my hands
You say, don't think so
I wear them too, I wear your shoes
Everybody wants to know which way to go
I was sleeping by the wasteside of tomorrow
Looks like a little beauty
But it's the third time we've fought together this week
How dare you turn on me now
Nights of missing me there
Feel a wave of destiny wash over my helpless body
By the way
And to whomever she fancies
Never clears up above our heads
And all I seem to feel is
Your head tonight
You don't know anything
And no help to come by, fight your own troubled mind
And thanks for branding me a failure
With the poker face
Hey, I'll take this day by day by day
Every look every look
But I still can't seem to tell you why
Little heart
Now your eyes are red from crying
Hold my hand through the thick and thin
For lookin' at you straight in the eyes
J'ai peur que je vais roullier ce soir
En hinn breiði vegur var greiðfærari hann geng ég og krossinn ber
The only way I'm leaving here
And your heart's weighed down like gold
Somehow, somehow
Wieder
Oh let me burn the words "forever mine"
Oh, winter for sure
Climbing a hill
The word's on the streets and it's on the news
No house to hide inside,
I never thought it would go
Eine stirbt im Pulverkuss
Blue, because I'd still have sad days
Like you've been rubbing yourself all wrong just to be somebody else's genie
Et toi tu ne reviendras pas
Have come my way
I'm like a swallow that wants one long last look, before flying east
But in order ta do that you gotta believe in me yeah
When he catches his reflection on accident 
And I could try to make you mine
But when it comes to the crunch, I just hide in disgrace
Alles wie es war,
Doorbells and sleigh bells and schnitzel with noodles;
And we can never erase
No cutlass wound will mar thy face
Their feet are cracked
Wears a pretty face and armor
His hallelujah child
To reach the coastline
Young lover's stand in the showroom
Princes kept their view
Stuff was started, things had ends
And came back for the van the next morning
Times without changes
We'll all be gone, there'll be no more roads to find
As if no one knows anything but us
Et pour tous ces mots qui blessent
So if I do not tell you if I don't find the words
May your soul's waters never wane
Blood on my hands
Oh, all our love fell down to Earth
How long can you hold your breath
My eyes are red, 
And fell down low
And you're right here by my side
J'ai laissé passer l'été
Go gorepeat till fade
She was waiting for her mom to come back
We started out as lonely hearts
Probably it's the toxin  sorry it's a lot been unresolved
And it's so hard this thing I got to do
I don't believe you now 
If your heart is beating fast, then you know she's right
Would you like to sing my song
The clouded mind
Because the myth is not supposed to retire
Arrest your fall
And you won't matter anymore
Over your fourtieth masterpiece
Do you ever think do you ever think
Watching the sky
He said my name
Gonna try to get caught up in a momentary lapse oh repeat several times
Um sonho a mais não faz mal
Go slow 
We are together tonight
Got broken hearts
Come back gimme light, come on darling shine
Os deuses vendem quando dão
Let's aim high, oh girl
A wind in the shadow, a whale song in the deep
Even when the music's gone, gone
It's sneaking around out there
To sleep and always be still
And I love that it's right on time
See this glass is falling
More of you buys my time
My heart is weak
Who wouldn't tear my heart in two
Iça, iça âncora vela
Have you been half asleep and have you heard voices
By this new depth I don't think I ever felt
Watching all the memories fade
So put some passion in the play, because we all go anyway
And I tell myself that you light up my life
So many days
Sacrificing many for the
We're fools to try
Listen to the rain fallin' day by day by day
And then only city lights will brighten the night sky
Around the world my army of lovers
That's the way it should always be
Stop talking back, get off the phone
But will all their peace accords
Anything you want girl, we can do
Hold me when I cry
That my one is falling for tricks
Only reminds you of the people you hurt
I feel a dark cloud coming over me
Two words
Tu touches mon coeur, l'esprit s'en ressent
I switch off like a 'television', and close my eyes
And I'll never be her
There's a reason no one knows her name
Call me raincheck in the afternoon
Be warm and kind hearted
The rain came again, cleaning the dream
I've grown old on this ocean, gave her all my stronger years
Tired of what the next day brings
Feel the city inside you
Where as a young girl I used to play a scene
There AIN'T no use in me acryin'
Remember the time when friends were around,
Oh and you're standing right behind me
Oh my mother, she betrayed us, but my father loved and bathed us 
Dreaming of your touch
You're asking me will my love grow
God knows I couldn't make it one day
And I got for myself, yep, it's been a few
My head is numb, 
My star has left me
There's room enough, she's generous
All comes to an end
High average, ball on these bastards, it makes me happy
If I can help you, please, you've got to tell me how
Baby I believe in miracles because I'm baby I'm forever yours, yours
'Cause I'm overjoyed, I'm ready for the
And The trouble with the straight and the narrow
Oh look but there I go again,
But I won't face the ground
You're broke and now you gotta return your jewelry to Jacob
You're feeling down because your head is hurting,
Kissed my mother on the face
You can raise your arm, you can wiggle your hand
And you will call it treason
Through your eyes I swallow flowers
The way you'd play with me like a child
Well, they'll never believe it 
Someday we will foresee obstacles
'Cause what if what we see is all,
Frankie, my darling
Let it be screamed, they'll never ever take us alive
So please try to understand that if I could, I'd call and I would be there
More about the days when we were crazy in love
Take me down
I touch the face of my own age
You need not to find a cure
Unless that someone was someone free like me
Under the wide, wide ocean's tide
You can bring meaning to what I do
Every little time
Nothing great, nothing good, nothing is as it should
Since I met you this house has started to decay
The hardest hitter that I ever knew
I don't know what I'm like but everybody says
One more chance before I see those innocent eyes 
You know, I was talkin' to this girl
In a changing time
Yeah we have oh so many friends who like to pretend we're still in high school
Looking for the way you thought could not be found
The glistening sea runs through your hands
Yonghwasoge yonin dulchorom gobaek haryogo
You've got a chance to retake a bit of innocence
Amanda said, "You have to go"
Y aprendí a quitarle al tiempo los segundos 
Why'd you have to break free
This part is sung in persian
I'm with some white girls and they lovin' the coca
Good things to think on
Move, pretty baby, where the sky is so blue
Forget about the time
I believe in miricles baby I'm forever yours
Drinking alphabetically because the beauty's gone all sore
Why does the sea rush to shore
Spend a lifetime, spend a lifetime
We are in bed at night
There's a chapter on love where the ink's never dry
The small, the large and the human mind
'Cause I will love you for the rest of my life
There falls another
Yeah we'll sing it someday
I dream at night ha
For the very first time
Yeah, need, need, need, need, need, need, need some kicks
I was beautiful with all my lights
Catch a wave on the air today
I'll just think back on it all
There were children climbing over fridges
That look on my face
If I stay right here, and forever with you
Sooner or later
Our friends are all hurting
I'm so excited its knocking down your door
Lord knows my destination
L'effet d'un corps de ballet
The lion stares high
For tears my heart is caged,
I ain't never seen a light like that before
Tell me if a lover know a blessing in this curse
Melhor saber
And I will hold you, touch you, and make you my woman tonight
Wouldn't change anything 
Because they've taken enough and you've given them all you can give
Over me
I'm doing everything
Oohoh summer wine
Come in you know what's been made up
A product of the environment
I've got no one to hold me, I've got no one to carry
I was glad it wasn't us, yeah I was proud
Tearing the very heart of me
Break into air
The words you say to me are unlike anything
Like strangers passing by
All you have to do is touch me
I want to cast some light onto her world
Kickin' the door,
So come over
And you hide the dead while my friends head to die in your name
Kom, vi knyter vänskapsbanden
I'll give until there's nothing left to
You can fly away with me
Well, I jumped in the water, started to drown
We come together, here we go
Lets fly away tonight
Doch die Erinnerung verblaßt
Puede secarse mi alma,
And it shows 
I wanted to say
This ain't a place to be making friends they all got agendas
Something he was not looking for
Placed in my wall
You can't know unless you feel it
When I think how it would feel to finally hold your hand
In another place, other space and time
The maid needs a maid
Run away from the setting sun
You always gone, you always be where them hoes will be
The whole world will be talking
Order anything you see
Sunny skies sleeps in the morning
Take a minute, take a moment, realise
Breaking the day in two
I know it wasn't meant to be
Your brides are not all as weak as what you take them for
One day if I could breath
My tongue will taste of gin and malicious intent
'Cause I don't want to end up being
Feels like, the time to start
It's a perfect night
You know what words of love
I cannot kneel, I'm out of time
Breathing as my body dies to get by
Brother sat me down
I know exactly how you feel
As I fall to the earth
Everybody's been wondering where you been
You're nothing
And the scent of your heartache, baby, and the taste of your blood, run within me
The flavor of your lips is enough to keep me here, keep me here
Turning the tide of our lives
It's in my skin
So come on up
Window, hoping it would catch the eye
They echo off the floor and walls
Way back home
But a part of me still falls to the floor
You used to lose yourself in me
¿Deberé o no volver Me arriesgaré aunque no quiera
And be at your door in a matter of seconds 
You speak your fears
In a better place in his brain
The morning scratched with static loud
Suddenly I noticed that it weren't quite the same
Surrender till I must obey
We're not running out of time
Super brain never scared of nothing
Because you love me way too much for you to ever leave
Why don't you take a friend
One day, you come around to see the other side of things
He never did amount to much He Never did try hard enough
My cylinder quiet, like tiptoes
On the back of envelopes
Swing low, play your show
'Cause she was there boy when nobody cared who you were
And press my lips onto his
My dream was this
And I'm only halfway sober,
But I won't let it change me, not if I can
The burdens that were his Mending the coat 
But I loved you,
But they won't ever win
And she had something to say
You bring new meaning to my life and now
SO like Nino when New Jack, I holla "cancel that bitch"
Down by the water and the tide is rising
But I remember when the vespers chimed
It didn't make sense how she could commence
Seus olhos de verão
His name is embroidered on my mantle so green
Time to throw us down, medicine's side effects
What's the use in trying, dying
Did the boys all tease you
Everybody knows
Southern trees bear strange fruit
But as far as I can remember
And still my reason will not rhyme, and still you tell me it's not time
In the soothing peace of car alarms and cats in heat
If all the world could take a moment
Be my island
But the landlord tried to kick that good boy out, that good boy out
Just dream and wish and try to close your eyes
Can't get you out of my head
Who needs peace when we've gone above
When from nowhere my eyes fell onto a girl
And when you call me from the other side
Free waters
I am broken
My time
Good night
I don't want to start
Let your inner mystic unravel tonight
Sometimes I wish life was never ending,
They are coming to get us now
I felt all fear and sorrow
When the dam breaks down and the city is covered in water
Just leave me your ghost
So I don't think we should wait x
When the hanging dust is clearing from the air
I've changed my plea to guilty
I stop and watch the airplanes leave the city
Your silence
Men jag behöver dig kom hit och rör om
No matter how unrealistic
When you're down and all messed up,
Gibt es was, das dich bewegt,
And go where we are told to go
Mais tout ce qui c'est passé
Flieg jetzt los, immer weiter
When the dark skies came along to test our steel
Oh revelation, comes in whatever form to save me
You know that I got a little something I should say
Or did we just not grow together
If it's real, I feel
If you spread your wings
That I'm not awake
But now I'm back in Pittsburgh, I might take it up again
After all it's the end
You spend you days just waiting for your next defeat
The world grows older every day
Show me love you can't fight what you been longing inside
Carved in your name with my pocket knife
And no help to come by, fight your own troubled mind
Before I pass out I need your ghost to tell me this bloodless voice
The words of love are not enough
And you don't know it
If we don't wake up soon all we ever knew will be gone
I left my friends on another continent
Don't go looking for him now
But I can't make myself say "Hi" because I'm scared
On the fire a while
Room for many, room for few
The picture is clear
I'm feeling shyer and the world gets darker
Every earthly breath, a lifeless testimony
nur unser klangheimliches Elend
Alone in your dreams
The other side is opening now
años pasaron y me animé a la victoria
They'll have you coughing up your colors
They got fooled
When there is nothing
Of any vagabond who passed it by
As it makes its home upon my face
Of the absinthe minded
She pays and doesn't say a word 
That a pretty face can take you places, you don't wanna go
And this time we spent together
So open your arms and sing for us
And know your name
"There are many here among us
Cover it with semen
Feels like I've passed my expiring date
Types with confidence
There was a time, don't you forget, when I was green and you were red
He was a friend mistreated, now he's dead so say you're sorry to him
There's better things right now for you than me
This boy, breezes in from the South Wells This boy, sees his days in the Middle East This boy, eased his way up the silver turns, but what is that, when this boy, he needs love, he needs love
And when the morning came, I was ashamed
Please Mr Lostman �れ�全�だ�う
But they don't speak
Fighting back with all my might
Around
And there could never be another
None but him and Jimmy could know
Stood by the gate at the foot of the garden
When all else in you turns and runs
And it's me but you're never gonna see who I am
Of the stillness of time
As tracer fire scars the sky
To believe
Zubizuria zeharkatzen
And we could jump in the river upstream
And the night becomes a musical extravaganza
Like a cat dragged in from the rain
You're not waiting here for anyone
Sitting in my car
And if my day is set and I haven't stopped yet
Well I had myself a dream the other night
There is always something better
Ich bin besessen von dem, was ich besitze
Don't you know
Strange that I'm a human being
Like a drunk in a midnight choir
So we make our plans we make our plans
Or mine on the back of the trolley
Pick you up, keep you away from harm
When you gonna realize, it was just that the time was wrong, Juliet
Drive on, drive on
We met the end too soon
I've been waiting for a sign to appear
I got yours and no others
We went beyond where we should have gone
Won't you come down to my arms
And when I am through those doors
Scratches his eyebrows
Bless you wherever you are
Fast asleep
But you touch me for a little while
Chemical fathers
And I spill beer in the grass
It's terrific how was the day after day worse
And it's hard on everyone
You and I are we
Just more bloodletting and misery and tears
And we'll care for making it right
Your hair's receding fast and so is your mind
You tell me it's blue, I'm a believer
Take it and let it be used
And you cared
It's not over  not over my friends
This is Your love, oh, God
I want to be alone
Oh my God, you can't believe
Ah, She's my butterfly butterfly butterfly
So I woke up my brother lying next to me
Baby, let me holla at you
God knows we'll never see her face again
Mare nubium, umbriel
Candlesticks, building bricks
Well, you're really cool and you always say the right things to me
Of life in The District
There's a constant slip out of the positive
You little wonder, you"
True lies with fingertips
Maybe Friday I can
The snow is up to our knees
My head runs off,
Go ahead and burn it down
Strength of head is all I own
Won't let them win
Wonder if she's gonna stay
Ending with a friend named Sunny Skies
Skapaður í mynd manns í líki karls og
And I'll sing a melody
Moody It's got me x 
But she wakes like a woman
I been waiting for an answer
I might be doomed never to find
Never turned away
I am lucky just to have a heart
It's as it's always been
I've fallen for your eyes
I might call and I might need some help
The wood from the tree
I left him outside in the snow
You smothered me in images of death
How'd you like the sound of those four letter words
Goodbye, shadows
I get high on you baby
You'll be part of me
With some other love yarn 
You didn't lose your job to
Linda toda, toda linda ela
We won't even know 'cause we'll just smile and let it go
I was wandering through the streets of the city
You're gonna be the one that saves me
If it fades away, come back another day
I do lá 's tú gan buairt
And drop down far away from it all
Into a lovers arms
My special one
We were made in the dark
Waiting in the wings, painters shade
So listen, listen please
Our father who art in heaven
We're in a natural spring
Your arms are like the trees
And suddenly I'm five years old
'Cause he's forgotten all he's known
Who are these old old people
Ok, it will all right, it will be just fine just fine
And how fragile I thought was I
You, you're the lonely one
Her hair it twists 'round her necklace
We go to the parties and listen to the DJ's
We'll make it out of hereoh yeah
Don't they know it's the end of the world
Yeah everything will be fine
And you're breaking my back every time
And when you're in trouble I turn away
Where the meadows used to be
So warm
You could go out every night
Even if only for one weekend
A song that I had only sang to just a few
Oh, you have a roommate Jemaine, don't bring them home
Or maybe to the last, but I'm still not sure
Long distance drunk, long distance drunk
He stands with his head in his hands
Rolling out of the blue like a storm,
Late that night, we checked into the Bellevue
I know I haven't said enough
Every night the motion must be fixed by glue
Wayward and highstrung
Livin' in a different world
Keys in his hand, reason again to let you know he's the man
But I know I'm getting old
Well, I take a look outside at the pretty girls outside
Drive slow
All III want is your love
I rarely ever hold a job, I never finish my work
That first look
Story of a spirits well awakening
Who feel that life is but a joke
I wait for rescue and for a sign
We get by, we'll get by
Good people for alibis
And ax lead to gun
That you've done  times before
Trotzdem ist Liebe wunderschön,
Inside you are everything else
The pressure I know you feel
I think I'll fly across the ocean
Gaze up at the moon hanging low in the sky, onlookers appear around us
Here's a place I've been before
Won't you come down Come away with me
If the life I live comes unhappy or sad
Oh, but you didn't have to laugh that way
Auf einmal stand er da, sein Name war Tara
Catch me flying in the sun
I wasn't as aroused as I was concerned
You tell me what you want I'll tell you what you get
When I was feeling down, you made that face you do
So the natural thought
From hate to love
You know what you're to do
Take him down, all his way
And for a moment you feel like you're alive
Through all of the shadowy corners of me
This blessed day
Long way out to the air
And then you get distracted by her older sister
Your evening eyes, the rain outside, the way I know
Your face in a dream returns
The noise just went away
So don't look at me this way
Kingdoms and lilac wine
I choose to love you and never lose
We'll never be broken, we won't be denied
Step on grapes put in water and tell you it's wine
Loving you in the morning is a warning
Another stone
And your spirit's close behind
Mil acasos me tomam pela mão
From town to town to town
All the voices keep torturing you head
Cause once it is lost amongst other thoughts
I know you had to go
Bringt mir der Tod ewiges Leben
For you I've waited all these years
My car's like the movie, my car's like the crib
You was the ChiTown version of Baby
But I know where I'm goin'
On lackluster times
And see how empty your life will be without me
No work said the boss at the bunk house door
Their favorite time of the year
For something you ain't never gonna find
Living souls around me
And the fates weren't on our side
When the years have gone by and
Your hair is coxcomb red, your eyes are viper black
Fearful mothers, watchful doubters
And where the rails end
End the quest you're beyond compare
Search through the darkest waters but
And look at each other
And I know if I stay in this night,
Hiding himself away
I really didn't care if the journey took all day
When you left you broke my heart
When will it stop When will it stop When will it stop
No, I cannot steal a pair of jeans off a clothesline for you
Jag kan offra allt jag har för ingenting
'Cause I need to
It was not a real body part
Caught before they fall through drains
Strawberry dreams and the dustfilled beams
Driving around, living the dream
obrigação saber seguir em frente,
Take a year in your hands
I love the way you stalk
The world's weight is over limit
And with that, she made her way
A slipper by the fireplace
Gone gone gone as ice melted in summer
Say ya won't ever lose
'Cause only you can
Away from red to black
Faire une liste de trucs qui vont bien
Someone like you around"
To come home
We are the unwritten scrolls
I'd have jumped from my trees
And he would stink of sex appeal
And wrestle down our souls if they would speak
Leaving the town in akeeping
All I wonder As I wonder Is this all the
Flock's chasing to find me alone
Because my angel eyes ain't here
And set this whole place under water
Preserve your value so that you can live to see a greater day
And now my eyes
Backhand, reversible roles
Don't you know baby I'm a leading man
And take me by the hand
But I've no idea where you are from the dialaview
And then I will fill the ocean back up with my tears
But you make it go away
And you will catch me if I fall
No more crying, don't shun your light, keep shining
Some bloodstains on your shoes
And not make a sound
You don't know yourself
Imagine a world without me
That just waste space
There's no place to hide
What a friendly offer
But no one is coming with me
Since you went away
And the big red wasp
I've barely made a sound for twentyfour hours
And away he gone light
Instead of rewind
But the future is already known
But I am not sure that I'll get over you
I do things I never should do
Barely surviving has become my purpose
Exactly how many times have I heard that one today
'Cause love is tough
And no horizon can sleep
And I try but it's always the same
Makes me feel I'm not alone
A seed of hope
So if the world ends, I hope you're by my side
I still say hi to you
The fate I'm facing everyday
The sun was so hot I froze myself
One fine night
From me standin' in the trap with Curran and Sir Cap
People died and people risen everywhere
I Don't know if I want you to understand me
I felt the rise and fall of your chest
Some people say God is long dead
And start to go slow
Nou pa men'm gen couraj
Did you even listen when they told you to change your name
When I see you alone
I eat with these crooked teeth
Morning skies all for you
I stuck around I played the hand I was dealt
It's time to show new eyes their home
Baby you desvere it and I know that
Inside out, upside down
It's here if you want it
Oh, you, you, it's always you
Said no matter what tie she's got
A long time
I got, I got that swagga back, I got that swagga back
It's not often easy, and not often kind
They think I need some time to myself
In this broken place
Coming back to you 
Unbutton minds yet unbeknown
For our world without sound
And you can take my hand
So I go by myself, I go into town
Now bugging because the label had just dropped Def Jam
I won't ever be mislead
I just about managed to forget you when you appear in a dream
In these nursing homes
But just as he was set to throw, his dad arrived there
My baby came riding to meet me one time
I wanna get lost
She's something of a tragedy
Sometimes you gotta burn some bridges just to create some distance
Don't turn me away
Loneliness astounds me
In it for love  money's too tight to mention
And you can try to search around
Said not to go right now
We got the money so we'll put you down
I wanna thank y'all for coming to see the preacher's son tonight thank you
Like how she feel, you know, you know what she told me
We'll be singing some day
So try to leave somebody
She's a party queen and she's in party heaven
You're a lonely soul
I'm injoy as the morning spirals open
You're still holdin' on to them days when everything was about you
But as long as the veins in our arm still stand up
With the memory of another day
I enter the visible world
Your friends that turn to liquid
They would have never missed a Christmas
And you always feel so hollow
And lonely tears can only hope to freeze
Everybody's laughing
'Cause finger by finger we're losing grasp,
Oh Mary of silence
When there's memories to be made
Give You all of my cares
He made his way to the border
My girl's got eyeballs in the back of her head
Es war zu heiß für sie in dieser Stadt,
There'll be someone new everynight 
Sing it louder
You know I miss her and think about her all night long
I live in a trailer home with a snowmobile, my car
So soft in his ways
He doesn't know what kind of guy he is
Make it a rendezvous
I feel it I feel it
Lay yourself in my bed again
I'm gonna break you down
Take me, take me, home, home
She said my days are unoriginal
You just sit there wishing you could still make love
And heaven is in front of me
His picture worn and weathered
My desire deeply harnessed in your spine
Sends me away
No matter what I say or do
And dream our dreams
In a corner of a darkened cell, and his pain meant nothing to me
I was lonely
To pray it's not too late, I hope it's not too late
I can't keep thinkin' I was right
Redbud tree, shelter me, shelter me
You're not alone, you're not alone
If you just give it a chance, loving you is not my plan
When it came to chasin' rustlers we'd always win
And the world is yours, the world is yours
Oh, you say you hate me now, and you burn me with your words
Supercollider
Two bit bars and honky tonks
Taken control of me
Down the sky at midnight
You were there and I was was with you
But you know you'd have to stay
The windows look like Christmas lights from out here
I tried to climb my felon home
Oh, bitte noch ein mal
I'd be out of line telling you, "leave her"
The world
Kept my faith from the day that you left
It's the disco infiltrator gone cold
I had a dream, a simple plot
You say you got a heavy heart
And I bet you're sweet and hard to get over
Oh I still remember when you
While you're sleeping in that southern state
And somewhere out there is the future Out there is the future
Now all the bonnie birds have wheeled away
Island life is living from a cup of broken queens
You're here just a little while
Cracking his knuckles and back of his neck
But the teeth you keep clenched is what's killing the chance
Pave their way through the darkest night
The water moved around me
Quand la bouche engendre un mort
Lookin' for some hope
I feel alright, I found a place that fits tight
Nice and white
To be like an evergrowing forest
'Cause I was too wrapped up in the dream I was dreaming
Who let you get on my train
'Cause I come from Alabama with my banjo on my knee
To the beautiful women that you are
I wanna give me a good night sleep 
He says he's wrestled with that blanket
May you dance like rain upon a still lake
Floating hearts
I found a clarity I'd never known
Place you have known
Why did he offer
Her wing beat is humming loud, is humming loud
I'm feelin' that shame 
Smiles and says "Aloha" to his sweetheart Hawaii
How the wind feels free
There's a golden key unlocks all the doors
You broke your back to make it okay
Insult everyone that we know
When you banged out the last beat on your drum
And there's a hope
Long after stars have lost their glow,
The river flows
He's the one I do adore, 
If I'm not right by your side 
Im Abendlicht
I am innocent in her dark eyes 
An' all you love, yeah
You knew they'd cry but you hoped they understood
I see the world from rusted trains
It ain't so long since you were flying high
We got sandwiches, chips and cold Gatorade
Trace it if I could, but it won't be understood
The caged bird sings
Oh sister, I am stumbling again
I won't fall behind
mysteries, music, birth,
Lies a garden full of evil
Seduce the world it never screams
When it comes to you
If I find my name's no good
Hung your head in a forgotten stare
Bright eyes
Walks beside me
I gotta get up and get over you
Oh, but if I don't do it, you know somebody else will
I've trashed myself  I've lost my way
What is in this air
Lying on your bed with your shoes on
I've become blind
Just like everybody
I mean madness, sickness, sadness, swaggerless back in the day
Get me a small man's wetsuit, please
You carry me along with your load
They'd just be misunderstood
From the cold grey sea
My headphones
Losing track of time
But ain't no sunshine when she's gone,
Cause nothing,
And his story left untold
Sometimes it's better not to know
Is something I'm trying to find
E desaprendeu
Somewhere around here
Deliver me, strength from inside me
I saw the sky break
On the crowed last car of the downtownbound 
Singing our songs is enough reason
My evil twin would lie and steal
This world, I've been right
It's OK, it's all right, because the day is just another night
Jesus, a friend in the better times
Put on your Sunday best and fake a smile
I never needed you for judgement
Well, I had a little metaphor to state my case
It was a surprise breakfast they were planning
And we'll pass on the streets I won't look away
My swollen eyes
Do not forget the light that doesn't make you crawl
And they wonder why you're so angry
Daniel is traveling tonight on a plane
I lit my fire, saw my coach I'm full of love
Need the pulse to feel alive
But in his heart, he knows the hardest thing about it is
And we'll release this town from the people
"No reason to get excited"
I'm starting to realise
Frozen eyes stare deep in your mind as you die
Her wishes that never come true
What you're feeling
There's no argument
But come back, come back in from the cold
I'm manchild man
Static everywhere
When love will end,
Turn your radio up
I ought to be on my way right now
When you sit right down in the middle of yourself
I couldn't believe, but now I'm so high
I hear that summer's coming back
There's nothing to give no more
And do you understand
porque aun no sé cómo vivir sin tu amor 
Feels like the final scene
When the sun is up, 
It will be completely
Oh, look what I'm holding here in my fire
Sweet Mary of silence
There in light
Don't run away now
Take one step with each number
I never knew this is the way it goes
And we're swimming around again, again
It's been two years since then I think
Of fair grounds that shut down as you ride away
I hear the words you'd say ringing in my ears
My darling,
Across a clear blue sky
I'm so in love, so in love
Silk stockings thrown aside, dance invitations 
Falls apart, cascading down
Overcome unconscious, made conscious out of the darkness
'Cause I'm not who I used to be 
Ce qui est n'est pas clos
Your love, is my sanity
It's just that I can't speak
But you keep changing lanes 
Haze garden pure strain highway
Had room for two
Selling your reason will not bring you through
Que le dice "Ven para acá, come una fruta y ve a nadar"
All of the while I never knew
You know I would take back that moment
Who's starving you still
I was making a mess for the better, I guess
And rescue me from me and all that I believe
Are we lost in a world
Holding all the pieces of my broken heart
The frustration I see when I tell you I'd like some company
Under your dresser
It still feels like the first time
To love and let go, was never the design
And I never let a nigga get that close to me
I was blue, just as blue as I could be
Eyes that look away in pain
Your inevitable love song
Slow your breath down, just take it slow
When those sad eyes start to close 
Grinding down the long ones
Who's singing this simple melody
Turned upside down
'Cause you try so hard
Bless you whoever you are
Isolated in my own world
Am I far away
Deeper down
That there's nothing here for me
Whose time is this
Voice 
Baby, can I hold you You'll be mine
Fills you with light
I know there's something,
If you blink she's gone
And everywhere we go, I can feel the subtle taste
Don't let me forget
We don't know anything
"Home alone, you call that a late night"
Oh I pray that we'll go back
I liked humans more than machines
Now it's over, isn't it
Young and just doing my own thing
I don't want to be shy
A kitchen sink and a rocking chair
If it's rock and roll, got to go, go, go, go, go
Echoes start as a cross in you,
Just one little lie
This life be true, don't bow your head to no one and no matter what you do
You better mean what you say
oder niemals mehr
As I get behind the wheel again
You are a beast and I am serving up your supper oh
To slip my mind by mistake
She lies still 
Frozen under you
It makes a beautiful sound
I can love you desperately, though your love ain't guaranteed
When our mouths are filled with uninvited tongues of others
I'd read some poems for you
Living on a diet of Chocolates and Cigarettes
Oh, the memories come astreamin',
Are you waiting for a miracle
Flowers cut and brought inside
You once had a heart like a child
And so you could become very sensitive to everything, you start walking through the studio, you go 'ah yes, it's going to be a good day, I can feel 
His body always kept,
Yeah we'll just stay in our home, in our homes
Now death is in my yard
When she twinkles
I wanna live today
So don't let me wait
I'm seeing hoes sex in the studio bathroom
So your phantom follows me
Summer days it never ends
It's my whole life
All dressed up like you're in some kind of rage
I would give anything, anytime
But from him I never want to part
Nothing can be changed
He gutted  sturgeons up from the silver bay
We say the words we take them in
Time to sing love rhymes
If the stars say that you couldn't love me,
They just want to be back at home
Longing for the warmth of childhood
She's telling all of those lies
Good things come
But I think more than I ought to think
And say yes to one and let the other one ride
But the silence surrounds you
And you're even more beautiful there than I remember you being
Quand, alanguie, elle frémit et soupire
I want them to stay
With a thought she has caught by a thread
Upon waking the facial expression deigns a satiable exchange
It's a perfect moment, oh
