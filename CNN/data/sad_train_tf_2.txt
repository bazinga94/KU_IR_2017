And all that love you gave was strong enough to make me stay and now it will be alright
That I want and I'm needing, everything that we should be
For the rest
From the edge of the deep green sea
All the things I should've given but I didn't
Enough to see your light
I�m free to care, I just never do
Straighten up little soldier, stiffen up that upper lip
It's just that I've been losing
And the voice that made me cry
Somebody hurt you too
And right as rain, I'm not the same but I feel the same, I feel nothing
Sewing up the fold,
Tell me enough of thinkin' everything that you've done is good
Become someone different
And I don't want to scare her
I ain't got to be afraid, my broken heart is free
This is my heart, bleeding before you
They've long since waved their last goodbyes
Car alarm or hissing snake
So I'll watch your life in pictures
All that I know is I'm breathing now
I'd turn the car around and runaway,
It's only the air you took and the breath you left
Swings empty,
Worth it right now
I want to leave my mark so everyone will know
And if it's alright
I just didn't get busted
I'm gonna miss the snow
To find I've been turned over
Even when I'm alone I hear your mellow drone
I feel the pain and it feels good
Traveled all alone through boring meadows
I've done something so terrible
Better sit back and go with the flow
But I'm already somebody's baby
If he had've stayed you might understand,
Of the unfinished line
The night's so long, yeah, the night's so long
It'll grow back like a starfish"
I won't always love what I'll never have
Your eyes won't open wide enough
In the night sky
Winds blowing lightly and I picture you
So I must learn to abort these feelings
And please remember me seldom
But everybody says this place is beautiful
You got me scattered in pieces
But I'd be the last to let you know
Three will love you so much
These five gears and wheels could drive to her
I hope you're waiting for me
And there's nothing I can do to keep
Do you still come last night clear eyes pale
Got to be some more change in my life
Every picture you paint
Just wanna make this right
Where the selfishly sick and selfabsorbed
But both of our hearts believe
Try to cry out in the heat of the moment
The children, they cried
I used to think of him, he used think of me
Our old friend, fear, and you, and me
I see Christmas lights reflect in your eyes
But nobody wants to know him
Those days would never end
The how I can't recall
A song for a heart so big
Still it takes him all day just to get an erection
That happens all the time, love, yeah
Folded your nightgowns neatly in a case
Yes, so CripplePig was happy
One by one they come and go
Of all the things I should've said
I dream of times when you were mine so I
Always keep me close
Ada, I can hear the sound of your laugh through the wall
Off the map where the wild things grow
Everything I can't be, is everything you should be
If you began to wave goodbye
Lay me down tonight, lay me by your side
Underneath a winters' moon,
I pray that you'd come to my door
Everyone loves the fun, everyone comes by
I'm still remembering the day
Or my heartbeat slow
I turn around to see
It seems like it's so hard for you to move ahead
And he drove his car into the Navy yard
'Cause we have spoken everything
Boy and the ghost,
Rolling my way alone
And don't think I couldn't ever understand
When you walk away
We've been around on the side
'Bout a home I'll never see
With a bullet and a bet
Life to Me To please come save me from myself
I wake up, it's a bad dream, no one on my side
Right before my eyes, you are the saddest sight I know
And on the autumn leaves that fall
I promise you
If your heart was full of love
Mankind, with your heresy
In the end
Shine until tomorrow, let it be
I'm on fire, baby
Do you lie
I feel me
And then accused me of trying to fuck it up
Why are you so far away from me
Is nonsense, right
And there's plenty of ways to claim his crimes tonight
House were nobody lives
Its hard to say that I miss you
That I'd already taken too much today
Heads on a science apart
Oh whoa yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Me, myself, I got nothing to prove
That's my little brother man, he's only six years old
In the rear view mirror
Be where you are
I don't know where they are
Drink my worries down the drain
And if you fell to your death today
And the road gets tough, I don't know why
What you tried to say to me
Over canyons and waterfalls
But this may be my last song
You gave up the fight
So I say turn up the music, take me home or take me anywhere
God bless her little soul
Me and my valuable friend can fix all the pain away
The way we are tied in
I watched you die, I heard you cry every night in your sleep
Instead of reading in a letter that they've gone to something better
Why do I worry about one
You have a problem with the truth
From absorbing everything
Every tree is broken 
How did I let things get to me
And you make boundaries you'd never dream to cross,
Twisting round and round
Regardless of what they say
The emptiness starts to drown
Hardened to the point
I have seen water, it's water, that's all
With tears from me
River of time, river
I can't believe what I do late at night
Or only one way that it was always meant to be be
So fall asleep with the windows open
My shivering halfmoon
They left the television screaming that the radio's on
Of the slow and funny scene
There's clothes all over the floor
My mind is filled with radio cures
And she may rise, if I sing you down
Tonight you're sleeping alone
Let me walk astray
You started a war that you can't win
Yes, it's the saddest experience you'll ever know
Without her I'm lost
I don't wanna be the reason why
You tidied your things into the bin,
I fall apart
It's funny that way, you can get used
I'm going to say it once again 'til I instill it
I know you're broken 
To heal the wounds from lovers past
That with the door closed, shades drawn
When you can lay back and enjoy it through your kids
So go on love, leave while there's still hope for escape
And I knew that the lights of the city were too heavy for me 
I can remember where I come, come from
But we can't go back, we're on our own;
'Cause I'd do anything you want me to for you
She put him out like the burnin' end of a midnight cigarette
I had true love
And everybody hurts sometimes
Try to make it all okay, baby yeah
These are the best that I
Just the same way you showed me, showed me
It's hard to believe
It's disrespectful how you've handled this
Können Sie nen Moment warten Dauert nicht lange
About everything you could imagine
And so we watch the sun come up
Just yesterday morning they let me know you were gone
And you'd be so crazy to say goodbye
What if I was someone different in your only history
I'm holding up the queue
Slow is the memory
I never knew then
How will I rest my head
And now I'm wasting
He's the only one for me, Jolene
That's the one, Oy
'Cause we kept your clothes, we kept your business
Sleeping with ghosts
It's even dark in the daytime
You're the only one for me
Its starting to hit me
I could fall, or I could fly
There's a world outside
But everything reminds me of her this evening
My mind is filled with silvery stuff
One kid with a promise
Hand over heart, I'm praying
He's never going home
I don't, don't need you telling me how
And it hurts a whole lot
In the one life that we've got
As I walked away, heard them say
It's gonna take her to get home
I don't know what to say
Brightness fills empty space
She comes to me like an angel out of time
Oh, to turn and see her smile
Take my voices, learn to love them
'Cause it's really not that sad from here
She makes up
Now I'm here to stay, love can be so boring
Now, Brenda really never knew her moms, and her dad
Don't you know, you're life itself
She collapses down upon the ocean floor
Best of starts, the broken heart, the stone
All of this and her dark hair, oh no
Baby I'm sinking, merely sinking
You pack my peace of mind 
My tongue gets tied
Would I could afford to buy my love a fine gown
And I won't hear you cry when I'm gone
Ain't no angel gonna greet me
As the sun sets on Mary, its rising on him 
Poison hearts will never change
As if it's hell down here
Sing out loud "We all die"
I picked up the song and found my picture in the paper
Asking to get in
She is wrapping him up in her bat arms
Perfect eyes will have perfect aim
But for the surplus that loves, what's to become of us
His picture worn and weathered
That's unfair
The night's gone
And you've lost your way
It's only fair to do what's best for you and you alone
Where do I go when the land touches sea
'Cause you're not the one, you're not the one
I had been waiting for so long
'Cause I've made my break
What did I say"
No one in this fair new world can talk us through this situation
Then it's your fault
Keep my heart
And I guess we're really over, so come over, I'm not over it oh
You make the hardest things
Ill show you
Ground had arose and passed its knees
Screamed your name
I guess she doesn't have a choice
I got nothing
Though he's gone
All the chickens come on home to roost
And all I wanna do is ride bikes with you and stay up late and watch cartoons
It's made of dreams that didn't come true
No one's about to shout
I want to say I lived each day until I die,
I'm only here to witness the remains of love exhumed
I'll tell you a secret I've held all my life
Below the tamaracks he is crying
Oh, in the perfect blue buildings,
Lord, I could never show you 
Well the chambers of my heart
I still remember
Perfect blue buildings, oh,
Cantilever bridge, the drunken sailor
Mate bells me to borrow money
Now that I know that I'm breaking to pieces
They won't hear, tonight, the words of a lullaby
But you can give me all the love that I crave
We have got through so much worse than this before
Remember all the songs and the way we smiled
Someday I'll follow you and see you on the other side
Well yes sir, yes sir, yes it was me
Empty stares from each corner of a shared prison cell
I break in two and if a piece of you dies
Say a prayer to yourself
Billy's leaving today don't know where he's going
Ooh The sun don't shine
Hey, beauty supreme
Even your friend said I was better
I didn't know
And if you ever get back to Hackensack
So, so you think you can tell
And if you take him home 
I'm eeing lights, feeling pain, there's my cure on ice
But you're still spitting fire
Tired of getting stoned
I see you give that look goodbye
And shed my last tear
But I miss you when you're gone
And there, you got me, that's how you got free
Is anybody waiting at home
But there's too much bad for us to think
For my troubles are few
All the light that you possess is skewed by lakes and seas
Slowly walk away
All I want in life's a little bit of love to take
Oh I, I want to go back to
I remember the days we spent together,
To look through panes of shaded glass
Meet me out for coffee, where we'll talk about it all
Where we are all going to
Like the time we thought was made for you
I'm glad you came around today
And you don't need my pictures on your wall,
That could think of the dreamer that thought
Hush, hush, darlin'
The thing is I'm not worth the sorrow
I wanna live life, and be good to you
Then I let the
Frightening
That I need to be with you 
Reminded me of when we were kids
That There is no truth 
And maybe one day I will free her
But damn Sam I love a woman that's blue
Come away with innocence, and leave me with my sins
Waiting to start
There's no more places to hide
Beneath the stars came fallin' on our heads
Twoheaded boy, she is all you could need
I'm drunk and I'm tired,
Take a ticket to my own fate 
And you should've left the light on
Yeah, I'm less than nothing now
I may seem unafraid
Couldn't love you more; you've got a beautiful taste
Then a phone call made me realize
There was nothing to
And a lark was heard in the still
Well you do enough talk
You'd be scratching your head through the best advice you knew
And yet you don't believe her
My lullaby
You're crushing me inside
And I'm so tired that I gotta go
I'm not comfortable with how the story ends
I won't feel sorry for me, I'm getting drunk
And then it was clear  I can't deny, I really miss him
The fool on the hill
I was just thinking  I was just thinking
Some people say she's stuckup
All day these bastards are leavin'
And disappears inside of her head
Got a YouThinkICare air
And talk to me
He got mad, tiresome
When I stand here taking every breath with you, oohooh
Scattered yesterdays, the past is far away
I don't know who you are, but I
And I've completely lost myself and I don't mind
While you were sleeping
You should count your change before you're even out the door
At the other boatmen's wives
You will always be inside my heart
To keep good love from going wrong
I am crying in the bathroom
A NeverNeverland
To yesterday
Minutes passed at speeds we can run at
And the birds all sing the blues
And it's not a cry you can hear at night
How can I forget your love
No, they never got us anywhere 
You might swear, you'd never touch a lady
If I had it any sooner you know
Everytime I interrupt someone like you used to,
We're on the other side
I suppose that I'm one of the few
And I won't let it show
Amongst the vending machines and yearold magazines
While I was busy waging wars on myself, you were trying to stop the fight
Ooh, where love is lost, your ghost is found
So why do I still burn for you
I hope to find it in the end
And left her with an invitation to the blues
Turned off the light on my way out the door
That man knows the sea
And black fumes of skin so gently bled
But all of that just seems so far away from me
Side by side in orbit around the fairest sun
As I pass down my old street
I'll carry you home
Is it by mistake or design
That's turned to turpentine
Give a minute
Shed the clothes that become my skin
There's innocence torn from its maker 
I told you it was all yours
Now when the wind blows you cover your tooth
What they call love is a risk
Someone's gonna show up, never fear
And I don't wish to taste of your insides
The distance that keeps you 
Remember, Dear, our son's first cry
Like you knew it was time to start things over again
Let me fly
Baby, I'll try to love again but I know
Change in the air
Your mother was born in December,
Your cold white brother alive in your blood
When my sister finds my body closed up like the blinds,
Spin me 'round again
When somebody loved me
I needed to leave this trade and just heave it away
I thank you and hang up the phone,
How I hope I'll suit you someday
Shit, fuck what you look like, just show the real
You couldn't love
Where is your sense of indignation
Well I saw it in your movements
Gather up its harm in gauze with grateful arms
Her eyes were bright, tonight would be the night
But it don't matter
There will be tears, I've no doubt
But what's really worth living anymore
I used to live alone before I knew you
I did everything for you, I did everything for you
There's a moment in time
Close to nothing at all 
And fully clothed, I float away
A breeding ground for hate but
I saw two birds lost at sea 
And I rise to turn it off 'cause all I'm seeing is her face, age eight
Washing in on top of me
She walks alone from wall to wall
That he's here, means he's never lost
We have nothing more to share
That there may not be another one like this
Like strangers passing by
You took a ring and pawned our love away
No, I'm not crying
And each line is sent I have found a new pages
He said, I'm gonna buy this place and watch it fall
And I don't want to start over again
It's all I really need to make me stay
All the hell I put you through 
No longer afraid of the dark or midday shadows
You need to leave that clown in the dust
Floor twofoot high with newspapers
In the spring
Flawed crystals hang from your ears
There's no heat in this house
Yes and the morning has me
I like the sound of that, yeah, it's got a ring to it, don't it
But she could breathe deep into my neck
'Cause here they come
A game that's made for twothat's you and me
When I need a thrill
And everything that we could be
Of the night sky to infinity
Another son who never had
I can hardly speak I understand
The winter slammed us like a fist
"We have gone to Hackensack" 
Aside the lions and the ladies
And through the evening the engine kept on until we hit Chicago and decided to stop
There's no regard for life
I'm not cryyyyyyyyying
I heard that your dreams came true
It would be a lie to run away
That's when I knew I had to move
Yes, it can be done
I want the things that I had before
And there's nothing much left of me
Without love it ain't nothin'
There was no tomorrows and we'd packed away our sorrows
Outside the world wages its rewards, I'll rest in peace as long as you know
And moonlight would provide the spark
Freak my selfish out, my mind is happy
I begged her to stay
Empty and bothered, watching the water
I break in two over you, oh,
He made my daughter laugh, then we embraced
Vanity fairgrounds and rebel angels
All I wanted was to sing the saddest songs
I've seen it all, I have seen the trees
Ya, I try to believe you
"No one is allowed to be so proud
I just can't remember who to send it to
And I don't want to cry my whole life through
And for a moment I lose myself
Where should I hang my head
You make me feel like I am young again
Save it for the deathbed
Hide and Seek Ransom notes keep falling out your mouth 
Up in my steamer trunk
Harness your blame and walk through
When you were an island to discover
Walking a fine line between wrong and right
No more breath inside
Light up, light up
I let my heart decide the way
I'm tired of traitors
Dear darkness, dear darkness 
Trains and sewing machines
To keep it light together
Keeping things clean doesn't change anything
There is a wound that's always bleeding 
If you are not mine then why does your heart return my call
And all around us everywhere
Got your bible and your gun
I can't believe what I saw on the TV screen
Come and kiss this pain away
And it might be wonderful, yeah
Want to keep you inside
Got a hotel room just to turn you on
It's letting people in
But I don't need them
Green limousine for the redhead
I'm feeling so lonely
Won't you let me take you for a ride
To tear inside you
I see the fire, I see the end 
Take me with you 'cause I'm lonely
Oublier le temps
Sweet summerlight
But it's gone
Forgot where I was sleeping, none of the lights were on
parecido a ayer 
When the game's been fought
Somebody's not paying attention to
Everyone of us is scared, not you
He is kind, she is free, and wants to show him
But you may lose me here
And I lift my hands and pray to be only Yours
Not many people want me at their parties
No brokenhearted girl
They will stay here forever
Complete contradiction
Against the wall
Come lay me low and love me
All you can be is just you, 'cause you're real, not the plastic type
I focus on the pain
'This sun never sets again
That you'll be scrupulous and one day even make a wife
And I have lived so many lives
And nights when you made me your own
So many dreams on the shelf
It's just a shame
Like a constant reminder
I've looked in the studio, study and all
And I, I can see their eyes
I thought we'd have children together
The kiss of the snow
I felt closer to you than you ever would have known
I saw an angel
When there's nowhere left to fall, nowhere to hide
I'm gonna find you 'til the end
It's easier said than done
I would still lay down my life for you
Cold, now we're so cold, mine, and you're not mine, say never 
I wear black on the outside
Black sky will burn
I need a change
I can't look away
Like the ground's not mine to walk upon
Her eyes were bright, tonight he finds her,
I mean it's always never like this
Places, places, get in your places
Why am I so troubled, girl
Strong as I feel
'Cause it's not hard to fall
And wiped a tear from the side of my face
I was here
Or make you feel I belong
He knows that they're the fool
The perfect heart's length away
No words could explain, no actions determine
A bruised full moon play fights with the stars
Give up on trying to save us
You got a devil up your sleeve
Somebody oughta take you in
I wanna break free
Its color gone
White lips, pale face, breathing in snowflakes
I'm still remembering my life
But I don't hate like they do 
Visions born in the dreams
You took a piece of me the day you went away, 
Being like you are
But I'm still near you
Without face, without crown
I try so hard, don't let me be misunderstood
Got such a feeling as the sun goes down
I don't mean to hurt
Started reading about dreams in your favourite book
This has got to lie down
I could kiss you, with lines of escape in my mouth
Even though I know you're not comin' home
It's just you and I, my friend
And at the back of what we've done
And you thinking we'll be fine again
Venice gets a queen
'Cause love doesn't hurt so I know I'm not falling in love
And she was right here in my arms tonight, but here comes goodbye
Please sleep, my darling, sleep
Who feel so very lonely
Yes, and the morning
Every song I sing, I'll sing for you
Until there is no one
One is the loneliest number, much much worse than two
And a girl from class to touch
You will always be a loser
But it turns out just the same
And take my hand to feel the pull, the quicksand
Told me when I was young
Oh, but you just don't believe that I'm sincere
For great love and learning 
My feet are walking over him
Why you got to be mean now
You never really can fix heart
Open heart, open heart, it should be illegal to deceive a woman's heart,
I've spent ten years trying to sing it all away
That's the sight and that's the sound of it
Hardly wait
I fell asleep last Saturday
When I look back I'll be able to say
Burning holes straight through my heart
I've been thinking of the things that I missed
Someone you said you'd always be there for
We shared the years, we shared each day
Nothing like I did before
Watching us fading and watching it all fall apart
On such a tight ship
Sing me to sleep, sing me to sleep
When it's the food on your lips with which it's in love
So take care what you ask of me
Coming back as we are
I don't regret a thing
You break and tell me
I've been hurt before
That you were looking for
Well, I really think you should quit smoking
And now you're gone, there's like an echo in my head
Teach a man to fish, you feed him now for life
It is my fault you see
This love is a mystery
It's easier to be apart
We're all right
I'm trying hard to hide your soul, son
But I would rather be locked to you than live in this pain and misery
Oh, sadness I'm your girl
Till I come back again,
Or let this heart be still
You took the first words that they spoke
More will show up after the bars close
I know that you'd stay
Watching the cars as they go by
They had breakfast together
And I'll tell the world
Good friend
Somewhere with you, yeah
Those dogs that love the rain and chasing trains
In the steps I'm about to take
So sad her eyes 
Like a castaway on a warm ocean
It's the end of the end of the end
So why did you flee
Now I spend my time just making rhymes of yesterday
The flan in the face
You are the only exception
You throw your pearls at swine 
Whatever you do, it's all good
Dance me to the children who are asking to be born
Oh yeah 
I left home at an early age
In the moment of the meantime
I'm with you in the morning
But I know that we tried everything we could try
Drove the night toward my home
So won't you be fair
But now she's your shade of gold
Is the pain of the fighting starting up again
Oh this town
My senses can't divide
It's all your fault It's all your fault
My neighbors think I'm crazy
When all of your wishes are granted
So why do I feel so sad
We're the coolest kids and we take what we can get
These wheels keep turning but they're running out of steam
You see, I know a few of your favorite things
So let's face it, this was never what you wanted
You've done enough
And fall, fall, fall 
He's going to change my name
You got a playboy mommy
Not one inch of doubt in my mind
So I'm holdin' on I'm still holdin'
And I still feel you everywhere
Where can I go that your pictures won't haunt me
If you are not mine would I have the strength to stand at all
I might as well be useless for all it means to you
I saw him last night at the party, he's definitely thin
Yesterday I went outside
You know that you are not alone
I never needed you to be there everyday
And soak into silence
Confessantly, this is the first time I've loved you
No hint of movement, no sign of pulse
I would give at this moment
But they believe her
In the blink of an eye
And I wear all your old clothes, your polo sweater
And here tonight while the stars are blacking out
In my dreams I see you
But the day will come, Jenny Wren will sing
And someone to believe you
Now I'm weaker than the palest blue
What about taking this empty cup and filling it up
And so bare is my heart
Been throught a million kicks looking for the one that sticks
For some answers, to this fire
They never fall, they can never run dry
I love them
And that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over
Learning to fly, learning to run
'Cause the one I loved today, I hardly know
I'll take care of you
Come on skinny love, just last the year
When your father found out what we did that night
I was trying to make you angry
While we're waiting
And we all seem to need the help
Oh, trouble
I pray you've heard
And I'll carry you home
I don't care anymore
Of tears and idle threats misplaced then
You'll be the pain
When you can't even define what it is that you are frightened of
Your smile is so wide and your heels are so high
A part of me is gone
Run an electric shock to my brain
But you are the sun
Seem to rain on
But she don't want to go outside tonight
And I'm the only one who laughs at your jokes when they are so bad
Totalll control,
In two separate worlds
'Cause the good thing's coming
If I ever break away from you that day forth,
We ignore because
Nothing more than a pile of bones
I'm in the car right now, I'm doing  on the freeway
Tell me that it's nobody's fault
I threw the screen door like a bastard back and forth
To help your ass from bouncing off the walls when you get down some
Nothing in this whole wide world saves us from this situation
Just a little bit,
I'm everywhere, I feel so high
You said the past won't rest until we jump the fence and leave it behind
I think I need to change my attitude 
Now it's turning blue, and you say
And we can fly, fly, fly away
As I say goodbye
All that I've got to pull me through is memories of you
Points to my beloved
In love with a molester who's sexin' her crazy
And while I'm gone everything will be alright
I can't do this alone
Oh but I have to say
Faith dear, enough to get you by
I need your light in my life
I love the way you love
It's getting to the point where we have almost made amends
Well, I never meant to cause you no pain baby, yeah;
It was the only place I'd ever known
The same blood runs in every hand
It's in my honey, it's in my milk
Give me a fistful of love
In my life, I hope I lie
While I'm staring at my phone
Lately my hands, they don't feel like mine
I want you to fly not stop and start
Never pick sides, never choose between two
Fell from the sky, heaven replied
Easy come and easy go, whatever
Oh, love, it's easy if you don't try to please me
If I have my way, I will love you
In you is everything that I'm missing
And we'll lie till the corncrake crows 
So lovely
And it's been hours now, to be here like this
Just as long as we got the same thing in our veins, you and I, we are both the same
I thought I sold my soul but he kept the receipt
But she's out with her answerphone
Those vicious streets are filled with strays
Belly's not even tingling, I just feel a bit pissed
I pray he wants to lose
But I'm turnt up upstairs and I love you
Could have loved you all my life
And if you're sleeping I'm with you
I break in two, and each piece of me dies
There is nothing left of you
As you walk away,
No one's got it aaall
Love these days is getting rough
Slips her dress like a flag to the floor
Get me a room at the Squire, the filling station's hiring
The sweet turning sour
Come on, oh my star is fading
I know how you'll die
For they're designed to be together oh
I'll never let you see
Because I'd hate to see her make the same mistake"
It's out of love
They fed us on little white lies
That alright Yeah
I don't know how I feel when I'm around you
Byebye
On a very tight ship
I'm sitting here weeping
But going out of my mind
I did not mean to hurt my little girl
I've been havin' mine
The sun's coming up
But that was not to be
I beg my god to speak and tear me apart
Down in the heat with the broken numbers
Above this same awakening world
Turning circles and time again
And your mother's still calling you insane and high
This house, it holds nothing but the memories
I guess it was a lot
So I showed you who's really in control
Who could deny these butterflies
The bridge to nowhere
Palms in the middle, hands in the middle
I'm tired of the sunset
The beauty that surrounds them
'This wonder always leaves
But I don't wanna fight anymore,
I turn to you and I let you know
Keep that sweet heart of yours beating
You've got yourself to tease and displease
There will be tears
I would tell you how much that I've missed you since you've been away
Now take a look at me now
And I need you
So we wait for morning
How do we call this love
A year ago tonight we lay
And I fell asleep with you still talking to me
Hold my heart till brighter days
Once said, always said, I will hold the past over your head
Knock, knock, knockin' on Heaven's door
The bartender's singing "Clementine"
Somewhere along in the bitterness
In a marathon of days too long
If we tear out the tumor
I won't pick up the phone
Where nothing ever happened
Could not speak as loud as my heart
And looks down at my breaking face
That one day I will be, where I was
So I turned mine, away from your sadness, away from the nothing that you feel for me
The sea's evaporating
But they might suit you better than the rest
You used to light me up
Got out of bed at all
Sing us a song, sing us a song
You could drop the keys off in the morning
Well I guess it's fate
You know the clothes that you wear, and the colour in your hair,
I think that you could do so much better
He waits for her to understand
Waves of steel hurled metal at the sky
Had an element of danger
You were only waiting for this moment to be free
Doll heart
You will pray to the God that you've always denied
Wait out the weather that howls in my brain
Were you left behind
Have tired lifeless eyes
I dedicate this song to you
Somebody who gave a damn, somebody more like myself
Living the good life, I left for dead
How many hearts will die tonight
They told me, "Son, it's time to tell the truth"
I kissed your mouth and back
Adolescence didn't make sense
On this new spring morning
Say goodbye to Ruby's arms
I'm sure it didn't ruin her
She's a pretty thing and she knows everything
Ooh Your stylish mess of silver hair
I got so scared that I forgot my name
This grief overwhelms me
But they'll take mine
But you were in the shower when I got there, and I'd have wanted to stay 
In hopes you're on the other side talking to me too
While everyone's yawning 
I thought I saw your face today
'Cause that's what I've seen in movies
Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up, and stuck 'em under the tree
I want deep space
You didn't know
The Lord made you to prove something
Sure we all make mistakes
Maybe we'll make something
Eighteen forever first kisses
I can't believe it four years down the drain
Just too bad they stare, just too bad they stare
Red light, blinking in the twilight
So I'm making a deal with the devils of fame
Still cries at a good film, still kisses with saliva
So where'd the years go
Just try not to worry, you'll see us someday
Even practice and parties seem long
Take back all the things that I said to you
And cover me from the sun
It rises all around me
Yeah kiss my mouth, hell is here
'Cause I'm a bad habit
If we get to see tomorrow
More then anything you wanted to be right
Counting stars again
Just hanging with the girls
Hear the nighthawks cry
"You know, those red moments where it's thin, like, pretty, early on, and But then, simul I also, like, include the like the tinted blues"
See you're high and lonesome
Are you so scared to look within
The weakness
Sorry seems to be the hardest word
Too many tears
Was that Marilyn was found in the nude
I will bring you home
Put me inside
Current girlfriend, exgirlfriend
Without sounding an alarm,
And I go back to December
When it's all here and it's all new
I won't be back here though we may meet again
Your withered heart and everything it's seen
The things I kept inside
This was never my world, you took the angel away
Babe, boy I'm gonna drink you in
You come to me with a bone in your hand
And ohoh, say you'll miss me say you'll miss me one last time
Resting on the shoulders
No one knows the name of
Whatever that means so
It goes to my head so carefully
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah
They've been knockin' me sideways
I thought I'd drop you easily
It's hardly what I'd be doing if you gave me a choice
In your life I'll take my cover echoing what is not
And poses for pictures that aren't being taken
Don't walk away
Embracing thoughts of tonight's dreamless sleep
You should've left the light on
So come on kid, look at what you did
You only feel sorry for yourself 
The words gets trapped
Johnny came home with another wife
And turn it into nothing
A child of sacrifice, a child of war
Can turn your world into dust
Now run along my little nightmare, your job is done here
That love was meant for beauty queens
And I feel something's changed
I'm like a loser that's betting on his last dime
Baby wakes up with the sun
And the worst thing is that I don't even really care
Who never live as long as we think that they oughta live
Here on the nineteenth floor
Oh, for so long I've tried to shield you from the world
My love for you's so overpowering 
Don't send me to the path of nevermore
And I will let the devil know
I never needed your corrections
Another floor, another ceiling
I see the rain fall upon the funeral mourners
To heal when you're hurting so much
I need help and you're way across the sea
For all the times she sang God's song
Powder blue, oh
In a dream, I saw you walkin'
He never meant to hurt me
A strength I never lost
before our parents send for us
Here it comes
In this same bar where you slammed down your hand 
I'll show every one around you 
I can use my tears to
Never make him love me
Of these lives which are completely meaningless,
It just walks in where it left you last
My castle, kids and home
'Cause these last three years
I've hardly been outside my room in days,
And I can't pretend I won't think about you when I'm older
The web we weave is thick and sordid
Oh yeah yeah oh oh
But I'm not going to say them
So let me go, just let me fly away
I was unrecognizable to myself
We are exactly as before
I may be disturbed
Acid heads, unmade bed, and you Woodward world queers
A stumbling clichéd case
Cut that little child
I get smothered in despair, it's never over, over
We all come to an end,
Flowers won't be left in parks
Custa o que correr, corre o que custar, ah
The town we lived in
Every thought that I repent
But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Plant your feet back on the ground
To the wisdom of old
And the fire that was starting to go out
I've got to get out of this hole
We've been cutting it close with the backwards & forwards
Her love is all that I can see
Oh, river of sorrow
Come back
And I won't look back
All the rest is predictable
It could never be the way I loved you
You're already the voice inside my head
Help me get back to your arms
My city's still breathing, but barely, it's true
Il faut oublier
Cause you can see with your own eyes
Now I don't know what to be without you around
I couldn't stop, so I swerved to the right
Because you're young, you're wild, you're free
Wondering, when savior comes, is he gonna be saved
You found another way to bleed my soul away
They are knocking now upon your door
No love, no glory
How the years would go flying by
It's so hard to say that I'm sorry
When I got home, heard the phone,
And when the color goes out of my eyes she's usually too
But I am broken too,
'Cause I don't really got shit else so that shit helps when I'm depressed
It's so hard to think it ends sometime
Here come the tears
Sought by single M Nothing too heavy
The boy from Seoul was hanging on good
And now I miss everything about you Still you're gone
Now you'll just become
So use your chemicals and take this to your grave, 
And the daffodils look lovely today
Not appreciated's just his first name
And something has got to give
Well, you could have your choice of men
You can tell the sun in his jealous sky
I whisper empty sounds in your ear
Running round this house
Frank's in there, and I don't care
When it rains it pours down
And learned to cry
And when the day has all but ended
And everything I will give is everything you couldn't take
I miss the grinded concrete where we sat past  or 
Now I work in a market as a checkout girl
It's time to get down Everybody wake up, it's time to get down
Oh, don't carve me out Don't let your silly dreams,
I still love you
Just to break me like a promise
So stay home
The addresses of our meetings
My Konstantine came walking down the stairs 
To be moving Moving Moving my way home
There's no point in direction 
Darling I hope that my dream
It can make you feel like you've gone crazy
Wildflowers, dear
And the way I felt inside
Never to see your face again
Fallen frames, they told me
I know that it is freezing, but I think we have to walk
I'm a moon that never shows its face
She could pull the sun right through me, oh
I left just before my lungs could get wet
She's running out
They come and go, as early warnings
Dry your eyes
I never thought good jobs were hard to find
Will you come home and stop this pain tonight
It's all I do, babe
Nananana, yeah, oh
Hello helicopter, are you listening
We hardly talked
How's it going to be, when you find out there was nothing
I will miss you, distance aside
Darling, please
With my mama's Mason jar
And I lost my head
The first things I noticed about you
Would you hold my hand, no
I'm not going back, I can't pretend
You were swinging your guitar around
On the hills
She lives a life she didn't choose
We're leaving here tonight
Can change everything in your life
Shine a little light
Though I saw it all around
We'll be light
Live forever, for the moment
Windows down and my hair in the breeze
I hear you talk about your family life
Send me roses, I just let 'em die
Your ship may be coming in
There's a place where you are going
And now the flames are burning me in my bed but I just don't care
Tout peut s'oublier
So you're backtracking
But I'm going to stop pretending
If you change your mind I'll come, come, come
Little pieces that avoid an awful crime,
Back with the streets I know
Inside it's cold
The mask I polish in the evening, by the morning looks like shit
All those little times you said that I'm your girl
Through everyone that feels it 
With someone new
Seems like they've made it to the other side
Put it to my brain and scream "Die Shady" and pop it
Said 'Stop'  but we went on wholehearted
No one knows what is coming
But always wakes alone
And they're all still around
Maybe something will change
I'm waiting, all hated and damned
But underneath it, she's a broken girl
Red racing cars, sunset and vine
You're all alone behind your eyes
All the bags are checked
Woooooh, Woooooh
The wasted years
If I'm lookin' for somethin' it's probably a fight
For things to be be quiet
Found something real that's out of touch
Why are you crying
Who'd never close both his eyes
Oh you should be careful of who you keep talking to
And you know it was money well spent
Daddy don't want you to see but you see just as much as he did
Saw an evil emperor wearing my clothes
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
My eyes 
Must enjoy the sun, must enjoy the sea
And what did you find that would leave you walking by
I want your warm, but it will only make
Where I'd find your face
With one or two I get used to the room
She once believed in every story he had to tell
And saying whatever they say
Not turn away
Cause now she seems so fake to me
Don't be scared to speak
Can I change my life for any price
Moved on to another town
And filled up our garden with snow
And the sorrow I have seen since I left my home
I did not understand
And you ruin who you love
And with a sound like white magic caught in a black car's blazing trail
Falling from your mouth
She run, run, run, run
In a day and a day love
Thinking a blink of these lashes would make you come
She hasn't much to hold onto
I don't mind repeating
But I was never the one for you
Back when I was a child
I've tried to see your point of view
I just want you to be mine,
Where are you now I can hear footsteps I'm dreaming
I saw him in my dream
These are the words I've never said
And that's all I wanna do right now
Please put all the drugs out of your hand
Leave tonight or live and die this way
Even though we've become without
When the AC hum inside your sleepy head,
But I'm writing the answers on cheap paper napkins
I'm bright as the Oregon breeze
The athlete's laugh, the broken crutch
If I only could, ooh
Forever I'll fight
Before you take a swing, I wonder what are we fighting for,
I say that I'm a phantom airplane
Some search, never finding a way
Don't wanna try don't wanna try
No I don't look back 
All of this and her dark hair, oh Lord
Don't try to wake me in the morning
In all the things you see
As one we are everything 
Doll mouth
I try to see but I'm blinded by the white light 
Find the reason of another's pain
So next time I see you, I'll be pleased to see you
Put me in the hole, a thousand times again
Of this frozen town, I'm stripped down to move on
The hour or the day, no one can tell
I hear you cry
From the world 
Awake, but cannot open my eyes
His father sent him to his death
But you never were, and you never will be mine
But baby wait, "It's too late dad, you made the choice
I love you I love you I love you I love you
And finally drank away his memory
I hold a force I can't contain
Take all these strings, they call my veins
There I was in uniform
Songs about happiness, murmured in dreams
And godsend I don't want to go
Could you let me go 
Is filled with holes
The things I brought you
You're there through my wasted days,
I wanna hold hands with you
He prays for love, he prays for peace, and maybe someone new
I laugh a lot so my friends won't know
Is fading away like tears in the rain
I took a walk with my fame down memory lane
You are the most beautiful entity that I've ever dreamed of
All the shadflies run at once
Feel there's truth that's beyond me
Emotion sickness 
I know you don't think you did me wrong
And I feel pretty, pretty enough for you
Picture perfect fading smiles are all that's left in sight,
What is there to answer if I'm the only one
That's how you fight it
When my days are through
So you got ahead
Get away, walk away, walk away
In my heart I know, I can let go
Yellow hair
Yeah, we never talk about the future
Go home and shot your health
May angels lead you in
Let me fly away with you
To fix this one last time
In God, do you still disagree
I'mma buy a diamond ring for you, I'mma sing for you
And they turn around, smiling, but
She says, "Hey, baby, I just might take the chance"
But thoughts of us kept keeping me awake
I want a perfect soul
That seems to be where
Oh, just a little bit wrong
I know that I'll be sadder
A nine pound hammer or a woman like you
With the wild wolves around you
Mama, now I'm coming home
I want you back
"And the wind is blowing like it's the end of the world", you said
Round here, we're carving out our names
I must be strong and carry on
But I'm still not right 
It's times like these I forget what I miss
Only heartaches remain
And everybody's got to live their life
And cut the nooses they tie for our necks
So oh, river of sorrow
Please help me friend from coming down
All the rainbows in the sky
But all that I know is I'm breathing
Że ty łatwo tak zgodziłaś na to się i
But nobody wins
Nobody has gained or accomplished anything
Dance me to the wedding now, dance me on and on
Drifting, drowning in a purple sea of doubt
No I got a good talking to
Your head 'round the door 
We were made through one another
I've gotta find a reason
The sands of time were falling
And all you do is let me down
No one is moving
I had so many dreams about you and me
Don't know when I'll be back again
Surrender my heart, body, and soul
I just want to kiss you in the morning sun
And my eyes are bursting hearts
Plummet pop, dew skin, fortitude for the sniffing black noses
In a year or so
Didn't seem so bad until I knew
Every time I ever cried from fear was just a mistake that I made
Choice to live my life extended
Other side
And through the portal, they can make amends;
Yes, I saw you were blinded and I knew I had won
The future may be all I really need
And it's one more day up in the canyons
I ruined it for my friends
We all need that person
Dangerous, 'cause I want you so much
It's not half right
You're not alone
And who he's become
Turn and head for the door
I knew the odds were I'd never win
I've been giving out chances every time
'Cause I'm too tired tonight for all these games
It makes me lonely,
But now it's just a monument
Well, I love you so much Never again
I bite my lip
They travel fast and alone
Mind, the war child
Up with it came our pain and fear
So cold
Your breasts heave when you sing,
A hundred times the doctors say
Please don't let this turn into something it's not
Don't you even try
A daddy to hold me, that's what I needed
Like we've known each other forever
And it starts just where the light exists 
In  hours
I'm only here for awhile, but patience is not my style
Till I heard the doctor say, I had a son
And goodbye for now
Looking back at ', reflecting on those things we could have
We'd buy the Sunday newspapers
To paint in the caves
And even if I need you here
You always say that, you always say this is the last time
And I'm lonely, but I ain't that lonely yet
And when I'm lonely, well I know I'm gonna be
'Cause there's no one left for us to blame
Like a wall of new TV's
I'm my only friend, am I
It's the better thing to do
I want you to remember
And I don't have nothing to say,
Gleam and resonate just like the gates
And a blow to his own head
Just a simple word
Felt like my saviour, my spirit I gave ya, we'd only just begun
I've got the one of you in that dancing dress
I walked around alot
Twenty ways to know
We're spending
I had shoes to fill
In the shade, in the shade
And you couldn't care less
Love of my life
Daddy, you've still got me and little Tommy
And I'll wait, I'll wait 
Tells me all the ways that he's gonna mess me up
And rub my eyes
And in I come to lick it up
I'm forced to fake a smile, a laugh, every day of my life
One sweet day
He will be alone
No one left for you
Your scars concealed
With warm summer eyes that flickered like fireflies,
I couldn't wait till I got home
The sun warms my face
All calendars pass
If it all ended tonight,
No lies, we're losing time
I got a heavy metal mouth that hurls obscenity
I won't deny the pain
Ooh, the years burn
And these foolish games are tearing me, you're tearing me
Is a rule, read the guidelines
But they're all laughing, what's up
Rings of flowers 'round your eyes and I'll love you
May your children play beneath
I try to be I never needed anyone to help me
Where are we
It's far too hard to make you
Pieces of the life I had before
I haven't forgot
You really shouldn't carry me no more
We'll try to go back and make them last
That I'll take to my grave
And they all look the same
Left aching in my mind
Did you know what you were doing, did you know
Heal her soul
'Cause it acts just like lovers do, the satellite
He was thirteen years old
Don't bargain when you're weak
I'll be your clown on your favorite channel
To call at 
I'm gonna love you 'til this ends
You didn't have to, but you coulda signed an autograph for Matthew
Thought I knew which one to wear
Taste the milk of your mother earth's love 
Over the ridge into the distances, written on your ticket 
Well, it'll be a miracle
"You're safe, child, you are safe"
You leave home, you move on and you do the best you can
Tell me when you hear my silence
I want you here tonight, want you here
'Cause if I died tonight
And then I fell apart but got back up again, yeah
I'll be around to grow
I think you need
And he loved me so naughty, made me weak in the knees
Good morning, son
For a while, with the vertigo cured
Bow your head and join with me"
Oh, sing to me once more, my love
And there he goes so perfectly, the kind of flawless I wish I could be
I shot the pilot
Is anybody waiting at home for you,
But your undecisive mind shows me that 
Alive from the first now I'm denied by the ghost of you
By the forest of our spring stay
Wintertime is a razor blade the devil made
Either way I can't breathe
And you better come come 
'Cause my day was rough
Can we help you find the peace and the star
So break yourself against my stones
Does he do all these things
And a million miles
And the strays are pining for their unrequited mothers
I may be a fool
And give you mine
That mimic the dirt cough go drink it's
Running from the voices filling up my brain
Are like music to me
Oh, unrequited love
There's nothing I can say
Oh man, I said I'm under the gun, round here
You'll knock on my door
Chained together for life
I'm too tired to fight your rhyme
With a gun and a pack of sandwiches and nothing
'Cause my words get in my way
Here in line where stupid shit collides
Our conversations are circles, always one sided,
With his sword, with his robe, 
Burning clues into this heart of mine
So remember when we were driving, driving in your car
We broke your glasses but covered our asses
That I'm stuck here waitin', at times debatin'
No time for farewells, no chances for goodbyes
May God's love be with you
Holding on to yourself the best you can
Sometimes ignorance
The window's open now and the winter settles in
Its two am, feelin' like I just lost a friend
Now turn around and don't be sad
How this backward chapter reads
Leading your own sorrow
My imagination runs away
Now they're all dead hearts to you
'Cause it's time that will tell if it's heaven, if its hell
Well, I feel so broke up, I want to go home
For heaven's sake I know you're sorry
Thought I knew it all
Took our chance, crashed and burned
And if you would open up the door
Every occasion, oh, one billion day funeral
She What did we do that was wrong
While we dance in the moonlight
Like the sun's just gonna drop
There's a corner of your heart for me
And all the Spanish candles unsold away have gone to this
There is no use in waiting
Forfeit any fight
Who married young and then retired
With no room for a pardon
There is a storm in my heart
That took my place
One you love
Been inside many heads in different positions
Your strength is in my hand
Starting from zero, got nothing to lose
Stuck in honey
There's still a little bit of your words I long to hear
You'll be the scar
Wie es mir geht, die Frage stellst du jedes Mal
I may be viciously unkind
Come to me once more, my love
Would they be kind enough to comfort me
When the sky can't offer none to me
That haunted this still life 
She wants to go home, but nobody's home
For every street of any scene
And now he's turning off
Of course it's long gone down, you're still hanging around
'Cause this is what you've waited for
Photos on the wall, she's my baby, she's my baby doll
It's so beautiful it makes you want to cry
Please come back home
Graving dreams
Assumed you'd always be there always be there
I'm feeling more alone
But I'm dyin' on the floor
Everybody wants to be someone's here
'Cause nothing's going right
You got me, I got you, you got me, I got you
And all the sterile striking, it defends an empty dock you cast away
you speak in tongues
Derramar no céu, se purificar
Sunk inside our blankets,
The feelings disappear
To make the other one leave
It's not hard to grow
Wrapped with wire, tapped to the heart
But we will know that you are gone
A head hung halfmast 
Is remedied, oh, my blue heaven,
So can you see the stars
We never ask ourselves the questions to the answers that nobody needs to know
The harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me
Never meant to cause you no pain baby, believe me,
Cry like a child, though these years make me older
I can't sleep
He ate a slice of wonderbread
Feel the moonlight on your skin
Spread your wings as you go
You're still the only one that feels like home,
Lonely and forgotten
You still look like a movie
But when you tell them soldiers my name
I've waited for the callin'
To change
You ate your words wrong this time
The need to destroy things creeps up on me every time
Does he drive you wild
We could possibly do was right
The stars, a roof above our heads
These foolish games are tearing me apart
Yeah, and Lord I know when I lay me down to sleep
Empty eyes
Tired of singing all the sad songs in my head,
All my sorrow, all my rage
Mother remember being so stern with that girl who was with me
And I'm kicking the dirt 'cause I never gave you
Someone had to go this far
Rejoice, rejoice, God's ears are stitches
He'd make me laugh just to comfort me yeah, yeah
Found a way to understand the things I'm learning
And dead does he love you
Oh my God, no one came to our side
Crawling back home again
Oh mother, don't look back
In my dreams I can hold you
And all my life that now disturbs my fingers
As the hills turn from green back
So take me to town, I wanna dance with the city
Sometimes I wonder why that meek guy got all the fame,
I'm burning slowly I'm growing weak
Your mouth was so dirty
So this is me swallowing my pride
You laugh at every joke
Safely to the ground
Drinking in the late night establishment
I thought you were my boyfriend
You never promised me anything
No and thank you, please madame
The chains to my life are strong, but soon they'll be gone
So if you find someone
Emphasizing these things you won't allow
Everything washed in a thin orange haze
And the doors are open now as the bells are ringing out
Little whisper smoke signs that you'll never get
While the moon does its division you're buried below
Telling me he'd be home,
So when I'm lost in a crowd
Hey you, things aren't what they seem
You're gonna taste the ground real soon
We're swimming in the blue
It stung like a violent wind
To explain to you I would have walked
I just want to hold you when you're not enough
I'm as worn as a stone
And I could've gone to that place
Saw your face
As my goad into my grave
Five stops, change the station
Can't believe it's hard just to talk to you
They love me like I was a brother
I know they have been hard
Who was there to handle all the broken bits of glass
There's a dream in my brain
I've been looking back to find
No one's listening anyway
I don't want this bridge to burn
My thoughts bounce off Sam's guitar
Carve the way for your pride
I don't know how long we've got left
Don't hang around once the promise breaks
Remember those classes when we thought we were so smart
Stand around here in this small town
Told me how to please a man
I can see whomever I choose
Caught in the confines of the simple life
It's hard to notice gleaming from the sky
Getting nothing in return
Like I heard her backwards saying
I know you feel like it's hard to stay
Take me to the finish line
I won't see you tonight
I'm sorry for the way I let go
And they're thought to be lies
And tell me how I'm supposed to feel
She says, shhh, I know, it's only in my head
I can tell you how I feel
Not sure what space I'm in, oh well,
mis dias sin ti no tienen noches
So let's pretend that we're rich
In shame
And I haven't slept since I met you
This is the part of me that wishes it was with it
Now the cities we live in could be distant stars
If you could die and come back to life
'This dream always ends,' I said
Turn my nights to sleepless itch
You can't miss what you ain't had, well I can, I'm sad and
And look for your children
Well I had better end it quick or I could lose my nerve
I am doll parts
So hard not to blame him
Never cared for what they know, no
Your body gives but then holds back
But when I left my shit in your kitchen,I said goodbye to your bedroom
Every part
From a distance my choice is simple
And waving your hand
There's no eyes in your own head
We're here to play a game of who loves more than whom
It runs in my mind all the hard times how it turns
We're entering a brave new world
I got away from you, I never thought I would
I like lying naked in my bedroom
Backhand, role reversal
I know we loved to hit the road and laugh
No, no, no, you are not alone
'Cause when I talk to you on the phone
So now you're gone
No matter what you say, he'll be back for more
Not a dollar or a crowd could ever keep me here 
Suddenly the night has grown colder
I won't sit outside your house
In this seaside town,
People won't be dressed in black
'Cause I've started falling apart
Little voices whispering
And a light that won't shine in the darkness 
What you've done,
All of my pain when I think back to when
Where you said you'd wait for me
Hiding far with everything
God, I love you
We never change, do we We never learned to leave
The thunder and the laughter
What I want you to remember
High, neglectful lover
You're not going to stop
In the shade
I never ever meant to hurt you
Where we used to laugh, there's a shouting match,
I wanna live where the sun comes out
You're livin' on fancy wine
A stick man flashing a finelined smile
Anybody who comes
I'm the orange clouds raining in my hand
I hope all the years will hold tight our promises
What kind of way is that to treat your wife
I don't mind catching up
Heart beating close to mine
But don't hate her when she gets up to leave
I dare not say as the wind must blow
Trading places with an angel now
Here comes a regular
still i keep waiting that you'll return to me, 
Yeah, but don't it make you feel rage
And It must have been an hour
'Cause light strikes a deal with each coming night
Our demise has been completed now
My head starts to sing
Someday I'm gonna run across your mind
You never let my heart go
A million miles ago, you seem
Oh the elements I do not fear
Don't despair, 
But fools they rush in 
Her eyes are underneath the ground
Maybe the whole thing's wrong
Where I laid and told you but you swear you loved me more
And my momma swore that she would never let herself forget
Did you see the closing window
And I can tell you 'bout today
Moody It's got me Mooday It's got me
And hang 'em on the line
But now I'm told that this is life
And plannings for the poor 
I've been waiting
For a bag of gold to you
Found your writing on my wall
I'm gonna stop wastin' my time
I'll keep reliving
About today
You look like a movie
Don't tell me everything is wonderful now, no
Hello from the other side
Are you at one, or do you lie
Don't you let it pass you by
But you've been cold to me so long
And I've always lived like this, keeping a comfortable distance
Happy hands and your elbow in the appropriate place
To cold wind
Oh and when your friends say,
Fresh lilaced moorland fields
Don't let go
I feel her heart move through her chest
As every fairy tale comes real
Hello helicopter, are you here to stay
Where's my love
The images stuck in your head
There's no more heart to bruise
Our bodies moved and hardened
Here we are still trading places
Of my secret life
But with your mind
Until today
A silence I can't ignore,
And still they lead me back
By the cracks of the skin I climbed to the top
So are you safe now we're through
And I'm taking all of your memories off the shelf
Hold me in your thoughts, take me to your dreams
And your son is smoking cannabis"
If the ground is black and yellow
This night's a tragedy, I keep thinking I saw her
You had me crawling for you, honey
Bury it by the river, easy
Night time resurrects fault lines
I had it once, I lost it though
Älä käsilläsi  Not with your hands
Why did you have to leave me
Maybe I've been going back too much lately
I don't love you and I never will
You're the feeling of hurting
Has been silenced now
I've tried hell
They never heard you play their loud songs, on the Bellerophon
Wouldn't take no phone calls at all
Won't you stay with me, please
And I don't ever wanna se you sad
Wish there was something I, could say or do
We're burning gasoline
And I'll accept your invitation to the blues
I searched for you there
Everybody hurts no, no, no, no, no
I guess I've had it with you and your career
But what my father did 
From beginning to middle to end
It all just seems to be how
Water and dust
I've been dying inside you see
There hangs a lonely photograph
Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner but I just been busy
There in the road, straight ahead
And nobody ever asks
And I didn't know, I didn't know it at the time
Come to me with the worst you've said and done
I'm nothing like what I'd like to be
And every forest sings a song
Do I know what you are feeling now
Let me hold on to you
Stars of lovingness in her hair
You're giving me a million reasons to let you go
You wash them clothes
Disconnecting from the missing link
So for once in my life
There's music on a station
And because of all their tears
And wave them like you just don't care
I hope all of my days will be lit by your face
To keep in touch You know you could
Let me fade into that pitchblack velvet night
While you're hiding in the trees
And I guess I ain't too good with money neither
The drunk kids, the catholics
In Polaroids you were dressed in women's clothes
My friends all approve, say "she's gonna be good for you"
Looking for some kind of clue
I guess I should go now
Turning inside out
Laugh like you did back when
Tears run down my face
I'd never let you down
To give them time to let them breathe
So come back to me my darling
It hurts to hold on
Neither dry rot or the burn pile
It's the one that you'll remember
Somehow I'll show you
Nobody cares at all
The minor fall and the major lift
A million days later
That stood for Deadly Nightshade
'Cause you've been waiting a long time
Just as sure as none at all
I don't know why you think you got a hold on me
So boredom captured another fool 
Never knowing who to cling to when the rain set in
I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me
To find the surface, when you're underground
Everybody that is, dear, everyone but you
I keep coming back here where everything slipped, ah
Every street light a reminder
In the skies over black Venice
Forget all the things that bring me joy
The tile is cold I can barely speak
That alright with you With you
I think I'm gettin' lost for a while
It's just been raining on my face
Baby, I don't care if you got her in your heart;
I will turn the rooftop inside out 
Maybe you're a sinner into your alternate life
Go a little bit suburban and go crazy
And I'm sorry I left, but it was for the best
When I won't have to leave alone
I won�t hold you to nothin
Love is like a dream, when it's just me and you
Strung out and thin, callin' some friend, tryin'a cash some check
They come in all quiet
It's four in the morning, the end of December
The jaded underworld was riding high
And sit here cold
She says she has no time
A long life wind
We've got a war to fight
Your life's colors 
I'm sick of this life 
We'd forgotten one another
The less you need to heal
And we'll never have to go back again
Then it was Jed then it was Jed
And I'll take the truth at any cost
Louis ran forward from the line
Ripped apart by the crows not the vultures
'Cause she's too scared, and she, she can't pretend
And I don't need your reasons
There's something inside me that just won't allow me to
One lie short of true
You already love will end
It's all just a dream, man, it's all just a dream
Won't let this build up inside of me
And I think I'll want to be alone,
I can't keep track of each fallen robin
What you need to hear
And it's just my luck to end up getting stuck 
walk away
Nothing to fear inside
Facing, confronting, branding each other
But I hate the way
Look in my eyes
When the lives we lived are only goldenplated 
Don't fight when I finally find
But I know I'm on a losing streak
One more night gone, only twenty more days
Or when the crazies say 'He hates us'
A little loss of innocence
I've been here, silent all these years
But it isn't what you're thinking
'Cause I believe in me, yeah 
Left a message, but it ain't a bit of use
He longed to tell him all the reasons for the things he'd done
She saw poverty breaking up her home
'Cause I can feel it crawl beneath my skin
It's not a silly little moment
When you took it all from the weak hands of the poor
I can sing this song so blue
To take a little nap while the road is straight
I think I'll save suicide for another day
You're like a dream come true
Written around the dried out flowers
So please remember me, finally
For angels to fly
Everything turned out so wrong
Remember what she does when you're asleep
He said, "Ask anything"
But one day goodbye will be farewell
Can you stop the pain
I know who's to blame, but I swore I wouldn't say
I can't imagine all the people that you know 
Tomorrow's turned up dead
Don't go and lose your face
Respectful to his mother
Wait till the day you finally see
I tell you I love you
When I rang you at home, they said you'd left, yesterday
And we've got to find other ways to make it alone or keep a straight face
And I feel the way that every child should
No longer easy on the eyes
The rest of my life's been just a show
so filled with nothing, 
And when the winter comes, keep the fires lit
All I need's my railroad boots
I break in two
In his arms she fell as her hair came down
Now go up there and show 'em that you love 'em more than us"
The rich relationed hometown queen
As I turn out the light
Looking in the sky I could see your face
And though there are times when I hate you
If the door wasn't closed
This is the place where time reverses
I still, I still love you 
So I thought hell if it's over
With me still
You might say you don't miss me, you don't need me
Who controls the keys
Well, it's just like being alone
Every time the sun comes up I'm in trouble
The cake has grown mold but the memories are sweet
Can you let me know
And half buried bow
You made me sleep and uneven, and I didn't believe them
I'm not half the man I used to be
Looking out the door
But there is one thing you must understand
Your eyes focus on my funny lip shape
I need a phone call,
I started losing sleep and gaining weight
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts
If there's no one beside you
I'd go back to December, turn around and make it all right
But when you hold me like you do
Don't you know she's got a I know I know
Sounded like footsteps on my stairs
The absence of God will bring you comfort, baby
I need a miracle someone to help me help myself
I know they say you can't go home again
A working class hero is something to be
It's me, your lover
And turn it into something
And every road you take
Crawling underneath my skin
Mother remember the night that the dog had her pups in the pantry
Find it in your heart
Bows and flows of angel hair
Just to prove that he was sorry
My fears unveiled for my fair female
Clumsy, crawling out of my skin
Turn back the hands of time
Splashing 'round until it's dark
'Cause I never seem to stay asleep enough
Oohooh oohoohoohooh
Ship without a rudder's like a ship without a rudder's like a
The hurt of wanting
And glows in the dark
Well, we've all made out predictions but the truth still isn't out
You had plans for both of us that involved a trip out of town
Someone else you know always is
Doing my hair with an hour to spare
I wanna run with the wild horses
Most of you was naked
Und alles war erlaubt
As he goes left and you stay right
Drenched in my pain again, becoming who we are
I wish the way that I dressed was your favourite kind of style
As my memory rests, but never forgets what I lost
Here we are,
Her mother hides the pearls 
Though I try to fight
All the silly frilly things have to first get done
Baby, don't go away, come here"
But out there in the future
I'm breaking
And you're really all alone
It was not what I expected it to be
I buy what I'm told
I just want to love you just because I do
He left us now for dead
But among your books, among your clothes
I had to have this talk with you
Know there's a reason
And you loved sunset strip when it sparkled
But that's one thing
A face is smiling in the light
Building up inside of me
And then I'll sing it to you
He grabs me by the shoulder and he tells me
And without a sound, without a sound
Cause honey friend fuck
You'd mean so much more if I remembered
To the furthest place you'll ever be
I'd take another chance, take a fall
You raised your hand for the assignment
It's the one that I've tried to write over and over again
Lipstick still on my mirror
The best thing I can think to do right now is leave it alone
Trying to take something you'll never be good enough
Find the few living things rotting fast
Swearin' up and down you can fix what's been broken yeah
Sheep are counting me
Now he drinks with the lepers 
Your heart is unobtainable
To understand where it begins or ends or what it means to be dead
Can you feel its second hand wrapped around your neck 
I was watching a movie with a friend
So overwhelmed by the ocean's shapeless form
When I hear your voice, it's drowning in the whispers
Yeah, that's what you think, and you hope she'll sing
It's ladies night, all the girls drink for free
I sent two letters back in autumn, you must not'a got 'em
And I'd roll my eyes and then you'd pull me in
Everybody else ends up these days
Still waiting for the swollen Easter tide
No longer shall you need
I'm begging you please, please don't leave here
So many times I've played around
Beneath the stars 
Sing me anything,
She had his box of letters in the passenger seat
To love again
I stayed the same
I loved you like you loved me oh
Pictures of the life she's longing
She cries to the heaven above
Look in her eyes
Broke your glasses but it broke the ice
Last time I wasn't sure
Your candle burned out long before your legend ever did
And I'd fix all that I've done
When the doorknob turned we took off for the stairway
As he begins to raise his voice
My hand won't hold you down no more
And all I need is
'Cause I'll still be standing here
She was my woman, I love her so
Before you walk out of my life
Even if I died alone
You changed my life and all my goals
Caravans lost
That's dead and gone
It's a small crime and I've got no excuse
But after a while I wonder
I've got no one left to mourn for me
With you tonight
Walk on shells tonight
She could see the world and its foolish ways
Trouble, oh, trouble can't you see
You know it breaks my heart in half, in half
I don't have to pay for this shit
It lasted twenty years, seven months and twentyseven days
The sweet delays love again
Do you see how much I need you right now
I'd like to bring a little light
I seem to remember a home that was better
Daddy's always on the move, mama's always on the news
Do you have a tendency to lead some people on
Don't keep me around
Do you try
She seemed dressed in all of me
I had gone when you couldn't see me anymore
Oh Father I have sinned
And there's a sky that's changing and a bird that sings
I could be another fool or an exception to the rule You tell me the morning after
I put my head on the table I was so distraught with you,
Wild horses couldn't drag me away
You were famous, your heart was a legend
One more night, that's all they can spend
I watched you suffer a dull, aching pain
How do you love on a night without feelings
The hurt of emptiness
I hear that you're building your little house deep in the desert
I wanna fill the room, when she's in it with you
Waking the neighbors, unfamiliar faces
And it was memorable
I'd feel rather depressed and out of place
I like drifting through the air
Everyone I'll never meet
If I was asked I'd tell
I'd really love to tell you 
But these feelings won't go away
Can I lay by your side, next to you, you
They will come, they will go, make us special
Like a mother's mourning dress
I don't wanna take away his life
And when you left you kissed my lips
Both tender fire and bitter squall
When you've become inconvenient
The cut so
I smoke the whole thing to my head
Whenever I was in need of a friend
"It's so cold, it's like the cold if you were dead"
That miserable rotten slut couldn't turn anyone away
And I will love you all the time
When I broke my bone, he carried me up from the riverside
She's losing her mind, she's fallen behind
And the night, it never ends
And it's been a long December and there's reason to believe
And shot me 'cause I died
This song will be here
And I listen I'm heading out tonight
When you can't really function, you're so full of fear
But I always thought that I'd see you, baby, one more time again, now
Please don't fall apart
When you see my face, I hope that you don't laugh
Hurt myself again today
This time was different
Help me 'cause I'm feeling shaky
Bound by the surprise of our glory days
And now I miss everything about you
I'm waiting, you know that I am
Turn my head, turn my head
Do you carry the moon in your womb
Well, I'd never want to see you unhappy
Is keeping perfectly still
'Cause you'd been abused by that bone that refused you
People say I'm a onehit wonder
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
And if we break before the dawn
And I see me, break me gently
Come sunrise, surprise surprise
I love it when you give me things
You left me adrift
Your head laying on my chest
All the deer despair
And take me to my home
The world feels like it's caved in, proper sorry frown
And before we knew it was too late
'Cause I'd give everything I have
Underneath a winters' sky,
Oh, oh, ooh
And it did 
Lived to see a lovers
Fridays at 
It's the same old SOS
And heard me laughing louder 
Gives of herself and the magnet head
Cold was the night, and hard was the ground
The things that you needed to have
Got the skin and the bones
We were born and raised in a summer haze
Three cheers for my parents,
And I'm so sorry now
I'd kill myself to make everybody pay
Who'll take care of me
Fall asleep with stranger's wives
The edge of the world 
And I have torn my soul apart from pulling artlessly with fool commands
I should've done you better, 'cause you don't want a liar
It's a wonderful place
Love me, wherever you are
It's only gonna end in tears, baby yeah
You are fading further from me
There's only fears
Love ridden, I've looked at you
A beach resort under a year of rain,
Baby you gotta believe in the things that make you & me win together
And you still can't let go
I wanna be bigger, stronger, drive a faster car
Worms eat my skin
Over little things the way I do
And with her my heart, it disappeared
I see the lights
Reckless, unfrightened and old
Once insecure about your scar but I think you got over it So right
But more than this I wish you could've seen my face
I tried to server ties and I, ended up with wounds to bind
But I swear you didn't care
My love is wasted, sorry for this I never meant to be
Don't wanna try don't wanna try don't wanna try no more ooh
In the fairest of the seasons
With the credit report for duty call
How does it make you feel
Help me to carry the fire
Long before I knew
And now you want me one more time
All he wanted was a toy;
And I feel your fist
I'm waiting for blood to flow to my fingers
But that's one thing I never mean to do
When I looked round you were gone
No, 'cause I can dish it out Never again
Another century spent pointing guns
I want to, I need to be
I feel unsteady
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
The broken seams along the way
I've never been the kind to ever let my feelings show
Leave me bleeding on the bed
Still smell the rain, distance aside
Looking very somber looking for his mom
I'm saying sorry for the sake of us
Lighting the darkness of my soul
A black wind took you away
First tell me which roads you will take
But I'm disappointed in you
All we can do is keep breathing
Here in your aeroplane
I just haven't found it yet and I need it
And then he's drunk and never even told her that her cared
So many voices inside of her head
Will you never let it show never let it show
I know that we could work it out somehow
And I walk home alone
Midnight moon shines through it all
I'm not the gold watch, and the new truck
It's hard to understand
I've got my heart 
And you'll realize that you love me
A place that we can share
The winter wind
Before you walk out of Monica's life, baby
Now I'm pacing down the hall, chasing down your street
You will never dream
If only I could be in that bed again
A long farewell of the hunger strike
Sang our newborn love to sleep
But I look at this way 
O, I need
We tore down that hatin' factory
But since you've been gone I've been lost inside
Our minds are empty, grave as well as
If you think that I could be forgiven
The panic stopped 
He's determined to call her bluff
Brushing my tears away
I want to believe in more than you and me
And as you flashed your backstage pass
I'm too shy, I should have kissed you 
Sweet, sweet smile, and it's fading fast
And still he's more than I can take
When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears
All my troubles seemed so far away
No, I don't need them 
Lately I've been feeling like a falling bomb
And that morning at the racetrack was one thing I remembered
And I find peace when I'm confused
Almost makes me crazy
Then I had better end it quick or I could lose my nerve
Future in my eyes, bright
In my Busby Berkeley dreams
Sounding hopeful but it's making me cry
They moved forward, and my heart died
Essence left my heart tonight
Will follow you around
Where is the road I follow
You left me on the shelf
They crawled out of the woodwork
Love one's daughter
At night I could hear the blood in my veins
And breathes it out, he says,
It was so like you to visit me to
Somehow I'd feel intact and reassured
All I want is the comfort and care
Mama, put my guns in the ground
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts no, no, no
There's people making lonely sometime
This place would be busier than O'Hare
Since the end of World War II
You haven't seen her for a while
My stray dog freedom
We are walking on a thin line
Your folks have bet you gone
One for you and one for me and
So unkiss me, unkiss me, yeah
You took advantage of a world that loved you well
And will you wake up by my side
And still the hardest part for you
Late at nightlike a bird calling out,
Amphetamine AnnieDog
You will be numb and blue
La lullaby, distract me with your eyes
I always used to leave before I went to sleep
If you just hold in your breath,
I can see it in your eyes
Don't cut me down just yet, I'll make things right again
In the press of every kiss
Sometimes you've just got to make it for yourself
How did I end up this way
Shove it down anything to make it fit 
I pray to God that it won't be long
You cannot run can't escape from the things that you said
A well slept opposite sex
And I'm sorry that I couldn't get to you
Falling slowly sing your melody
I could stay here all day but that's not how you feel
That we end this here
Your chance to even up the score
When the flood calls
I've searched the holy books
Till I'm blue in the face with a choking regret
Put it on your son
No time to think, my turn to go
The clubs are all closed down
You keep your distance, I can't deny you
And the world's got me dizzy again
And everywhere I turn
The skies are dark, they're dark but they're clear 
Look at what I love today
You've got to calm down
That's not the shape
There's a picture on my kitchen wall
We couldn't win in the end 
I check my palms, the cracks in the sidewalk
Turns whole to half
Here we are Here we are
I'm outside your house
You're still a lawyer
And drove the car into the garden
You dance all wack
The moon, the stars, are nothing without you
I don't like to wait too long
All I need is a little love in my life
On the strength of your faith
I've been waiting for something,
Making something out of nothin'
And though he was ashamed that he had took a life
Thank your lucky stars
I just dance on the harpsichord string
From the way you talk
And use his credit card again 
One final step
Can't forgive, sorry to say
But we don't have much room 
And as I climb into an empty bed
But spare some for spare parts
For loneliness like this
I fall asleep to the sound
We're losing ground
Pretty Mary K is off in somebody's room
Do you believe you're missing out
Some liar I loved to control"
Perfect lies from a perfect dame
Wishes with a blue songbird on his shoulder
The worst things in life come free to us
I was deceived by the wrapping
I may not have the softest touch
And caring what it brings this way
Reading the stares at your passion that bears me now
Stiffen that upper lip up little lady, I told ya
Felt like nothing good could come
This town's so strange, they built it to change
Like those guys with guitars
Our sky fell down tonight
But what I do know, is to us the world is different
She got enough on her mind
So for tonight I'll stay here with you
Nothing
I love you more than I can say
I may be late
Something inside of me dies
Wine left to rot an' a voice that can't sing 
I'm in love with the world through the eyes of a girl who's still around the morning after
But you want to be with someone else
I am a bird girl
Must be a different view
Everything I do, I'm gonna think of you
I am flying on a star, star, star
My mouth has sprung wide open
And I knew you
Than the friends you try to keep
One more, one more night, that was a good one
Still tryin'a find my home sweet home, oh I, oh I, oh I
Alright, now help me out boys
You will never stay
And what you make the truth
Shake what your mama gave you
There's no living in my life anymore
And it was always horribly convenient and happening too fast
And don't get me wrong, dear
It's not that hard to hide you
And when the stars fall
I've always known it's true
Take what's left of me
Unless your looking to check out Shot, shot, shot
Hide and Seek Mm, mm, you don't care a bit 
For years gone by and I cried
As you opened up,  miles wide
Build a nest for us to sleep in here, you know it's real
Don't leave another piece that this puzzle needs
Yes all that we were, all that we knew
Others said it must have been the weather
I got baby to pound me
I'll tell you why I don't want to know where you are
You're a nobody, girl
So there's nothing of yours to hold or to talk to
I'll be under ground one day 
The boy I'm dreaming of
Future's above, but in the past, he's slow and sinking
Sweep your boat out to sea
I'll make everyone pay
Sweet Jesus I need you
Yes I guess we need the drama
And I wish that you could be the one I die with
Don't lose your selfish ways over me
Only love is all maroon
No wind or waterfall could stall me
So take me to the airport 
I don't understand that sound no more
We'll just keep laughing
Love it, oh sometimes at least I fall
Like the other girls, Jenny Wren took wing
But you don't care
I'm really quite a mess, yes
Smother me under the eyes
In the end I will find some peace inside
 minutes, to whisper your name
Seen through 'em all, seen through most everything
That job's not mine
I'm coming back around again
Yeah we'll share our fears 
And I fell so fast in seth ott's bedroom
The city and leaves you homeless again
Old men kneel to accept their fate
But I don't believe, I don't believe
As soon as you're born, they make you feel small
And the bird girls go to heaven 
In the wee small hours of the morning
Shifting the dream
And isn't it great to find that you're really worth nothing
With not much making sense
I thought I was someone else
And sit out in the fountain
The strength inside me burning
I went out back and I got my gun
The lights on the riverbank, they just much reach
I take a step outside
Thinking so hard on her soft eyes and the memory
You don't need to compromise
Ever again like we used to be when we was teenagers
You were easy you are forgotten
'Cause, honey, it's over
Yes I crawl back into your open arms
'Cause she's folk, so play it, maybe she'll come
And I never come back to this town again
Haligh, Haligh, a lie, Haligh,
Hit 'em off with that dark brown,
And I don't have to stay this way
He takes your hand
Until you've flipped you're heart and you have lost
In the morning, I got in a fight with myself
Others say she's shy
Some days I wanna quit, and just be normal for a bit"
She's gone to heaven, so I've got to be good
I should be crying but I just can't let it show
Finding a way to let go
And if we find gold
Left me standing all alone
So far To pull me up, take the pain
No one laughs at God on the day they realize
Oh you take yourself a photograph and laugh at me
But as the scenery grows I see in different lights
The boys you left are men you didn't raise
You told me how ya man playin' games
Beyond love
Stripped and polished, I am new, I am fresh,
Than the power of goodbye
But how long will you stay with me, baby
I want you here tonight, I want you here
Stolen from our very eyes
And the ice kept getting thinner 
In your own home
Johnny's daddy, was takin' him fishin', when he was eight years old
The rain pushes
And then one day I lost the job
So if someone could see me now
Put signs on the handles 
Pushed my head beneath the waves
Oh well, it seems like such fun
For laughing at your jokes
Laney uncle's crazy, ain't he Yeah but he loves you girl and you better know it
And you can throw me off a train
So don't stay mad, just let some time pass
I won't be sad
Where the fun, it got no end
If one day you just up and leave
And sometimes I have to say, yeah
The glow was strong when I was a boy
Baby I got a plan, run away fast as you can
All my friends now try to save me
Bringin' new tears 
You already know the story, the chords are just the same
I can drive on that road forever
Salt my wounds but I can't heal the way I feel about you
And who would he become, all the things he'd have done
When it's all said and done
Oh, I wish that I could be Richard Cory
When will I come around
There's this boredom that drowns everything
Oh, stay with me, Arienette
And everything you stand for turns on you to spite you
After a hard day of nothin' much at all
And we're wrapped in light, in life, in love
Cold skin and bones and this latitude we ain't payin' until the heat comes through
'Cause they make you stay real still in a real small space
And you are wonderful
Dream about the days to come
Freedom comes when you learn to let go
No matter how hard I try
I need somebody and always
Tomorrow it may change
But I am asking please
And down with it went our pain and fear
Of you knocking on my door
Reach for a hand to hold
Just dragonflies
Inside
It's been a long cold winter since that day
And I know you're shining down on me from heaven
I'll never have to lose my baby in the crowd
The perfect taste that leaves your mouth
With someone else on top
The memories shaken apart
Spinning me around once more
But I need a last breath
I can't survive on a halfhearted love that will never be whole
No one's laughing at God
I walk, the record stands somehow
But she will always be a broken girl
I thought this place was heaven sent
One may think
Can you believe she repeated that
Take my hand and we can outrun time
Always end up in confusion
And who's to say that it's not right
These things are wrong
We'll float in space, just you and I
Where is my love
If you're on your own in this life
I can't stop my suffering
I never tried to stop you
Please kiss me
It's gonna be alright save you
On the hood of the car
I heard my mother thinking me right back into my birth
That's proper rank, that tastes like hairspray
You won't need a real job
Daddy ride us on your back again
And you just see right through me
We were running for the money and the flesh
Talk to the sky
I've reached the end of the road
Well I'm gone
It was a slippery slippery slippery slope
Every dream inside my soul
Stones taught me to fly
He may lay the queen of spades 
I can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh
And I really believed
But the heartless wind kept blowing, blowing
The rain falls
Only air, that old breath
Those conventions are taking their toll on you
Anything you ever want me to be
All about our lives
It hurts to hide
And caught a long wind
Wait for the year to drown
And those days, too
And all the promise we adored
As we are to the world but I guess you would know that
When every man is torn apart with nightmares and with dreams
I'll do my best now, but you've been gone for so long
And there were barricades to keep us off the street
The permanent installment of the daily dose
"I dreamed you were carried away on the crest of a wave
Who will you love What's love when you've hurt
You've got some kind of family there to turn to
But she knew all the words that I never had said
For I do believe
And scratching her wrists in the pouring rain
That's all and for us, that's as good as it got
Just a little bit is all I'm asking for
Mister fisherman, to a less peculiar ground
The time always comes to slip away
No one laughs at God in a war
That God sent this angel to watch over me
Like a kid alive and talkin', that was you
I wanted all the things that I haven't got
I hope your conscience eats at you and you can't breathe without me
And the day has come where I have died
But tonight, I'm gonna love you like there's no tomorrow
They'll do their best to change you
But you keep sailing right on through
Yeah, I know I'll see your face again, woah
Deeper than the sea
'Cause they'll be losing bodies tonight
And the clouds all form a geometric shape,
How long must I wait
Are words that you whisper in my mind
And every night our lonely planet
Don't let this end
For every job, so many men
How unfair, it's just our love
'Cause this hurts deeper than I thought it did
Yeah, she is beautiful, but she don't mean a thing to me
Storm in the morning light
That I thought that I should
They was hanging in
She sits in a corner by the door
I thought we'd be simple together
There'll be no last chance to promise to never mess it up again
No you can't, you can't come in
See the lights all shining bright on Broadway
Leaving him empty just because he's a man
I've no idea what's right sometimes
For we're like creatures of the wind
Save the life that here awaits
Ever more as you get older
Words come into meaning
Hanging on the words you say
Oh don't take it all to heart
And I'll be gone
And how can it matter Ohohohoh
You'll never live this life that I live 
In my sweetest dream
The good times that made us laugh
All across electric wire, it's a baited line
In this river 
When the joys of living just leave you cold
I touch the place
Changed in an easy chair
And I know, 'cause I've heard talk
But no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep
Your eyes forever glued to mine 
It's all a falling through
The man that you think you see
I was born in '
I never should of waited so long to say
I used to look myself in the mirror at the end of every day
Yet I am just a man still learning how to fall
I'll never let go
I'm inside your mouth now
And fuck you, fuck you, love you
I need a little loving tonight
Let it die, and get out of my mind;
That hurt too bad to where we both begin to cry
Towards the mouth and the reunion of the Known and the Unknown
Don't wanna try don't wanna try 'cause all we do is fight and say the things
To tell them that they've got you all wrong
Like letting it go
This weight it must be satisfied,
Why am I such poison, girl
And I want you in my life
Borrow water off this man, here goes nothing OK
And there have been some that I have broken
I went out driving, trying to clear my head
It gets so depressing
You wanted good schools and friends with pools
To never go home
Have you ever heard of anything so absurd ever in your life 
Standing on my own two feet
Man that kid made fucking up look cool
There's no control, are you with me now
Will love Aladdin Sane
And dreams of a world where the two of 'em are together,
Around you still
The California sun cascading down my face
It's love's illusions I recall
I'm gonna find someone someday, who might actually treat me well
I'll take this soul 
Sleep alone tonight
She's still too young
Come back home, you know the place where you used to live
My shits all over the place
It's washed away
I can walk but I will crawl there
See you on the other side
Never a clean break, no one here to save me, oh
You're not that weak
I got the TV on, the sound turned down and a bottle of wine
If you'd only sing along
Tell me a story
We can never go home, son
And I am helpless sometimes, wishing's just no good
A constant reminder of where I can find her
Then turn right around in that song and tell her you love her
You don't have to love me for me
Never knew quite what I had
And all my life I never felt the tremor 
And the silence won't cease 
You come to me with excuses
You've been my soulmate and then some
All the shots and all that come
In twenty years from now
Just the same way you showed me you showed
See, I'm a wreck inside
A flower in the twilight
Now I long for yesterday
And he come home and he'd say to me
To come around and cover everything
Barely surviving has become my purpose
Oh is the main thing calling me back
Eyes like a car crash
So, it's sad this doesn't suit you now
The things I needed to
Can't get no rest, keep walkin' around
There is no one, compares with you
When she says her love is dead
You offer only one reply
But it's not right
You're everywhere inside of me
This won't break your heart, but I just think it could
How did he not find the baggy, with his hand in my shoe
That's pretty shitty man, you're like his fuckin' idol
So damn confusing to me
Wonderin why their bodies go to silly places
I am not your friend, I'm not your lover
Lately I've been dreaming with you
Mayfair mistress of the satellites
I know I'd do it all different if I had the chance,
Just sinking in this box
I'm gonna die of loneliness, I know
Bringing it back all so clear
I'm tangled up inside
Dance me very tenderly and dance me very long
In the shape of a heart that they cut out of stone
'Cause we'll hold each other soon
I just don't care anymore
Well, it's a sly curse
And I don't dream since I quit sleeping
To see if I still feel
But all his troubles on his mind
On my heart, I'll bear the shame
And hear your voice of treason
You will look for me you will look for me
But I am older now
It was February  Valentines Day
You're not just a memory
It was you, you're the fool
You got some kind of nerve
You make me feel like I am free again
My tongue is tied and my
So if the chain is on your door, I understand
From my own true love lost at sea, lost at sea
'Cause dumb is back
I'll take one chance without compromise
When it's burning inside
Lazy sun, your eyes catch the light
I wanna start everything over again
All the words we said
I've been thinking, thinking about you, about us
But no one wants you when you lose
And I say thank you Mom
To make a better life
Until I can see nothing at all;
Of history
Down in the valley where the church bells cry,
And no one really knows what they are searching for
They beat the pain
So this world
There's nothing in between
Blowing out wishes, blowing out dreams
Won't you help a brother out
I'm so glad you remembered
She pulls away, my arms are tightly clamped round her waist
Where I feel your fingers have been 
Peace will not come to this lonely heart
But I can't take it so I run away and hide
Am I making something worthwhile out of this place
With dirty hands and trousers torn
I know there's someone
I thought if I could touch this place or feel it
'Cause I'm still breathing
At the shallow end 
My feelings swell and stretch; I see from greater heights
My home on the old Milk Lake
I need your help
What's the point in ever trying
Jim brought me back
Sat in my kitchen, buttering himself a bread and the cat was on his knee and smiled at me
You know, every minute someone dies 
It's like I'm looking from a distance, standing in the background
And when it's dark we'll be light
And airports see it all the time
Is a memory as useless 
Someone's waiting in the tall grass
I'm down here by the bay, my arm around the moon
I try to remain
Dream new music to calm down
Same old game
As wars rage before me
And I miss your face so
I shook the hand of time and I knew
Were full of hate, I was so angry
On the radio beat
I can't replace
Well everybody's tired of being alone
I could bring you the light
etched in cold
My heart is on my sleeve
Baby, how can you stop that ol' sun from shining
Who could never love anyone
From home again
There's got to be something that would be worthwhile for me to give to you
And how we fell apart
Well, maybe we got lost in translation
'Cause they wanted to hear that sound
Sometimes its hard
I am still right here
Next door
And I won't answer if you call
Please let me take you out of the darkness and into the light
And when the crowd becomes your burden
Just hand me down, give me a place to be
I need to tell you
Seemed to be a lie
Looking out the door I see the rain fall upon the funeral mourners
And my eyes hurt, hands shiver, so look at me and listen to me because,
If you lose faith in you, I'll give you strength to pull through
Stepford wives, who are we to complain
How it left her aware she was naked
They hold high their prized possession
So I left it beside the road
Is that why they call me a sullen girl  sullen girl
Of how I predicted my world
How could I ever have lost you
To be alone
Out of doors, and into stores with bigger names
If I tell you you're mine
I see the moon
Butterfly, early summer
In each dead bed and empty home
So open your eyes and see
And so we ask you, please
Far, far away, find comfort in pain
I broke through the trees, and there in the night
I bowed to save my head and
I will kiss you
I can tell somehow
Soul mate dry your eyes
Lonely is the room, the bed is made
Nothing unusual, nothing strange 
So come on, tell me, is this the end
One guy I know thinks he's hard to get along with
When it comes to this, oh
Our heads are firmly fixed in the ground
Just a few last hours, we gotta make this count
But I was just thinking and thinking, merely thinking
See now a star is born
Please stay
My God, this reminds me
It's so strong and now I let myself be sincere
Is the same kind of scars
That's all right,
For you don't love me
What if you could look right through the cracks
And I believe in crystal light 
Haven't had a dream in a long time
And it's sad, but true Out of cash and IOU's
No, you never were, and you never will be mine
Of appointments and promises made
It feels so right
And she's my friend of all friends
You send me to the path of nevermore
Hey, yeah, yeah
White and red, black and blue
At the top of my lungs I'm giving it back
And it's turning me round
That today is grey skies
But I cleaned up my place like you so I could see things straight
It's such a loss for the good guys afraid of this life
What have I got to do to make you love me
The very last thing before I go
Carry me to heaven's arms
A hundred times is fine
But you make me cry, where's my kiss goodbye I think I love you
Better call the ships, they been caught sailing
Ignore me in the parking lot
Now you say you're leaving California
I lived, I lived I loved
They say life carries on
We know to seek success is utter nonsense,
You had nine lives and one by one you chewed 'em up
Is to know me all wrong, they warn
At all the eyes on the ground
Align my heart, my body, my mind
Hide and Seek No, no, you don't care a bit 
Why carry on without me 
Not some demon, not your father
For the cute ones
In my platforms I hit the floor
For these thoughts here to leave me
And people come by and they look at your face
They don't shine quite as bright as back in Frisco
So one man has and another has not
In your bedroom
But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and mom
We were here all together yesterday
Oh, your sweet disposition and my wideeyed gaze
Oh, unbreak my, unbreak my heart, oh baby
But If you loved me
Don't worry 'bout a thing
There's a shadow running through my days
In this song and rhyme
I hear you're asking all around
Don't fool yourself
'Cause here comes a regular
I'm gonna make it right
I feel unready for my love
For you, whoever you are
I think about long distance rates instead of kissing you babe
Wave yesterday's action goodbye 
I never thought I would say this
And all I am, all I have doesn't even matter now
For no more shall we part
I'm not a bus ride, you can hop inside, and just roll away clean
Such a strange predicament we find ourselves in
And then the silver turns to gray
Still I waited for the day
I keep pretending not to care
I could go back,
You're up with the sunrise
Even though she wakes you with a kiss
And there in the square he lay alone
Like I follow my dreams
Water's getting harder to tread
And take the pieces and build them up to the sky
Und der Wald er steht so schwarz und leer
Oh I'm scared of the middle place
Gather my skeletons far inside
I'll be your engine driver in a bunny suit
"Great great minds
And I don't want to be here if I can't be with you tonight
I pray to god you won't come back here anymore
The first time in my life and now it's so great
We don't need to fight and cry
I'm just laughing
Stones and sled
You can't remember, you try to feel the beat
Up until I lost you,
Since the stars predicted something new would reconnect our worlds
Isn't anyone tryin' to find me
I feel like the shadows I don't even bother for anymore than that
Do you see the truth
I was in Guns and Noses, ah
And the siren song that is your madness
Without love
And I'm trying hard to work it out
I hear the clock, it's  am
And lives that were over before they were spent
I sit and watch as tears go by
I'm just the shadow of the man I used to be
Life, it taught me to die
Ada, don't talk about reasons why you don't want to talk
What I want from this, is learn to let go
It's always you 
This is all I need
Hey girl, look at my mom, she's got it going on
The laughter penetrates my silence
She said, "Some days I feel like shit"
Not much hair left on his head
Think twice before you touch my girl
I've been so lost since you've gone
That I will understand someday
And this wall breaks on the phone it at all, if you call
Don't mind if you can take it
And it said, I'll wait for you at Heaven's gate
If I lay my head down
Bring that minute back
Sell me a house that stands, oh
The moon is a sickle cell
Never tell the one you want
Your house beneath the hill and up until
Black heart, sweeping over the land
I want to feel through you tonight
Twentyone was not a good number
But you need something to fill up the days
Memories are fresh
And now there's no way back
But now Ebonics rule our song
I know it sounds like someone else's song
I can't take my eyes off you
I tell myself too many times
So here's one to the pigeons
They fell through my hands, on me
And she was listening to the sound of heavens shaking
For my wings some time 
You'll say you understand but you don't understand
I lie alone, the clock strikes three
That everyone is staring at you
I wear this crown of thorns upon my liars chair
With heaven's help
Stains on the carpet and stains on the scenery
Old friend, why are you so shy
And I'm balancing history books up on my head
'Cause I know the dreams that you keep
Some days I feel broke inside but I won't admit
Cinders of gold
Trying to get the other kind of control
No quarter phone booth calls to home
Grow further from me with every, falling tear
Demons despise the sound of shaking paper
And when she came back
Together we always pull through
And watched you reading with the lord
I'm working on erasing you
By blood and by me, you walk like a thief
I never really dreamed of heaven much
That I've been wasting all my time
Shortly after your first heart attack
We'd set the fire to the third bar
I've got a long list of calls I must make
The same old tears
Lord, stay by me
'Cause I know I don't belong here in heaven
Bdbbyebdbdyebdbyebdye
To love you until your eyes run dry
I've got to tell you so
Are we ever going to get it right
Hold on tight, hold on tight
Cull memory for assimilation
I felt something that I had never touched
Yeah I'm weeping warm honey and milk
They will know how I love them 
You'll lose your hair, your teeth 
I know I can't feel what you feel
And I didn't mind; it's not my kind
Soft winds blow round his head and his phone rings just once
I wanna drink until I ache
I met a girl, a snowball in hell
My regrets, I'll face in the end
Lemme be your downfall
No money, no babysitters, she couldn't keep a job
They say I suffer from a lack of serotonin
Show me something ugly and show me something pretty
So what do you say, your coffin, or mine
Let me rise against that blood red velvet sky
As a man I've never been much for talking to
I'm gonna hold on to the times we had tonight
Tender you go
There's a possibility it wouldn't show
You've always been there, you're alaways been
Holding you again could only do me good
The love I sell you in the evening, by the morning won't exist
But now old friends are acting strange
So hard and to the point
Cheapens the taste
I pray to be only Yours
Most of what I remember makes me sure
All of a sudden it's cold and we're falling apart
Everyone thinks that we're perfect
Davy says that I look taller
No my heart is gold My feet are light
I live in a southern town
Look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky 'cause
Total control
And those of us with ravaged faces
You remain selfless, cold and composed
I'm going to wear a smile and walk in the sun
Hear the rain fall
And my burden to bear is a love I can't carry anymore
Loud, loutish lover, treat her kindly
Though it all looks different now, I know it's still the same
With the sleight of his hand
Make you feel the same
Oh, waves of time
To stare at my starving brain
So leave me in the cold
Somethings will never wash away
I miss it all from the love to the lightning
This morning's paper's ink stains my fingers
It's time we left town
This constant yearning 
aun sigo buscando en las caras de ancianos
How cruel is the golden rule 
I made it die
Standing in the rain outside until I came out
X I'd pray for her even more than me
So if you lost a sister, someone's lost a mom
As we sink deeper into the drink
Now it's years since your body went flat, and even memories of that
The feeling of feeling
, people, all jumping out their seat
With your hand in my hand, still feel the love
You took your coat off and stood in the rain
All full of romance for someone that you met
Remember when you lost your shit
Was losing them to drinking and to driving
Run, run away
Don't look away
But I will try
I always needed time on my own
It felt great falling, great falling
So let's rip out the pages of yesterday
Sometimes I forgive
Come home"
It's been seven hours and fifteen days
Perhaps I tried too hard
O and all you folks, you come to see
So your heart is warm for ever more
Time can come and take away the pain
In the fake plastic earth
Of the nights we share
Now do I have to fall asleep with roses in my hand
With just your song to say goodbye
Unbreak my heart
His life was stole Stole
Rain fall and voice sound
I feel so lonely, there's no one here
And knows what all my imperfections are
Borrowed house for a borrowed crime
Weep not for roads untraveled
We go where the wild blood flows
For somebody else to understand
This one's called 'Stella was a diver and she is always down'
It's broken and bleeding
I guess I'm feeling just a little tired of this
And from the sidelines, I see you run
Turn my head
It's greener pastures I'm thinking about
When I dream I dream of your fists
You're everywhere inside my room
We are here for you
And back to my neck
These tired eyes just want to remain closed
If ever these questions were yours, what would you say
It's a mixed up man and I guess that's me
My heart feels so still
And you're probably hanging out and making eyes
Tellin' you things, but not tellin' straight
Try to be speechless for a minute
It didn't get there by itself ooh
Oh, but anywhere, anywhere I'm gonna lay my head
And never lets it show
The ground is getting closer and the sky is falling down
Why did it have to end
Fierce and light and young
But I knew her too well
Just three miles from the rest stop
'Cause I'm your jazz singer
And everyone else, all of the others
'Cept the planet that we own and its playing nd fiddle
It's kinda nice to work the floor since the divorce
Is to be home
I'll be staying down where no one else gonna give me grief
Where no thing of consequence can grow
I don't want to play the brokenhearted girl, no no
Big family dinner,
You won't be coming back
But you you still tell me how you didn't know what to do even now,
But, you see, my hands were tied
There is a faceplate all brown and red that stretches across my mouth
Press my face up to the window
If you don't listen to me while I talk to the wall
I guess I'm just burnt out
Walk it off, dear
But blessed with beauty and rage
And even when you lock the doors
I got to know the sky
Got to live with the choices I've made,
Yes, and Jane came by with a lock of your hair
She is ten times heavier
In one ear and out the other 
And I feel so low tonight
I can't change what happened
My mouth was a crib and it was growing lies
I should have wrote a letter
I need you in the world
I've spent ten years singing gravity away
At the end of the dark passageway
Couldn't see that I, I was so blind
I'm giving up the ghost of love
Don't it just make you want to cry
Leave it open for someone else to
I haven't hung out with anyone, if I did I'd have nothing to say
I remember everything
But she sings of greed, like a young banshee, and she wants for this, and she wants for that
I can make you satisfied in everything you do
Till I find my Jackie ooh,
Uns Vertrauen gelieh'n
You choose your side, I'll choose my side
Where are you now
And I remember when you started callin' me your Mrs
Still I'll try, try again, try again
All that's left is
She won't go underground
You just might wave hello again
And she wonders where these dreams go
I'm tired of dating, let's elope
And I listen I am on your side
I feel the hurt so physical
I'd hear how my mother cried for him
Well and I can and I die
I am a mirror, with no reflection
Your every wish will be done
I just wade the tides that turned 
Leave me dreaming on the bed
It seems artificial, like a TV set
So they went, years and years
Must I dream and always see your face
But all your friends are there
Your tiny hands
I'm down here by the bay where the water pounds
 cela il n'est rien a faire
I wonder how you sleep
Wish I had my radio
I still adore you, you never need me
Lift me like an olive branch and be my homeward dove
You combed your hair inside that mirror,
Well, maybe it's me and my blind optimism to blame
There was a girl with light brown streaks
Undone for the last time
Suspended animation glue
If you can tell me something worth fighting for
Then I'll leave your town and I'll never look back,
See the safety of the life you have built
Haligh, Haligh, an awful lie,
That you fashioned out of sand 
Your name is tattooed on every boy's skin
On the first train to Mexico
If she knows you're paper
Forgetting to give back
I think I need a sunrise
City bird, haven't you heard
Looks like no one will ever
And lies
We'll carry on, my only friends
Silence you lost me, no chance for one more day
I was like a gun
Run to the lobby where I saw you try
I'll sing it on the street drunk to a cop
Oh and you see everything in red
Nightmares become me, it's so fucking clear
I know a ghost can walk through the wall
Do you wish it was me
She said I think I'll go to Boston
I miss the way we breathe
Hoping what you need is behind every door
Oh stay with me, Arienette
And many times I've cried
you don't have to say it 
I'd do anything for a smile, holding you till our time is done
I try and tell myself it'll all be alright
Somedays I hate everything
Tears are falling down endlessly, woah
Oh lover you should've come over
Their old friends and I've seen through 'em all
The world is falling around you
Find out for certain love's gonna be there for you
And land on top of the sea
When the swingset hit his head
I saw hatred in his eyes
Short love with a long divorce
Has no one told you she's not breathing
I was back in the old days long ago
I've got another  'nother  miles
And I know there'll be no more tears in heaven
Ain't it funny how you feel
You know they say it's better
Coming back over again
And all again I wait for this 
I'd be nice to you if I could make it through
It wasn't meant to be
How we spend our days, casting love aside
And down when the work's been done
And wash your swollen feet
If you just stay with me we could make it through
I have nothing left to hear
And all the time you were tellin' me lies
Afraid that I have made mistakes
And I'm on my way to believing
Don't waste your time on me
You and your big dreams 
Tomorrow is tears
Bodies rest in motion, fighting night and day
She was all right, yeah the sea was so tight
Take me to the heavens now
Stuck in her daydream, been this way since 
But everything you say I only see
It's too close to home
And maybe you can cry all night
You wanted someone else to say
Have become, all I love,
Don't back down, nothing can be changed
And I think that they could be the better half of me
Ground down, I know that you'll feel fine
Stuck by the phone again
See some colors, light hangglide off the moon
The lights go out
There's still a little bit of your song in my ear
He walks, you say, "Sit down, it's just a talk"
You can all sleep sound tonight
Solve lots of problems solve lots of problems
I will not pretend
But I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up, see I ain't like you
In the tower above the earth, 
This is the song for Baby Birch
I'd draw myself going in the right direction
Given you meaning but taken my place
Hush, hush
Oh god, please don't tell me this has been in vain vain
Your garden grow, and it's your day to wed
Know that love don't live here anymore
If I could end the quest for fire 
I've noticed things
There was a time, dark and divine
You paint a blue sky, then go back and turn it to rain
I really wish I got to say goodbye
I know everything is all right
Just another chance so that I can show
I know you wanna stay
Fake concern says "what's the matter, man"
Shell, forgotten with its memories
He's acting dumb, that's what you've come to expect
Till you cry when you're driving away in the dark
It's so weird to be back here
To wait until the morning train arrives
There's a place your mother goes
Thinking about everything we've been through
That I will be there at the end of the day
I know how I feel when I'm around you
I said before too long you'll be a memory
I've braved a hundred storms to leave you
No not mine,
Boy and the ghost
I'd tell it to your face, but you lost your face along the way,
When you come around and telling me I changed
And my leather jacket
Away from the light in my eyes
Avoiding a fight with this man
There's something that I feel I need to say
Never imagined we'd end like this
The tugboats on the river
No light will touch your face again
Our love,
A good one
That you can just follow and push around
About the future
And I was thinking 
I've done some things that I'd love to forget but I can't
In my cruel love gold poisoned
I know that diamonds mean money for this art 
Man, but don't it make you feel rage
You're a thousand minds, within a flash
In your life you were larger than this
This one's nearly gone
Pipework  I lay it down for the
Did you hear the slamming door
Never thought all this could backfire Close up the hole in my vein
And just dance, and just drink,
And now I've forgotten how to dream my own dream
I wanna' scream, let the blood flow that keeps me alive
I'm not pretending
Cracks appear and passion slips away
Tomorrow it may change
You're still leaving nothing but bones in the way
'Cause in the end I'm a sensible girl
Lie cold in the ground like you did
And float in space and drift in time only fools rush in
I am drowning, there is no sign of land
Could have me feeling the way I do
Know I'm right and do it right, could I get to be like that
So I'll wait for you And I'll burn
So please don't ask me any questions
Is there I still longing there
With excellence industry
He told me he liked Turner
So they jokingly nicknamed it the porridge,
I know you've got your part
And I tried so hard to reach you
The scraping subject ruled by fear told me whiskey works better than beer
On the stairs, she grabs my arm
You just walked away
You're just a sucker for the ones who use you 
It's all smoke, there's no more fire
But girl, what if there is no eternal life
And you heard my heart stop beating
He had to leave though I begged him to stay
Because it's hard to think I'll never get another chance
But you're all smiles
I'm just hoping you're not seeing his face
Be careful not to let the bedbugs sleep tight, nestled in the covers
And your thoughtless words are breaking my heart
I was dressed embarrassment
Hands are scarred, heart is charred
I won't give up till it's over
And when I'm standing still
But they're just old light, they're just old light
Nobody lives
And I can't erase the things that I've done 
The bathroom stalls
It's been in the past for awhile
To this heart a little bit closer
Hope there's someone
My curly hair and a voting booth
Fly like an angel heaven sent to me
Ah yeah
The best thing for you is to leave this awful town 
I don't even think so
I won't always love these selfish things
I'm watching through my own light
They say if it doesn't kill you it'll make you stronger
I miss your tanned skin, your sweet smile
Of your veins
And I can't stop dropping everything
And I want to tell you I'm sorry
And left an empty shell of me
I could wait with you for the winter to come
The time when we counted every black car passing
To always get me through the day
I noticed that
Cut out the only thing that was right
I think I'm coming undone
Well the paint was all cracked
And sit on top of me, yelling out my f name
Pull my head level with hers so she might engage in
Than the angels do
You step a little closer to me
And it's hard to find, hard to find
You never were, and you never will be mine
Und das war unsre
You grew your hair, so I grew mine
Sometimes there's no one left to tell me the truth
She was nobody's wife
Hear the crowd of ghosts
Everything short of "I love you"
To hide the people watching her
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to an evening of boxing
Hey, I wanna crawl out of my skin
Homeless my sweet
She lives in my blood and skin
You're lost in the dark  you can trust me
No matter what I say
My desire
Our hands would not be taught to hold another's,
Maybe this year will be better than the last
I'll look back of my life
I still maintain
Unkiss me, untouch me, untear this heart
'Cause I will never be forgotten
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah
Oh, when I run
They could have texted me when they were here, but I'm fucked and I don't care
I know I should've fought it, at least I'm being honest, yeahee;
He didn't stop all day to eat a bite
I've bought some things that I sort of regret, about now
But now I guess it's just too late
I awoke and I imagined the hard things that pulled us apart
And the moon's laying low in the sky
That looked familiar
Whatever makes you happy
All this wasted, it's all inside
Why's love gotta be so tough
Look right through me, look right through me
Saw you sitting all alone
So I blame this town, this job, these friends, the truth is it's myself
How much my heart depends
A horror soundtrack, from a stagnant waterbed
Kept you sleeping and even, and I didn't believe them
And it's hard to say how I feel today
The heart wants to explode
I had a feeling once
When God takes you back he'll say, "Hallelujah
Smoke is rising from the houses
Nobody said it was easy
Take these broken wings and learn to fly
Saw me just come up with anger
Swallows fall in a wave and tap on his window with their beaks
Never quite knew how to make them believable
I never knew perfection till I heard you speak 
Are you sure what side of the glass you are on
A restless imagination
At the face you don't recognize
To the seal's watershed
Nobody loves noone
Our screaming in the willow tree
It's impossible to expand, when you never get a second chance
I bless your words and education
Here we are
There'd be no tear to wipe from your eye
I love your depression and I love your double chin
I know you're leaving in the morning when you wake up
Oversaturation curls the skin and tans the hide
But we're trying hard to hold on
You kiss me with your kiss my life begins
Give you reason to believe
Someday my pain
Withering son
Ohne dich zähl ich die Stunden ohne dich
Underneath the sky that's ever falling down, down, down
This is nothing new
Cried for no one
Conversations competing for space
And now it's  years later 
I glance down, I don't believe what I'm seeing
Waits at the window
It's only your shadow, never yourself
And you thought you could change the world 
I know I'm not the only one
I've promised to send out for you 
And you will find someone
And we're on so many drugs with the radio on and the curtains drawn
I don't get many things right the first time
Like snow, like snow
Then you screamed the bridge
Baby, set my soul on fire
Right in back
Tears o'er a tin box
I'm tired of singing all the sad songs in my head,
You can tell them all how, how hard we tried to work it out
How can you live in a place like this 
No footsteps on the ground
She didn't realize how much the little baby had her eyes
They talk though what you show
I'll point you home
They stick to the shadows
Well it's an Assisi lie
I said something wrong
When you stand in front of my eyes
Now I'm finding truth is a ruined, nauseous end that nobody is pursuing
And you made an island of me
Shared my body and my mind with you
Ich habe Blumen mit, weiß nicht, ob du sie magst
Think back and talk to me
That could think about dreaming a dream
The rumors flew but nobody knew how much she blamed herself
Guess I think I feel alright
But please try to be patient
Embraced my soul you loved my mind
Now you're gone
You got rid of me
A sharp silver dragonfly
But my mother does
And I know I like to draw that line when it starts to get too real
you're just jealous 'cause I'm young and in love
And I knew that my last lines were gone
And I know the mistakes that I made
My mind replays
I've got an open door
Since we drank to the sunset until it was gone
Like a living Chinese finger trap
You look so fine
Sometimes I'm so full of shit that it should be a crime
Maybe this is wishful thinking
It's like you're pouring salt on my cuts
I don't know where we are headed for
But I always find a way to keep you right here waiting
So I couldn't come meet you in Brooklyn last night
That fell at the bottom of the road
'Cause you're scared, I ain't there Daddy's with you in your prayers
I see things that nobody else sees
Is lifting up her dress
But who needs them now, displaced they're easily more safe
And I would love to bring you down,
It's just this thing the seasons do
The shattered surface, so imperfect, is all that you believe
Find that all these funny faces look the same
Where do they all come from
Or break your heart
And it's turning in hours
I see the truth
When I lived in your chess game, but you changed the rules every day
While I sat at home
You know the words so sing along for me baby
But kiss me out of desire, babe
And these are the years that we have spent
Mother don't worry, I've got a coat and some friends on the corner
We can't even look into our eyes
Even if it's just for a few days
Why would he come back through the park
Only love can save us now
And true love lives
Come around Ruby, I could never sleep alone
Kiss the dawn
No hero in her sky
I'm sick and tired of the way that I feel
And it hurts my soul
The pillow in your pillow case
And the fog comes up
I'm not about to stick my grave with an
Everyone now, is so terrified
When I could run, pulling arms to love her
Your eyes are so blue
I gotta think about what I wanna say
You who love to love and believed we can never give enough
And my heart opens up to you
Her tiny, tiny teeth
You could be happy, I hope you are
When the sun came up
All I know is, I don't want to lose control
And in a minute I hear my name and I wake
Goodbye
In the morning I awake and I couldn't remember
I've been waiting for this to unfold good
And the people that you've been with,
Inside I hope you know I'm dying 
And dreams were all they gave for free
I was closer to you back then
But if my silence made you leave
Don't get upset about it No I'm not anymore
Loneliness was tough
You're life is not your own
Those were the days of our lives
Don't wanna try don't wanna try ooh
My bad habits would be gone in a matter of days 
My whole world could cave in
Well, summer's gonna come,
But her eyes glaze over, like she's lookin' straight through me
Straight down the line
By their color or your fear
Still wanna go
I guess I'm guilty spreading thin with my love
That this life is easy
And they got nothin' else to think of
And tell me I am still the man I'm supposed to be
Desert wind
Concerned but powerless
You're all that I hoped to find in every single way
Let you down 'cause we were the special two, and will be again
There isn't anything left to try
They're asking is it good or bad
All the planes we flew
But an angel came down
Wao, wao, wao That side of your bed is still mine
'Cause I can't believe what I found
Wish I could recklessly love
I got my own kindsa groovy
This is where it has to start
Stumble as the moments pass
Is that any way to say hello"
Rejoice you'll never make it out alive
Just another one of them
Walk past the gates
Take care of yourself
Why aren't you sorry, why aren't you sorry, why
And Laura's asleep in my bed
And when I write them out they don't make sense
Just for a few habit forming years
But as for me, I wish that I was anywhere, with anyone
That's what I heard her say
When the spring is cold
He was a sucker for your doubledose
For a latenight ride on your rodeo
Dry house, wet clothes
Take a chance on a 'recommend', ya
You never know when it starts
But some of you was light
so full of nothing, 
Staring into glassy eyes, mesmerized
The fire would sparkle in your eyes
Put me to shame now
Where you kiss the ass that I've exposed to you
It ended bad, but I love what we started
And you know I see right through you
I don't know why, I guess that I just do
You are the clever one aren't you
When her clothes fall to a bundle and she's laid in bed
Could you please start explaining
But here comes goodbye, here comes the last time
I sit on fences
Yeah, she'd wanna kiss you all the time
You keep coming back to tell me you're the one who could've been
No one seems to care anymore
And fat blue serpent swells
I need you to show me the way from crazy
I remember the car you were last seen in
And she says, "Baby, I've gotta get going"
Under your thumb, I can't breathe
You just didn't care
But we've been drinking, and it doesn't get me anywhere 
Scallop the breastbone, roll in toll and fold the long winter in it
The shorter story
So baby let go, got to let go
Give up the thing you love
Who has taken you far from my land
When they came to firebomb the house
A part of your soul ties you to the next world
And every man wanted her and so did I
Everybody's saying, he's not coming home now, 
Then looking upwards
I once was lost, but now I'm found
You touch her skin and then you think
You wanted rock 'n' roll, complete control
Try to find out what makes you tick as I lie down
And I know that I'm drunk but I'll say the words
Below this we'll end here until the end of time
The spookiness of night surrounds us in trees
I, don't know how I feel when I'm around you
Baby I'm a house on fire
Under a sky that knows no stars
The one and only true love
Well, I have sown untidy furrows across my soul, but I am still a coward
I keep feeling smaller and smaller
Every option I have costs more than I've got
Like we did on the beach last summer
What's left of you is
I'll sing it one last time for you
So close to perfect, swear to hell, thought it was you
You could be the one I'll always love
Do come and find me
Down an endless hole
And I can't let go of your hand
And the hardest part of living is just taking breaths to stay
But I wouldn't stop you if you wanted to stay
She never learned to let things be
I'm chasing all the words
Burning every bridge that I cross
What I've done
And I would have stayed up with you all night
If only I knew what I know today
I almost feel sorry for what I'm gonna do
Horses running free
When the summer turned to spring
Wanna be something you would do
Hope comes from inside
It's hard to know they're out there
After you've caused so much pain
But at the time it didn't mean a thing
The night's hard to get through
How do you love in a house without feelings
Don't you know she's got a babe
Only ever calling out, "Cuckoo"
Of when we had just started things
It's six AM and I'm all messed up
John, honestly we'll never stop this train"
Fall asleep reading science fiction
I have a hard time as it is
Mom and dad was arguin' a lot so mama moved back
Do you still forget the breeze
And she is kind, he is free, full of knowing
Please believe me when I say
And I can never go back to the way I used to be before this started
Her love is a rose pale and dying
To be everything I'm supposed to be
There with my crooked teeth and companions sleeping, yeah
I just want to dance in your tangles
And your light's always shining on
I will not run
Your love was like candy
I couldn't walk, and I tried to run
Collecting your jar of hearts and tearing love apart
Dangling before my eyes
We used to have fun
He hurt me but it felt like true love
I'm waiting to hear from you
In the blue part of the evening
Now we are one
Tied down by handicaps instead
You never doubted my warped opinions on things like suicidal hate
Get a little bit suburban and go crazy
I know in the past I've found it hard to say
Mmm that it's just what we need You decided this
Some get by but some get old
Watching TV movies on the living room armchair 
Please let me bring back these gifts of mine to the woman
But leave that blanket around you 
Waking up I see that everything is okay
How can we go forward when we don't know which way to turn
I've lost the only love worth fighting for
The baffled King composing Hallelujah
But you don't need my pictures on your wall,
If you leave my life, I'm better off dead
I'll never have to buy adjacent plots of earth
We could go to the pictures and see something funny
Lonely failed experiments
The moon is rising, a revolution
But the world may not have many years
Still a little bit of your taste in my mouth
I'll always be thankful
Even when their numbers draw you out
Hold me up, hold me down
I felt you calling to me in the gloom
All pleasures the same, it just keeps me from trouble
Then you got sick too and guess who took care of you
'Cause I'm lonely and I'm tired
I'd love to believe it's all about love for a child
They won't change their minds
Kneeling alongside old Sad Eyes
This hex was delivered spent
Causing you pain
A black wind took them away
In the tall grass where
Just that one moment, ended their days
After all, I'm still a jerk playing with matches
One of these mornings one of these mornings
Boredoms in the bathroom shaking out the loose teeth
And the world so far below me
Help me carry the fire
Boxed it up and buried it in the ground
I hope you're keeping some kind of record
You can't break my heart, it's liquid
Speaking of Nirvana, it was there
This used to be the place we ran to
Gather up all your loose change
I was born to love
Our sinking friendships
You're always right
Hold onto love
But you should've left the light on
Do these dreams have any meaning
Just cross the border and into the city
Breathing smoke through his microphone
Hey, yeah
I really do love you
Because you know I hated to close the door on you
Tracing out a path right out of here and now
Like a druggie, like I told you
She would change everything, everything
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday born I was
There isn't anything that you can do
Trying not to catch the cold eye of the gulls
I am sorry that you came to find
We both know the day will come, but I don't want to leave you
�Cause I never seem to stay asleep enough 
Come to me let's drown
That you stay surrounding me, surrounding me
I'm gonna take you home
And so my child and I came to this place
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
But this could be the big one
'Cause it's hurting me to let it go
Life taught me to die
And I'm trying to understand myself and pinpoint who I am
Burying hurt and regret
Don't you think I was too young
Is almost everybody's question
Open your door  don't hide in the dark
'Cause I can't get you on the telephone
Because I loved the simple thought of you
Looked through the paper
You turned your light off
A dusty cartridge from the VCs is on the way to see old friends,
Later on the bed
Just live our lives, stigmatized
Let's have a toast for the scumbags, every one of them that I know
Hands hang low creasing the fabric of my wedding dress
And said the trapeze act was wonderful
Why can't you believe
And darker and darker it goes
Before you turn and walk away
I'm gonna take you home 
You lost the love I loved the most
I never knew what it was like
I asked what's the reason for tears
Will take me through the lonely night
And I hope when you think of me years down the line
They ain't gonna change
The endless inbetween
When you said your last goodbye
Take the time to take my breath
Love is love's critique
Knows all these parts Cause my jealous heart can't take that
Or a sad song in a lonely place
You just can't show me, but God I'm praying
I'm a fugitive that has no legs to run
But then I awoke dear and found you not there
As they flew past
Besides
Falling softly from the branches of the trees
We'll fall just like stars being hung by only
I will let you down,  I will make you hurt
Into your house, why don't we share our solitude
Hair is grey, and the fires are burning
Now he's turning off
Shh, mama's only gone for the moment
When you walk around, know you are future youth
Loved and adored from day one
But just give me a break and see the changes that I've made
My spirit gets so downhearted sometimes
With what I've done
Caught me listening to water dripping
I'm on the outside of love
Now I know, I lost you a long time ago
I just want to love you when you're not enough
You've been the only thing that's right
With your arms outstretched trying to take flight 
Got to be patient, try and pick up a clue
And, yes, you just run to him
And he told me that I'd done alright
A voice inside my coffeecup
"Shall we look at the moon, my little loon
Sad songs in my head'
Such a vicious world
I've got all the change
And I leave, my burdens at the door
She tried the last one on, it couldn't speak fell off,
I listen to you talk but talk is cheap
But we can remember
And deep inside, my tears I'll drown
I set my watch to the atomic clock
Searching for the right,
One day I guess I'll be
Never once do you think that they would lie
Too much love will kill you
Loving him was never enough
You were the one I tried to draw
It was real true love 
What it feels like beside you
He still gets sad
'Cause I believe there's a place
To see how warm it is inside
Looking for some cover trying to get away
I can't believe you had the nerve to say the things you said
With his Father's  and a broken fuse
I know it's hard, but you
But if this was a movie, you'd be here by now
Did I fall or was I pushed
You might say that you don't care, oh
Just one touch and I'm on fire
I still feel your love
From the only place that you've known
You've made me realize my deepest fear
Have you ever loved someone so much, you'd give an arm for
Caress every ache
And I was born to tell you I love you
Scream back at you 
Just goes to show how wrong you can be
They call holidays an option for a reason
Tell my mother I am sorry
It's like I told you honey
All my senses come to life
Halfeaten gallons of ice cream in the freezer
You were born on a black day
Just our hands clasped so tight
I used to live at home, now I stay at the house
Already lost the grip
At the wave of your hand
And there's distance and there's silence, your words have never left me
I try again and again
The long and winding road
Better change, before it's too late
And there, you got me, that's how you got me
I'm always gonna live to be your man
The darkness
And feel it wash away
More than the weekend
And I could live, I could die
And then I die
Won't let you down when it's all ruined
And broken mirrors
Running over the same old ground What have we found
Because there's some lives you live
I have called you preacher, I have called you son
I could never be the puzzle pieces
We need a connection but you seem to push me far away from you
She sleeps in, lies around, and then she goes out
I believe in you, and I don't really give a damn
Fell face down didn't help my brain out
He talks about you in his sleep
If it just won't sing for you
I'm in the crush and I hate it
You're gonna find someone new
And I'm burning all the letters
You on the run
'Cause it seems that wrong
Maybe check the news
This is my plan, run away as fast as you can
None of this was planned
Being a mistress on the side
I just wanna feel
I'm following suit and directions, I crawl up inside for protection
And knowing nothing at all
I may just never see you again or might as well
Words fall through me
And convince myself to lay back down again
Of the glowing dark
And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call
And it's too near the bone
But if you need more, I'll just do it in some, right
I used to run down the stairs
Yeah, he'll claim all that has spoiled in your heart
Thought we'd be on fire together
Does it hurt when you think about me
I'm broken down and hungry for your love
He had everything a man could want, power, grace and style
And then told me not to fire it
And when I see you, I really see you upside down
Will you stay with me 
And the lightships 
And holding his bleeding heart
And I was glad she never walked away
One more time  I promise after that, I'll let you go
And now it kills me just to hear you say the simple things
When I'm standing in the fire
Goin' with another guy
You showed me love
I would dig a thousand holes to lay next to you
I wish I'd never met you, or that I could bear to let you go
There's no one in this life
Over you, I break in two
Can you do all these things
Counting stairs with double meanings
There's a movement out the door I swear but no
I'm two heartbeats ahead in Hell
The windshield of your little car is frosted through the glass
"I'm waiting on hoof and on hand
And I just want to see you back at my front door
I can't believe this never happens to you
I'm waiting for some kind of a miracle
Left this world a little better, just because I was here
With the sound of your voice
With the perfect dream
I have walked these streets so long
I'm going away for a while
I wanna kiss you goodbye
Who she may run from
You will see your beauty every morning that you rise
You bring yourself down in pain
But I can't find enough of anything to drown out what you said
Beneath the dust and love and sweat that hangs on everybody,
And all these days I spend away
Wake up in the morning and have breakfast ready on the table
And your jokes are always bad
One time, tell me you need me tonight
Let me steal this moment from you now
So could you please collect your things
These fuckin' walls must be talking, 'cause man I can hear 'em
It lets your beauty unfold
Breathing in lighting
Couldn't see through the smoke
Nothing gets so bad
And sit here cold, we will be long gone by then
To fly, to fly
I keep a memory of your face
I'm coming up only to show you're down for
You are one of God's mistakes
The ghosts are crawling on our skin
She said she'd call but that was three weeks ago
And I rationed my breaths as I said to myself
So pleased with a daydream that now living is no good
I have decided to leave you forever
And the older I become
I've got my heart
So may the sunrise bring hope where it once was forgotten
I would love to pay for you
Bring him home again
Out glaring geezers' stares
"Come down," they say
I found you, something told me to stay
Frank's in there I don't care
My hands have got
Speak no feeling, no I don't believe you I don't believe you
In the cold light 
The sky
I saw the future once
Just a few last hours we gotta make this count
I'm putting back together my heart,
You'll soon begin to love again
I know I'll be there at the end of the day
'Cause I never leave my heart open
Like cheap officers who would stand there and flirt in front of me
'Cause I was tired of lying
nunca duermo antes de diez 
I'm barely holdin' on to you
I think it's time, we give it up
It's sad so sad, so sad
To breathe this air
The phantom is inside
Father set our house to flame
Bring my baby back
To keep myself and heart employed
When autumn comes
Than I was before
A nation blind to their disgrace
Unfortunately, we are not licensed to display the full lyrics for this song at the moment Hopefully we will be able to in the future Until then how about a random page
Time, there's always time
You might say that it's over
And having so much to say
Tongues on the sockets of electric dreams 
You stay out drinking late at the bar
Yeah their lives were stole
We meet here for our dress rehearsal to say
That our memories depend
And you're so independent
Long were the nights, when my days once revolved around you
Years down the line
To the outside, the dead leaves lay on the lawn
Yeah, yeah, yeah ah
I wouldn't change a thing about it
And I'm feeling my way through the dark
Theyre asking me to export all of your insecurities
If I wait for stormy skies
Das Leben ist nicht fair
Take everything
All these words I just don't say
We still dance in my outrageously beautiful
Of children wishing they were safely underground
A place so dark, so cold, I had to set me free
And a candle burning bright
Won't you sing me to sleep
"You're safe, child, you are safe" Am I coming
I put its rope around my neck
So don't look now
I will hold you down, fold you in,
Take my hand
I'm a stranger in this town
And all the shops are closed 
Bad moon whine again
Do I stay
Johnny, don't point that gun at me
And I'll ask for the sea
I hope you're as happy as you're pretending
But you never thought it was enough of
It was just before the moon hung
This special morning brings another sun
Talk to the wind
Here's to the tears you knew you'd cry
Your phone has been disconnected
Even now in the final hour of my life
My body's running but I don't see why it bothers
Wash your face, dry your eyes, oh
Well, I can't forget this evening
At least we both know where the other one sleeps and lets end this tonight
I thought you'd be here by now
It's all that I can say
Don't spend another night alone
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now
Together we cry, oh yeah
See, the cage, it called I said, "Come on in"
Halfawake and sleeping on my feet
Maybe maybe they'll stay true
Put on my coat in the pourin' rain
Bring you home
Just stay with me
'Cause I have lost the force to fight
I know my place
Their sun is our sun
It's time to say goodbye
I'll see you in another life,
Lover, there will be another one
Advance the tallowcolored walleyed deer
Hell, there's plenty of light still left in your eyes
She figured if she didn't move no one would notice her
I hope I cut myself shaving tomorrow
I don't dream about anyone  except myself
That I've lost more than you'll ever see
Just a killer come to call from some awful dream
I will let you down, I will make you hurt
You'll be the road, rolling below
Out of every sorrow
I'd do anything for you
Your eyes feel so low
I was discovered by the love
Get me through Grey Gardens tonight
Like brothers on a hotel bed
I cannot recall
And I just wanna stand outside
If she had wings she would fly away
Mother don't worry, I killed the last snake that lived in the creek bed
Everybody hurts
You're gonna make 'em scream someday
The blower's daughter
Take me You're sorry, you swear it, you're done
Take a day plant some trees
I couldn't feel my feet or hands
Cause everything were been through
The waves will pull us under
I guess it really is my time
'Cause our days were rough
She We gave her most of our lives
Alone and crying
See, honey, I saw love You see, it came to me
You don't even want to let them start
He's in pain and misery
Wonder if you're lost or found,
I will leave my mark so everyone will know  I was here
The world is wide, the time goes by
I'm backsliding
And I'll tell Saint Pete I can't come in
In red, blue, green
And I don't feel the need to know who you're with
I'm an ocean nothing floats on
Than to show my skin
That long black cloud is comin' down
Blunted and exhausted like anyone
It's short, it's simple, it's crystal clear
There ain't no way that I can hold it down
With my heart beside me
Oh, the sky was a woman's arms
Hi, Justin, this is your mother
When the waves
A father after Leningrad
You are a ghost
I felt so vacant you treat me like a child
My heart's beating to quick, I'm fucking tripping out
I need a big love,
Come with me my love
In this love
Rear window with the room in the hair
Better come come come come come to me
I'm broken, I'm broken
It's just no good anymore since you went away
And these fights
I loved you first, I loved you first
Oh, but I learned the hardest way
The strangest twist upon your lips
My sister, hold on tight
You know the one I bought you in phoenix
Wake from your sleep
He's nude as the news, nude as the news
Maybe I'm born right out of my time
Millions weep a fountain, just in case of sunrise
You have to take me right now,
Just like she's walking on a wire in the circus
I come bearing forgiveness
And sailed on shooting stars
Atlantic ocean, New York skyline
I sit tight, don't want to miss the show
And I've been waiting far too long
But I'm sure it didn't ruin her
Of course she lied awake
The morning light has washed your face
Tomorrow, see the things that never come
And pray our pain subsides
And I rest my head on the tile floor
That maybe I can live without
And I put my face over the ground
And when I die, I want to go to Hell
Those kilometers and the red lights
Feel the hollowness inside of your heart
'Cause in  hours x
And let me kiss you, oh
Anything has before
Stand behind bulletproof glass
But I don't make you lonely
I never had no one ever
I was your fortress, you had to burn
It's the wrong time for somebody new
So if you love me let me go
My wealth would render this no less severe
Where you are
I see pain but I don't feel it
I'm not your family
Face upon your happy home
Now you're gone now you're gone
This family's breaking down
The map of the world is on you
She sends her regards
Please don't let them look through the curtains
Of my aching heart
Couldn't look you in the eye
The stranger next to me
And more heaven than a heart could hold
Why are we strangers when 
Maybe I shouldn't have done the second one, I feel all fidgety and warm
Found a way to understand the time you're burning 
I'll never be able to give you something
I'll never really learn how to love you
Having thoughts
What can I possibly say
I don't mind where you come from, as long as you come to me
And like a ghost in the silence, I disappear
And love all you have left like your boy used to be
Something's getting in the way
Walking in that room when you had tubes in your arms
And he knows all the ways of the wind
But I'm just drunk enough to let go of my pain
That I laid you in your grave
I never once in my sweet short life meant anybody harm
And of course, you can't go without that
You can't carry it with you if you want to survive
We're not the same inside
Loose change, bank notes, wearyeyed, dry throat
Say something funny
If you're not for me then why do I dream of you as my wife
This lady of the flowers; her electronic haze
Don't be a fool, make it easier
I've got your letter, you've got my song
Crawl across the river mouth 
Never needed you so bad
Why is everything so hazy
When it's summer in the city
In the morning when you finally go
At anything that moves
She was calling around to find half an hour
A firecracker flash of light then on
Sweet baby, don't cry 
Your arm's got a death in it
Just to occupy one minute of your day
Nights alone by your side
Mmm, summer turned to winter
She wanted more from life than he could give
I cannot stop my rebel hands
When was the night that showed us the sign,
Don't you think we stay for too long
Graze it with their wind arrows
So I dialed her number and confessed to her 
Between the halves and the half nots
And my ships were sailing
I wanna travel the world but I, I just can't do it alone
I need you like water in my lungs
Like it's always been
I finally found the words
Have no fear
And now I'm older, see it face to face
Counting stars wishing I was okay
Eve, you're wrong, love
I'd fill your every breath with meaning 
'Cause you wanna say good night
That old blanket of sorrow
A child afraid to even cry out says
What they promise and their word isn't good
Than sweet, sweet lies, oh now
It's later, never sooner
But my dogs, is gon' be a thug for me, c'mon
Lays like snow at the foot of the Roanoke
But I get tired and I get weak 
Where you hold me down, fold me in
Thought that maybe we'd fall in love over the phone
Let me kiss you, oh
And I'll take with me the memories
When you try your best but you don't succeed
I can hardly hear you say
There are friends who never call me anymore
Goodbye my friend
Cannot be repaired
Maybe you're right
and to be frankly nobody 
I show the scars of every fear and doubt
For all you've done and still do
One man's righteousness is another man's
There's no song without love
I guess you're as real as me
My wretched world
Nightfall came
And if I went with you I'd disappoint you too
I didn't know it was over
Now all my days are filled with tears
You mustn't underestimate that when you are in doubt
Celebration guns
Do you have to make me feel like
And when all you want is friends
Hope is lost, I can't let go
The wild and windy night
That everything
And we saved 'em for a rainy day
Hard to leave when it's picturesque
Wounded warriors took her song away
So when my mom and John came in I would be cold
And all this like a message comes
I feel lost
They come snapping at your heels
Well, in the dark we're just air
So far away, I'm gone
You're the only one who really knew me at all
I'll be crying
I never meant to sound like this
Everything where it belongs
And she walks the night
Lying beside you as cold as a statue your hands are still warm
In your heart there's a spark that just screams for a lover to bring
We reached for the stars; everything is now
I'm gonna lay back down, I'm gonna lay back down again
So please put your sweet hand in mine
And a strange dust lands on your hands,
What is gone is over
Late last night, I made my plans
Behind the old facade
He brings her to her feet till she can no longer stand
I write songs
Got to get to you, got to see this through
And rescue me from me and all that I believe
Pull me out from inside
And it was easier to lock the door
Crop circles in the carpet
She doesn't need him
But time has changed nothing at all 
This world forever, baby
Ooh, Ooh, oh, whoa, oh, oh yeah
And now you want to talk 
If it takes you forever, I want you to know
Bring back the joy to my life
I know it's dark outside
I had to take your word on that
'Cause I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
But the dawn is breaking, it's early morn
She's pilling boxes in front of the door trying to block it
And barely conscious you'll say to no one
Now sadly I know why
'Cause all I think about is you
The desperate are water
And talked a little while about the year
And it's colder than yours
White carpet thick with pet hair
Well we can change our partners 
They come and leave you behind someone else's face
Our carefully laid plans
I look for you or someone who can still remind me of
And he often remembered how it used to be
He was a very good friend
All we got left's right here, mm mm yeah
Broken this fragile thing now
Your baby doesn't love you anymore
Sallowskinned, starryeyed
Coming after people you watched collide
No one to get on
Stephanie says Stephanie says but doesn't hang up the phone Hang up the phone
To just let go, my party piece
Go off to sleep in the sunshine
Oh what a wonderful place
And all of the drugs she took, every one, every one
Maybe it can't stop tomorrow from stealing all my time
And I hope that I see the world as you did 'cause I know
Or he'll say he's just not the same
As I stared at my shoes in the ICU
"I know this can't be wrong" I say
Here the nighthawk call
The world has changed or I've changed in a way
In the smokefilled world
And we ignored our others, happy plans
In place of a broken me
Is that a fact Delilah 
Were gonna live our lives
I didn't think so 
I hate coming to the entrance, just to get bars on my phone,
Ever found a way to say to you
Your crazy thoughts and dreams
The wind blows so light
I'll say goodbye
As I put my foot down to the floor
So tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
And it won't leave me alone
Before the lights turn on, yeah and you're left alone
But everything's the same, this town's gone pitiful
Your neighbors were screaming, I don't have a key for downstairs
Sing to me of the song of the stars
I will miss your heart so tender
And I was kinder
They say that promises
Holdin' your scarred heart in hand, it's all the same
When you've fallen on the highway
I can't wait
But if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right
Don't say you won't get scared and leave
Well everybody's hit the bottom and everybody's been forgotten
Between worlds, so the people ask her
But I still love you more than anyone else could
You fade into a shaded room
A bourbon brown that can burn my eyes
Lying here, lie, lie, lie, lie,
Yes I do, I believe
And says to her
The cloth low on the mast 
All fleet snatch is laying waste my gore
Both of us were dreamers, young love in the sun
You left another message said it's done,
Collapse the light into earth
What a sad trick you thought that you had to play
Goodbye brown eyes
Never meant to hurt anyone
"Never never never never never never never never never let me go" she says
But if you take a ride with them you may not come back alive
postponed, at the first showing
And the rushing wolverine flies past
my days without you are like a sky, 
The black Air Force sergeant was not the first one
'Cause we are broken
Hey Mr Curiosity
It's such fun
'Cause I don't need this life
Now all that I can really say is baby, oh
And you love the lies they say
Is everything is not as it's sold
But I'm not looking for an easy way out
Don't you think nineteen's too young 
I know that I'm drunk but I'll say the words
And sometimes you take a swim
So you won't feel bad about me
For the sea like navy men 
Can't go home alone again
To get back to who I used to be
Would rather die than have to touch you"
That type of shit'll make me not want us to meet each other
Of my world
You'll say don't fear your dreams; it's easier than it seems 
While you dance to "Purple Rain"
The grass is dead, the gold is brown and the sky has claws
Now my words are filling at the top
Woken up from a dream last night
Make it over, make it stay away
So let's let these tiny acts of charity be common ground on which to build
But one thing is true
But please remember me fondly
I can call, wish you well and try to change this
Just say it to me now
Here we are again, circles never end
Drew talks to me
The imitation picks you up like a habit
A part of me I'd never seen
To try to hold on
Can't you see that this is death
Feels like I'm looking at life 
And please yourself at the same time
Needlework and seedlings
How can I give love when I don't know what it is I'm giving
I've even been there once or twice, or more
Down by your side
And spend every moment I had with you
Lift up your voice, lift up your voice
I never needed you for pointing out my wrongs
What about the junk head Could have gone the whole way
Microphone
Nobody here
You catch me if I'm falling
About a million reasons
I turned my head away
You'll notice something funny if you hang around here for too
Take comfort in your friends
Of sorrow has taken you
And I'll be anything to keep her here tonight
Already died and went away
Suppose it's just a point of view
Even when their numbers call you out
When I and my mother would disagree
And the genius next door was sleeping
There's no use in trying, when the pieces don't fit anymore
Your voice it chased away all the sanity in me
Any feeling
I turned away as he came near the street below
I learned the truth at seventeen
You have no home, you have no walls
Oh when you're looking at the Sun
I cannot tell if you mean what you say
Maybe I would have been something you'd be good at
You'll say you'll never give up seeing eye to eye
You broke your children for life
It's so easy to laugh
To tell you I'm sorry
Because one is the loneliest number that you'll ever do
But I'm nonetheless 
It's because I'm thinking about a friend of mine who you don't know who is dying
I've been trying to be where you are
Return the videos they're late
We'll throw these books In the fire
Into our lives
Than to sit and think of you
All that I say, you always say more
Left it all for love
It's not about the scars
Make 'em wash
We're at war, we live like this
And I am feeling so small
My girlfriend's jealous 'cause I talk about you twentyfourseven
While he stands tall and walking proud
Since the apple wasn't there, yeah
If I leave you it doesn't mean I love you any less
And don't go home
Like a cat tied to a stick that's driven into frozen winter shit
Though you're thinking that you're leaving there too soon
So tell me when my silence's over
Stepping outside she is free
Saying sorry, we've fallen apart
Well, I no longer hear the Music when the lights go out
But you're falling anyway
So I could make up my mind
For telling you I thought that we could make it 
So many things I would have done
She would change everything for happy ever after
I should've stop to think, I should've made the time
It's disrespectful, I can't handle this
But something told me to run
Wonder if I'm lost or found,
If you had a part of me, will you take your time
Just know I'm gonna have to walk away
Your mouth should be working for me
When you're dreaming with a broken heart
Like somebody else
Wind in my hair, I was there
I'm gonna let it burn
Surrender
Worse than a fear, it's the knife
And the people you're with
See the planes take off from Heathrow
And that's life
Beneath the stains of time The feelings disappear
Like the rains outside
I could look into your eyes until the sun comes up
I guess it's funnier from where your standing
God is a place you will wait for the rest of your life
To fill a hole, to shake the sky in two
This tired mind just wants to be led home
Then something unusual, something strange 
Dass die Sonne scheint, dass sie wieder scheint
And let me run
You'll find a way to live your life
And one's pointing his tree branch at me
All the love I felt hadn't been in vain
'Cause the man of the hour is taking his final bow, goodbye for now
For to gaze awhile 
I thought that maybe I could find myself
When your soul embarks
When praises cease and seasons change
He was selling cocaine
Was the year I came up for trial
And I'm ill with the thought of your kiss
Ah, just one more
Well, it's  o'clock on Monday morning
And it's your first cigarette
Fifteen years gone now, I still cling to the petticoat
I'm in love
It was like everything, like everyone's been broken so
You're right back where you were
I watched you laughing from the passenger side
Sail away with me honey
But I didn't, now it's all too late
The father was cruel and he lost his wife
One day you'll kiss your rabbits nose, pick up the phone
You are my only one
And said "Amanda, I'm in love", no you're not 
Means nothing else would be the same
Take a good look at me now 
A box full of suggestions for your possible heart
Struck from a great height by someone who should've known better than that
Seeing life in a new way
I'll start to wonder if this was the thing to do
Till it's gone
Let me put on a show
Less your lover
Waiting to light
And I'm so happy now that you're gone
Drink up, dreamers, you're running dry
Hers is the face I see when a certain mood moves in
Before you walk out my life Oh, yeah
I'm wasting my time
Sweet summer days when I was feeling so fine
But now we speak with ruined tongues
"And it's all running out like it's the end of the world", you said
You hit your head and then forgot your name
'Cause when you showed me myself I became someone else
But when you tell them my name
Love was such an easy game to play
There's no greater power
Turning into dust
And the people they come and go
They never care at all
And when she was sad
What was gettin' near
If I had you here, I'd clip your wings 
The sacred geometry of chance 
That I made a difference, and this world will see
So please hold on, so please hold on please hold on
Seems like your trying to bring me down
Would you love me a loser or winner
You're eating my heart away
Please don't tell me everything is wonderful now
You don't know how hard it is
Layers of dust and yesterdays
'Cause every breath that you will take when you are sitting next to me,
The change machine lied
But here inside my mind you are the loudest one I know
What was the answer you wanted me to find out
You, me and mum, y'now, anything was possible
This love's too good to last 
Why you can't raise your voice to say
Hey Slim, that's my girlfriend screamin' in the trunk
Set out with no map and turn off your torch
Like a beggar going from door to door
I know you think I'm holding you down
'Cause I talk to you like children
You're still the only one that feels like home
The first colours, the first kiss
And they're all missing out, yeah they're all missing out
"We'll catch him unawares but 
Talking all night "please stay up" but
And find patience and grace
'Cause when you have more than you think, you need more space
But you always find a way to keep me right here waiting
When you're staring at the cracks
So I'll fall back in line
I watch the dreary light
Such imagination seems to help the feeling slide
You're the only one
Why I turned out the way I did
Now I've lost my disguise, it was all white lies
I'm your little lifegiver
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him home again
On this shallow land
Translates by tone
I tried to stay above the waterline,
"Build your castle, stop collecting stones
In strange ideas, we live apart
I wanna live life, always be true
The snow's been fallin' for months
"If you're so funny
Say something sweet
In case you failed to see
I'm missing your laugh
Oh, and you're so beautiful, yeah
Nothing means a thing to me
And all the people in a dream
Choking on the thought of leaving
And I know, you're gonna be away a while
Like that firework over the freeway
We lost control
Out of this place
Does it mean something
There's nothing to see here now
But no one's gonna say it
'Cause I will comfort you when my days are through
You might be just what I need,
When they say,
For the plentiful times that, 
I needed to pray or see a priest that day,
Caught in a dream
Now that the hour hand has landed at the end
I never tried to feel
And sleep alone tonight
But I am never beaten, broken, not defeated
Now I'm sittin' in this empty house
You wanna hear she loves you
Do you still love me
Your dress is torn to shreds
Be a good soldier
I'll leave my room open till sunrise for you
Take a chance watch it fall, grab too much and lose it all
For you this never ends
I can't be there with you But I can dream
So leave the light on, I'm coming home
Do you know I die
Cover it with semen
I think I'll start a new life
You don't really know what you got 'til it's gone
Tie me up with sheets, and hang me from your tree
And I'm lost and confused
She was hoping for a better world for this little girl
I'll be big enough for both of us to say
She kept all of her pain locked away
I've wasted away
Who knows, maybe it's all a dream
Guess I'd better wash my mouth out with soap
See you walkin' by with another guy
If I could just stop hating you
In syringe or in shower stall
Now listen to the truth
Too much of you my friend, my dear, and now I cower
Alexandra hoisted on his shoulder,
But when you start to pick it apart
Little bit of love
Take any boy in the world
But there's no way you can feel it from so far away, yeah
And it's a little late for explanations
I'll just use your simple name
As I crawl a cracked and broken path
The night we took that year
Under your skin
We won't have a thing
Oh, my hands are strong, I'll take any man here
We noticed a bonfire
So let me go where,
Are we ever going to start making sense
For a fake Chinese rubber plant
Try to hold on try
It's better that we break
Seal my heart and break my pride
Screaming out your bloody orders
The wind's indecision, the sorrowful rain
All the cards
I stand no chance at all
And I will always remember you now
I just want to feel free
The world is just a little town
When every time the sun comes up I'm in trouble
In form of future youth
With anyone who might
Oh, all my old friends are staring through me now
I know you have a little life in you yet
Just let them go
Pushing out before I sleep
Lucky stars in your eyes
I still feel the pain
Who will fight
The shock bleeds the red from my face
To sink into the dark, dark earth
He lives in California, too
Amazing grace in here
Do such normal things with you 
I need some distraction
Oh meet me on the road
I wear your sparkle, you call me your mama
We're crooked and were cut to the core
I accept like a curse an unlucky deal
I was thinking that maybe we can discuss
That's taken its place
It's making me tired
And I got nothing to look forward to
I leave the door unlocked
Love is love's sad news
You make it hard to breathe
Next door there's an old man who lived to his s
All I really care is you wake up in my arms Wake up in my arms
In its proper season sheds its shell
There's nothing like the pain
The days and nights are long
And all I needed was a call
I ain't lost, just wandering
The light was shining from the radio
Your eyes look low
I wish sometimes I could take back every word I've said
Amongst your toys in a room where I can take no more 
After all I tried to do, stay away from loving you
You can tell them all how I finally let you down
Like I won't know real love till I've loved and I've lost it
He said, "Son, have you seen the world
To tell you I was just a lie
When you water down my name
Sweet words that I want to give you
Somebody please tell me, how can you stop the rain from falling down
That alright with you
But she's stuck against the wall
In a tight little world
Our love is strong 
Let's take a breath, jump over the side
And much to old to break free and run
Like sunspots or raindrops
This is one for the good days
We both know it's a waste of time
And I was always so impulsive, I guess that I still am
So why would you be welcome here
Unloading lead inside me, I was subscribing one by one,
She was heartache from the moment that you met her
Try to put it in the past
Now go out there and show that you love 'em before it's too late
And even shared the tears
Don't you see me crying
They can run me out of town
On the wall behind St Peter's
I was just guessing
Tear me apart and then some
Good good bye, good good night
Their small town eyes will gape at you
Every time you say you're learning
You live the blues
I guess that makes you found
She stops and waits until they go back in
There's no need to go and blow the candle out
Our love was comfortable and so broken in
Yeah, he taught me how to hold my tongue
Would you pat me on the back or would you criticize me
But it didn't know me
I never needed anyone to help me
Mother forgive me, I sold your car for the shoes that I gave you
You turned a man to stone
Of your broken little hearts
I know you got my last two letters; I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect
And I don't get no change,
But it's just a temporary high 'cause when I close my eyes
And you're all laughing in the garden and I'm lost somewhere in your mind
Ain't it funny how we pretend we're still a child
Named her baby Hope when she was just fourteen
Where I got friends who'll care for me,
Don't have the strength to part with them yet
I thought we could wait for the fireworks
My dear they will dry off your cheeks
Could we learn to live right
And you remember when you were young
I guess we'll have to move
Eyes closed, head down on the pillow
I'm not your star 
And I hope that I change
God resigned from hearing my old story
Nothing to hide
Remember all of those days
'Cause they know your playboy mommy
You got me sippin' on something
I'm waiting
Yeah, I'm guessing this is growing up
And our beauty surely gone
When all I wanted was to be good
What ghosts exist behind these attic walls There's got to be a simpler explanation,
My pillow still wet
Don't patronize me sorrow
I can't say no to you
Until I saw your blue eyes cry, and I held your face in my hand
To tear me up in your sympathy
We'll get some jewelry for your momma
I hope you're waiting for me 
You love so deep, so tender
Your presence dominates the judgments made on you
We both could see crystal clear
You told me how proud you were, but I walked away
Sailing over Coney Island
"Bo bo, you need prayer"
That won't ever come
And if you can't tell; I'm scared as hell
That little piece of heaven looking back at me;
What you truly wanted to become 
The void took the shape of all that you were
He's pulling up in the driveway and you don't make a sound
I can't remember the last thing that you said as you were leaving
In fact I'll feel a whole lot better
I looked across and fell in love
Lights are blinding my eyes
Just as black and whispering as the rain
All the angels praying for me
And I can't do nothing about his strange weather
In your eyes"
'Cause we believed in our candidate
And how eventually my mouth will just turn to dust
But that day will most likely never come for me 
Tell me what did you learn from the Tillamook burn
If you don't believe it
You'll always be mine
It's a cruel thing you'll never know all the ways I tried
Just to prove I was right
Will I shake this off, pretend it's all okay
That if you fall, stumble down, I'll pick you up off the ground
But it never got into you
The birds
But I was happy to explain
And it's too late to start
Shoot me to the ground
Silver birch against a Swedish sky
I'm the hero of the story, don't need to be saved
mis dias sin ti son como un cielo
Holds my love in his hands, still I'm searching for something
I know you hate it when I leave the light on
And all the girls in every girlie magazine can't make me feel any less alone
Turned away in disgrace
Gotta think straight, keep a clean plate
And you're not the only one
I walked upstream
Don't believe it, and you will find it
We can even have an open relationship if you must
And I'll always need her more than she could ever need me
Over the edge of the world 
Car wash also on Sundays
I'm lifting the mask from a local clown, feeling down like him
It will open up for everyone but you
Everything we had
Then what are we doing here
Electricity between both of us
And run in little circles till circles are
I've looked at life from both sides now
And cut you like you want me to
I'll meet you in another life
I'm sorry for walking you now
Someday if ever you love me you'd say it's okay
Bleeding, birthing his black diapason
How this fell apart
This song is for the soil
For the wind to carry me free 
And we all went to heaven in a little rowboat
Pulling me closer, pushing away at me
i think of you as i made myself 
my days without you don't have nights, 
Beneath the brilliant showroom light
I've seen it all, I've seen the dark
All those special times I spent with you, my love
But we all got wood and nails
I wish I could have told you
But we only exist in this song
If you need a second opinion as you seem to do these days
I can feel their blue hands touching me
The night, it never ends
So I will share this room with you
I find myself searching
I wonder will it be the same tonight
Facing the ghosts that decide if the fire inside still burns
You find all the numbers you need
We don't know the meaning of
So many things to say
I was sure you saw me, but it wasn't meant to be
My recollections are all that's left of you
Oh, brother, are you gonna leave me wasting away
In small brown paper handbags near the porch
I would say at this moment
You gotta get out 
Give a minute, lady
Now he's dying to get inside
Making it up behind my back again
We can't outrun the past
We live our lives on different sides
She asked the pisspoor "Why you lookin' for that
'Cause now we say goodnight
So before I end my day, remember
But it's no sacrifice, no sacrifice
That it just is, everybody 
"You're safe, child, you are safe" Am I coming through
And make myself renewed again
And I was bad news for you just because
Bled into the sea
Knowledge is a deadly friend if no one sets the rules
Our wide toes plunged into the weeping shale to tear
"Attention shipping information in sea areas within
Joey will come when it's really time to go
Let me rest in pieces, pieces
It's gonna hurt bad before it gets better
Because number one was the girl friend from Paris
Say one last prayer
Don't get the jokes but I just need to laugh
Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red
Oh I'm still breathing
Now our hands are tied
Sometimes I wish I could save you
But I'm still
Lisa  Lisa, sad Lisa  Lisa
We can get right tanked up and and go home and have a fight
When the storms are raging round you
Or scratch my arms till they bleed
Those sad eyes
You never do, babe
But they say be true, don't stain your bed
But You sing to me over and over and over again
And some things they stay the same
I'll wait here
I thought with a month of apart
Seems so very sad for you
and without you everything is so boring 
You just slipped through my fingers
She says she has no time for you now
How's your mother, how's your little brother,
If I can call you, and tell you I care
Oh my mother, she betrayed us, but my father loved and bathed us 
Use me Holly come on and use me
Can't pretend that I'm all right
And it took a long time till I came clean with myself
The things you put in your head
Me and you baby used to flush all the pain away
Some sun had gotta rise
That you don't want me there in your life
Of all the times before
Burn my knees and, burn my knees and pray
I say she drove him to suicide
See Slim; shut up bitch I'm tryin' to talk
Funny how I'm nervous still, I've always been the easy kill
Blame it upon a rush of blood to the head
I can hear the sounds of the city
There is room beneath your bed for me
Welcome to the soldier side
I heard from someone that you wish you could
You stay and forget where the heart is
"Daddy, where's mommy I can't find mommy, where is she"
There will be a hidden message about a boy that loves a girl
Good things we been through
And fought it off and fought to feel
I'm gonna dream about the time I had with you
I can hear you asleep
To mend that shelf
Walkin' past the carpet mills looking in and takin' stills,
We were sad of getting old
It'll almost break you
I don't really think so
Just too bad they lie, just too bad they lie
They dug me my very own garden
So take a deep breath and count back from ten
The town all dressed in white
You show up like a hurricane
I'll be your clown behind the glass
I couldn't change, though I wanted to
Couldn't save you from the start
I laughed the loudest, who'd have known
Hold your mouth to mine
Wish I was with you 
Tell me what's making you sadly
I started looking and the bubble burst
Fifteen years gone, I still wander this parapet
Here in the dark, in these final hours
And like a baby boy, I never was a man
I was
And now I wish I'd stayed
Better call all the guys on the deck; they've been caught with no feeling
And it's dark and there is nobody driving
What the hell, we've got nothing more to lose
Behind my back
Then finally make me do just what my momma said
So if you have something to say
Become someone better
When the sun's too bright
In the middle of the summer
Is that what you thought love was for
Must have been touching close to ninetyfour
Then I guess we're both to blame
Souls escape fire
I'm on your side
Let's talk over mai tais, waitress, top it off
Well, I'm lookin' at the snowflakes
I've no need to stick around
He was me
My scream got lost in a paper cup
And if you call I'll run, run, run
And it's quite alright
Please don't think that this was easy 
Don't you flan in the face
Put your hands on the wheel
I'm goin' to a town that has already been burnt down
Just passin' through
I could've had that drink, I could've talked a while
Oh Lord, what have I done to myself
Look at what I lost today
And find a brand new way of seeing 
She's in the air In the air
Highways flew by
Now I watch as tables turn
There's no lies, the lies, the lies, the lies
For you to find you love me, and tell me so
And here I am to garland you with flowers
Tell me why I cannot be there where you are
But then again maybe we are just pretending
He deals the cards as a meditation 
One, two, three days that I've been sleeping on my side
Cause sometimes I don't know what to do 
And you're too drunk to notice
You've been waiting a long time
Every word I've said
Don't leave me stranded, don't leave me alone
You were so beautiful before today
From the house that built me
Will frequently check credit at moral bank hole in wall
Put your hand on my heart that was cold
These flowers will never die'
A twoinch deep incision carved
Accept it, Don't let it 
Singing out loud when the sun came up
Time will fly, upon my baby's back
I want to walk into your grave
And loved it why I never knew
But till then, darling, you'll
Like the feeling of what he needs
The spin of the earth impaled a silhouette
No no, I think it's more like a ghost
I guess it couldn't hurt me
And let the trumpets blow
It's you that I live for, and for you I die
I sang a lullaby
Will the rain wash away
I won't do too much scheming these days
And I'm saying goodbye
Will never again, sir, tear us from each other's hearts
No, they'll never hurt you like I do 
The feeling sometimes, wishing you were someone else
Sing the anthem of the angels
If morning never comes for either one of us,
The shortest breath of your young life
Before the fight, before I let you walk
You can't build a house of leaves
Everybody goes
Am I destined only to die the same way that I lived
Such awful thoughts
Burned alive in the heat of a grieving mind
Cause the man of the hour is taking his final bow, goodye for now
I've got shinsplints and a stitch from we
The house set fire to my heart
Night time triggers the land mines
You're just one more hand me down
Well it takes one to know one, kid I think you got it bad
Here I'm thin between darkness and light
And it feels like somebody is
A couple years went by something happened
Cause you say you love me, and I'll end up lying
Lookin' in the gun's direction
'Cause I miss you, body and soul so strong that it takes my breath away
And daddy lost at the races too many times
Return to me
Wishing one more time to face her
With your wishful thinking
And my father told me, "Son,
Still don't know what love means
Without the blanket of sorrow
The wasted youth
They say bad words that makes me wanna cry
Just him and the secret he was keeping
So the years went by
And I've been trying to make
At every occasion, oh, I'm ready for the funeral
Where I feel I will
You got what you want
It's hard to know that you still care
Can you please
I took off my shoes and walked into the woods
Oily marks appear on walls
And had his girlfriend in the trunk and she was pregnant with his kid
I'm sorry that you have to see
I hope we come up with a failsafe plot
And they say 'We've got some bad news, sir'
Just keep going to the bathroom, always say you'll be right back
And I will get lost into your eyes
If you don't love me
It started out as a bit of fun
When I woke up, the rain was pourin' down
I'm trying to be cool
Reminds me how you laid us down
You never see my bleeding heart
Sometimes honey, it just takes someone else
I'm half alive, but I feel mostly dead
When she loved me
I'm trying not to go insane
This is my front page
Was capital ME but you can't say I didn't try
I thought we'd get to see forever
Am I good enough for you to love me too
Balanced on my head like steak knives
So I'm always pacing around or walking away
Hold memory close at hand
Don't like the things you don't say
And now your altitude and memory's a shame
The soldier on the ground 
But sometimes I feel your not deserving of me
I'll spread my wings one more time
To hell with this pride, let it fall like rain
'Cause I'm the girl who kisses the dawn
Do you think that it'll float
If I could look across the country
We're all in tears for the world is broken
My dear, we're slow dancing in a burning room
My view stretches out from the fence to the wall
A thousand crystal towers
Life of the party and she swears that she's artsy
It's just the end of the, end of the world
These arms would not be taught to need another's
Lottery or car crash
And so long, goodbye
Whispered like prayers
They'll be damn proud of me
Won't you just hold down, hold down
Better call the captain, he's been caught stealing
So you can rest and repair
When darling I love you
Truly disappointed
But I just want my mind to stay the same
Trying to make things good for
Hot ashes for trees Hot air for a cool breeze
Sometimes love is not enough
And ain't this position familiar, darling,
And it hurts to want everything
born in hearts
I'll always look to a brighter day
I can honestly say 
It's cruel, somehow
Nothing to left to win
Cursed the day he let it go
Everyone and everything
Laid out ahead of me
Already somebody's baby
And where are you when I need you around
That I should go and this should end
And don't fool yourself 
I live with are numberless
Her tears fell
They're stinging my eyes, no tears
With all the pretty things she did 
It is a better side of you to admire
Your talking is just noise and won't lay me down 
It's so hard to get through to you
A young boy's died
Talk about your big mistakes Hey Shan, nice going
Pain on pain on play repeating
Down beneath the radar screen, she's lit up like gasoline
Why do we call this love
There are so many of us
Tryin' to be misunderstood
So come rain on my parade
That the good things would never last
Knowing I am safe on the inside
The sea of love
Won't you let me show you how it feels
But you are such a super guy
Faking now faking who you are
And then I get, a scary thought
The things that they did  ah  they didn't have to ask us
All the glory when you ran outside
It's already half past
So don't forget to breathe tonight
Rage on against the dying light
Leave the meter running
But I'm not gonna bless you with such compliments
And in this horror show
And rejoice although you will not survive
No one's laughing at God when they're saying their goodbyes
I'm not the road that you think when you lookin' for a short cut
We're waiting to hear it from you
Your face has faded but lingers on
Your lips give you away
My lover's gone,
I thought the older women would like me if I did
From things it's not meant to see
'Cause I'm so tired that I gotta go
And I keep it nice and tight
And all I think about is how to make you think of me
And the mountains surrender,
Letting the cables sleep
To give her the priceless peace
Sing like you think no one's listening,
Bury me, marry me to the sky
While the whole world turns the other way
From then on it was turpentine and patches
Johnny's daddy was taking him fishin'
I'm just falling to pieces
When I finally get it figured out, I've changed the whole damn plan
Can't you see the grass is greener where it rains 
I wish I could sleep
I'm brokenhearted, I can't let you know
Don't let yourself fall down
That I'm the one you really want to grow old with
We found her with her face down in the pillow
Those were the reasons and that was New York
Sag mir was ist bloß um uns geschehn
All that I wanted was to sing the saddest songs
Who asked for your hand
And I'm sorry
Well what would you say, if I said that you could"
Only they can hear you breathing
But I think I'll be returning now
Stay at home or walk in alone
Old friends, old friends
So come home"
I can only give you everything I've got
It's just lately I've been feeling
To the bed that I once made
Too young to hold on
Stole the urn while they
Some escape, some door to open
Both a beginning and an end 
His father burned his skin
Help, I have done it again
But you'll think of me, you'll think of me
And the daffodils look lovely today 
I told you
We're alone, we're alone, we're alone
They locked the door
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
Can't find it in my soul
And I'll be your downfall
They are lost to us"
Before long, they waste away
I got damaged, I lost myself in you
We're all weeping now, weeping because
I don't see lightning like last fall
And as I think of giving up
To believe in something
Let the show begin
Yellow water, final scraps of light
Do you think you can help me
When it all, ooh, went wrong
And the river bed shall not be yoru home"
While everyone is sleeping
I had a lover
I heard from someone you're still pretty
And I think of someone else instead
I hope that heaven is your resting place
The party gets boring 
Look outside, I know that you'll recognize, it's summertime
If it's good shit you won't know
I hate it here
I was waving around a bleeding open wound
You are impossible, Delilah, the princess of denial 
The dark days when fear crept into my mind
These days, I haven't been sleeping
So bring me back my girl
That if I lived till I could no longer climb my stairs
Safe and warm
We're singing a song, we don't care if we're wrong
Lying on the shady grass
It seems like it's been so long
Putting all the clothes you washed away,
Oh, hate it
In the light of day
While your house is swaying
Said, "Time has bridled us both, but I remember you too"
And Eve says let's give it a try 
When you'd hide your songs would die
She quickly loses breath
In the light of the sun
'Cause then I'd know I was down because
There's no relief for the bleeding heart
That is the hardest
The books suggest we set our hearts
What have I got to do to make you care
At the touch of a button
Could I be any clearer 
I dressed the kids as well
Oh, truly disappointed
But my dogs, is gon' be a thug for me
All the years keep rolling
If you could paint it
I don't need them 
To wipe the blood away
Until the day I die
But those drugs you got won't make you feel better
If you're looking for it 
'Cause he'll never hurt us again 'cause he'll never hurt us again
And I know I can be self righteous
Do you care to see
But you don't really care for music, do ya
In the morning
We live in a wheel, where everyone steals
I have all I need, haven't quite lost it
The biggest lie
And when those tears have run out
It's hell when you're around
A place called hate
To try and save your swollen face
Now, Brenda's gotta make her own way
Because
So I'm waiting for this test to end,
Someday they'll find your small town world
A moon full of stars and astral cars
Makes her body older than it really is
We drive tonight,
Yeah, you'd sing along, you'd sing along
Mother, where are you today 
And I know that you love me
I love the things that you do
And I'm just having thoughts I said
And the time rewinds to the end of May
Did I make it that easy to walk
It's raining in Baltimore fifteen miles east,
My mind is gone, I'm spinning round
This path seems the blackest
If the city girl was ever there
I was stone
Who would have known how bittersweet this would taste
What you got
Bring back the nights when I held you beside me
And can I choose again if I should lose the reason
Ten times removed, I forget about where it all began
Even angels would be homesick in this forsaken town
And someone's little girl is taken from the world tonight
My riches can't buy everything
I wanna run away from love
Let me out, let me out, let me out
Your father must have lost it your sister couldn't help you
In fact you may just want to run away
White queen how my heart did ache
Mother I made it up from the bruise on the floor of this prison
And unfolded
It's full of flowers and heartshaped boxes,
My sweet love
Is the monster you fear
With my hand in my pocket,
And my chances are so few
The light of the moon 
Those are just a long lost memory of mine
'Cause I wanna go ride away
All that's done's forgiven
I got paid to fish 'em out
I'm standing underneath the stars
All my old friends, they don't know me now
I'll check tonight
Yeah, you got me
But electricity it drew you near to me
For your footsteps trail
And I never saw the writing that was on the wall
On a course of distance
Remember when I cried to you a thousand times
I'd be anyone to be at your side
I'll never forget, the sound that night
And it was raining cats and dogs outside of her window, and
Crocodiles cry
Think no more about it 'cause I couldn't find it in you
In everyone that's out on the street
But there are some things even love won't allow
What the hell am I doin' here
I just wanted to stay
Better than the truth
Oh, yesterday came suddenly
Now he's lighting up the wrong way, something for the pain
What comes is better
To fight this feeling that is growing in my mind
So many reasons why
I've tried so hard to tell myself that you're gone
For truth, for love, for my desire
I kissed your mouth
For years gone by, and I cried
Live forever, for the moment Melanie C Live forever, for the moment
Ja, ich habe ihn gern, weil er so hell und freundlich wirkt
You're so selfless, cold and composed
I gotta live on an island to find the juice
Like I feel you
In this hole that we have fixed
I carry you on 
I died in my dreams
I'll ignore when you call
Winter howling at my face
I died the day you disappeared
I was dropped from
Spend a day to make her smile again
As we all tried so hard to remember
Just know that wherever you are
'Cause I been feeling sentimental for days gone by
I don't need to be I don't need to be
The things you told me to hear you speak
And you think you have to want more than you need
Where love is more than just your name
Once he was a lover sleeping with another
'Cause I wanna know if you can see the stars tonight
She spreads her love
I thought we'd be family together
I washed your dishes
Has anybody ever told you it's not coming true
To watch me while I bleed
There's always something getting through
I should've said your name,
We found him with his face down in the pillow
We're singing in the car, getting lost upstate
Just in case I like the dancing
Lie for fun and fake the way I hold you
The sun is coming up and it's going down
You just refuse to bend so I keep bending till I break
A knight in crystal armour
Signing off and winding down
Hold the gun
Thought we both could use a friend to run to
Feel the power you cut the truth into you
Lilac wine 
As what you hold
Honey, I'm a roller concrete clover
You think of the past,
They gain the light, they formlessly entwine;
I'm here to tell you loves not some fucking blood on the receiver
Everybody says
When my sister picks a fight
I'm waiting for you I know your leaving
Held you in my arms one time
It's not like me to beg you to stay
So now in Rock Ridge pharmacy I will be waiting for my man
Keeping everything moving, everything static
And now I'm older, gotta get up, clean the place
Me and you at the park taking walks outside
I just really need your ass with me
As I say goodbye to the way of life
And we'll lie 'til the corncrake crows
My friend 
No regrets they only hurt
He belonged to everyone 
Everything was beautiful
My sadness shows
And salt betrays my eyes again
And you were walking down below
I got happiness that I can maintain
And I knew that you were a truth
If you ever make a mess, I'll do anything for you
Of violence of love and of sorrow
Deep in pain, she is so far
I know that I'm still learning
Oh, little stranger, bring my baby back home
And I grow weaker and I
It's on your side now
It's the same outside
Other people think he's not
She left me with a note saying
A blanket, some matches, this pain in my chest
Such a lonely day shouldn't exist
'Cause I'm still alone in my mind
Let's take it back to  years ago
I'm starting to believe it should be illegal to deceive the woman's heart
Of when you looked at someone else
And it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart
It's done
In between tonight and my tomorrows
Tell me, is it really worth remembering
I just think it's time for me to go away
Will you help me to feel the glow
I already forget how I used to feel about you
But you'll think of me
So many mistakes
It is not a habit, it is cool I feel alive
So if you're out there barely hangin' on
I said I'm under the gun, round here
Before you walk out of my life
Baby, you're a lost cause
'Cause you're gone, gone, gone, gone, gone
I'll wait for you, babe
I never said I would stay to the end
That the empty feeling turns from black to blue
With a joy that's hard to hide
Home We struggled hard all our lives to get by
And too afraid, you're too afraid to fall for anything
I haven't seen them in a while
So she took her love
You take what you need to make you whole
Remember it was me who dragged you up to the sweaty floor
Or something that could ease the pain
'Cause I was always late
But God can be funny
'Cause I'll always miss her wherever she goes
To strip his clothes off by the dumpsters,
Stapled together with the strangers and the friend
Slender fingers
That you've bound and gagged, you've shot and stabbed
I could be lonely
So let's take the time
And said to me son
Always
It's the getting to the point that is the hardest part
I sleep with this new girl I'm still getting used to
I did what my body told me to
For the way some people are
If you're feeling kinda nothing 
I couldn't love
Are those dreams inside your head
She's not in your history books, lost her mind and kept her looks
I feel like our world's been infected 
Well it can always turn
From all this gloom life can start anew
And don't you think
No, it's not what it seems
I live in a city sorrow built
How we break each other's hearts
So I can find someone to rely on
Why are you telling me about everything
Gotta take what you can these days
You don't want to hurt me
Shadow of a shadowy man
Timid without a hand
Words will never sound again
That sinking feeling 
I got  bucks and a cracker, do you think it's enough
And they talk to me
Withdrawn a step away
I must have held your hand so tight, you didn't have the will to fight
And what you never knew
I tried to be your friend, you made me shamed, so I'm getting even
'Cause it's tragedy and it'll only bring you down
Repenting other lives unknown
Looking for faces in the clouds
But you've got to walk away now
But he calls me up
You're crumbling, sadly
But you think I'm not as cool
A girl at the window looks at me for an hour
Left empty handed
Baby, you're the only light I ever saw
And I don't know how we woke up one day and somehow thought we knew
Found a way to understand the things I'm learning 
The damage is done The prodigal son is too late too late
Yeah, I think that I might break
'Til the end
But it's missed when it's gone
Tell me, what did you do, what did you do the last time, why don't you do that
My open eyes to lightning storm
Cold child
the playground toll
You say what you want maybe I didn't get my way
Still scratching around
You know my heart So tell me honestly, did you ever really want this
Daddy, please hear this song that I sing
But it don't matter at all
Still with feet touching
I think I'll go out an embarrass myself by getting drunk and falling down in
Oh rejoice, your father's been calling
Your eyes are almost dead
Tellin' me, touch me, feel me
That it's either black or white
There is nothing left to say
Draw the bath and remind me to eat
We all play the game and when we dare
Houses burnt beyond repair
Something that I just haven't got
It's like a cold hand on my shoulder
Call it off, sorry refused
For all that you've done and still do still do
If I died tomorrow would this song live on forever
If I lived till I was a hundred and two
But I've made the change,
I'm coming up only to hold you under
So close no matter how far
I've journeyed here and there and back again
"I feel you pulling back
Even though she sleeps upon your satin;
Before my nights' vacation with you
We believe
I close my eyes and disappear tonight
Among the fallen trees and fast asleep
And you're hiding here alone
But with nobody in your bed
Sing to me of the plans that You have for me over again
As if from a distance
Leave no trace of grace
When everything was falling apart
I'd never want someone so crass 
She'll never notice how you stop and stare
Or living inside of my skin
But now she looks at you
And it's opening time, there's noone in line
And sitting in the long grass in summer
I travelled the whole world around
Now tell me, what have I done
I'm still reeling from the loss
Don't act like I mean nothing
To say "I love you" right out loud
Every time you get a drink
You kiss me, with your kiss my life begins
All the things we laugh about
How do you sleep at night
I can't believe
The night, this emptiness, this hole that I'm inside
My amulets, my charms, I set all my false alarms
So why couldn't you have met me halfway
I am the rain that's coming down on you
How to save a life
There is a time and place
How about what I have to say
We're divided by the ocean
"Wherever he has gone I have gone"
'Cause it's a flag that I love
Under blankets and warm sheets
Look up to the sky, not just the floor
When you lay your head down,
It hurts to touch
And you could say my name
And please don't fall in love with someone new
Please, please, I'm begging, please
I'm never sad like we were sad
Denying every tear
In sorrow known
I guess you thought that I would put it all behind me
I've got this life 
To the next plan soul remain
Then you hang up the phone and feel badly for upsetting things
Just one big lie
So far The stranger next to me
All stars could be brighter
Just let you leave without a trace
But I know how you feel, I know how you feel, and I do care
I'll be your downfall
But it won't get any harder
Asleep in the deep of
If again the seas are silent, in any still alive
Told him I was drowning
Covering the cuts and bruises cuts and bruises
I feel so far from where I've been
I was your amber
And just as I go to walk out of my bedroom door
I welcome your new life for me 
At your funeral I was so upset
There's nothing left here to pretend
It's such a shame for us to part
You can't turn back the clock
Have been silenced forevermore
Calm me and let me taste this is the calm
Sat down in jail with this friend of mine
Rooftop swimminpool
I'm too depressed to go on
Stay my love my love please stay
Scratching at the door
When you turn away from me
I could never love you back
Even though you know it don't always go that way
The doctor said, she's in a better place
Since the war was won
No, we can't talk about it now"
The broken locks were a warning you got inside my head
Never been one to hold on
I heard a little love is better than none
I dodged a bullet and I walked across a landmine
Well, the night makes moves
I'm just running in circles all the time
You were as kind as you could be
It's a state of bliss, you think you're dreaming
The broken clock is a comfort, it helps me sleep tonight
We'll reach up and hold their tails 
That I never should have taken in the first place
With yellow lights on a dark night
I've a bunch of purple flowers
You'll never touch him again so get what you can
I am nothing more than
You say we have turned
Beneath your tender touch
He'll never return it When you come back, we'll have to make new love
One more little one, I'll go down
Tonight, tonight
I don't have much to say to you
We're working our jobs, collect our pay
The words that you needed so bad
Ready for today
They could sleep on the floor
Or all together just taken apart
Girls, forgive my human mind
I know your fears and you know mine
It sounds so ridiculous but I just can't lick this
And I had a feeling that I belonged
Give me one good reason not to do it because we love you
So take a look at me now
I can always hear a freight train,
Now you mail back my things
She's been going about her business as usual
And the rains poured down
Don't even dare to say you hi, still swallowing the goodbye
But I just had no intention of living this way
No, I couldn't help but fall in love again
Scraping through my head 'til I don't want to sleep anymore
Your hand's on my crutch
Eating snowflakes with plastic forks
Everything will be wonderful someday
You come wasted
And the road the old man paved
When I think more than I want to think
I'm gonna stay eighteen forever Cut me open
How many times can I blow it all
I hear the crowd count down till the bomb gets dropped
Or at least something beautiful
When we were teenagers we wanted to be the sky
Oh, I miss that feeling of feeling
Inside two years alone with you
To have a song that I can sing
Well you're all scared and stiff
Before I say goodbye, my star in the sky
I feel so useless, do you
He says he's so in love, he's finally got it right
You didn't have the time
Like it's all real, when it's a lie
It's only you that I'm losing
I wrapped you inside my coat
How come you're not ashamed of what you are
And we talk till the evening fades
Oh no my darling not with that clown
And I'm sleeping in your living room 
So be kind to your mother
There's a windup man walking round and round
To say goodbye, nice try
He deals the cards to find the answer 
Still laughter pours from under doors in this house,
Whatever, he left her, and she had the baby solo
I told you not to believe in me
You got me, I got you
We catch the last bus home
I needed someone I could shake
But if you take that train under water
That they both are satisfied
It just don't seem right
When all along the fault is up for grabs, and there you have it 
And I miss you, yeah I miss you
And you know, everything changes but
Well, just look at me
You can hear the words she wrote
No I want a taste of love no i
You're still there still as you were
And we pray that they turn to seeds, to roots and then grass
All the things we talk about
Tomorrow holds such better days
Is a tiny prayer to Father Time
To think of me at this point in time
Our minds pressed and guarded
And if I should die before I wake
While I watch the ocean, 
Has a mind to serve the other
Will there be peace
To wish impossible things
Your tongue is a rudder
I can't rely on a dime a day love that don't go anywhere
Rude and sweet
Curse my enemies forever
His soul flew right up in the sky and I cried myself to sleep
I faintly remember breathing on your bedroom floor
Because of the things she did in the streets
Nothing left to say
At somebody new
the truth is that i also 
By the shape of destiny
Walked back home to my place,
And you are constantly surrounded by the swirling stream
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
I nestle into pain
Beyond my dreams
And the words still ring, once here, now gone;
A quiet picture drawn each day before it ends
Lord, I'm needing you now, tell me how to stop the rain
Now this applies both equally to you and I 
When I look and I find no change
From this moment
They say your boyfriend lives in a bubble
I never was one for lying
I can't be left to my imagination
It's hard to say I held my tongue
You pushed so hard
I need to remind you 
We're all inside our own heads now
And run away from all of my fears
You were my lesson, I had to learn
I'm tired of asking
I saw the sun disappear
And I can still hear her last goodbyes
I'm gonna leave it to stargazers
And these dreams keep you awake
Instead of accidental running, always running
Like my love into her grave
I'm ready for my sun
You could love me if I knew how to lie
And why does it matter Is to love just a waste
For the come what may
Can only be another sign
I'll wrap up my bones
The lone neon lights and the heat of the ocean
And then you're bound to see my other side
Not a number, not a name
In dull surprise when payment due
I'm living in a world that's all about you and me, mmm yeah
You could never let me in 
I love you Slim, we coulda been together, think about it
Never say a word
Pictures and some memories 
I hear my voice, I hear my voice and it's been
And when you think more than you want, your thoughts begin to bleed
And the road travels on
Like she wants to believe in me
Shadows are falling and I'm running out of breath
It's sweet, lie motionless just staring at the ceiling
Go run, run, run
Said, "Do you kids know what time it is"
We go home
I want you to notice
So I picked up the paper, it was more bad news
Hearts are broken every day
And I'm sure gonna give you a try
The way it feels to be alive
Mary's got the same size hands
I'm chasing Überlin
I wish that I had never said the things that I'd told her today
Long enough to know that it was him
Still miss you baby
Hard love what we've done, when with anyone else
Or am I just going crazy, dear
Maybe you would have been something I'd be good at
For all the times you run this
Who's all alone
While you try to find the lines to speak your mind
We ain't over but the writing's on the wall
Soft, dark, and dreamless
Do you find it all right, my dragonfly
It's been kinda hard
I've been twisting and turning
But I know that I love you through the hole in the sky
Please just save me from this darkness
The call to arms was never true
And who wants to give up that part of them
Down one to all the hopes and cares
To bear the shame of this whole world
It's not going to stop
But the timing never seemed right
I reach to hold you, but I don't feel you there, do you
Never reaches ears on distant stars
And I've heard it said too many times
Her heart is achin' 'cause she wants him home
We'll cry about this
If I pretend that nothin' ever went wrong
Mommy won't stop crying
So I'm holdin' on, I'm holdin' on, I'm holdin' on
I've got a tight grip on reality, but I can't
Take his hand in mine
Oh wake me please when this is over
Takes a look around, no regrets, no regrets
Gotta live our lives
And you think I need some discipline well I've had my share 
This is the way you left me
Dying far with everything
'Cause all of the stars are fading away
Tonight, when I came home from work
Blankets wrapped and drifting off to sleep
We didn't handle with care
When I was younger, I saw my daddy cry and curse at the wind
To spread my wings and fly away
No, it's just some guy she's been hanging out with
I was so scared to face my fears
Is a cloud of smoke
Piss pools in your seat
You know I plan to retire someday
And games that never amount
But I can't help it if I'm just a fool
I held her close, I kissed her our last kiss
Yeah yeah
So she may laugh in the autumn of your years
I need fuel  to take flight
The rest of my life
Love me love me love me love
What seashell she is calling from across the world
But the little wet tears on my baby's shoulder
Like gold, like gold, like gold
She who dares to stand where I stood
For all that you've done
And so it seems only in dreams
He says close your eyes, sometimes it helps
Wish that bar lady'd appear; and come serve over here
A brand new morning shines
RIP Baby, we love you from all
All of the words, All of her men
And fill me up when I'm empty
I'm listening to a song inside my head
When a telephone was a tin can on a string
Now I wish I woulda talked to him
Babe, you lost me
And, James, he came to the door
Never broken
A heart that's broke is a heart that's been loved
There was never any place
And you call me up again
You kill me, you build me up but just to watch me break hey hey, hey hey
Who sees you as something more than sexual
They still can't erase you
Yeah, you are beautiful but you don't mean a thing to me
Am I waking up at all today
God can be funny
I'm a singer without a song
And leave me with pennies in my eyes
For every step in any walk
Because we both know
You'll be living
'Cause I'm a bad loser
I want to believe
I live in America with a pair of Payless shoes
I hope you find what you're looking for
And make everybody late
So I look to my Eskimo friend
Well you know that's a lie
But frayed at the ends, he breaks
Falling out my babe
May I say I loved you more
No one's got much to say in this town
Of a sleepless circus promenade 
Sometimes, I can almost feel the power
And then later, when it gets dark
Who's from the future
Oh, I just told the biggest lie
I can feel it falling down
If I was rude
Does he still look just like you
You called me out
So we took the room
It's just to close to the heart
Another walk, another dance with him,
And you were fool enough to love it when he said
Made me feel so glad to be alive
No wonder, it was never plugged in at all
I feel you changing shape"
Well I'm far too old to care about that now
I'm holdin' on your rope, got me ten feet off the ground
Just keeping the peace between these sheets
Songs about memories
All we gotta do's avoid each other
These days we go to waste like wine
How's it going to be, when there is no one there to talk to
This place is gassed by fear
And from the first to all the last times, all the signs
Won't you look down upon me Jesus
He's never coming back
She's all I'm always wanting you
And turn it into something you would miss if
And now the walls are closing in again 
Thought of you as my mountaintop
I left you in the cold until you shook
To our love send a coffin of wood
Leave them to rule in hollow point hell
You can sin or spend the night all alone
Need your light
Totus desiderabilis
And the reasons why
And in a pipe she flies to the motherland
There are beads that wrap
Your love
We were born to die, we were born to die
Falling so far on a silver spoon, making the moon for fun
But you just turned your nose up in the air, oh
You'll be sorry when I'm gone
Lost again, broken and weary
If I don't need you then why am I crying on my bed
And you've got your share of secrets
And they whispered into your brain
If it's the last, if it's the last dance
Somberly, somberly linger lie long early
Voices will slip
I believe in medication 
To fall down at your door
One for the heartbroken lovers
You've always been there, you're always been
"Bobby, don't look back"
drowing in my tears, 
And as I start to leave
With every word that we'd speak
I know exactly how it's gonna end
And my skin is burning from the wind
As hard as you try, no, I will never be knocked down
And you'll see me return
He was bored and tired of my laments
But we don't care do we
Then you wonder why they haven't called
So I said that it was time for a change
They found her in a small grove of trees
If these arms were meant to hold her
Please tell mom, this is not her fault
Give up your heart left broken and let that mistake pass on
This song's your letter
They're playin' some kind of game
I should have forgotten you long ago
I can hear her say I love you like it was yesterday
Let my heart go
I don't want to think about anyone
Well this is torturous electricity
Doing things I wanna do
Oublier ces heures
But it's truly, truly a sin
You got me writing lyrics on postcards
I heard about your regrets
Oh rejoice, your nails all got chewed off
Am I making something worthwhile out of this chase
I go about my business, I'm doin' fine
The sky turns black
Ain't a love that's perfect 
I believed your every word and I guess you did too
That I'm the one who has got your back 
But honestly, won't someone stop this train
But, tonight you're sleeping alone
Don't wanna stop, cause I want you back
That I would be great if I was no longer queen
As if I'm becoming untouchable 
What you lost
You took your life, as lovers often do
I remember how you used to say
It's over now, I'm cold, alone
Sometimes I worry that I've lost the plot
I guess it's time to put the top down
Will she remember my old voice while I fight the tears
Or in a holy wall of fire
No longer needed here so where do we go
And she don't want to go outside tonight
In the wintery grave
And knock me back
This life is not yet over
I sit by myself talking to the moon
Well, there's gonna be a snowstorm
I'm not alone
But I carry you on 
Oh it's so sad
You won't be seeing rainbows anymore
I wince a little, but it's not because I know the truth
But I didn't
I try to just smile
To live the rest of our life
But it doesn't let me run too fast
Now hush little baby, don't you cry
But I can't help the feeling
Instead of a cold goodbye
On the hood of your car
Jumped in the river, what did I see
The genius next door was bussing tables,
When it was dark, I called and you came
Make a property line from the bed
And I just know that she warms my heart
And now my sorrow seems so far away,
Yeah, it can always turn
I want to keep burning
Just to sleep underneath your bed
I've been thinking about you, baby
What a cruel price you thought that you had to pay
Can't wait to see you soar
Stares down at the ground
We'd ever die for these sins
Goodbye sunshine
Old memories
Send photo to address, is it you or me
If your hand's a little cold
Well, what would you say if I said that you could
And once there was a desk
This is fact not fiction for the first time in years
It was never supposed to end up this way
Once the police made you go away
So right,
It's slipping away, there's no tomorrow without you
Who's gonna walk you side by side
Give me a million reasons
And the truth has a habit
In a very sad, sad zoo
Wives and daughters cut and raped
'Cause you got no one to listen, you got no one to call
It's not hard to fall
I'm a mouth that doesn't smile
And I don't know if I could stand another hand upon you
All you did you did with feeling
And out into the morning
My heart has been bruised
No love, there is no love
Stillborn the trust in you 
Let me, let me, let me
'Cause this life is long
And we will never feel again
Lost in their overcoats, waiting for the sunset
And the dregs of my bed
A lock of hair you said would prove
I will leave behind all of my clothes
She lives by disillusion glow
I know it is always been there
For every time he tried to break you down
Long nights allow 
I know that no one
Tryin'a find my place some place, oh I, oh I, oh I
Tried not to move but she was armed
And you never would have thought in the end
Please keep your hands down, and stop raising your voice
What I've always known since the very first day
Blessed in our sin
Listening to her voicemail
To live without despair, and to be without disdain
Burning bright
Thought I'd see you one more time again
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
And I pray in you're the one I build my home with
I could wait with you by the water
Chorus in Sindarin alone
Closing my eyes and you chase my thoughts away
I can't remember why 
I never had the gift of holding on to you
Could you stay, my love
This place is our prison, its cells are the bars
They're explosions in the sky
My hand you took
'Cause I won't be coming back
And the moon is shining bright
And just say the things I'll probably never get a chance to say
Calm these hands before they
I'm holding on your rope
And I'm tired of being last to know
Clothes of sand have covered yor face
Of the days so young and sweet,
Together we cry, cry
Let me be with you tonight
Hide inside me tonight
Lying in my plastic bed
Guess I don't wanna die
Waiting on a brand new day
And the fire that was starting to spark
Slapback kills the ancient remnants
And I will give you what you need
Damn their lies
One day goodbye will be farewell
I could have died right there
And they tell her not to say a thing
Barely see my breath, surrounded
A safer car, baby smiling in backseat
That�s the piece you keep when you say goodbye
I'm sorry, could you repeat what you just said
But we're all right
But why must truth always make me die
Hopelessly drift in the eyes of the ghost again
Four months at sea
And she listens like her head's on fire
If I could go back,
Seasick yet still docked
Sad eyes, baby
Scraping the paint off the hardwood floors
While I'm stumbling home as drunk as I
I don't want to be old and sleep alone
Well you don't mind me being headstrong
Hear the nighthawk cry
She didn't know what to throw away, and what to keep
But you're already somebody's baby
Wanna die, wanna die, I wanna die, wanna die
Here, here now, don't cry
Und jetzt wird es still um uns
He's still up on that hill
All alone in my car
Everybody got to have a home
Sometimes I walk around town looking at faces
I was bruised and battered, I couldn't tell what I felt
Lookin' puzzled, in a daze, I know it's confusin' you
Suddenly everything has changed
And now you're standing bare in my doorway
And still I find myself outside
Dear my love, haven't you wanted to be with me
Shadows on the hills
I want to give you whatever you need
I miss sleep
At Christmas time with your family here
And when things have changed
Dark little heaven at the top of the stairs
Until the end of time
You ran me all around
In the morning I'll call you
Come on baby, now throw me a right to the chin
Here on neutral ground
These colors will not change, you change the way I see them
So I can see my baby when I leave this world
Then I'd run over to your house
The needle tears a hole, the old familiar sting
Think I'll get a lover
And even if I need you
Spending all your time
And that God never blessed her insides
Through the tears and the laughter
Like I used to watch you sleep
Like a house made from spider webs and the clouds rolling in
Nobody's listening 
You're not coming home tonight
Now I'm a policeman directing traffic
Take a piece of the sunshine with me
You'e not the only one to blame
Just break me to small parts
All the everything you win
But if by chance you're here alone
But from dusk till dawn
My selfworth measured in text back tempo
I'm not coming home now
And there's not a word that I comprehend
And you'd take care of me
In a minute, sometime soon, maybe next time, make it June
Ich werde in die Tannen gehen
Now I wander around, feeling down and cold
With her army complete
Don't look back 'cause I am crying
It makes no difference to me
Dry your eye
While you dance to 'Purple Rain'
Love, it taught me to cry
But I can't stay this time 'cause I don't love you anymore
And something's gotta change
Rich man in a poor man's clothes
And if you happen to you wake completely lost
We are screaming inside, but we can't be heard
They shot an arrow at your head
Although my heart is breaking
He had to leave though I begged him to stay
You've got me down on my knees and I proclaim
And I feel you
To the one thing that I need to walk away from
For a little while, so did I
I'm just a person on my own
I just want to love you when the day is done
Running all the red lights
Your eyes are fighting sleep while your mouth makes your demands
Yeah, the truth is that I miss you so
I am a growing force you kept in place
Next door yelling cries mercy she is begging please
Tell me why I can't be there where you are
I ran with my heart pounding down that broken path
Try this figure out memorize their words for hope
But you won't stop crying
I refuse to let you die
Won't you take me by the hand
This time to face the day
To separate you from everything I do
Love me 'til the walls cave in, yeah
A sick shouting like you hear at the fairground
I suck my tongue
Holding it up behind my head again
My hearts a tiny blood clot
Oh, my savior and my sin
Living in the shadows of your song
Say something
You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand
So I tried to intrude through the little holes in your veins
When you gonna love you as much as I do
I know how I lost a friend
Burning in my eyes to blind 
I lost my job, I lost my wife
These days I seem to think a lot
I never thought I would just
IIIII don't think you can save me
And pray you never feel this same kind of remorse
Everytime I walked away
But you can't take your eyes off her, get another cup of java
There are no words to describe it
Come Armageddon, come
It feels like standing still but I know
And those whose names were never called
This is the coastal town,
Stay a while, my baby wants me to
I wish that this weather would never leave
You're the train that crashed my heart
You can read me anything
When you look inside, all you'll see
Such a funny thought to wrap you up in cloth
Our coats aren't in disguise
Rejoice although this world will devastate you
Larry tap let you in through the back 
I no longer hear the music
Picture, picture, smile for the picture
And now her daughter cries
Would leave you alone
And how can I hurt you,
Just have to move the bats out of your head
We'd share each other like an island
But I've never known a winter so cold
They say a few drinks will help me to forget her
So how does this make you feel
For the rest of your life when you're ready
Will all be lost in time
Brought back something,
Wenn sie dir nicht gefallen, stör dich nicht weiter dran
Lili, you know there's still a place for people like us
Fill it to the top, fill it to the top, fill it to the top
Will you sleep tonight or will you think of me
Raised in a wild space
I need you so much closer
And met Dr Dre and flew you and mama out to see me
I'll be strong, but whatever you do
He said 'I bought it for you because I love you
Desert wind and a perverse desire to win
Isn't everything wonderful
Maybe 'cause we spent so much time
And the world she is tough
All my eyes can see is all I know;
The heart wants what it wants
And all I've got is your hand
I've been wanting to do anything for a long time
But I can't breathe
Keep singing
But I guess it's the soonest
Although the summer's past, those mythic dreams would never last
Separate lives
In a life that you hate
I am not for you one
Don't let me darken your door
Disappointed and passed over
As I walk out the door
I dreamed just last night
And I'll know that my life was good
Talking it out the last hour
Will not cry in public, less chance of illness
But she'll never change her ways
Our clocks are ticking now so before our time is gone
And at sweet night, you are my own
Not anymore, I've gone away
When I go to bed
And the night, the night is yours alone
Never got the chance to go that far Never got the chance
Cold water, cleaning my wounds
And with my Xray eyes I strip you naked
Let me try and pull out my pride
My girlfriend's pregnant too, I'm 'bout to be a father
Never to come out
We waited and I guess we're getting older 
You keep on building the lie
Disappeared without a trace
So much to love, so much to learn
To fight the feeling that is growing in my mind
Because of you
For the kiss, kiss
Just savour every mouthful
Into the darkness passing over the faces in the river
Don't you know you can't leave his control
Could I speak any plainer I need you here 
'Cause your hands and lips still know their way around
All the time now from you people
Take a breath, I pull myself together
Tryin' to pull her close out of bare desperation
Was I too young to see this with my eyes
Sleep may be the enemy
Flowers grow through my window and I love you again
New words for old desires
It's like a lie I told a thousand times
In a dark room we fight, make up for our love
And I accept and I collect upon my body
"Daddy it's me, help mommy, her wrists are bleeding,"
'Cause it's been forty years or more, now, Martha, please recall
Grass looks much greener, but it's greenpainted cement
All the cards begin to stack up,
And I will always remember you
Still falling
I can't believe what I cannot see
Then I got dressed
And he listened obediently
In the pictures
For the windless breezes
Eighteen blue, twentyone gray
I used to believe love conquers all
Yeah, I've gone mad
Baby, we can talk all night
I wanna feel with the seasons
For there's many more tears on the sunrise
I know you'll have the heart
Stained 'soul mates' forever now
Yes, she caught my eye as I walked on by
And then you woke up at the bottom by the drain
His dad looked down and smiled, said we can't leave her behind
And you feel just like Cagney, she looks like Rita Hayworth
You've eaten something minty
Can you stay strong
"You're safe, child, you are"
Breathe Eve, save that one
Now I have nothing that I can keep
And here I am left in silence
Skating around the truth, who I am
You made one last stop at the store
Look, all I know is that you're the nicest thing I've ever seen
Take me by the hand
Don't go hiding, hiding, hiding in the shade
I won't fall behind
Driving alone, finally on my way home to the comfort of my bed
Been there done that
And then the guns rang one last shot 
Making out with people I hardly know or like
Sweet deceit comes callin'
You don't want to mess with this honey
Straight to the back of my skull
That I would be good, even if I was clingy
I'm with you, I'm with you, yeah yeah
How could I let you play me, I don't even know
She said "I'm sorry, son, but no one by that name lives here anymore"
But you are not permitted to leave 
You're the prayer inside me
Promise you'll stay with me
And as you move on, remember me
I can picture your face well from the bar in my hotel
Even if I cried alone
Sweetheart, I'll wait for you
I won't break your heart
He grabs her by the hair, he strokes her on the cheek
I've spent an hour with you, should I want anything else
Pale green things, pale green things
Because there's been a great deal of discussion, yes,
If you feel discouraged when there's a lack of color here
Hold me like you'll never let me go
From then on it was cold Campbell's from the can
Cops were running around the scene
And I got spun
So she sat in the corner of the room do be do be do do,
And I'm sorry if I dissed you
And I'm too afraid, much too afraid to fall for anything
My vision's getting clearer
It's just after pm, I see kids leaving school
And become a man when you handle your own
Is leaving Sacrificed most of our lives
Are you scared to death to live
We share the sadness
Oh, this world may lack style, I know
Down by the people if they let you breathe
Turning and turning but never returning to what you once had
How do I say goodbye
Couldn't see that I was blind
Give me all of your dreams
Nothing to do but keep sleeping longer
Say 'Sorry, babe, I had to meet a mate'
I step up the pace
I have a lot to think about
Falling on the floor
So now I'm taking back my words
Oh a beautiful world
Nor lay my face to the soil, nor my teeth to the sand
Drink up, baby, stay up all night
There is nothing I know except that this lifetime is one moment
Run with the wild horses
He'd tell of places you have been
While they are in each other's arms"
It looks like an early winter
Chafing mine eyes
Did you stop at any time
With our eyes
Unill the break of day
Stood on a bridge
Oh she just couldn't believe it 
Do we run
Sick of all these wasted years
You should be the one I'll always love
His light went out
What a mess I've made
With the last breath of my
Great story of
Before I would get burned
Oh heart, don't break the promise
I can watch the countryside and I can fall asleep
And your arms around me
"Take me again," she said, thinking of him
Do I know what you are feeling
And wishes on eyelashes fail
But I can still feel you here
Yeah, things could be so much worse
If I could just speak up I think I would say 
Should've done something 
So dry your eyes
And for the first time I've opened up my eyes
I was not honest
With me at your side
With all the memories that I got
Said, "Pity please the ones who serve,
'Cause it's always raining in my head
And just to lay inside you, and just to know this feeling
I'm gonna buy a gun
To sleep at night
With every passing day
And all around the air did say
"Wake up, paul," whisper clouds rolling by and the seeds
Smile down on us, sun
We're not the only ones
You have gone so far 
Well, all I ever did was look up to you
The streets are empty
'Cause she spread her love
But not all things will pass away
There's nothing I wouldn't do to have just one more chance
You come to me with your hair curled tight
And so tomorrow there will be another number
Hard as hell just to comprehend, ya
My back is turned on you
I will roam lost but never alone, hide with me, hide with me
What a fool I've been
"Loves golden arrow
They kick the chair but we, we helped tie the rope
I hurt myself today
Do I care anymore
We will haunt you when you laugh
And if I have been unkind
Oh, my darling; oh, my baby, yeah
Make sure I know who's taking you home
You looked behind you to smile back at me
Someone found and gave away
You'll fake it if you have to and you'll show up for work with a smile
Or anything
All the words that I said that I wouldn't say
You thought you'd found her but she knew you all along
And make everything be wonderful again
The hurt's relentless
He says help me out, hell is coming
I still taste its kiss
And ask my girl to dance
Just promise me, you'll always be a friend
In bed I was half dead
I run off where the drifts get deeper
Thought of you as everything
So we raided their liquor stash and walked down to the riverside
Everything turns to shit
Black hair, like an electric space
The men in black ties arrive at the house in surprise
We can pretend nothing's changed
So I'll file away all my dreams
When you walk away is when we really play
God damn, God damn
Come again just to start afresh and
All the pretty faces and sorry words
Yes, I feel too young to hold on
I hope that I have a place in your heart too
And now spikes will keep on falling from the heavens to the floor
That when she pulls me by the hair
Missing all the cracks in the pavement
In the blackest of rooms
When everyone would offer up a hand
I only wish that I had been prepared
It's coming on Christmas, they're cutting down trees
No, I can't forget this evening
The sounds of the city sifting through trees
I thought this love would last forever
'Cause I haven't tried as hard as I should
Everyday you find new ways to hurt me
Though my love wants to relieve her
Is just hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
As it was withering
And said what's that sorrow you bear and I could tell him he understood
Through all my lonely fears, no tears
Spread your wings to the wind
But no one cares
I been working on my backwards walk
And the silence of our words
Open heart, open heart, it should be illegal to deceive a woman's heart
Rocking back and forth
He accepts it's his fate
But please return, return
In my steamer trunk
Now that you're big enough to run your own show
Jackie ooh,
With my wide eyes, I've seen worlds that don't belong
To kick your heart around
Repress and restrain
A note that says, "I'm sorry everyone
Unbreak my
The people never change
If I gots to play I'ma play till I win
They've hosed you down, you're good as new
I guess he wanted to kill himself
Can't say much of anything that's new
There's nothing left to lose
And coming up only to show you're wrong
Cover me in rag and bone sympathy
Silly errs postponing your despair 
you're not going to come back 
For love that cannot live yet never dies
From the hotel where he calls 
And this life and work
When I am falling
In things that are ephemeral
I should have looked again,
'Cause we both know what it's like to be alone 
I never thought I'd
I'm tired and I, I want to go to bed
Son, you'd better wait to fall
And now it's happening in mine
Because you instantly felt warm
I unwrapped your present underneath your feet
Forgive me, I'm trying to find
My feet are gold My heart is white
What am I gonna do when I run out of shirts to fold
And do I really have a song that I can ride on
But what can I say now
When you and mom decided nothing could be saved inside this house
And I won't feel like this forever
Don't you think we oughta know by now
And they're letting me go home
It's not right
And nothing's ever easy, that's what they say;
Now that everyone's an enemy
So, you're leaving, aren't you
If Heaven's really coming back
The buildings aside
When my life went pear
Anything you want it can be done
I�m ahead of the curve
If I could start again, a million miles away
What I said was not a joke,
That it was wrong or it was right
For me to say or her to second guess
I can't believe you actually picked me
Now tears allowed,
And when will I meet my end
Put it up too much to call home sometimes
I can still hear it all of the time
After plaid shirt days
Fond farewell to a friend
Crawl across toward your window
And I'll keep up with our old friends
Got my balls, my wheels push people
I still dream dream dream
I tried, to run away but your eyes
I wish I could say to you
Oh, William, William it was really nothing
To the long, winding road
My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I
Ohoh try, try, try
I'm feeling my way through the dark
You cannot hide the way you feel inside I realize
But I can't find your clamshells
You'll break instead
Es war ein Stück vom Himmel
But now you're lit up by the city
You touched these tired eyes of mine
I didn't mean to hurt you
"When you gonna make up your mind
Go or go ahead and just try me
A child
Unbreak my heart, sweet darlin'
Everything that I do
And took Poor Edward to Hell
Do you remember staring up at the stars
Comprende mis white lines
If you were thinking that the worst is yet to come
Every time we've no control
Go where you are little pond
Will bring life into my deepest hopes, what's your fantasy
Goodbye to evening parties
Wrap them around, every fucking thing
That today I belong right here with you
We had new inventions had new inventions
I keep on looking through the window again
It steers the whole ship
Didn't care as long as he was able,
But years take their toll
Oh, can't anybody see
We're out of time and I can't breathe
I love you mom
Well, Jesus Christ, I'm not scared to die
The God of Wine comes crashing
So many things
Woke up and climbed from the suicide machine
One smile and I'm ready to die
You will always listen as I pray
'Cause I could be the one
And I must of said the the right things
You always find the words to say to keep me right here waiting
Just the sweet pain of watching your back as you walk
Well I move all directions, to the corners and the outskirts
She waits for me
The wild wives of unknown men
I swear that I can go on forever again
Well, darling you may do your worst
That try to hold on
They don't know I used to sail the deep and tranquil sea
Will end the story of a soldier in the dark
But I sing glory from my lowest
You are mine
Thousand times
I thought that maybe I could find myself
And it burns a hole 
And I can feel your light, stay with me tonight
When it hurts so bad, sometimes
Love was always cruel
Or what I'm supposed to say but
And all these places we went to see sights just gave them excuses into the game
And spaceboy, they'll kill me
You're not sorry, no, no, no, no
Are waving goodbye
I finally got my orders
Go on and try to tear me down
I've been your friend for many years
Everything inside of my head
The future's miles away
What we need
Right now, I wish I could hear you say
And I can't, I can't hold on for too long
Options change
They're taking her children away
The harder I push the further I fall
Alright, alright
I gotta get you back today
'Cause nothing compares
You turn in pain
And when you kiss me
You're talking to her now
Because it seems that it's always changing
Well we'll all come back
How can I have feelings when my feelings have always been denied
It's time you told your story
And dry my lips no words could make
So tonight to compensate I will
I roll over in bed looking for someone to touch
"Put your hands in the sky
The drying of your tears
Nothing much to speak of but a rough diamond
Do you read what they're saying about you
And to think
Beyond the moment that ends our bondage
It's called breakup
Until its silence burns you
Wont you come home
And what have you done
She slips off into a dream
Out those sliding doors
Trumpedup excuses as he told mom
Leave something to remember, so they won't forget
The summer's gone, so are we
Take me, make me, you know that I'll always be in love
You neglect your wings like you don't need them
Searching for some trouble
Did it happen when we first kissed
She keeps repeating "I bet she needed"
S'efface de mon souvenir
He's gone so far to find no hope
I'm still an asshole playing with candles
Where once there was only a girl
No gloves
I can't forget that you once were mine
She loved me and I did too
Till the pain is so big you feel nothing at all
That these feelings won't go away
And one horrible thing I saw 
So you say what you want maybe I didn't get my way
Go wait in the car
You got wires coming out of your skin
And there's still a hole where the phone was thrown
So I think it's time, for us, to have a toast
Gray would be the color if I had a heart
It's the loudest sound I ever heard
I would have told her then, she was the only thing
Surrounded by so many things 
Sweetheart, I'll wait for you
I didn't know what I was doing
But just a cloud that lives inside of me
'Cause I miss your hands I miss your face
I know it's been a while but I can see you clear as day
Never meant to say anything
Ease his worried mind
You think one drink
And it must just be the kids
He talked about you, Mary, and how much we loved you still
But tonight I just wanna stay in
Mama cut out pictures of houses for years
Two hands longing for each others warmth
You were the first to say that we were not okay
"You will always be a loser
Down to earth then sinks the sun
All my dreams, it suddenly seems, it suddenly seems
In hot cream, in sweet moans
Oh all the times I've tasted love
I said, "You don't need my voice, girl, you have your own,"
But still your love was true
i think that one time i was unfaithful 
Cheap sex and sad films
So before I end my day Remember
Tell her that we love her
Puffs away, and winter comes
When you leave don't say
And your sheepskinlined coat is eluding me still
Cause you got me
The maestro says it's Mozart
And sometimes I just ain't in the mood
I didn't want to go to bed and I didn't want to stay up late
The fool who wastes his life, God rest his guts
And you don't need to bother
I'm gonna miss the birds
That river's flowing
But then you open your eyes
A bag over his face
I'll fall asleep tonight
About reasons why you don't wanna talk
Not thinking
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry
Tell me you love me Can't go on, ooh
And I scream as loud as anyone,
With a smile on her face
Just keeping the peace, just keeping the peace
How can you stop the rain from falling down
Your face it's all wet
It's not a habit, it's cool, I feel alive
Out on the road
Teignmouth 
Don't waste your time on me 
'Cause it's time that will tell if it's heaven if it's hell or if it's,
We'll die inside this salted earth together
To hold on to these moments as they pass
Digging in caves to find the treasures of the land
So much for the afterglow
Burn up the pain, my thoughts are strange
A little girl came through the front gate, holdin' a fishin' pole
Noone loves you
I can still see all your clothes thrown on the floor
I got nothing left inside
Ready to become
Ocean, swallow me now
We're left as shells, we lost the fight 
I stood in front of her face
Yes, all you have to do is cry 
To hum through the hours of dying
With the words you've borrowed
And sleep the rest of the day
I am so gone, so tell me the way home
While this town is busy sleeping
Shows that we ain't gonna stand shit
Every time the day darkens down and goes away pictures open in my head of me and you
And I know what is right
And each time I feel like this inside
Did I say that I want to
I yearn to say good bye
It's the disease that we crave
Her life was stole Stole, stole
They cut through bone
Never thought I'd have to retire Never thought I'd have to abstain
And if my wife took a bicycle ride
So I won't hear a thing
Sleeping dog beside you
No you better stay away from this
But I want you to know that I need you right now
Well, I pictured somebody else
Final breath
Tell me, who are you this time
Like sisters, blanket, blanket girls, 
Don't let yourself go
You always said destiny
When his dreams are running wild
When living ain't easy
Whatever words I say, I will always love you
Flowers competing for the sun
My heart, my heart
I think that I'm just tired
I love the tone that's in your laugh
Then in the evenings looking at stars
And I knew for sure I was loved
Sound of failure calls her name, she's decided to hear it out
I remember the bells, the flowers
And I will pretend
Gray light, new day leaks through the window
I throw some clothes on in the dark
As the hunger pains grow inside
You been puttin' up with my shit just way too long
In hand a single rose
And in her eyes you see nothing
Angels have no thought of
And he wish he'd had a mirror; looked a little clearer
Just one kiss and I'm alive
Don't you dare ask why
They've been looking around
It floods the sky and blurs the darkness like a chandelier
Hand in hand, I'll show you the way
All of your lives unled, reading in bed
I'm gonna find you and never run again
But I'm thinking of what Sarah said
You know I never would have run away from my home
How can you love me if you don't love yourself I love you I love you
It's funny I know
Let's go for a drive and see the town tonight
Love is just a piece of time
Bury me under ice
If you let me have my way, I swear I'll tear you apart
Fading everything to black and blue
The grass grew high, I laid down
I'd say she was his sister but she doesn't have his nose
You don't have to love me, all the time
Our friends speak out in our defense
Now don't you believe in a love that's worth a fight
I told you everything I possibly can
Walked me up a story, asking how you are
You spend half of your life trying to fall behind
If these walls could talk they would have so much to say
Oh the person
My little hawk, why do you cry
I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
But Jack comes tumbling after
And all the memories of the pubs, and the clubs, and the drugs, and the tubs
So we can stay like this forever Sun poisoned
More hearts bein' broken, more people being used
Tight side by side
Awkward silence is on the other end
What country shall I say is calling from across the world
The words we spoke on freezing South street,
Your words just disappear
You promised you would be there when I go
Cause everyone I know just keeps calling me
I am small and the world is big 
Did you think I could hurt you
They breathed fresh air once, a long time a long time ago
Rudder's like a ship without a rudder's like a ship without a rudder
Do you care enough to see 
And sometimes I find I catch myself letting you back in
That's not what I believe, and it doesn't matter anyway
I killed a man of mine
In the shadows the name is unknown to me
People die, but real love is forever
Brother, put your needles down 
Some guys were puttin' him down
Steal all my children if I don't pay the ransom
Breaking apart like I'm made up of glass again
Always for you, and
So you say the present's just a pleasant interruption to the past 
And look to the corner think about me
Sun has gotta rise
Waiting for my phone to ring
When time stood still and I had you
Your grand dad left home for the circus
Of my life
When everyone else was having good luck
A life of barely breathing as she walked out of this place
And hold you like I used to
How can I go forward when I don't know which way I'm facing
But that's just bullshit
See, the sea wants to take me
My calling, I'm calling at night
Now nothing
Your voice is soft like summer rain
Oh, you are not useless, we are just
I looked at you and I
You will always be a loser now
Almost lovers always do
You were like home to me
Maybe I need fantasy
Take heart, sweetheart, or I will take it from you
I come clean out of love with my lover
A hole from which to see your head, 
And I said, "How about them engine breaks
'Cause I've got a plan
We've been through fakeabreakdown
She hangs her head and cries in my shirt
Send falling stars that seem to cry
Baby, I find it hard to breath
By blood and by me, I follow your lead
I don't want you to hate;
When my dad died the worms ate out both his eyes
But something kept me standing by that hospital bed
To relive time in his mind
But gravity always wins
I hand you my mortal life, but will it be forever
I know another moment will break my heart
In my sick way I want to thank you for holding my head up late at night
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
Life carries on in the people I meet
And do I really have a hand in my forgetting
Coming for to carry me home
Wake up lying in a patch of four leaf clover 
Because the man wasn't good he was great
In your confirmation dress
"I followed you daddy, you told me that you weren't leavin'
If only I could walk through the wall
The memories of your devotion, ooh
We can't get back again
When I'm faced with the knowledge
When it whirls, when it twirls two little beautiful girls
What you think it is
I won't let you close enough to hurt me, no
'Cause you're not right within
And the traffic stops for miles
Before I'm dead and gone
I really feel
But I'm not alive until you call
We talked all night
His eyes are burning
Heard your name the other day, it's been a long, long time
I forgot fools run
Well, the trees grow
I know nobody else who can laugh along to any kind of joke
The winds been humming on it all day
I like the shit you did with Rawkus too; that shit was phat
I hate to feel the love between us die
Running in circles
And on the surface of the waters
You may change your mind
Bigger, stronger, drive a faster car
Oh, I will stand arms outstretched, pretend I'm free to roam
Everything but suicide
Jackie oohoohooh
Tables and chairs worn by all of the dust
I have some pictures, the wild might be the deuce
Try to justify the things I used to do
'Cause you're the one
Friends
And she's thanking her mother sea
The world was younger than today
There were times I never really knew how to feel
And I feel, all this pain
All that I have is on the floor
And there was hope in me that I could take you there 
To help you see beyond the gray sky
Carry a torch for days,
I hope that you don't laugh
I pretend to cry
But I don't really mind, I've got much more than that
Your eyes set on the ether
I'm barely making sense
Hasn't anybody told you
The way they show they care
On a day like today
I know that the clubs are weapons of war 
I dream of another you
Because of you 
We made love on the living room floor
Feel as low as you feel right now
I didn't lose my mind it was
Words are spoken
And the fur and the mouth and the innocence turned
Hoping you would care
When I had you there, but then I let you go
All we got left's right here
So you walk that way, I'll walk this way
And the mind games
Don't wanna look this dead, don't wanna feel this dread
And it only feels worse when I stay in one place
Why the tears
Of course I see you, I do
Oh, you'll be the end of me
Oh, James, you broke me, I thought I knew you well
Endless talking
All the change in my life just fell away
Who am I to say this situation isn't great 
All my blood for the sweetness of her laughter
But it's time I gotta say goodbye
Don't you wish that life could be as simple
Honey kisses clouds of fluff
I just want someone to walk in front
No, you're not the good kind
And the bathroom's still a mess
Every look that you threw told me so
But now the sun shines cold
You'll never return to this place
I've just been cutting onions
I can change your mind turn it all around
I can't even breathe
Ran my whole life in the ground
The holy dark was moving too
But I won't lose no sleep on that
Sing me a love song
And there's nothing I can do
With all I ever wanted, it comes with a price
Cause I bet Brenda doesn't even know
We couldn't break from the concrete 
When she thought up that I should be with you
With the wordly goods you stashed away
In the caves all cats are grey, in the caves the texture coats my skin
Everything will be explained
And how you held me in your arms that September night
It's always been up to you
But now you're saying "hey, let's think this over"
As fish swimming round in a barrel when you've got the gun
I can feel death, can see its beady eyes
Nothing seems to show
All hungryeyed and weatherstained
But I would never want to come between us two
Your cry for inspiration
From my window 
So I can feel you in my arms
As I opened up the door, she said
I hear Kate Moss talk
To that coffin you call your apartment
Can't think, can't sleep
Without a single word
Don't leave home again
If you could fly, then you'd feel south
You must not fear
But something about it felt like home somehow
So shut your mouth
For my bones have found a place to lie down and sleep
You can hold on but I wouldn't waste your time
Now the rain is just
These days are so much colder
My story has been told 
Rocking chair
Four score years, living down in this rainswept town
I don't need an education,
I was hunted down by hounds
And no matter what they knew
Lonely and so untrue
I didn't mean to waste your time 
Take my hand, stay Joanne
Now I'm thinking back to what I said before
The silver thorn of bloody rose
That you touched me before
You walked around
I'm not feelin' up to it now
And here in the sky
Together we always pull through
Desperately remained at home
You are the maid for me
Who makes you feel that this life is a life
Somewhere along the line, I must've gone off track with you
Out in the city, in the cold world outside
And holds you
With you I saw fun and expansion
I don't want you thinkin' that I don't get asked to dinner
You're gone and I can tell
Oh, he surely must be happy with everything he's got
'Cause now I see I'll never stop this train
Me and my broken heart, yeah
So tell me you love me
There will be times
And you'll remember the guy who said all those big words
She's got a baby
Can't hide the past
I said, "You haven't met me, I am the only son"
Hey this kind of trouble's only just begun
Our very favourite fearscape
"Sweetie, the moon has raped me 
Somebody tell me why I'm on my own
Let me run
What about the sweetness we knew
What did I do wrong
I had not forgotten them
But some are altogether mighty
Some wouldn't even bother and then you came around
Of my world, yeah
But when you said that I wasn't worth talking to
But I can't bear to listen to ya cry
Elvis never could carry a tune
Work each day, all for nothing at all, at all
Will shrink you till you're underground
It always seems like you're going somewhere
Flirting with the flicks; you say it's just for kicks
I'm gonna put it six feet underground
I've got two little arms to hold on tight and I want to take you higher
I'm feeling like I'm famous
And I'd wager all, the hazards of love, the hazards of love
If you're trying to find pity well you need to look somewhere else
When time stood still
Had no one never
You are unfixable
So tell me when you hear my heart stop
The time I waste just to say goodbye 
Your cardinal eyes
While you still have control of the flame
A final sleep
And her cunning mate began to sing
You're the magic that holds the sky up from the ground
On my face
So rather than hold on to a broken dream
Spinnin' in the night sky
What it meant to give everything up
Wake up in the morning, stumble on my life
With the noise in the background from a televised war
Maybe I'm foolishly overreacting
And would you take away my hopes and dreams
A silent kid is looking down the barrel
I've watched you sleeping for a while
Me to feel I'm falling
Been dreaming of this, so long
She says she's right here, she seems so distant
Can you listen I am on your side
Don't tell me tell me 'cause it hurts
I know what you're thinking
I've been sitting for too long
As you lay down on your side
If you'd never left these streets
You told me none of that was real
This will make you love again
But it don't matter 'cause
So I lifted my gun
And shut your mouth
I just need to lie down
Don't you know she's got a
Be president
I promise one day I'll come back to you
Someone choose
I must have called a thousand times
Now you've got me right where you want me
Waiting to be asked to come inside
I told myself I won't miss you
When they told me that there was no saving you
Our last dance together
It's no fun to be the man
Why you gotta be mean
Inventing lovers on the phone
When the part is through
Let me back
I don't have much in my life
She waits all night for him to call
And I remember the truth
Where the bones'll show through
In circles, circles
Your devils and your gods, all the living and the dead
You'll close your eyes and see me
On the inside of love
forgetting because 
Let me feel you moving like they do in Babylon
And I thought that bein' strong meant never losin' your selfcontrol
i always knew it was better 
Dr Jekyll is wrestlin' Hyde for my pride
Pick up the phone
Could tell each other everything
Yeah, anything to make you smile
Fireburned and blew out flowers
It was just my old memory of how much I care
O my love
A time for us and the words we'll never know
They'll tell me that you're mine
What has happened to love	
Got to head back east and want to leave tonight
I cry, "Oh"
I've found I always move too slowly
I only wish you weren't my friend
Don't let me get carried away
'Cause I need it right now
I feel as if I'm wastin'
I have no reason why it should've been so plain
But you won't stop crying
And look no further for happiness
Some things always stay the same
Watching an old fight film last night
i don't know how to prepare coffee 
Even though she doesn't want me around
Yanked by my wrists to the sugarfront courtyard
And your knives and clothing too
Don't you dare
We'll wrap the world around it
Oh, my babe, at least we tried, oh
And the machine is bleeding to death
Sometimes I'm not sure what I'm gonna do but I ain't here for more
When I'm workin', yeah I know I'm gonna be
Strong as I feel It meant the world to hold a bruising faith
If you want to know what makes me sad
Is there sunlight on your bed
He used to call me DN
Even I realise I'm here am I just wasting away
'Cause I'm not big enough to house this crowd
I may not say the words as such
You've got one hour
And we are, we are
It's still not real
You should close your fly
I think I found a place
I've seen what I was and I know what I'll be
These are the contents of my head
But maybe I'm just too young to keep good love
The rainy roads of our old town
Secret songs that you keep wrapped in boxes so tight
Aufnehmen Wen
Clutches of sad remains
Keep this scene inside your head
Always be careful
Lucky stars
Baby cut me all to pieces
'Cause we're off limits during this transition
So I never went back
Breathe it in and breathe it out
If I walk away from you
When you walked out of my life
And everything's reminding me of you
No one can lift the damn thing
The quiet corners off this town, and I
And you were gazing at the sky
And come up with poetic lines
Take anybody that you want as, long as she don't go
First my left foot then my right behind the other
That they think I'm immune to the pain
Hey now, comb your hair and off to work
Got a taste of you, threw up all night
Life carries on and on, and on, and on
He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
To be acknowledge by some touch from his gnarled hands
So now she's run off with my car
You swallow me
You and me, Bess, we was as thick as thieves
If I had a dime for every hand thrown up in the air
I said, "Baby, you're not lost"
In strange ideas, in stranger times
The shape of her horizon
I wanna open up my heart
Take me home, tuck me in
And from two suns spinning
Kristy, are you doing okay
But man I feel silly in that dim light
Look at him working
Sometimes I wonder how I will stay strong
Take my pain away
Oh kiss me and smile for me
Down the stairs, I was there
You would have taken it back
You are the smell before rain
I was held in chains but now I'm free
I think that's for the best
And from the first, to the last time, the signs
She's still here when everyone's gone
So let me go out there
Let's stay up late and smoke a jay
Hopeful for awhile
The DJ was the last to leave
You can't remember, you try to feel the beattttttt
Passing by with every exit sign
Strange infatuation seems to grace the evening tide
I could love, in this dying world
And I will drink myself to
Cut out all the ropes and let me fall
I still need you
Investments and dealers
For this heart's a little bit colder
But you still have all of me
We'll be here forever
Give it all away, to have someone to come home to 
Peel off all those eyes
And I am true to my heart now
I sent this bitch a picture of my dick
You'll start to wonder
But deep within the corners of my mind
There's one thing causing you trouble
There's still a few holes that let in a little rain
You told me you loved me, so why did you go away
I smile as it burns
Tonight, when I came home from work, hurt
It's not the end 
With a book in my hand
And it's your final last call 
Well I gonna call my home
And something slow
I'll make sure I'll look
I won't always live not stopping
Some say that time changes,
Well that's just fine; that's just one of my names
And how we're guiltstricken sobbin' with our heads on the floor
But I guess that's love I can't pretend
But you didn't find anything to read
You burn down the trees
Everlasting like the sun
I haven't made half the mistakes that you've listed so far
�Cause I can't get you back, can't get a second chance
But mum, there's a tear every time that I blink
And it all became the world we know
And Morgan says
Don't you think it's quiet around here
Can't help looking back
Only in hopes of dreaming
You look like a perfect fit
A tear comes to his eye
And now, miss Susan A, you're losing every opportunity
I stopped my rambling
What is it you need
Unbreak my heart, my heart
Why do things have to change
She said she'd like to meet a boy who looks like Elvis
You take me out shopping and all we'd buy is trainers
And I'm wastin' everyday
Now you are gone eternally
Pray for tomorrow, but for today
I keep on singing, your eyes they just roll
We don't see eye to eye, or hear ear to ear
She parks her car outside of my house and takes her clothes off
So I put my hands up; I say, "Enough is enough
And if you call for me, you know I'll run
I am better where you are
Round here, she's always on my mind
You looked happy, and that's great
She wraps her fingers 'round mine with the softness she's blessed with
And lonely just to watch you go
Just after doing you by the sight of My Kodak delights
I move in water, shore to shore
Here comes ya ex
In a way you could say, I was always a cynic
You've been looking for someone to believe in
I hope it's worth all the wait
So wait for me
But they won't show
Two to one
Won't feel you anymore 
I'll hold up high a mirror
They said start as you mean to go on
And no one likes to be alone
When I was a baby
I'm still breathing
Got a crazy sensation, go or stay now I gotta choose
You're protected from trouble and pain
Forgive me, Hera, I cannot stay,
Like a little clock that trembles on the edge of the hour
I need a raincoat,
If you don't have it you're on the other side
Praise to the glory of loved ones now gone
To be honest, I really don't care
Just in case he didn't want to go with her
Because if you got him back, I would get back the friend that I once knew
Friends go floating gently by
I love you more than I have
Nothing to embrace
And I know in the cold light
Revealed in the sky, to leave all behind
I even learned how to use the washin' machine
Young men standing on the top of their own graves
You can laugh
No more trying, oh oh yeah
Bedshaped
She was left alone
Whatever you're doing now would probably suit me fine
You didn't know him at all
Who tell their families that they're sorry
I wear my garment so it shows
And how lips tasting of tears
For today is a new day 
All the truth that I needed
He made what became the world we know
All ambition 
Me and my heart
Wipe the spots off of the mirror
But I'm nothing so good, no I'm nothing
Can't help but think of 
Ain't nothing I can do
They do right now
Noone told us about the laws of the land
To prove you still feel  
I'm waiting, I'm waiting for you
Jasmine, I saw you peeping
The world is just illusion, trying to change you
I'd always hoped for better
I need answers for what all the waiting I've done means means
Full of broken thoughts
Holding my breath for the fear of sleep again
But that's not the shape of my heart
To dry her eyes, broken inside
This is God pissing down on you
In one of your lies
We are the walking dead, we hold this ghost in our arms
If this is the last dance, this is the last dance
My hate
Came 'round the corner at a rate
That stole my broken soul
Makes no sense at all
Tired of dreaming of rest
Well, winter's gonna end,
You're still alive Delilah 
Back through lamplit streets and dew
You got your heart right
Without my wings, I feel so small 
Selfhurt, plastics, collections
I'll kiss you again, between the bars
I may take a holiday in Spain
Passed the guitar and said I battered my car right now, won't you please give me your tune
And you can use my skin
I can't tell you the truth about my disguise
And just are you, who are you this time
You promised it was real and I believe that
After walking all day through the first winter's snow
I have lost all trust I had in you
She lives in a world she didn't choose
So close to dying that I finally can start living
Only desire
I loved you first
On your face
Don't give you what you need
We'll call it Christmas when the adverts begin
And I'll drown in my tear storming sea
But it's you I take 'cause you're the truth not I
She says, "You know, we'd all like to rearrange"
And I am alone
It's too dark to see the landmarks
Somewhere you're not coming back
Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you
But there I was picking pieces up
Your tongue in his teeth in a struggle to find
I could pull you from the fire
I didn't know, didn't know, didn't know
Lackadaisically so
I want to know the things you did that we do too
Dream of angels who make me smile
You're working so hard
I'll breathe again
Like a brand new friend
The setting sun is set in stone
I stand there for a minute, starin' straight into the ground
No one ever said it would be so hard
Don't walk the plank like I did
Did you bury the carnival with the lions and all Excuse me while I sharpen my nails
A lover's lap where I can lay my head
Don't leave me dying, without a lover to hold
Get rest while you can
We just don't care anymore
How about a drink The St Jude club at noon
So please don't get me rescued
And all my brothers and my sisters yeah
So my mind was filled with wonder when the evening headlines read
Edward, see those alluring lights
What do I say when it's all over
You just got to see me through another day
Angels to fly
You don't know how hearts yearn
I need to be alone I'm not coming down
Even when the sun comes up I'm in trouble
They're not good thoughts
But that's okay, there's nothing left to say, but
And I'm tired, I should not have let you go
And a place to be
Of this town
With my tears, you'd make a sea a desert
Everlasting like the sun Melanie C Everlasting like the sun
I know that you love me
And hours of making love inside
There are days every now and again I pretend I'm okay
On sleepless roads, the sleepless go
And there's no Hell that he can show me
Lost in the arms of destiny
Hold me in your freezing arms before we have to go
Greg was always getting net from  feet away He had game, oh
Ain't gonna be alone
Did I get too close in the pouring rain
I know I can't take one more step towards you
Well, I guess I should have heard of that from you
You'll try to hit me just hurt me
Will the hunger ever stop
I see in blue
Oh babe, I hate to go
Oh despair, 
I can't compare to nothing
You say, "I wanted you to be proud of me"
What's the time, seems it's already morning
To have and forever hold 
But the heart wants what it wants
It will all end in tears
I just shouldn't think anymore tonight 'cause
But didn't, then Phil saw it all, then at a show he found him
A different tree now lines the streets
But for now we'll go on living separate lives
You're the one that I love
I knew, I knew, 
Don't want to be first in line
'Cause I have spent my whole life
So what would you think of me now
But that girl had so much love
What a shitty thing to say
If you ever come by here
Give me your hand
I take away your pain
You wrap your thoughts in works of art
I lost my head
Inside of me, yeah inside of me, inside of me
Maybe someday I will see you again
I reach my cold arm across the bed
No one knows who's in control
Leadfill the hole in me
I wanna close my mind hive or heart
'Cause if you take him back 
And they seem to lose control with you
Embossed beneath a box in the closet that's lost
We are everything we need
I have found the perfect end
And then the devil took your breath away
Shared your dreams and shared your bed
Like the horseshoe crab 
And a pattern of stillness 
But to know that the trust you had in me is gone
He smiles politely back at you
Oh it's such a shame for us to part
It'd be all right, it's all right
My heart sinks
I'm telling you I'm trying to hear this out
Lessons learnt
Stop sending letters
You ever tried to say
We came together but you left alone
Let's take a drive through the sprawl
Yeah, you slither away like the snake that you are
And as the moon fades
To use a crane to crush a fly
Tonight I've fallen and I can't get up
Oh, what to be done with her
To the lighthouse my friend
Was it mom who put my dad out on his ass or the other way around
For a girl in need of a tourniquet
Your hot, hot, weather in the summer
I think you made a big mistake
This is the part of me that's trying to be funny
I wasn't shopping for a doll
I know you cut me loose from contradiction I know I'm all wrapped up in sweet attrition
Swing low, sweet chariot
All the windows are glowing
If I just turn and run
Forgive us now for what we've done
And I never really got it
I will not leave you all alone
I hate to show that I've lost control
Ouch, I have lost myself again
And I will love you till I die
We are tested and pained
One by one you can cage them in your freedom
Kissin' me, your lips painted black
Your heart burns through
Though I'd die to know you love me,
Yeah I'm a clown
One sear scratch is lying in the door
But the ones who didn't make it
Inside, your cover's always blown
And every time you're driving home
A long walk home on Friday night
Did you close your eyes as you walked away
Standing, smiling on some fantasy island
She brings her hands up towards where my hands rested
I wanna feel
And walked outta my life
I keep holding on too tight
When he feels like he should be having his fun
Got up before dawn
Caught me making eyes 
Oh rejoice, his arms are burning witches
And mildew on my glass
And the mother of gloom
I was young but I wasn't naïve
The black eyed dog he called for more
You're still the one who makes me feel much taller than you are
I'm missing just one thing, a brand new start
At the end of the line
From the city to the south 
I was born into this
There was no tomorrow, we'd packed away our sorrows
Is this song to you
By the moon on rocks collected
I'm in the grass on my knees, wipe the leaves away;
She said nothing
They climb through my veins like it's mercury rising
I've wished on the lidded blue flames
I'm just young, rich, and tasteless, P
Songs about love
Babysat all four of my kids
For I've lost the last love
And have you seen how the cars when they pass
Here's two for being unaware, that you're gone
And you love to party and have fun
Good night my love
Well, I listen to the weather
So will you hold me please,
All my rights are everyone's enemy
And it may not make much sense
Ripped gloves, raincoat, tried to swim, stay afloat
But see how deep the bullet lies
As I draw up my breath,
Supplies are endless in the evening, by the morning they'll be gone
The love You taught me most of what I know
Don't punish yourself; leave it well alone
When the robin makes his nest
I watch you dance, you look so happy
Sometimes love has to let go
I was cold as I mouthed the words, and crawled across the mirror
No tomorrow, no tomorrow
And still they echo me
But I just turned my head away
I've looked at clouds from both sides now
There is no reason 
I fluffed the pillows, made the beds, stacked the chairs up
But that don't change the fact
Be as fucking insincere as you can
I know that this is my fault, I should have been more careful
Or shot up on the block and your mom
And the clouds above move closer
And love's so distant and obscure
And it's all been said nightswimmers
A house
To give a love, you gotta live a love
They throw me a bone just to pick me dry
Some liar laughed as he composed
Try to have fun in the meantime
You're the glitter in the dark
To see your blue eyed problem
Cause you never were, and you never will be mine
Turns you around
You will be back someday
Enlarging your world
Let's have an extended play together
If the sky is pink and white
All of the trees were bare
I want to break your heart
Was it a woman's face
Even heroes have the right to bleed
Oh, the first cut is the deepest
I could put my arms around every boy I see
That could dream about a thought
It may be over but it won't stop there
But I came to my senses
Passedout in the gutter, wornout in your head,
Regular exercise at the gym, three days a week
And I'm not sorry if I do detest you
And the hand of the watchman
Summer's getting colder 
Just because I don't say anything doesn't mean I don't like you
You'll be free, child, once you have died
, , pussy stays on my mind
Left in there, left in there
They're gathering round with all my friends
And at the time every house that we lived in either kept getting broke into and robbed
Clean up what is left of you
And I'm pushed into the deep end
On a bad day, looking for the great escape,
Death is no dream,
You won't have to wait too long, yeah, yeah
'Cause it's been ten days without you in my reach,
I saw our sad messiah
Bottles break, music plays
I love you 
I see some flowers on a hillside
And he trying not to eat you
What a waste
'Cause it's hard luck when no one understands your love
The smell of rain in the air con
As the heavens just increase
Notice me, take my hand 
You accept and go back to try it again
Quote you are my soul unquote
And I know these scars will bleed
Because I can't live without you and
When you walk by
A heart that's harder than stone
And then you bring me home 
Along the way I lost my faith
Right here when the storm blows over 
I'll be right there
The building turned its back, ignored my call
I was wrong
There is no one here but me
Holding my head high in the rising tide
But your heartbeat in my head
But I'm willing to give it another try
Sunday is gloomy,
You played your songs and danced your dance
I just need
I remember when we used to want to hang out
People say I interrupt people with the same look
So she sees sex as her way of leavin' hell
I let go, there's just no one that gets me like you do
Why you gotta be mean
Ah, ah, ah, you fell into our arms
Nichts war zu spät
Your middle name is always
You might sleep but you will never dream
Then I start to doubt myself
The air around me still feels like a cage
So meet me by the bridge
Over your sad, empty town
When you told me you were leaving
You always wanted to believe
I know what I should do but I just can't walk away
It burns a hole through everyone that feels it
When that line had to be drawn
'Cause where you see a wall, I see a door
But you ain't leaving no more, daddy you're mine"
But now, you only stop by every once and a while
But turned them away, she's a whip and a slave
These flowers will always die
And you are only just beginning
It's easy not to think when you're not told that much
Make room for Clara's bare feet
Is the same sky 
I say the road only grows long
Forcing everything metal to shine
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday born I was x
Then why are you on your own tonight
A glass once half full 
This is a modern fairytale
I never had no, no one ever
No, this can't be, please don't leave me alone in the dark
I know it's hard to tell how mixed up you feel
Then you started seeing daddy on the TV
Just for a while
So pristine the pain
The rain falls hard on a humdrum town
Struggling to maintain what's left
For no matter how much I really do want to stay
It ain't that in their hearts they're bad
You know the kind
Stand here until I fill all your heart's desires
Father set our house ablaze
For this I gave up trying, one good turn deserves my dying
Clinging to a past that doesn't let me choose
I'll miss the things that grow
The only one who's ever known
Though my record may say it
This time we ride roller coasters into the ocean
Love is good and love is mine
I fell in love with you
No sweeping exits or offstage lines
Ain't no good thing
And I wish that I weren't here tonight
I know what you want to say I know what you want to say
No one was saved
Oh, love, well I'll wait for you
A miracle
Sorrow waited, sorrow won
And my wife has some dogs in our yard
You were here, that somebody's me
But so dysfunctional, it couldn't last
You know she'll have to burn you
He was ten years old
And I won't forget you when we part
I'll be wallowing in pity
Undo this hurt that you caused when you walked out the door
To call in sick and late at work
And lost forever now
I try to keep an open mind
To all the fights I've conquered and beyond
From sour home Chicago
And at the end of all your lines
And the footsteps are getting louder
She lives with a broken man
Never look her in the eyes
Yeah, we lost all meanin', we lost the magic
Hands on my mouth
And I know you're up in two hours
The bed is unmade like everything is
I don't mind, I don't care
We're afraid to be alone
There's one thing that's still the same
Have to go back where you begun
She must be hurt very badly
You're there through my wasted years,
I was on your porch last night
It's on, and being foolish won't cover up 
From the work of sorrow
I watch you like I'm gonna tear you limb from limb
As my jaw dropped to the ground
They're calling your name out
When the bird has flown
To the tears and the pain
I searched for joy but I bought it all
Lie crushed and broken on the virgin snow
The strangers whose faces I know
The things you once told me,
Tide will dry, upon my baby's back
At the thought of being stuffed in my home
Let me out, let me out
And now I wish I'd stayed 
We slave for days and weeks
It's raining in Baltimore, baby,
I knew you'd feel the same things
I wish I had a reason, my flaws are open season
'Cause I was filled with poison
I dig in this ocean and I try to fill it with gold
I was far away
And if you lost a dad then someone's lost a son
To feel alive
I shoulda never let you hold me baby
But you are unfixable
From that same head you've twice removed, now
I'm a pill on your tongue
And our souls they blend
But it�s gone
That I love you so
It was everything I've waited for,
Didn't think I'd turn around, and say
So what did you do those three days you were dead
And every time I see you in my dreams 
We just can't do anything about it
But may be the only way
She says, love, I hear sound, I see fury
Watch as she lies silent for soon light will be gone
Why must life be so tough
And though you have forgotten
And you don't wanna be here in the future 
You make me feel like your whole world
Recollection brings me back
There's no one in town I know
He looks at you
You notice all your fingers pruning up
There's no water that can wash away this longin' to come clean
Anything as beautiful as You
Ever since we were kids, but now
Become a rock star 
And traveling blows when you're out of road
If I got to go first
Believe we're gliding down the highway
I said does anybody need that room 
You're everything I thought you never were
This song is for the people
My head's a carousel of pictures
I have seen fear
Send me away to san quentin
Just one more line to keep me sleeping loudly and cold
And I wanna come home to you
Before you kiss me you should know Papa was a rodeo 
No one will ever love you for your honesty
Won't you come down Come away with me
If I don't return to you
There's nothing wrong that wasn't wrong before
'Cause I'm so lost without you down here
And take the pieces and build them skywards
To prove you still feel 
Been standing still for much too long
And I slam the door
All these places, have their moments
All of the moments that already passed
Remains a sordid twist of fate
At least we tried, but we lost it
Well, think about the lonely people
When he finally found her he said that it was different
But time is on your side
Forgive me if I'm young or speaking out of turn
You leave with everything
Possibly maybe, possibly maybe, possibly maybe
Red tongues twitching 
If you're hurt
Little bit of love, love, I feel as if I'm wastin'
Funny how it rained all day
Bearing down on these two shadow animals
Woken up from a dream
The harvest of my dreams 
I stood too long in the way to the door
No, I This girl is only gonna break your heart
Cold wind blowing
How I love you
And I'll let your smile just off and carry me
Like you to stay
As she simply walks away
All of these moments I'll never replace
And I've seen something you probably never got a chance to see
If I only had an answer to put it all to bed
And not our last days of silence, screaming, blur
Watch his mouth its open wide
You're on my mind, love
And I loved you
And my mom hates my guts
Side by side in silence
Once there was a darkness, deep and endless night
Under the ground
And you are in love
Keep changing your mind
Sickness and sleep turning me cold
How can you know it if you don't even try
We had as rugburned babies
 months and  days ago
Forget about the ones that are cryin'
I took the old track
Watching history unfold
And these flowers will always die'
Let me walk away
The grave is the bed
The whole thing's tumbling down
To be with you, to be the one
I'm sick of hearing my own lies
Give up your books and put an end
Way home
All the lonely people Ah, look at all the lonely people
If he had've stayed you never would have taken my hand
Prostitute found slain, and Brenda's her name
Up and away from the bar fights and neon lights 
Can I help you find the peace and the star
How could you know what love is
Sometimes the last thing you want comes in first
Your softly spoken words
I wanna clean up my head
And it starts, sometime around midnight
It was wild
Feelings unfold, they will never be sold
But as the sun rises on Mary, it sets on him
And that's the way that you feel
Well, I could go away and you could wish that I had stayed or just stayed gone
Bracing like the bow upon a ship and fully abandoning
It's been so long since I've seen the ocean
Now you've gone away, don't worry it's okay
And you break apart the things I had
But the wind carries sounds
I'm not a stone, I'm just a man
Where the rays of the sun were so warm and tender,
And hid in the shelters underground
You're so much to everyone all the time
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do
Take the pieces and build them skywards
I will somehow
Took the get well soon cards and stuffed animals
Just the car that we ride in
And I know, and I see, you'll be breaking hearts again
With dying shooting stars
When you will be able, able to say
It's time to surrender, it's been too long pretending
You really got a hold on me
The sound of loneliness makes me happier
It's very difficult to keep the line between the past and the present, you know what I mean
With closed eyes
One hit wouldn't hurt a bit  
Oh, Caroline, you
I had these dreams, in them, I learned to play guitar 
So far away in their bulletproof cars
Where does the love go
Just running in circles in my mind
Probably mindless dreaming
We go 'round and 'round again
If this town's your sinking ship
And I won't pretend I understand
But my friend got to me before you
I even got the underground shit that you did with Skam
And she's the reason it happened, but she's overreacting
Turn the tires toward the street and stay sweet
In your life we take our cover echoing what is not
Sometimes I wanna call you but I know you won't be there
There's no way she can kiss you
You were the first to lie when we were not alright
With you I knew god's face was handsome
Please let me show you where we could only just be for us
The snow is really piling up outside
And claim all that has spoiled in your heart
But I left her when I found her 
There is room beneath your bed just for me
On lonely nights I start to fade
I'm like an ambulance that's turning on the sirens
It's only your shadow
No, I'm not sorry and I do detest you 
To walk back through the mud
You keep me up in bed 
What's the point in all this screaming
Don't lift a finger, let me hold you
Whatever was at hand whatever was at hand
She cried on my shoulder begging please
For my love
His bedroom walls began to glow
And there's no one allowed in
Everyday, to make myself feel bad
I can be all you need
I wait for the postman to bring me a letter
Sadie G, she's crazy, see
The wind upon my face
Singing ain't this life so sweet
Lost, enslaved, fatal decline
I believed I was strong
Omit myself take myself from your eyes
I went to the doctor and guess what he told me, guess what he told me
I only wanna make things right yeah, yeah,
I didn't give to you on purpose
 hours
And happiness and peace of mind 
Losing sleep, we learned to be
And I'm thinking 'bout calling on Jesus
Your sympathies I'm ready to return
I was impressionable, I was upsettable
And we'll lie inside for a little while he wrote
She can take me apart
So much pain
What happens when you become the main source of a pain
I think I'll start it over
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad
'Scuse me, I apologize She's got vacuum cleaner eyes that suck you in
Far beneath my nightmares and loneliness
LA is getting kind of crazy
I caught myself thinkin' once again
I never know what the future brings 
Said goodbye, to my best friend
Makes you talk a little lower about the things you could not show her
There's no need to tell anyone
I don't wanna be without you babe
It's just dead and gone
But he's a fool
Always there through, through that and this;
Every street light reveals a picture in reverse
Go ahead say it, you're leavin', you'll just come back runnin'
He told me to close my eyes
If I squeeze my grape and I drink my wine
That you had left behind
Can you find me space inside your bleeding heart
Who suspect they could never love anyone
Is it always like this
Where September was long
He's volunteered with grace to end your life
Our love is quicksand
And what's this shit about us meant to be together
He whispers like a bridge
But I need someone different
Why weren't you there all the nights that we cried
From give and take and still somehow
Well I don't need anybody
I tried to find a cure for the pain
Live for the life and the love I need
Severed myself from my own life
All the girls that you run dry
If you feel like letting go Hold on
If you're sleeping are you dreaming
Wild blood in my veins
Thank you for this bitter knowledge
What do you do when you know something's bad for you
Presence of people not for me
So grab me while we still have the time
Never been alone as such
Wait for everyone to go away
You have no new messages, so why haven't they phoned
I'd feel sorry for us instead
I'm crying 
Always be mine
Because I whistle to a different tune
With your darkest secret safely packed away 
In every new seed
Contempt loves the silence
Midsweet talk newspaper word cutouts paper word cut outs
Someone to whom I could relate
Like you're pouring salt in my cuts
I will remember your kiss
I'll speak my mind, whenever I feel slighted
And in your heart
And the air in between is overflowing
That time heals everything
In my arms 
No one gives a shit about the things they do
Low, it's not my call
They had lights inside their eyes
At the backs of other women
I can't sleep no more, baby
I don't need a remedy
Joey will come when once more it looks like snow
I'm making plans
These are, these are
That you don't want me there by your side
Unmistakably lost and without a care
And I didn't get to say goodbye
By the way your hands were shaking
I need a sunburn,
A happy song
Before you sign away the deed
I know which one I prefer
The skyline was beautiful on fire
In mine when I'm asleep
My dear, my darling one
Where they don't know who we are
In fact this is twice in a row
Instead I sleep
Fell out through your teeth, push the pieces in place, make your smile sweet to see
Looking out across the next few days
There was no chance of us at all
Or change the fate of two
I can't forget the day you left
Bright, sacrifice,
And only you can give the breath of life
Caught me a long wind
Is a mind that knows much more
I didn't think much of it then
If they revive them, just sit there
This girl is only gonna break your heart
You were always one of those
I've been here before, I know this shade of blue
There is a tree as old as me
And everything I need to know
When all I got is sinking sand
I don't want a broken heart
But you just sit down there and you wonder why
Now waking up is hard to do, sleeping's impossible too
There's nothin' left to believe in
Sailing downstairs to the northern line, watching the shine of the shoes
Taken from a distance
Yeah, she's alone and I'm alone
Words that I'm hearing are starting to get old
I've got to make a point these days,
This is where the road crashed into the ocean
And who do you think you are, running 'round leaving scars
Here's a phrase that we all know, but I can't make sense
Something has taken you so far from me
Using all your strength
I've got the feeling we're gonna die we're gonna die
They hurt you at home and they hit you at school
What made you want to end it all
When I called you, you little one
Ooh it's hard on the man
Or do you feel condemned
In a bulletproof vest
Then we will never die
Alone in this house again tonight
But I promise you this
Here they come
It's funny how
This isn't all my fault
Please don't walk away,
Surrenders it all
People say we got it made
I am on the mend
I know I would apologize if I could see your eyes
On that midnight street
I want you to watch cartoons with me  HeMan, Voltron and Hong Kong Phooey
You said you hated my tone, it made you feel so alone
The past
I told you I would return
That this life would be good
Better call with some persistence, that way you feel nothing at all
That means another day without you my friend
And your arm felt nice wrapped round my shoulder
It's such an icy feeling
Oh, we never talk about the past anymore
Make yourself a photograph and laugh at me please
mordiendo mis uñas
And I hang like a star
I made the choice, and you couldn't decide
Everybody's gone at last
Damn the government
Lets drink to the memories that we shared
There's nothing I can do now
For you and it would never end Thought you were my boyfriend
I'm not upset because you left me this way
Everybody's screaming 
It's a river spanned
Who would have thought that you could hurt me
How am I supposed to send this shit out
This one laughing quietly
With your triumphs and your charms
You'll never step foot in my room again
Down on Main Street They're singing their songs tonight
I was through with doubt and pain
Brace myself to hear the lies
He'll take you out any open door
The shape of my heart
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts no, no
I know I'm going to feel this way until you kill it
On this one
This place is a prison
I said it's too late to apologize, yeah
Everytime I let it go, baby it's you
I know everybody
Stuck by this river
Can't you see my walls are crumbling
The sunset stretched across this nighttime scene
I've gone away
Gave you tools just to stay alive
I guess it's true  cannot live without you;
Of the cherry blossom tree
And ohoh, I can feel her, she's dying
Why your father was so resigned
But this is my life
I was stood in the stair 
And I know sometimes you wanna die
It was Don DeLillo, whiskey neat
I fell in love and I needed a road map
And it's so hard to do
Mother don't worry, I've got some money I saved for the weekend
Showing me its comely powers
I lack the reasons why I should be so confused
So let's give up the ghost
That you'll come in with the rain
They remind me that houses
And I wanna hear what you have to say about me
Mark your place in time with another question why
I would have given you all of my heart
And we're set alight, we're afire love, love, love oh
Nothing we could do
Would this song live on forever
In this place it seems like such a shame
I need this, I need this
Do you love her
Stop this train
But I'm banking on the rest to clear away
And no one has the key
The mask I wear is one 
Because they know your playboy mommy
Morning comes in Paradise, morning comes in light
Try to slip past his defense
Afraid of the sun
There's plenty more fish in the sea
Tell me I was wrong
Get your broom and sweep echoes of yesterday's fallen freckles away
Right in and out of my life
And you were left feeling so alone
I know that I love you but let me just say
You were always the waiting
Went into the world Melanie C Into the world, 
Evil's in my pocket and your will is in my hand
You don't care a bit, you don't care a bit You don't care a bit
And I can't shake but I can't breathe
Until we're home
And as you turn around to leave
But I'll burn every bridge that I cross
Work will still be done
I remember the days you were a hero in my eyes
These clothes don't fit us right
Baby, I love you and all that I want you to do
Better things to do around the house
But the touch of your hand
If I squeeze my grape and I drink my wine, yeah
Six hundred sixtysix hundred sixty days
I'm looking up not looking down
You're more than a superstar
I'm only a man in a funny red sheet
I hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time
The first kiss and the first time that I felt connected to anything
Do I divide and pull apart
There's a hole in my heart and it's beggin' please
Quietly turning the back door key
There's gonna be a little one and she, says it's time to go
I guessed it couldn't hurt me, yeah
How do we carry on
To think that I was wrong;
And find a place we both could hide 
Seen in the mirror
Goodnight, may your dreams be so happy and your head light
On you I depend
No I, never had to give up of holding on to you
Shouldn't let you torture me so sweetly
And I didn't know, all those years ago
And if you won't give my heart back
As blue as your eyes
It's pleasing and freezing
And the day will come, when you'll get away from it
And if you would sing along
Take a look, you might see me on the ground
And towering over your head
Just one more chance to say
Drunk on immorality
It was your life
To face the fear but
I'm the one between the bars
Punkrock tshirt, black cap and tattoo
Always having my heart set on you
But I've walked them straight lined
And I know, you can see right through me, so let me go
Beside my window
In the living room, the living room,
So you better run
It's a treacherous road
Leaves like ton to the winter load
But I'm scared I'll get scared, and I swear I'll try to never give up
I am a bird
Twilight fades through blistered avalon
You call my name
Around your knees that crackle into the dark
To the beat of a drum, yeah
You've done nothing wrong
Down in the heat and the summer rain of
Shattered all the pieces apart
It lies but can't stand up
I go to the places where we used to
Blame the devil for the things you do
I'm a fallen old tree
Not for myself and not for you honey have no fear
You know what I need
All my life I've wasted for this
Fucking well come and find me
Never, no one
The automatic gauze of your memories
I stay at home with my disease,
And I'm too afraid, much too afraid to sing
Don't hold on too tight
And if you want an ending to your screenplay life
I just ain't the same without you in my life
And the rest don't really matter
You like your women and you like fun
Peuton jamais savoir par où commence
I will leave this man just to occupy one minute of your day
And I just need a little time
He had another face
One kiss and I'm ready to die
Fear is the heart of love"
Please don't close your eyes
Like there's no sunrise
If I could be that guy instead of me
It's no sacrifice
And then who the hell was I
Oh, he's gone, he's gone, he's gone, he's gone
Wir waren verschwor'n
Everybody who comes
Better not look him too closely in the eye
Satisfaction guaranteed to you
You remain to make it hurt
Millionaires say
I drove past true love once, in a dream
We couldn't take this on, the story goes unformed
Everything is like you say
It takes a steady hand 
Takes him away to war
So you better run
And then you'd bring me home 
And that's why I want you to sing it anyway
I like your twisted point of view, Mike 
And just to taste your lips
My blood is pumping through my veins
I'm as open as the door in her house that leads to her room
And I hope this makes you happy now
The roses came but they took you away
Not much left to do but drown
The wall on which the prophets wrote is cracking at the seams
To cut through all his worn out leather
Suzanne, the plans they made put an end to you
Has anyone, looked lovely
'Cause everybody hurts
Where did I go wrong I lost a friend
And I think about summer, all the beautiful times
I try to say it
Some things take so long
You never loved me
Was a sign on the wall that read
Crumbling like pastries, they scream
I recall
Still small, small voice of calm
'Cause you live in shades of cool
I scrape my hands until they bleed
Through the eye of the needle
'Cause both my shoulders are heavy from the weight of us both
Until there's fog inside the glass around your summer heart
Then in the night, the sorrowing sigh
There ain't no blanket, that can hide this cold
Served out his time, became a circus clown
You are, you are, you are
Some people like her for her charm
Hollywood created a superstar
Make me whole
Snow will fall, be a storm, there's nowhere warm
Oh I think I've forgotten her now
And every wave is tidal, if you hang around you're going to get wet
Honestly I tried to avoid it Honestly
Try to love again
There's nothing left to prove
Never have I loved since then
Caught painting a dotted line
Of the human race's vice
I will make you hurt
And the man you will marry The home you will share
I lost myself in sorrow
I hurt myself to let the darkness out
You got me
We take our daily breath and thank our unlucky stars
I'm dizzy from the shopping mall
Raise your hopeful voice, you have a choice
To this love aloud
Dance me to the end of love
And if she seems as lonely as me
I'm on groove from the grooving losing as I use ya
On such a breathless night as this
In a dream I saw you walkin'
Well I thought it was already as heavy
Your enemy is sleeping
You're the bedtime story
With the things you could do
Here I am expecting just a little bit
Ah, but you got away, didn't you babe
My clothes won't let me close the door
Child, you know how much I need it
Home was anywhere with diesel gas, love was a trucker's hand 
Should've done something
I turn the palm of my hand up to face the skies
Mr Higginson, am I not good enough for the world
Remnants of dying laughter
the hours don't have a beginning, or end 
Hoping for that call
K, it's your ride
Oh ooh
And a band of angels wrapped up in my heart
There are too many of us
I'll run to you, I'll run to you
I thought I was just the guy
I've been dreaming, dreaming about you, about us
Until it disappeared
Then we could talk it through
I'm falling down
And all the color drains out of the frame
Then die
I've been looking for someone to believe in
Draw another picture
'Cause I'm just one of those ghosts
That's when I wake up, alarm clock's ringin', there's birds singin'
Under the covers I'm okay I guess
And love is blind, but that I knew when
All died when you went away
I need you tonight
That I'm the same the way you left me
Used to have a little party every Halloween with candy by the pile
Where the land is low is
Wish the clock had no hand
Well the future's got me worried
That's from the path that you made when you said your goodbye
Everything die
You are, you are, you are my everything
Did you expect it all to stop
But I turn them off, and tuck them away,
With truth on our side
I know from the outside
But here I lie
I pray that something picks me up
I remembered you the moment I met you
And through the walls, they made their mudpies;
To try to turn back time
Four men in uniform
I have loved you for many years
Making more friends would be easy
And you are beautiful, but you don't mean a thing to me 
The next time you say that you love me
Is it fashion or disease Postironic, remains a mouth to feed
Please, please forgive me
And I've been drunker than a skunk
Traveling a street that I did not go,
Things that I still lack
While you are down on one knee
And I waited a long, long time
But I will remember you
All the days you spent with me, now seem so far away
I'm here and now I'm ready, holding on tight
Dropping little reels of tape, to remind me that I'm alone
The sound and the thought of God 
Just when I thought I had forgotten
Blister please with those wings in your spine
I never once in my wayward life was heading to run out
A warm December with you
The curtain closes, they're throwing roses at my feet
To say the least, I'd thought I'd seen them all
I would teach my feet to fly
You are the only one
Making fools of all the neighbors
I can't take my mind off you
I heard all you said don't say anything
Have faith that when you call my name
They grapple till she's safe within their keeping
And the history books forgot about us
Stop charging, my darling, get closer, be quiet
Possibly maybe probably love,
'Cause I will come for you
The days were slipping past
I'm afraid I won't know where to stop
That feels like home, yeah,
The untold pain
Oh I'm gonna buy this place and start a fire
Where the grass is greener and the sky is always blue
I don't know why but I feel conned
And you can thank me for mine
My feet will never touch the ground
Running far, running fast to the dead
Sat on the floor in a grey, grey room
But I know that waiting is all you can do
For why you're not around, and feeling so useless
If I had to I would put myself right beside you
Open up next to you and my secrets become your truth
So they say, so they say, so they say
We as people are just walking round
And how it lost me all I wanted
A magic trick makes the world disappear
So let this heart be still
Please don't call me self defending,
'Cause I'm a bird girl 
I can't trust no one
I take the truck on into town
'Cause I remember it all, all, all too well
When the moon is a counterfeit
I saw tears were in his eyes
And if you catch me I might try to run away
Throwing caution to the wind
But it's not going to stop
Remember her hair as it shone in the sun
And I know you are gonna be just fine
Suckin' on the ice makin' eyes all by myself
So take the streets if you wanna
Here's to you and your lover man
And I hope the rising black smoke carries me far away
The one to keep hatin'
Sold my coat when I hit Spokane
When sorry seems to be the hardest word
Every day, every hour
I'm standing in a room,
New straw for the old broom
I'd do anything to be at your side
And such was life in Leningrad
I used to work in a record store
So who's gonna watch you die
I was teething on roses
Of the murderous hand
But now it's just another show
I sleep with windows open
Now when I think of touching your hair
I feel you
And he's all that I need to fall into
By my only things are clear
And show it where to aim
I have seen your eyes
To let lie what's done
The darkest country road
These are a few of my favorite things
Do come and find me, oh
There'll be nothing you can do
How this will end
To the one I now know most
You gotta help me make a stand
How I'm supposed to feel
You already knew where you should've been
The kind you had left behind you
Daughter to father, daughter to father
'Cause I need you
And they weren't crying, my friend said it wasn't so bad
Those were the days of our lives, yeah
And I remember my birthdays
But I remember everything,
She can't find her place, she's losing her faith
So will I ever find that place they call good love
Und die Vögel singen nicht mehr 
But you can have what's left of me
Guess I've seen you three times
Now I've been dead for twenty years
Hey girl, open the walls, play with your dolls
May we see clearly in a different light
Those yesterday's feelings
And I realise there's something wrong
All gone and it goes on and on,
Let me feel the space between us grow deeper and much darker everyday
My love Your uniform returns to air
So you turn around toward the tiny girls who have got no tricks, who have got no past
Now you've gone away, further than yesterday
Is coming home from BFPO
In a galaxy of stars with nothing in the middle
I found it there today
The sun's in the sky but the storm never seems to end
I've turned into someone else
In a small Montana town
I know I'm not your only, but at least I'm one;
And I'll follow you into the dark
But I'm just too afraid of all this change
Where we left off
We had each other, that was all
The underground drip
We're strangers in an empty space
Regretting some little foolish thing
He hit me and it felt like a kiss
Hold us still when everything spins
It's so hard to go in the city
I know you're sorry
I'll remember it
Like a cut down tree
Her world has changed
I know I'm gonna look
Here comes that sun again
Baby, why'd you have to run 
Can I have a moment
No I won't let you down, oh no
From trying not to speak
When they called you a hurricane thunderclap
One endless moment
But it won't be any harder
I never thought I would forget this hate
Rest your head
We haven't had sore bits for about a fortnight
Everything will be alright
Some things look better, baby
And fly away to somewhere new
Stranger, we should be intertwined
und auf die Wege hinterm Waldesrand
Jed could run or walk, sing or talk and
It's getting darker but I carry on
We walked along a crowded street
I am feeling frail
And you have been so ugly your entire life
And drive around my faster car
And I can't stop from dreaming there's something else
Shameless as an ocean and
Goldenrod and the H stone
You can't get anyone to come in the sack
No wonder it hurts
See everything you say is real, and I respect you cause you tell it
Now I don't know when but a day is gonna come 
Our skin up off from the bottom, leaves our ankles bare
It's  am my heart is beating too loud
In a coma you don't dream
And your only hope is that forgetting might make a door appear
Gently pushes me back as she looks at me straight
No you will not be forgotten
To my troubled mind
And never could I tell it was him
I seem to lose the power of speech
All the lies that you tell, I believed them so well
But then of course everything always happens for a reason
I am on my feet to find her
I'll let you get the best of me 
And though I said my hands were tied
I'm gonna hold on to the times that we had tonight
Hopeful thoughts of soon returning
That my love for you is blind
Soul mate dry your eye
That there's someone out there who feels just like me
I don't wanna die
I'm lying here tonight 
We all end together
Shattered as belief
But it's hard to turn the opposite way tonight
Like I'm made of paper, oh woah
Those that she'd loved
Nothing left to do
For you and it would never end
This time next year, we'll be no more, oh yeah
Well it looks like an early winter
A single thing that I could always understand
You'll have to wait till
And if I hurt you 
How can it be you're asking me to feel things you never show
The snow won't go away, My nose runs down my face
You can't mend me, don't even try
So many men no one needs
See I met him later on, think it was 
But my happiness disappeared
I'll have to let you go
But you still don't like to leave before the end of the movie
Driving to the riverside
Or lie to yourself
You are always gonna be the one
What a coincidence, your Papa was a rodeo too
You have come to save me
I've been standing on the shoreline
I'm sorry, but it had no place to grow
You're breaking my heart
We kissed, time slipped, hard edged, tight lipped
That's when I definitely knew
Karen, miss communication, Karen, Karen
Fist, fist, fist, fistful of love
Daddy's in the corner 
I could still fall in love with you
You've got yours, I've got mine
Hey now, make your breakfast
Now that we are apart
Like time, there's always time
Well everything is eclipsed
U and I had many conversations on the telephone
I've got your letter I've got your letter, you've got my song
We know something's wrong
There goes another one that kept me breathing
'Cause there's no comfort in the waiting room
Just sometimes I wonder
I bow down to pray
Think back to this time last year
You can't remember, you try to move your feet
Deep at night I'm awakened from my dreams
See in a moment
To lay you down in clover bed
And rejoice although this world will penetrate you
You're not blaming me for anything 
And said some of 'em were from me, 'cause daddy couldn't buy 'em
You've made a fool of everyone
Maybe cross the country 
Come on fallen star
I started to fade away away away
Into his side
Hello, hello there, is this Martha This is old Tom Frost
So I can see my baby when I leave, this world
We're passing slow, we're passing slow Slow, Slow
I shut my eyes
An old soul song comes on the alarm clock radio
You only think about yourself
When I walk around all of the streets
I'm not ready for you now, please don't hate me
I know you feel the same
It will just go black 
Both admitting we'd never felt better, never felt so warm
My life is brilliant
From so many thousands of feet off the ground
I don't have to drive, I don't have to speak
Stay by my side
Change your mind and you'll have to forgive
When just one remains
And what did I see
And my voice gets thin
What have I got to do
On doing nothing,
And maybe twice the bear that I thought I was
It didn't get there by itself
Give me more than one caress
As the years pass by before my face
Back when I had those fights with my old man
You've got me paralyzed
I was trying to make it home through the forest before the darkness falls
Who called to say come dance with me
Roses on my grave 
My baby lives in shades of cool
Stays fast with the ship
The end of paralysis, I was a statuette
While you were kissing me once more than once
And our bodies are tired, our shadows will dance
Need someone to numb the pain 
I was there to dry her tears
You'll discover that casual friends kept notes in their pockets to remember your name
Through troubled times
Propped up by lies and promises, saving my place as life forgets
As you are right now to me
Down there in the waves, faded and erased
My point of balance was askew
There's no eyes in your head
Adia, I thought that we could make it
Deep down inside, I apologize
When jealousy burns
My heart is telling you
Take a look at my body
Let's follow the cops back home
Been walkin' my mind to an easy time
Ain�t the same since I'm living without you
I see it around me, I see it in everything
You are walking on a thin line
It's who we are
Better play it cool better let it pass
Like it's forever
Round here, something radiates
I'm starting to believe it should be illegal to deceive a woman's heart
It's not like I think about you constantly 
This parasite inside me I forced it out
And spaceboy, I've missed you
But how can you collect them all and throw them in my face
So why did you bawl
Take what's left
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
The light and the dark, the big and the small
I will remember you
If you're looking for it looking for it
All we got to show what we really are
And all I can do is try
To be here with me at my side
If I can just hold on tonight
So far away from where you are
With the magic of our eyes
The shower or the bath
But don't forget to entertain 'cause this is your first defense
And homey there he just front and pretend
Put your name on the line
The sun's gettin' cold, it's snowing
Your words in my memory
She was lying on the floor and counting stretch
As you're still burning the dress you wore to senior prom
And if I could hold on
He couldn't win the war with ego
My mother birthed me down a dry ravine
Why, why did you go
Don't hold on to the past
To me it's nothing but a one man cult
And you will never see the one you love again
I don't even know where to start
And I hear my mother call
I let out a silent prayer
Maybe if I don't cry
I keep floating down the river but the ocean never comes
Just turn around
How I wish I'd chosen darkness from cold
Another night, another dream wasted on you
Isn't the ending so much as the start
My heart was blinded, love went astray
Has one chance
It might just change 
And when I arrive, I won't know anyone
All the things I should have said to you
You've been waiting a long, long time
Are all thick and dull, all gravel and glass 
Of a girl with a broken heart
You could be my unintended
You just don't care what you look like
Then she leaves, with someone you don't know
I can see but once I was blind
I want blood, guts, and chocolate cake
I don't want to see my parents go
Those days are gone
A silver rain will wash away
So come home
'Cause it's so far past me now
Whatever on earth possessed you
Lift me back up to the sun
And rise to meet you rightly
I might need to be near you
Here, broken and cold, with great remorse
I wanna sleep in my bed
Left my heart out to bake
Let them go on, let them go on
How can you love me if you don't love yourself I love you
These drunken hours  graces deflowered 
Can't I stay an hour or two or more
Or will you cower in fear
How can you mend my, please help me mend my broken heart
That David played and it pleased the Lord
I was young,
Is there some better place I could be heading towards
I gave in, to selfish ways
I built a barricade to block you on the road
My weakness caused you pain 
While he's roaring and biting, I wash off the mud
Your fingertips across my skin
Wake up from this dream
It's too much, too bright, too powerful
Keep my heart breaking in the dark
I learned all I need from you
That it may seem unfair
To work for your bread
I write down good reasons to freeze to death
So kiss me with your mouth open
Am I your only one 'Cause you're still my only one
To wake you is all we got
So some say love is a burning thing
And I can picture it after all these days
I've got something in my throat Beneath the bedclothes
How's your life, what's it like there
More than some pretty face beside a train
Stronger than you found the grave
And here's an autograph for your brother, I wrote it on the Starter cap
We're both of us beneath our love, we're both of us above
Don't close it 'fore its done
Into the new morning milk blanket
How can I just let you walk away
In the sky
Oh take me back to the start
I should have stopped you from walking out the door
And the way your innocence tastes
When you're little and the world's so big
I feel like a fool
She walked through bullets and haze
Now that we're apart
She put her fingers in the imprints
Everything
And I can't breathe
Sometimes is all I feel up to now
So I gave myself a few more days
I won't feel better in the cold light of day
And the singer won't get in our way
And one by one the years of our lives 
Broke a promise 'cause my car broke down
But it's a flag that I love
And I think I am just as torn inside
Words are broken down
So I will take it back
How do your pistol and your Bible and your sleeping pills go
Twisters rolled but no one walked in
You hit the road and left me an ocean
Hey Lucy, I remembered your birthday
Possibly maybe,
So lay all your troubles down
Though she doles out hurt like a puking bird
I don't really mind if I just Fade away
While you are away, my heart comes undone;
Just like I always wanted, but I'm so sorry
If I could get another chance
When our child was due, but I said, he'll have to wait
You can always review on your own little screen
What are you talking about, variety Hostages
So colourfullyseethroughhead before
You grew up and you sparkled, but why don't you care
Oh but I know love as a fading thing
And they say they take me home
Don't need prophets or preachers
We feel no emotion as we spiral down to the world
And things that we could never do and,
You made me compliment myself when it was way too hard to take
Let's pin splitblack ribbon onto your overcoat
"You lied to me Dad, and now you make mommy sad
But I feel, tomorrow will be okay
I will remember
Blends in with someone's sigh
Calling me a fool, saying that I've effed up everything
Just as high as the door
And I'd hope that if I found the strength to walk out
You'll say you'd never let me fall from hopes so high 
The river down the way
I could live in a different place
Just give me a sign
But hey, what daddy always tell you
As long as I need to
And I could kill you with my bare hands if I was free
But every single time I do
Wouldn't say goodbye
The demons in your head
You just have to walk away
No I, just wanna taste your love
I will pack my bags just to stay in the corner of your heart
Seems you never realise a good thing till it's gone
Send message, Dan's number, where've they gone
Was it all a waste of time 
A friendship turned to a bond
Stuck in the shadow of my mistakes
So many things
Now I feed the birds Day after day
Weekenders on our own
She thought of maybe asking a girlfriend
And in time you'll be glad it's gone
Curling up inside my private tortures
Oh I need you
And the air in between is spewing comets
I'm gonna let you go and walk away like every day I said I would
Don't believe you're all alone"
I just need to know that I can breathe 
At ugly girls like me
Their heads heavy
So I wanna live in a wooden house
It's only 'cause I wanted to
But no matter what you'll never see me cry
And a rocket to depart in
Held your standards close to heart
Why the tears We're all here for you
To leave it, believe it
The reason you don't live
And I saw God cry in the reflection of my enemies 
I made the choice  I was wrong, you were right;
She had a mind to make
Fighting for the lives of her children
And this house just ain't no home
I am alone and she has left me
What's left of me
I've been feeling, feeling for you, my love
If you push me but I won't fall
But I remember how it was back then
I won't be seeing you for a long while
I can feel her breath as she's sleeping next to me
To settle for a place with some nice views
Unbreak my heart, my heart, ooh
All twisted metal stretching upwards
Can we go it alone say say say
My face is as white as the snow that haunts me
If I'm alone I cannot hate
We were lovers in every way
If you don't, if you don't love me
So come on and hurt me
Now I work for my dad
If you were still about,
'Cause in my dreams I see you again
I say you're name
All head south, or what
Time's not your friend
I heard the doctors put your chest in pain
Don't stop the buck when it comes
And you swore you say me laughing
I've got the feeling that I'm right where I belong
It's funny, I remember back one year, when daddy had no money
And see it all dissolve around you
And all the sky is grey
I'm still not feeling anything, this has got to be a dud
The SFO, the time and price
So if you're calling me out,
Blue blood pumping like a hunter's fist
To take my place in back with the loudmouths
Nothing is clear
Like a skyscraper
I'll visit your picture, I won't have the nerve
Until that moment comes
It shouldn't have been anyway, no way, no way, no way, that's right
How many times will I burn it down
Next to the dance hall
Will you come for me
I sit and cry
Best abandon ship, ohoh
Stars, Saturn and moon
And all the things you said to me, yeah, yeah
seems like yesterday 
But dad if you were lonely you had no where to turn
And your tears feel hot on my bed sheets
I see it in your eyes, I see it in your eyes
And can you keep sleeping metaphysical girl
Who's gonna look
Remembering the good times from a portrait hung on high; Hanging so high
I can't take my mind
You see, my old man's got a problem
I have drunk you wine
By the rosebush laughing
You sold me out to save yourself
I feel too cold
I'm blue and cold
But now you can't even recall
I never really had a problem because of leaving
You bring me closer to yesterday
If I woulda been the one to maybe go this far
Or your biggest mistake
Don't try to change my mind
Stars so close you can reach out and kiss one
Calling for his mother, then me
I go out every night and sleep all day
I will settle for nothing less
Your sharp teeth
But we don't have much room to live 
Trying to remember
Thought things were okay
It's the loudest sound
River of sorrow
At Mann's Chinese Theatre show She was gonna be a star
Seaweed and Indiana saw grass
You're givin' me a million reasons
Own these dire nights
I will lay down my heart, and I'll feel the power
And I drink a little more than recommended
And these flowers will always fade'
El cielo está cansado ya de ver 
And it's been here and disappeared
I wished your love away
I don't know if you meant it, but you did yourself in
The lover, a Martian
Frank Ocean and Mr Hudson
There's a fine line between love and hate and I don't mind
I can't live if living is without you
I was a liar, I gave into the fire;
I woke up early this morning around am
No happy ending
And I'm gonna buy this place, is what I said
Say there's a last kiss
Just to stay in the corner of your heart
And all the people who really understand
I don't mind
I'm tired of feeling nothing, goodbye"
It's not how it was supposed to be
Oh, but I know you care
We never talk of our lacking relationships
And if I grow old, well I know I'm gonna be
The bed I'm lying in is getting colder
I purchase a hazy escape at the alcohol place
With a trumpet or a train,
We could make babies and accidental songs
I don't want to waste another day
Oh, but I'm scared to death
Unable to just let this go
Seven loves you so much
The wind in my hair
But if you can't see me now that shit's a must
Where I go to sleep alone
You know the truth
She doesn't know how bad she messed me up
I'm dying, I'm dying, please
Let me in, let me in
With all the things you took from us
Don't you tell me to lighten up
And then begin to breathe in
Your beauty is beyond compare
Hold, draw me close, close to my lips
And I claim I'm not excited with my life anymore
On the night train 
I am here right beside you
He's drinking up, he's allAmerican
He'd kill ten thousand people
Don't wanna die alone without you here
That moment in time when we'll be set free
We beat him with guns
Singing Everybody wake up Wake up
Oh we knew it was over
At least I'll try
Everytime I try to grasp for air
Oh, but maybe I'm just too young
Six will love you so much
Oh eey yeah
She claims society is just a fever dream
I can't believe you let me down
BabyI can't help you out, while she's still around
Some of it is just transcendental,
When you're coming down think of me
And we just go in circles
I wanna sing one for the cars
God my fingers burn,
Nothing can stop these lonely tears from falling
She thought daddy was a wonderful guy
Along with place and time
Close enough to start a war
Give me all Whatever you want
Leave me alone to pick up the pieces
Baby, I'll love you to death, I guess that's what you get
Whirl around me, dance eternal
To cousin, kindred, kith or kin or she'll end up dead
'Round my hometown
But one thing's still true
I don't want to relive all the mistakes I've made along the way
If you took all the little feelings in your heart
I wonder if you blamed yourself for when she left you
A Promise is a promise
We all need somebody
It's clear something hear ain't right
Don't look down
Your hair is everywhere
By the office building
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
The sun shines but I don't
Know even less than what they say
I can't go on, just holding on to ties
They rain and snow on everyone
Or a bent up cigarette
There's many scars
So now I'm leaving you alone
Maybe, we are, we are
I'm embarrassed but I'm much more sorry
And the sewers are all muddied with a thousand lonely suicides and a dark wind blows
Everyone I know goes away in the end
Where would we land
The ring meets my face
That David played, and it pleased the Lord
You've never seen the lonely me at all
Baby if I listen real hard,
It was just to piss you off
Seen your kind so many times
There is a road I'm always walking
The city's been dead 
Was there a man up in the corner with the spiders made of light
So now I head back up the steps
They say life only grows short
Me a messenger man
Even after you're gone
I'll be leaving on a train
And even though you never knew it, well I knew
Hurts like brandnew shoes
Look, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that
But I guess that's just the way the story goes
That you used to love
Just try not to worry, you'll see them someday
My floorboards moan under my feet
The moment's already passed, yeah, it's gone
So I'm up at dawn, putting on my shoes
Sometimes you just can be a man
But life without death is just impossible
Time to get the seeds into the cold ground
Says here in the water you must be gone by now
The spell has been broken, I loved you so
Bastard son of a bastard son of a wild eyed child of the sun
and your tearin up your photos cause you wanna forget it's over
'Cause nobody told me
The ground is now cement and glass
Where I say shut your eyes
And I breathe you into my heart and pray for the strength to stand today
But I feel old and tired
Where you walked away
Don't think about the consequences
'Cause you're all I'll ever need
With your shirt tucked in and your shoes untied
I'll carry it to my grave
You could be the one who listens
'Cause he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
I just want something
Doesn't anybody stay in one place anymore
Some say I'm crazy for my love
And everything about you
And even at the bottom of the sea
Up against the fire, don't feel any heat
We are on a sullen misty moor
Wrapped up in the pleasures of the world
Whenever paul thinks of rain,
Oh, the world is round and so I'll go around
Changed my mind so much I can't even trust it
I wanted you tonight
But you're not here to make my sad songs more sincere
There are memories all over the place
We knew our childhood days were done
With my ghostly tears
And we're alone
Suppressed by all my childish fears
Sad song, sad song
If we hadn't been there in the first place
For awhile you were here
Lord please lift his soul and heal this hurt"
I can wash your sins away
A phrasing that's a single tear,
Baby, I'm a man and I was born to hate
One that settles down stays around
Was it everything you hoped for
I walked around my good intentions
I'm not fine, and I'm in pain
Because before too long you'll be a memory
And me, just another dream theory lost inside your eyes
And I'll talk real loud, goddamn right, I'll be heard
Summer's passed, it's too late to cut the grass
I know you're never coming back
And every, everything isn't only
From all our favorite songs
Want to be part of that nineteen eighty
With a father on amphetamines 
That all of these clouds are
Or will we leave each other alone like this
And my old friends, we were so different then
Hold my wine, hold it in
Baby says I can't come with him
Words that you never told me
Empty glass
Something happens to you
The child is on the moor
Did I ever think of you
She's not trying to go against all them
I'm feeling crossed, I take it inside
Those days are all gone now
And I'm hoping that you'll say
I need your affection all the way 
How can I go forward into something I'm not sure of
It clearly doesn't tear you apart
But the sun will always rise
And though the words tightening
Yeah, yeah, a lot of people think he's fine
Tell me that now is not the end
And I can love you till you drown
I'm crying
I wonder if you have the same dreams too
You were always crazy like that
Feeling old
You can see it everywhere you look
I really don�t know what I have to fear
There's nothing simple
Baby, I die every night, every time
'Cause I know I'm good for something
Of this love that we've been working on
My mouth is dry with words I cannot verbalize
I didn't mean to do you harm
Girls when they fall
To fall down on your knees
The saddest song, that she ever heard 
Rage, yeah woo
It's all of the good that won't come out of us
The whining ghost
I thought I might get one more chance
Because I'm gonna buy this place and see it burn
Note to single M Why did you not show up
The winter stripped the blossoms bare
The stench of a love for younger meat
But never taking off the weights that,
But that's not the shape of my heart 
Well, we might die from medication, but we sure killed all the pain
Will you walk right up
But I will surely cry
All because I've fallen for
I felt lost and found with every step I took
Let me hold you, let me hold you again
You have no right to speak to me so kind
I fell into your arms that night
Let me under your skin
Let me ride the crest of chance into the sun
And I find hope when I'm let down
When I fell down you'd be there holding me up
Geezers' stares bounced off
Of the girl who died with me
And the train ain't even left the station
And someday you will ache like I ache
If the curve of you was curved on me
And then sometimes again it seems that all I have is worry
She's the one that makes me fall
I will go down as your lover, your friend
To gold
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
Lookin' back every at the day
'Cause you feel like home
It's just a fond farewell brave
 alone,
Linger on, your pale blue eyes
With your inlays of mother of pearl
Two o'clock in the morning, something's on my mind
Ooh my love was punished long ago, if you still care don't ever let me know
Cut this picture into you and me
Don't tell me not to complain about my money and fame
But I'm on the outside, I'm looking in
Frightened of the dark
At the jokes told by their daughters
Wait another minute here, time will kill us after all 
The way you bit off my head
And no flags wave me home
You can take anything
And is that alright with you
And after all, it won't take long to fall in love
My only one
I can hear the truck tires coming up the gravel road
On the walls
But you'll see lonely sunsets after all
'Cause it's all right, all right to see a ghost
The power of youth is on my mind
Something unusual, something strange 
The place that I was born, on the lakeside
So I can say this is the way that I used to be
A band of angels coming after me
I bite my nails for days and hours
Your dry blood on my fingertip
And the holy dove was moving too
The only rattling cages are her own
They fly to the end
Tell me it's not all in my head
So you stole my world now I'm just a phony
Drove up to Hillside Manor sometime after  am
The best things in life are always free
And shove it way down inside
Pray your life was just a dream
And I know I did damage
And they'll do anything
All be lost in time
And don't forget to breathe
You're still dreaming
People are dying, I close my blinds
Lay rotting where I fall
And all the angels singing
And always was this
A memory that could hold me back 
So stay the night
Got damaged, I got damaged
And I let the wind make love to me
We couldn't care less
And when we are done
But I'm not a fool there's no need to pretend
All my life, though some have changed
I hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off the wall
How can you offer me love like that
'Cause if she suffocates, she'll suffer more and then she'll die too
I left her when I found her
I'd set my course for land
Somebody tell me I'm not alone
When I fell down, you'd be there holding me up
Four will love you so much
Killers reinvent and believe
We got into a bad fight
If you wanna come with me
Hit the bucket, it was a rocket all a sudden
Is where I did my homework and I learned to play guitar
You are second hand smoke
All the pictures are all in my mind
When I hear your voice, driving me insane
Your sweet young skin was shining then too
So we meet again and I offer my hand
At least you think so
"Three long years and your favourite man
You're always gonna be
Faded like your name on those jeans that I burned
But their callous words reveal
Accept family and obligation
I don't belong to anyone, my heart is heavy as an oil drum
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead 
Amie come sit on my wall 
You can move mountains with your misery if you don't
You let me down, now I'm hanging you out to dry
Corner street societies
No one's left to stop you now
Would you tell me I was wrong, would you help me understand
That thunderstorm's still crashing in your cranium
With flaming locks of auburn hair
Through the eyes of a fly on the wall
I need another world
How can I ever misplace you
There's a place and time for everything I know
Don't want to kiss you
How I wish I would save my soul
Let her sink
This is year one 
nor traces of the sun, 
I don't blame them for their curtaincall
Besides, don't release me until it's over
They can see that he's just a fool
I will lie awake
She broke your throne she cut your hair
Maybe it's trite but I can always, always, always be wrong
And no poem or song
You're just a baby, you cannot fly
How long can dust wait
No explanations, no fucking reasons why
And there's a time, ooh
As I take this piece of you with me
We heard the rain on the window
With my dirty hair 
And run away before I know
The street
Baby, help me mend my, this ol' broken heart
No warning sign, no alibi
And the world, stood still
It's not over till you start again
And all those oceanic vistas are so divine
I was the light from the lamp on the floor
I'd be smiling if I wasn't so desperate
I try to believe you
I'll take you back
With stolen wings and evil ways
She had on that scarf I gave you
We'll name each after its way
You're nobody girl
Of that leak in my soul
They don't give up too easily these days
I don't need them
Memories made in the coldest winter
Saw something in the way
'Cause the trousers seem to love your floor
Scared that I couldn't find
Because I took my own insides out
Everything we had, everything we had
Most people never find a love 
Though I've a faint belief in everything
And I gotta hear the same sermon
He told me he's packed up your books and letters and things;
But anyways; fuck it, what's been up Man, how's your daughter
And I watched from my window
I put on my hood and walked away  that doesn't mean I don't like you
There are twenty years to go
Every carriageway a mile for her
Three and a half minutes,
And I live my life, and have friends around
For the rest of my life
But mostly the view is accurate
Showing all the things you hide
As I paced back and forth, all this time, 'cause I honestly believed in, you
The sun sets on the war
I saw you asleep beside a wall 
They paint a broken life's
In the woods one Christmas Eve, waiting
Your little feet
She lives by the wall and waits by the door
Don't wanna try don't wanna try I bout just had enough it's been a rough road
Did you say "No, this can't happen to me"
For my wings
What we both knew was true
Don't be scared
Sad to think it was just a fantasy
All around me are familiar faces
Well, I miss my mother and I miss being her son
That you've been gone
But I just want my memories to remain
Their tears are filling up their glasses
Give me a reason to stay alive we're gonna die
He took off all their clothes for them
There's those thinking more or less, less is more
yet etched in cold
I'll display my disaffection you grind me up, yeah, you spit me out
'Cause it's quite alright
Mr Hudson
See you right back here tomorrow for the next round
A chance for calm, a hope for freedom
Her ankles clasped, her arms so rudely pinioned
Oh I was living on borrowed time in a
There will come a time I will look in your eye
I waited for an hour, I finally gave up
'Cause it's too hard to belong to someone who is gone
I'm writing a song all about you
Yes we gave it a try
The light reflecting off the mirror ball 
You saw who we are, Jenny Wren
Ashtray floors, dirty clothes and filthy jokes
I don't eat, but I play with this grey, grey food
Bittersweet
I think sometimes you forget where the heart is
Can fight for two
As I fall, as I fall
Are you strong enough to tow the line,
Your foot steps get louder
Is there someone new now
The water soaks into rocks
Ten years past and now you'll flee
They're like searching for you
I knew there I'd die alone
But I won't be home again
Have you forgotten
You have to help to patch things up
And never been down the factor too much of
Artificially sweet
Maria came from Nashville with a suitcase in her hand
It's a picture perfect evening and I'm staring down the sun
Pour real life down on me
You'll say it looks as though I might give up this fight
And what can I tell you, my brother, my killer
They call her Mississippi
Just wish that I didn't feel like there was something I missed
This unholy notion of the mythic power of love
There's a line drawn, like the lines on her own hand
It takes strength to be gentle and kind
Every drunk step I take leads me to her door
'Cause this ain't exactly what my heart expected
Now the lightships 
You're living for nothing now
I'll be waiting still impatient
And I held my tongue 
Want you here tonight, want you here
And always fool me
Only they can see where this is gonna end
And weightless and maybe
You were only waiting for this moment to arise
You were always the mysterious one with dark eyes and careless hair
And inside my head, holdin' on
Oh come around
I never needed you to be strong
After so many words
Round the sea I'm not floating by the saints of heaven
Well, I'm a sucker for that feeling
Do you miss me, Miss Misery, like you say you do
And I'll always be
We are all the same
Turning tables, yeah
And the whole world must watch the sad comic display
Leave me behind, let me stagnate
But they're sick of it all and they're bankrupt on selling
And do back the things it did to you in return
Don't back down, there is nothing left
I wish we'd never met, then met today
Pretty Mary K with some little boy in blue
This is my time of the year
In my mind
Stay with me, baby stay
And I can't sleep
And up until now I had sworn to myself that I'm content with loneliness
You can't make your heart feel something it won't
And watch as something seems to happen somewhere else 
Then I let the darkness cover me
May they shade you from me
If we don't move together, come closer
Nothing we say is gonna save us from the fall out
It seems you're playing a game
Anyplace is better
Everything's gotta change
The road is long, we carry on
Between the trees and cicadas singing round the pond
Don't wanna take a breath without you baby
Is it time to let it bleed
An eagle is flying 
Such a pretty garden
Daddy was an alcoholic
Somewhere's hole to divides any way you want
I've been walking in the same way as I did
To even look upon
I met my wife at a party when I drank too much
The things I feel and
My Clementine
Oh I never thought it would be easy
I see the shadows of your face
All I see are dark gray clouds
"Daddy, our baby's gone"
Such bad dreams
Ada, put the sounds of your house in a song
You might sleep, but
Cracked eggs, dead birds scream as they fight for life
It's a beautiful world we live in
Now you should be holding me
Nothing I know changes me at all
And even if I could it'll all be gray, but your picture on my wall
And I know it's long gone and that magic's not here no more
Somehow it seems so familiar
When I find myself in times of trouble, mother Mary comes to me,
But the same ol' song
"Isn't something missing"
I will not run 
Drink up sweet decadence
Now that you love me, I love myself
And I find it kind of funny, I find it kind of sad
And there ain't no one to buy our innocence
Arise oh brother mountain
We're dancing 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
The light from the Lord that shines inside
Now all we do is shout, oh yeah
It's the easiest line you could break
Higher than I've ever been babe
A hero of war
Strange how life makes sense in time now
In the corner
One is the number divided by two
I climb to fall, to begin again, to begin again
It's taking everything in me 
And you can tell me that you're sorry
What did you tell me that I wanted to hear
Saying goodbye
I was prey in your bed
So let me know the truth
Been searching every corner of the earth
Excuses, you know it doesn't work
To hear the time in his mind,
Or we'll skateboard your ass push people
Oh, I'm so mad I'm getting old
And tomorrow, you won't believe it
Lose the love they sought to gain
And I've hurt myself by hurting you
Close my eyes and I count to ten
She walks up and asks how you are
I loved your son for his sturdy arms
And I know I'm dead on the surface
And part of this terrible mess that I'm making
You got much closer than I thought you did
To goin' shoppin' for my cousins
But it's just something we have no control over and that's what destiny is
Asleep from all your pain
But I know the feelings still alive, still alive
And trust just don't come easy
I've looked in the attic, the cellar and hall
Show me all your figure paintings
And stop crying your heart out
These open doors, these open doors, these open doors, ah
Biting words like a wolf howling
Music starts
The pain has made you grow strong
The clouds in your eyes 
Her eyes were red with anger
Still nothing's heard
It was bound to happen so just
With my hands on your waist
And if we died right now
I'm sick of spending these lonely nights
With shadows I spend it all
A long December and there's reason to believe
A streak of light above the trees
You're a bedtime story 
I never thought there'd be
Let you fall for every empty word I say
Sought by single M Mrs Destiny
Ask her to dance
I'll pray for stormy weather
The way it is, we're on land
And spit your pity in my soul
So I think I'll leave by the window
I pick a book up and then I turn the sheets down and then I
But she never could get drunk enough to get him off her mind
And you told me we would never survive
As you lie in fields of gold
Two lovers locked out of love
You should've never gone to Hollywood
Can you hear the horses
Baby, baby, please
I left you right where I want you
Beyond the ridge to the west, the sun had left the sky
Little babies' eyes, eyes, eyes, eyes
Sorrow sank deep inside my blood
I know the past will catch you up as you run faster I know I know
Made an angel in the snow
From a distance I can entertain
You are driving me home 
You are safe
For the life of me, I cannot remember
Can't forget the years she's
It wakes me every single night
All at once you look across a crowded room
You're there through my wasted nights,
And flowers they bloom
You bring up the soft side in everyone
And I've, got all the symptoms
Don't be a criminal in this police state
They can tie me up, call me a clown
I stuffed it down, it's back again
Tell me what's wrong with my brain
Will I get better or stay the same
I'm gonna make a lot of money, then I'm gonna quit this crazy scene
So you can try and live in darkness but you will never shake the light
If that's what you need
One look and I'm crying
Watching them pass like clouds in the sky
Come into my life
Like I am living at the edge of the world
Slide your hand
Doll arms
Never do change
And we are still alive
She thinks she hears you coming
All these things we'll one day swallow whole
Yeah, I get lonely, but I ain't that lonely yet
If you're going out with someone new
Of a world left without it
'Cause I'm thinking about a brand new hope, the one I've never known
On a lover's shore"
When you gonna make up your mind
So I, I just got to tell you
I remember it well, I was stood in your line
And a twisting mind
And they all mean one thing
Tell me lies, slap me on the face, just
Running scared, I was there
I guess she thought she'd get away, wouldn't hear the cries
When the lights are turned down low 
Lately I've been thinking
Never thought you'd make me perspire Never thought I'd do you the same
I'm gonna do another I think Yeah, one more, these are shit
It's been so long since I found a space
I don't ever tell you how I really feel,
And she shatters like broken glass
In your eyes anymore
Could put right what I got wrong
'Cause it's time that we'll tell if it's heaven if it's hell or if it's,
Blue hydrangea, cold cash divine
I need your arms to welcome me
So we can stay like this forever new stitches
Honey can you hear me in between
You lied to me all these years
In a town full of rubber plans
I'm tearing at myself
And all the times I had
I'm gonna be the man who's workin' hard for you
Of hope for the days when I feel like I've lost everything
When I was feeling down, you made that face you do
Right here by my side
In the woodland, the leaves are marking a path
That I loved you more
But I love you
We gotta make a decision
'Cause you're fast asleep next to me
That the blood now had soaked
Fucking glow in the dark
If you're still free, start runnin' away
To my deepest inquisitions
She says the Bible is all that she reads
And you came home without Lili Marlene
Everything they whispered in our ear is coming true
You're losing the calling that you've been faking
From his family and his friends
And we can mourn its passing and then bury it in snow
For me to burn
That'll put roses on my grave
To leave you alone
I hate myself and I want to die
And you can praise the clouded mind
Just medals and scars
Just play it cool, yeah, and try to avoid being seen
The cut that never heals
My eyes demand like broken eaves
When I'm not around
She wears her tears on her blouse Confused and racked with selfdoubt
Do you think it's dangerous
They make me feel I'm falling down
The time flies by,
But in the same old haunts I still find my friends
And if it gets too late, for me to wait
Who would have thought
Come shove me over the edge 'cause my head is in overdrive
His heart is breakin' 'cause she's there alone
Well, I don't think I care 
I was buried alive
And it seems to me you lived your life like a candle in the wind
Home waits for me
Up for air from the swimming pool
Forget all the regrets that are bound to follow
We all need that person 
And now the clouds, well they've covered everything, oh
It's a long walk and the music is loud
Will you keep an eye on Baby Birch
I should be hoping but I can't stop thinking
Step aside from all this anger
Maybe I'm still searchin' but I don't know what it means
Everyone now
Streets where you were raised
Viva forever, I'll be waiting Melanie C I'll be waiting
But I could never love again
I've been around this world
Baby, maybe it is just because I didn't know you at all
The water keeps on falling from my eyes
I wanna' show you all the pain
All the ones I've loved calling out my name
I was young enough, I still believed in war
Flashback to the night when you said to me
I left them all behind
So there was none 
And thusly it ends 
I would be happy with just one minute in your arms
Mr waitingeverpatient can't you see
And will you never say that you love me, just to put it in my face
The ocean pressures its frame
But you can't paint an elephant
I'll haunt you when you laugh
This conversation has had no face
A place
You let my hand go, and you fake a smile for me
'Cause I don't care
Send the poisoned rain down the drain to put bad thoughts in my head
But could not make you stay
Acoustic guitar, if you think I play hard
And remember when I moved in you
I believe that I need to be free
Got no resolutions, no clever anecdotes to say
I'll come to you, I'll come to you
Try to detect you while I'm sleeping
'Cause I love you
No one saw
Possessed by my taste
It's just a place I'm looking for
Like we never had a chance
Through the headlights of a car
But like a drunken night it's the best bits that are coloured in
Ooh my smile was taken long ago, if I can change I hope I never know
I was alive from the first now I'm denied by the ghost of you
I'll always look out for you
I was here Oh, ooh, ooh
Here I am on the phone again and
Tearing me apart
And cried, "My children, my children
I'm back with scars to show
Problems all left alone
All the times, that I could beg you please, in vain
Oh my god
Dreams over a lie's the same
No one here beside me
I'll be your super queen and make you me
The dog days are over
And you're restless, and I'm naked 
Goddamn, this business is really lame
Haben wir zu viel versucht warum konnten wir's nicht ahnen
Don't you know she's got a babe baby
And my mates are all there trying to calm me down
No, no, no, no Melanie C You know it's time to say goodbye, and don't forget, on me you can rely
You can save face but you won't ever save your soul
How could it be, that the curtain is closing on me
Matters of heart are hard to address
And Rob their houses
Should be a good night in here, Ramo in the main room,
Count yellow highway lines
I wish you'd never forget the look on my face when we first met
There's a moment to seize every time that we meet
Beside the green apple sea,
Me, I don't say much
Jailer who sells personal hells
Reading prayers from this old book I found
I didn't see the time
And I'm seeing the light in a station bar and traveling far in sin
With sadness so real that it populates
I guess I forgive you
And I just wish you'd come over and explain things
The sun will rise
That you were crying
Blue smoke will take
First the lights, then the collar goes up, and the wind begins to blow
Down your face they pour 
 minutes, to finally decide
I am displaced, I am displaced
I'm wasting
I don't want to sleep with you
The pain of this slow burn
I've been wadering 'round
I'm praying secretly
But I'm safe inside me here, oh well,
I'm just having thoughts of
The champ goes down like a clown in the second round
I want it back 
And a better daughter or son and a real good friend
Clutching her handkerchief
Will be destined to remember
I guess maybe that's what's worse
'Cause I know you're somewhere out there right now
When she does stupid things
I just hang around and eat from a can
Man I'm 'bout to get crazy, just run away
As drunken men find flaws in science
No one gets hurt
I lost myself in gravity
So far from home, do you know you're not alone
She is gone, now she's gone
Well sir, it's the first time I've felt like something is mine
It's like a movie playing over in my head
Yeah, we couldn't destroy a single one
You don't know how lips hurt
Before the last one
And I just blame everything on you
My mama felt, she never liked you neither did my friends
Without thinking anymore
I remember shooting stars, the walk we took that night
Instrumental break
tremors that hold us
And daddy's always working
See if we could be something
Me fighting him, fighting life, fighting dawn,
Turned around backwards so the windshield shows
I thought you'd want the same for me
I'm holdin' on, I'm still holdin',
Beside me today
I want a perfect body
And all the people who've seen it all before
One will love you so much
But I never planned on you changing your mind
And went right back to bed
It's about time that you got sick of me
Now it's just too late, and we can't go back
Well, maybe there is a God above
Waving good bye at the end
You keep going over every word that we've said
Like I have something to give
Leaving on a jet plane
But I'll come back to you some day
Are the wonders of this world
And she's scarce above the gunwales
Every time the sun comes up I see double
Honey now if I'm honest
I don't know why I let go
The sun was always in her eyes
All those lonely nights, lonely nights
I will not lay like this for days now upon end
And bury it in parking lots
Never say you miss her
'Cause the world got in her way
Held acquaintance with the waves
So let's just say goodbye forever
Together we cry, oh, oh
And I don't need your permission
I never knew time passed so slow
Cold smoke seeping out of colder throats
All the things she says
When this broken world mends its foolish ways
Until she'd rise and say
If you fall, you know, I'll be there for you
But I knew the sense of worthlessness she'd have to rise above
Just know I love the time that we both had
From my cold and tired brow
The words that you whispered, for just us to know
Mad world
All of your life you have spent
I don't think you know what I fear
Oh, I'm not crying
You heart is like a diamond 
Till yesterday is here
And the smoke came out our mouths
Your eyes blackened by 
'Cause I knew you'd want it
In a place where no one knows what we have done
Accept it, And let it 
And the complications when I see His face
Takes one step forward, looks back and then walks away
Drop dead in place, you can forget it
And if you would sing along I will be happy now
I guess I'll go home now
But my heart won't buy it
Just to be over this, back to another one
And dreaming of just having a man
The crescent moon above us
Please hold me under the sea
You always seem to know where to find me and I'm still here behind you
You peel back the layers
The Northern Lights are just a band for hire,
I'll die
I guess it was never meant to be
Boy I was shaped for the fury
hold me tight
This innocence is brilliant it makes you want to cry
And dream about things
But you still don't like to leave before the end of the movie 
Back to the same place I sat with you drink for drink
All the centrefolds
Couldn't see past the end of my beer
Your world's no wider than your hatred of his
When the floes under our feet
There will be an answer, let it be
Like bones make the walls of a prison
And maybe try another time
Sixteen just held such better days
It's not like years ago
I miss the air, I miss my friends
Deep below it burns
Everything was such a blur, it didn't come out right
And I'll look back and regret, I ignored when they said run as fast as you can
Maybe some time sooner or later
Pretty when I cry
Singing Life just ain't fair
'Cause I think it's time for me to pass
Consuming thoughts, consuming time
His thoughts echo round
Sad eyes, I'm trying to hold it together
I will love you always and forever
You made fun of me for singing my song
Leave me in the rain
'Cause oh, you'll be the end of me
I say
And if you wanna show, then just let me know
You wouldn't be here right here, you wouldn't be here for me, no, no, no, no
And that's the reason
I love you
Hell knows where your heart would be today
I couldn't face a life without your light without your light
I've been watching your world from afar
'Cause I too know love from you that
And before you know, you're feeling old
I know nothing at all
Like, "There's still a hole where the phone was thrown"
I gave myself in that misty light
Is it a dream
'Cause you want to be alone
Eat some shrooms, maybe have a good cry, about you
Yeah, today is on my mind
Write me a love song
Sweetheart, may not be easy
I think I need to find a bigger place
Happy people don't give into 
And to know you is hard; we wonder
She said Is this the return to Oz
When I was
We're stuck inside this salted earth together
I wish I died
Farewell, somebody's gonna wish that
Your resentment grow till you're all alone
For a second I was in control
You just close your eyes
Just a little bit of your heart, just a little bit of your heart,
For me too, yeah, yeah
What are you hoping for
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
There's nothing left inside of here
Of kindness linger on
And in that house
It's funny when you find the words to say
Sunsets, small town, I'm out of time
Bright and early for their daily races
Can't stay in one place
But in these days I'm so confused
Howling hallelujah
Take the gun, and count to three
We've been alone too long
In fact, they follow me
So choose your last words, this is the last time
Grey would be the color if I had a heart
I won't forget all that I've done
Lying here, lie,
To never let that right be denied
I always have
But he tells no more lies
Well that may be your worst redemption
I go where I please
Beyond the furthest star
Will his presence still remain
'Cause when the calm comes down
There's a sense of longing in me
The things you did then
This is a progressive dance but
Yellin' cries mercy she's beggin please beggin please beggin please
Everything's falling into place
As you disappear in a puff of smoke
I see your face, you're haunting me 
'Cause it was on a hidden bit that nobody else could see
She wants clean sheets, and fresh flowers
That I'm tired of calling you once a week
Save everything
I held her hand but I don't hold it now
Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Now that it's light
Oh it seems to me
I could do this right 
With someone else
From crying when he calls your name, Jolene
Now they meet amidst the broad daylight
Abusing 'cause you're a friend
I got down on myself
The curtains drawn, the winter sun makes patterns on your face
I can hear your heart
Lock the doors 'cause I'd like to capture this voice
So I'd prefer to be remembered as a smiling face
I got your bible and your gun
'Cause I killed all the flowers
I'll put his picture down
Do you find it hard to sit with me tonight
You called me from the room in your hotel
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town
And you needed proof 
I couldn't be the one who'd stand by your side
Knowing every moment is closer to your flight
In case you change your mind
A tear drop falls on every page
I told you, weren't lyin', I know you aren't relying
Oh, yeah
But I can see the stars
Ghostly fingers 
And no reason or rhyme
If I could only work this life out my way
Distance makes the heart grow weak
But why aren't you sorry, why aren't you sorry, why
Let me apologize while I'm still alive
About a land far way
Help me understand the years
Who can be sure of anything through
To hell with my pride, let it fall like rain
But you love someone else
And I said, "Not a chance Not a chance"
I took a deep breath
Could've been something
Now you can hardly stand it, though
Because I miss you love
All those mistakes and be wise
Greed's all gone now, the panic subsides
Of everything I see, the world ain't half as bad as they paint it to be
Cold I loved you from the very first night 
With the lies they told to you
Whenever she walks by
"Hold me like this for a hundred thousand million days"
I'll be okay, is that what you want me to say
There was something that was not there
I can't hardly wait
Why wasn't God listening
You're sorry, you swear it, you're done
We thought that everything
There's nothing left of me
Between the trees and the pond, you put your hand in mine
Their words, mostly noises
Some'll laugh and some just sit and cry
But if by chance you change your mind you know I will not
I've turned my back
And found that there were none
And I just wanna stay in bed
I didn't plug my ears 
To read the signs carefully
No they're a part of me
I sure do hope the road don't come to own me
Wondering which version of you I might get on the phone tonight
Tried to erase the way your kisses taste
And when did your eyes begin to look fake
I still look for your face in the crowd
And it leans on me like a rootless tree
It looks like an early winter for us
Collect the love that I've been given
Got a feeling my love
If you let go, then just let go
Once my ignorance was bliss
Oh shit, I'll go cook myself a brew
There are objects of affection
Tried to point my finger
Light will fill our eyes like cats
You're weak, but not giving in
And I try to be, but you know me, I come back when you want me to
Those who speak know nothing 
And so I'm asking you
From this dark cold hotel room
And never say goodbye"
And can I hold you one last time
Whose code was broken, crucifix uncrossed 
You must have made some kind of mistake
Happiness ahit her like a bullet in the back
Your life anymore 
Don't you dare look back
Round and round and round
But it don't snow here, it stays pretty green
Take the very, breath you gave me, take the heart from my chest
Oh, little stranger, bring my baby back to me
Being poor was not such a drag in hindsight
The last thing that she sees before they turn off all the lights
Yet still inside, I felt alone
I could never care enough
Take apart my fantasy 
It would be a lie
Solace my game, it stars you
You're a drunk and you're scared
Selfless, cold and composed
The thought of reminiscing
Dance halls are empty
You said, you said that you would die for me
Excuse me, think I've mistaken you for somebody else
Unkiss me, untouch me, untear this heart, yeah yeah
Again I waited for this to change instead
But it won't change a thing
I saw through your lies
Deeper still and wholly
And the bodies you left lying around
That'll make me hater your name forever
They don't make stationery like this where I'm from so fragile, so refined
And bear my soul
Oh you know you're only having a laugh oh
He cries harder and harder
Turn down these voices inside my head
Child, you know how much I need it
Weeds blow tall on a broken train track
To be your mother
You thought that you saw him, but no you did not
You say it so loud, but you sound far away
A cure for no real sickness, cross your hopes and die
Long haul, sentence carried out
And this is why my eyes are closed
Of course you say you can't complain
And time is running me still
I'll do anything for you
So you thought that getting sober
Hey What's that you say 
Since he walked through that classroom door
And will you never try to reach me, it is I that wanted space
The big top is crumbling down,
But when you come and see me in California
Should've said something 
Love is drunk all the time
If you knew the man I used to be
And I sing and sing of awful things,
You love love love, then you die
You'll always be my favorite one
This fool you love somehow is here with you
Now all the things you had, they aren't the same
A sweet romantic place
Don't turn back to me
Take me with you towards the light
The dream is on
Just reminiscing lookin' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out
My love, I'll make you understand
I know you didn't bring me out here to drown
By the way my words were fading
Who'd will the meaning of
There were times you really made me cry and
I'll hurry past your chest of drawers
Such a foolish game
And you can't bear the thought
I need some sleep, time to put the old horse down
I want you on my side
No words from my cutting mouth to your ear
Her name was Sheryl
When the light first came upon us and we saw the Everglow
To the quiet chaos driving me back
When everything goes wrong, you see some bad
There's an eclipse in your eye
All the summers singing, drinking, laughin'
And there never was
We've been told you stay up late
I go down and I wondered if there was any reason left
This is the part of me that means nothing
I think the finish line's a good place we could start
It's a loser, a sinner, a cock in a dildo's disguise 
Well, neither one of us deserves the blame, 
When I am in the life anyway
And in the morning I'll be with you
I step outside my mind's eyes for a minute
Jenny was a poor girl living in a rich world
And I will remember you
Will you comfort me in my time of need
Can you tell a green field from a cold steel rail
It's so real but it�s in my mind
Lights that flash in the evening
Come alive, I've come alive
I won't let go, I won't let go
Please don't go, I want you to stay
Without hearing what I have to say
Won't let this build up inside of me
Pain won't go, rest in peace
And the spine collapsed and the eyes rolled back
Never die
Thought that maybe I'd really love bein' alone
I know it's not right, but it seems unfair
It brings me right back down
In a phrase to cut these lips,
Salt my wounds, and I'll keep saying thank you
Your mom just smiled and sighed
You make it hard to see
Well I, just see the sky
I'll carry you in my arms
The shameless kiss of vanity
You talk to me
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright
Did I say that I loathe you
It's cloud illusions I recall
I close my eyes, it's all the same
Then I'm sorry 
Not to regret and not to sleep
I want to be a good woman
That there is comfort in a world
Oh my dreams come back to me, back to me, back to
But so's another line
That I've always been dying to tell you
Nothing you can do
Maybe I'm a fool
Never meant the words we meant
It's in my mouth
These scars of mine make wounded rhymes tonight
As they put you down inside
But I guess we're always leaving even when we look the same
I think I, I know I, I believe I, I feel like I gotta
There is no peace that I've found so far
Remembering everything
If I fall to his feet tonight
The things we do just to stay alive x
And left a bleeding part of me
Guess it's clear he's gone
He said you changed but he wouldn't say how
Yearning for more than a blue day 
My back turned towards the sun
While the lovers and the lonely, start to whisper all about me
And dear my love, haven't you longed to be free
You're startin' conversations
Hey, shit happens, Uh huh just blow it off woo
The future that we hold is so unclear
Never now I need the other and if you're suffering a lot
I try'd to save us so many times but still you couldn't see
So now what's next, there ain't nothin' left to sell
Victim of political pride
All you bitches put your hands in the air
Oh my heart is frozen still
Do you ever hear me calling
Ur tellin' me you really need me crying beggin both knees are on the floor
It's not treason, it's no lie
Losing sight of life, day by day
I'm not fine, I'm in pain
You're connected to the heart
And there will be no pain tonight
And he's changed his tone of voice
Late night drives
I got fried a little
And whatever you decide to do, Jolene
And I fired away
Chat at the bartender in the cold top steeples
Well I guess the answer is don't do it in the first place
You're stuck in the same old nightmare
But if you fall and take a tumble 
Your apocalypse was fab
Trouble, oh, trouble
And so easy to say
There's a woman
All of our work
You held me in your hands
She's mostly gone, some other place
Don't feel bad for me
Flicking my tongue out at the wet leaves
And curse my mother's name
Always worried about someone else
'Cause I can't do it face to face
'Cause I don't remember anymore
That I would be loved, even when I numb myself
You, I thought I knew you
Look for the rainbow in every storm
And even fancy things have finally lost their charm
It took so long just to feel alright
Until the wolves are away
But if you'd known how that would sound to me
It was a trial, you made a mistake, we know
Driving around on a Saturday night
And I loved the way you looked at me
And this bottle of beast is taking me home
In that troubled water
All the glitz messiahs just pass the time
A song to keep us warm
Mais leur chanson est monotone
It took thirteen beaches to find one empty
You said "Young man I do believe you're dying"
Come back to me, baby, we can work this out
There will be an answer, let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
I ain't the money man, which your money man, you ain't lookin' at me
I think you're a Contra
That's why it's blue
I gotta stick with you, my baby
I just know that she warms my heart
Was how to shoot at someone who outdrew you
So come on, come on, come on
Do you know that when you look at me, it is a salvation
 am it's dark
And I've hurt myself, ohoho
Always die
Inside the time I have to forget you
Of the curl of your bodies
Hello, how are you
I don't wanna walk around
Everybody here is watching you
When nobody's there
We are the everliving ghost of what once was
Rocking Chair 
The side of the road
It felt like a lifetime
I said I'd never leave you'll never change
No I, wanna taste your love
Under their desk in an air raid drill
The last girl and the last reason to make this last for as long as I could
Dancing a jig in a church with chimes, a sign of the times today
But in just three words he brings you down
'Cause I'm still breathing on my own
So I hope and pray you won't throw this love away
And if you think you see some tear tracks down my cheeks
But when it comes to being lucky he's cursed
Look me in the eyes
She told me you'd given up drinking
All of our rubbish dreams
The bitterness of one who's left alone
Even if it's alone
Nothing compares
Ask the ministry
After school in the back of a bus
Lost in a haunting thought
That is the kind of girl I am 
No need to worry
Want to get myself back in again,
To let you go
My pulse was as high on my very first date
GLORIA is love
The sun gives her no mercy
Like in a love affair, when the love has gone
I think I kinda like it but I mighta had too much
Flash flood, you got too comfortable
Some sort of window to your right
She loves him more he loves her more
In a land there's a town
I wish my smile was your favourite kind of smile
You cut your hair, we never saw you again
Walking, holding hands
I can't believe I still want you
You still support me after all the things that I've done
But I'm glad that you've come
Walk away walk away
It's hard to force that smile when I see our old friends and I'm alone
Don't worry Mary, 'cause I'm taking care of Danny,
This used to be our childhood dream
That would make you hurt like me
Time's tide will smother you
I'd do anything for you, anything for you
Bittersweet, I want you
Turn on the bright lights
And how can you mend a broken heart
What's right my love
And I can read between the lines
Ending with letting go
And no one knows who's in control
You couldn't keep your hands to yourself 
I feel like going home
I get to go home in one week, but I'm leaving home in three weeks
And I can't, I can't get up when you're gone
But don't strain yourself for me
All I need is
I'm battle scarred
The preacher man said "let's bow our heads and pray
To try to figure out what it is I've done wrong every time when
"The shallow drowned lose less than we" you breathe
Oh, I wish I had a river I could skate away on
I don't need a hand, don't need anything
Share a popcorn and when it's finished we could go to the pub at night
He only loves those things because he loves to see them break
Somebody to die for
Why does my soul why does my, my, my feel so bad feel so bad
But these feelings won't go away 
Or maybe unfold some old yellow lost love letters
Would turn to flesh with teeth of pearl
Take your economy car and your suitcase
And drink the cold away
And just dance and just drink,
All my life 
I am so tangled in my sins that I cannot escape
To our love let all the pinkeyed pigeons coo
Ooh, I remember we could talk about anything
Lies, lies, lies
Walk with me and maybe
Ah, what did you think
Midnight's calling 
Like my memories, I don't need that
Oh, we couldn't bring the columns down
And I know, and I know, and I know that you got everything, but I got nothing here without you
Just one more round before we're through
A black sheep boy dissolves
I knew it was a dream right away
'Cause I will be gone
We'll be half way to anywhere
In the shadows I climbed mountains for chairs
But tonight, I'm gonna love you like there's no
That I've been dying for something real
Love me, love me, love me, love me
Oh, but even if I fall in love again
It hurts to love you, but I still love you
Tried to figure out memorize their words for hope
Return over valleys
She knew someone
But, I believe in you so much
A glass of water longing for the ocean
But no one's listening anyway
Built a shack with an old friend
And now my family is one again,
And came into my bed
I'm through trying now, it's a big relief
And I miss the way you made me feel
Just sitting here, trying not to look back
I cannot carry the weight of the heavy world
So swallow the knife
I'm begging you please, oh please don't leave here
That I started looking for a warning sign
When I look right through
I'm barely off the medication 
On the back of a motor bike 
Oh my tears fall down as I tried to forget
So I will just sing my songs and I'll pass a hat,
But a broken heart took her song away
I always was one for crying
I believe in you
The singing sinew
They still eat their young
So stop chasing the past 
Would you still be here, no
I'm like a mother barely keeping it together
I got her to come on and move in with me
All my plans fell through my hands;
Sunshine for a brother Old man winter's in the air"
I was here
That goes without saying
I'll help you carry the load
And thinkin' 'bout you in the night
So holy light shines on the things you have done
Is this the feeling I need to walk with
Bury your face in my shoulder
Then you smiled the whole way through it
How many times do I have to try to tell you
Now I pay the price
"Why do you cry
'Cuz nothing else matters
My dying prayer, sealed in a scream
My family tree's losing all its leaves
I was just a girl then
I burned all the good things in The Eden Eye
To the shadows of regrets
Though you're still her man it seems a long time gone
He never buys any smokes
Baby, I love you today but I don't believe, I don't believe
And even now I hate you it pains me to say
Or maybe it's you and your sick need to give love then take it away
I will always love you
And I half run away to sleep
Isn't it funny how we don't speak
I am outside and I've been waiting for the sun
They want you or they don't say yes
What's so easy in the evening, by the morning's such a drag
You learned the hard way to shut your mouth and smile
As she begs for her fish from the water
You still sound like a song
And there's no doubt he's at home in his room 
And like a deer in the headlights, I meet my fate
The last place we left off
I will tell them of your ghost like a thing that never, ever was
And settle, two kids and a swimming pool
Don't want you thinking I'm unhappy
To this heart alive try, try
Well, hell, you, can I take you home
Screens my words but I will hear them
But once we're gone, who's gonna care
And lie here on our bed of leaves
I found you here, now please just stay for a while
And walking away at the dark end of day
The monster your mother made you to be
The palm trees swaying in the wind
Maybe you'll rest sometime
The ghost of your smile was seen on a body in the park
Your face against the trees
You leave with everything I am
Hey little train Wait for me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be
So keep breathing
Adia, I do believe I failed you
I lost my mind, I lost my life
When people run in circles it's a very, very mad world
Why'd you fill my sorrow
Wondering, the change you'd bring
And so you told me I ought to be leaving
I wish nothing but the best for you 
We're the coolest kids and we take what we can get Wait forever
But a lot of people think he's fine
That's why I try to keep at bay
But I know how you feel, I know how you feel, when no one cares
With anything to keep the thought of you from my mind
Booze in my hair, blood on my lips
 Since he's | Senses  lying dead on the floor
It'll be those who gave their island to survive
It's filled with so much color and the laughter we left behind
I hope you know it was never to you
Like empty promises
But I don't want to be alone
Looking kind of anxious in your crossarmed stance
Round here, we all look the same
But you have always keep passing me by
It's a violent night, there are boxers in the street
I'm down to just one thing, I'm starting to scare myself
Sea salt tears, swimming 'round as the rain comes down
Eyes of stone observe the trends
You can go, you can stay
Bones Boy talks and flickers grey
Hold on this will
I was speaking soft, see the pain in your eyes
Where the highway met deadend tracks
Worn like a mask of selfhate
When we were children we played
Two hands digging in each others wounds
A little bit of heaven but a little bit of hell
It's under, under, under my feet
Would I could afford to buy my love a fine robe
It's the loudest sound
Dreams of a face that is pure perfection
Why are children always first
Papa was a rodeo 
All I think about is you
I just want to find where you are
Now there's red spray paint slashed on the wall
He freely gave to charity, he had the common touch
I always wanted that myself
I don't feel the joy
I'm not ashamed to say I cried for you
Got your bible, got your gun
Just walk on
Far from his room, the familiar perfume
Wish I were capable of lying sometimes
I could say it, but you won't believe me
Cause nothing feels like home
A haunted man who can't outrun his ghosts
But there ain't no way I'm ever gonna love you
It's worn for protection, nobody gets in and nobody gets out
The everything that takes you back
And I'm underlined already in envy green
Was hypnotized by a strange delight
And what did I do that you can't seem to want me
Always failing to remember why we came, came, came
And I have no idea where else my heart could have been
I was just thinking that I have been missing you for way too long
I found somebody 
LA lights never shine quite as bright as in the movies
And maybe get some sleep tonight
And I'm waiting for the day
Somewhere far beyond this world,
I heard you found some pretty words to say
You are mine, I am yours
And all I ask you is for another chance
Headlong without a thought
I cried enough tears to see my own reflection in them,
The lesson she learned when her memory serves
Mary, you shouldn't let it make you mad
So I can feel infinity
"I think I'm old and I'm feeling pain", you said
Three wasted years, wasting time
There is no night time, only a passing phase
No wonder I'm scared
Her sweat, it tastes like sugarcane
The mirror when I'm on my own
These are the dreams I'll dream instead
Trudging back over pebbles and sand,
Sharing pillows and cold feet
He beat her cold
I'm warning you
When it's you I'm dreaming of
Floating on the body, floating in the Dalles
Now the man of the hour is taking his final bow
Waiting for sedation to disconnect my head
Where we captured all the fireflies
Oh, when she calls, I do not walk, I run
Sketch the trees and the daffodils
I am a tree reaching for the sun
Well, is it true what they say about the Son of God
That you just don't love me
So you sailed away into a gray sky morning
You don't know how lovely you are
But nothing I can say will change anything
Oohhoo, ooohooo
Don't leave my hyper heart alone on the water
Into something I am not recognizing
But like always, I let them go
Puts on her makeup, puts on the new dress
So by the morning light
And I love nothing
The day our house collapsed
You can plan for a change in the weather and time
They're playing "Chasing Cars" and I thought of us
Cause lord knows I could use a warm kiss
Everything I do I'd give my heart and soul
Goodbye, goodbye
And my broken telepathy
Can I stay and say nothing at all, at all
They painted up your secrets
That I can't shake those memories
Up the stairs to her apartment
The parks lay empty like my unmade bed 
Afraid to find out that you're alone 
When she'd say
You left me hanging from a thread 
So why'd you fill my sorrows
Feeling together, believing whatever my love has said to me
Only to find, I've come alive
Now and forever･･�
You'll be a real good listener, you'll be honest, you'll be brave
Hate me in ways, yeah ways hard to swallow
You don't want me back
May your love never end, and if you need a friend
You know there's nothing I wouldn't do
And my bruisecolored eyes peeled
Need a change
Bring in the past with the postcards you send for me
What am I sayin' here
You were always brilliant in the morning
I tell my love to wreck it all
Look at my hands
Where'd it go tonight the sun shall see its light
Good love
You are "just another girl" 
And they were all born pretty in New York City tonight
My love A kiss goodbye before you leave
But its far away, it's in the distance
They press their lips against you
The days are long now
I'm in a car
Maybe I'm wasting my young years
Shared my body and my life with you
Try to pretend to laugh
And baby cries he cries his eyes out
Call up on Geezers to rid these green trees
Cracked up years ahead are all I see
City bird, haven't you heard
I never thought my whole life would change
Throw on your dress and put on your doll faces
O can you hear the song of thunder
So don't cry Delilah 
you're spending all your nights growing old in your bed
And so it's crying on my shingles
And we'll run for our lives
I got a beauty queen
I drink a little more than recommended
Without talking
Leads to one mistake
I have seen death
Rejoice, rejoice
That the clock is ticking,
You make it hard to smile because
Now that I turn
And the third is almost fallen 
But no split hair�s gonna get me down
Let me drain
There's wealth in the bank but there's nothing to show inside
They never wanna hear you say
And a shadow is cast on devotion
You want to fuck some other women, now
And that's the way this wheel keeps working now
I don't want to hate
You crying, tragic waste of skin
Now I've been sent to my room, I've been sat in a chair 
Unless a light bulb really loved him very much
And let it out
Through still and storm
When you hide, hide inside that body 
Before I open up my arms and fall
Not the foolish, not the wise
Resonates a note
You right where you are, from right where I am
'Cause our love's the slowestmoving train
Not to search for, not to love
You lower yours and grant him one last choice
To hold off the real slaves, paid off and staid
And when I come home, yeah I know I'm gonna be
And all I really ever need is some love and attention
Don't know if our fate's already sealed
Every bag, every blouse, every bracelet
Not too sure how it feels
They never say, forever gaze, if only
It's just us my love 
Today I saw my father standing in the graveyard
And I'm not sure what the trouble was that started all of this
I made wine from the lilac tree
We'll float in space, just you and I only fools rush in
You've not heard a single word I have said
You won't open up; It tears me up
I'm here for you to use; broken and bruised
Happy holidays, sad sick savior
I felt much of the pain
We were only freshmen
Things cannot stay the same
I play the ones from yesterday
So a love is lost, a love is won
Far away where nobody knows
All the times, when I felt insecure, for you
And it's going to carry on
To shoot the breeze, love again
Such a lonely day, and it's mine
I tell you that I'll always want you near
Last night I had a dream that I was in the graveyard
You'll return
Have we lost all the love that we could share
Oh, unbreak my heart
There's proof in the sky
It doesn't hurt me
Her name was Naomi
And I'll lie to keep her happy
I may not seem like very much
So I'd like to start this one off by saying
Poor old Jim's white as a ghost
And still you chose to do without
It's four in the morning, the bars are unloading
Is it weird to be back in the south
And I miss you love
Sorry Sorry, but I can't just go turn off how I feel feel
They've got me on some medication,
�だ�しlove song
Seasons are changing
Stare as I hang, it's all the same
Brought down like an old hotel
No I opened my mouth and I tried and I tried
And the rain turned into tears upon your face
But I don't see and I don't feel
This shit it's making me tired
She has every reason to
There's something missing in my heart
But lost is meant to be
She was so young with such innocent eyes
All you have to do is cry 
Take me to that summer past
Sorry if that's sweet but it's tomorrow's hope
I'll be your super queen and make you
Taste my need
To shift my point of view
I waited for the remedy
we trip on excess steps
That the angels have slipped through our landslide
No one, knows where the shore is
Dead roses
Heartache calling me
Maybe then you'd know how I feel 
Buy a bigger house and live in the suburbs
What if there was no light
That like chasing through your misses
He's come so far to find no truth
Let me know I'm just on the outside
You're telling me that we live too far to love each other
A hotline, a wanted ad
And Amie come sit on my wall 
Softly we tremble tonight,
Anything
That has you choking on the truth
Oh, distance has no way of making love understandable
Then what'd you say forever for
Don't talk to me, no
In the backyard of a friends place
Gravestone
Had I known how to save a life
Coming towards her, stuck still, no turning back
Everywhere you go red roses follow
I will return here one day
White walls surround us
There's room at the top, they are telling you still
Easily enter my body
Come come to me
Like spun glass in sore eyes
Go take your economy car and your suitcase
Her eyes are basking in the sun
The hollow triumph of a tree 
Just let me love you
Her skin is white,
The littlest things that take me there
'Cause all that's left has gone away
The most loneliest day of my life
I will light a match this morning so I won't be alone
I got so, got so
No distance can separate
He too understood and felt her pain,
I thought it less like a lake
This sickness has no cure
Though I still believe in everything
We might as well be strangers Be strangers
Once I was a hunter
And why leave me sailing in a sea
But I didn't understand
If Heaven calls, I'm coming too
Lie to all your friends
And an old chest of drawers
Things are never gonna change, mm mm
Fly through my dreams
On everything from how I act to what I say
I'll come, come, come
And all the time I waste 
You can say you're the first to know
I've got the feeling we're gonna die
I don't want to be cold
I could stop and answer all of your questions
Can't help but wish that I was there 
Lighting up a smoke
Nothing surprises me anymore x
I'm like a child looking off on the horizon
Love in our life is just too valuable
I've had enough, of this town
That little kiss you stole; it held my heart and soul
She'll always have a place in my mirror,
Everything's gonna be alright
And then we can trade places, play musical graves
Mother I lost it, all of the fear of the Lord I was given
I wish you would've grabbed the gun
'Cause I want to be a good woman
Someone mawed and put my cock in
Maybe I'm not up for being a victim of love
Now you're in my arms;
Oh my love, oh my love, oh my love
Or laughing at your jokes
It never ends
On my own in a separate sky
I didn't really know what to call you, you didn't know me at all
Our love, our love, in a ball of yarn
To carve my own and set it free
Ooh, it's so typical, love leads to isolation
New York is cold, but I like where I'm living
Because these days aren't easy
'Cause I let you stay
It's a shame what your father did to your brothers head
Sweet Sunday morning, with nothing to do
Last night I heard my own heart beating
But is still a chair
And live with what I did to you 
The seasons are positive, negative, positive, negative
You won't talk me into it next time,
I still think we should meditate
From the slavecatchers' songs
And when they asked us how we knew his name
You get a phone call from the queen with a hundred heads
And those who fear are lost 
And we were dreaming,
I got a feeling that I want to live, live and live
I try to stay busy
My words just break and melt
"I will always love you"
Why don't you come home to me
And don't you know I'm not your ghost anymore
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah
But I could've told you, Vincent
Listening for patterns in the sound
And I can't fight
I open up my wallet and it's full of blood
You turn every head but you don't see me
You take My hand and pull me next to you, so close to you
It can tear your soul apart
My heart is frozen still
I have a feeling you don't know what to do
You can tell everybody
And no more will I say, dear heart
And visitation time
To my loved ones today
A sly curse
She holds the blood, she carves the knives
Remember when we used to look how sun sets far away
And meanwhile heavens falling
Bring down the government
Either way I'll cry with the rest of them
From last night tears
That you'll call later on
And I won't tell the lie"
How could I be losing you forever
Just tell me why you had to go back
She's at the edge of the bed, she gets in
When you are lost
Around, broken in two
Only bones
Who turned your way and saw 
I had to try to keep my mind outta this
There're some things that I should never
And my father and all of my family rise from the seats to sing Hallelujah
How I wish that it was forever you would hold us
We're all the losers
I hear Brenda's got a baby, but Brenda's barely got a brain
You'll never dream again
Then those around who care
Now I can't let go of this dream
With my salty tears
I can't think of what they're for, oh, they ruin me every time
Find the grace to be nothing at all, at all
Am I the only lonely one of you
They had a master plan, wanted to tear us apart
But I forget which door I came through
Where will we go when we get old
That what we had could make us feel alive again
Don't look back you're safe now
Feel so fucking angry, don't wanna be reminded of you
The window sill
She's twelve years old, guess she's havin' a baby
There were people, standin' all around
The rusted signs, left just for me
I hear the beat of my heart getting louder
Woke up and before they went back to sleep
And it will make you more aware with its absence at night,
And up those stairs, in that little back bedroom
We might make love
That I have torn her apart so many times, so many times
Teach me of honest things, things that were daring 
To hear you knocking at my door
Once divided and nothing left to subtract
I guess I should
I keep holding onto you
Only an echo, just skin and bone
Out there in the spotlight
Still it's so much clearer
Well, she was my catatonic sextoylovejoydiver
One is the loneliest number
Try, bleeding is believing
And the sidewalk holds diamonds like a jewelry store case
The snow in Montana was three feet high
I know you'll come in the night like a thief
You know that I'm always right
Turning the clock back,
I know that I can't take back all of the mistakes
Everything had changed, around me, mhmm
And build a new reality
Afternoon, there's always something happening
Nothing left to lose
Don't you say hi
You hate the way your life turned out to be
How did I get here with you, I'll never know
Well I guess I'll go home now
I'm going through changes
How can we go forward into something we're not sure of
We die forever
God, please bring the rain 
Screaming at the moon, another pastime
So don't leave me here with only mirrors watching me
Just a fading fucking reminder of who I used to be
Cause the sun it seems to sink now
All the times, that I felt like this won't end
And now he's guiltstricken, sobbin' with his head on the floor
For now its just another lonely day
To cover the thing he was scared of
Dance by the light of the moon
Is my heart breakin' on me
I could spend a hundred years adoring you
Because the road is clear 
Got no reason yet to die
I missed my stop and went round again
Our hands are in the branches
But when I look into your eyes, it pieces up my heart
Or felt a part of this human race
'Cause I can't say no
Pain is a warning that something's wrong
Head of someone 
Bought myself a hard pack of cigarettes
Seems that I'm always
We seem to never end 
And things that we could never do
We've gotta get out
I'm supposed to love you back
Searching to feel warmth forever more
The promises you'll only make
Suffer my desire
Lightning on the river and you're shivering
And surely that ain't right
Sparks are swirling faster
All the stuff you left me with
It hurts to be here
My favorite dreams of you still wash ashore
Of apple juice in the hall
Somebody threw that brick
Your mind aches
I am lost
These people aren't your friends
They were friends of mine
On a big town avenue
And you appear just like a dream
Oh, I cut his hair myself one night
These look well speckly, bit of green and blue,
All eyes turn hollow
And it hurts even more to have to be with somebody else
I feel you in the wind
But nobody ever hears him
While I hope that she won't come home
They watch their city change
They circle in sunlight
Never fall in love with potential
I'm sorry for what I did
You're all getting drunk instead
I caught myself thinkin'
Your face saving promises
They're mopping up the butcher's floor
I don't know how to say
I'm too tired to fight your rhyme
Picking up astral signals
I think there's a heaven where some screams have gone
Later in the dark
In shattered pieces that may never be replaced
How it's gonna turn out
All walls are great, if the roof doesn't fall
They're saying "You've got one more chance to do right," and it's tonight
But who could love me
You spin around me like a dream 
You made my body feel heaven bound
I feel estranged every now and then
That you're gone
So let me fly
When the sun comes down
Lots of love, just keep it comin'
That dream of Paris in the morning or a New York window view
A black sheep boy grows horns
I never really thought that I was lost
So I'm done whispering, done whispering
All the strange things
I'll run free too
But someone, they should have warned you
To pay me and the one I love
Are you sitting in the lights
Earthquake in your pajamas huddled in doorways
This was my worst love; you'll be the first to go
Des malentendus
And I hope you're thinking of me
Baby I was naive, got lost in your eyes, and never really had a chance
Though it comes as no surprise
Crying tears of goldlike lemonade
When the dreams, and the words started falling down
Don't wanna try don't wanna try I 'bout just had enough it's been a rough road
A fool of everyone
I just came to talk for a while,
And nobody's watching you now
Rain, rain, go away
And shots were fired
These aren't tears of sadness
And I can't face the evening straight
I even got a tattoo of your name across the chest
When you're gone
When your birthday passed, and I didn't call
Too many years built into memories
He was someone I could learn from
And the snow had turned to rain
It's the simple life for me
She's afraid when the sun returns
Someone else is gonna come and clean it up
And now you say you're leaving California
With promises that might come true for a while
And I walked the sea forevermore
Nobody near
And you feel like such a knowitall when you only want just a tiny girl
Gimme something sweet
'Cause I saw the end, before we'd begun
Why are you staring into outer space crying
I know I've been mistaken
Love is love's reprieve
It's ripping me apart
Ha ha ha You died out long ago
It gets hard to explain
We're not the same, dear
"Well you do enough talk
No, I won't be seeing you for a long while
Where I can shelter in peace
And all the words we said
It'd come as such a show
By jealousy and death
And back to the 
And as our eyes start to close
I could still feel you in my bed
My goal is to reach your hands any day now
I'm done with this, I'm counting to ten
I will be the same but older
Except everything you had and what was left after that, too, oh
Believe it doesn't hurt
I just want to touch your soul
And do you think I'm wasting my time
You look so vulnerable, I feel scared for you
There's nothing left to say
Get up, won't you stop my pain
And underneath it all, the giant was afraid
This anniversary may never be the same
When you left last night 
"Oh whatever he has done I have done"
Until you're out of breath
And let me rest in pieces
I think I need a new town
Afraid they'll see that she's lost her direction
She's leaving home after living alone Bye bye
Seems I have stolen a horse and I step to the gallows
Jackson, Jesse, I've got a son in me
I tried to ask you to your face but no words came out
What are we gonna do Stand up
But I need something that works faster
That these nights when we were drinking 
On her words I don't know what
Feeling ten feet tall
And the sun will come on through
He's come so far to find the truth
Longing from a distance
Not feelin' up to it now
In a space that's too small
And when the house was left in shambles
He's got lines on his face they tell the story of his pain
I'm gonna miss the wind
That I cannot say
Was there a voice unkind in the back of your mind saying
You'll fall asleep
The love will never get lost
You are the blood in my veins
Fucking come on and break the door down
She said while you were sleeping
And I have the skill yeah I have the will, to breathe you in while I can
I'm tired of fighting
To melt the street beneath your feet
For one
Leaving everything behind 
Stand in the corner, smoking
I called the limousine company
It's just a fond farewell to a friend
That feels like home
Watching all the world inwar torn
And old
I was drinking you goodbye
To marry the untold blisses 
Just a turntable to watch
I don't ever want to go to bed
And I miss you still
High flights, inhale the vapor, exhale once and think twice
Back to the good old times
I'd give my heart as an offering
Lord, here comes the flood
estelio han, estelio veleth
Well you are my accuser, now look in my face
I know what it tastes like
Oh my baby baby I want you so it scares me to death
And sleep the rest of the time
I'll close my eyes, then I won't see
And she stared at the world
Now the sky is pink
Flowers and the love in my arms
She goes downstairs to the kitchen
I saw a movie, it just wasn't the same
Oh oh oh oh, riverside
Believe me when I tell you
Haven't they heard we won the war
Hold me
The skyline, baby, is bright tonight
No one feels the pain I have inside
Oh yeah
Hold your grandmother's bible
Tears stream down your face
Driving home the sky accelerates,
And your broken wind chimes
As a man I ain't never been much for sunny days
And I'll come back to you
'Cause I can't face the evening straight
But I've broken all my promises to you
Unkiss me
And for the first time in my life
I can't escape the pain inside
Papa was a rodeo, Mama was a rock'n'roll band 
Children scream, or so it seems,
The neon lights make me calm
I like your questioning eyebrows 
These open doors, these open doors, these open doors, these open doors
She loves me and she knows I won't forget
The ugly truth
Though the marks on your dress
And we'll go to sleep, but this time, not alone, no no 
'Cause what's left to lose
The one that makes me seem to feel much taller than you are
When I say out loud, I want to get out of this
To live a love, you gotta be part of
When life and love turns strange
Are welcome
Look beneath the floorboards for the secrets I have hid
Take me I need your help
'Cause I don't feel so good
It will just go back 
Let's pretend, happy end
We lost ourselves, the love has died 
And you were right, right from the start
No one ever said it would be this hard
That without love will wilt and die
Give them back to me
As you fall out of your clothes
Will always get me through the day
This is our last goodbye
I was your fortress
But if I ever needed you
And pray to God he hears you
If you're not lost
Walked away, heard them say
Oh, everybody's dying just to get the disease
Before he'd ever learned how to talk
But of what you've just become
And keep your mouth shut
I know they're rested and ready
Just like sunny days that
But I will wait for you
But I've done it enough
But now you never show that to me, do ya
Yet I see no end
'Cause you're too smart to remember
On the waves
Every chance that I take
No perfect endings
Swinging an old bouquet
Me with you, face to face
As I burn another page
Find a way to lie
Oh keep me on your mind
Has left a pool of tears
I'm a new baby weeping
You're fighting with your mom again
Some forever, not for better
This is why I am lying when I say
You never really can fix a heart
Nothing and nobody's gonna do me any harm
Ambushed on the road, stole your gold
And in between the moon and you, angels get a better view
I've seen you cry, I've seen you smile
In the name of being honest
"There's plenty of time to make you mine"
Yeah whoa stay whoa oh
And a runon piece of mountain trembles, shivers, runs down the freeway
Now I think I know
I can't write a song for you
And I'll fall on my knees
Leavin' home ain't easy
They were cryin' to the camera
Words long gone
You could keep me up in bed 
There's no recognition in their eyes
I will fight until the end
And now I break to the floor when the old piano comes crashing
I find I always move too slowly
I won't kill myself trying to stay in your life
You're quiet, you never make a sound
When you're walking downtown
There is none to harm
You can fall back on us
I ain't about to die like this
I only think about you when we're both in the same room
I guess I know by now
Just think of all the places we could be
Who will cast the first stone
And you'll add my name to your long list of traitors who don't understand
As we round the corner
Blood on the floor,  fleas on their paws, and you cried till the morning
The only way to live was drown the hate
How we take each other's love
And in this old horror show
But for the grace of love
We'll make it out of hereoh yeah
Now all we do is fight
No you still don't like to leave before the end of the show
Everywhere I look I see green scenic sublime
With the moon shining bright as headlights on the interstate
You've dreamed a thousand dreams, none seem to stick in your mind
But just stay with me
I can't stop this ache
I know all that you need
And taking drugs and making love at far too young an age
Then all at once, you have to say goodbye
So do it with your mouth open
I'll never get over you walkin' away
I know you're looking for a ruby in a mountain of rocks
I'm a sky that nothing wants to fly in
Below the sea
Relief, believe
All alone, I can't mend
And I will die all alone
Because it's time to arrive
Frameless heads on nameless walls
Oh, river of time
She coulda been a movie star
'Cause no one's tried to give you
Yeah then I saw love disfigure me
She's holding her tonic like a cross
How dare you say it's nothing to me
With maps, a mountain range, a piggy bank
Given you a reason to stay
They call her name at seventhirty
Whisper words of wisdom let it be
A lonely road, crossed another cold state line
There's still a little bit of your ghost, your witness
This innocence is brilliant it's so beautiful, it's so beautiful
Can you take away the pain of hurtful deeds
Why don't you tell someone
I told her my story, and who I'd come for
I wish you'd hold my hand when I was upset
Give me a reason to believe
Day one, day one
The harder I push the farther I fall
As she falls around me
Wellmeaning teachers
So if you want to see the future, go stare into a cloud
Would hurt so much
These feelings I can't take no more
Hope in my past
Sleep tonight
But you're not coming home tonight
No need to argue anymore 
I've got nothing left to live for
In a bloodstained sky
I wanna hold you now, now, now
Oh, the rain falls hard on a humdrum town
You remind me
No fight left, or so it seems
My nose isn't that big, it looks nothing like me
No one else will know that part of me
Animal or Angel You were carved from bone
That I'm stuck here waitin', no longer debatin'
Hang and black out together
I said before too long you'll be a memory
Really loves my company
I am in such a mess
I know you don't love me
Well, there was a time when you let me know
Just come over let's pour a drink babe
I'll kill who you hate, take off that dress, you won't freeze
'Cause I've been waitin' for ya, for so long, for so long
So it don't make you stay here, yeah
I miss you dad but I've got nothing to remind me of you
Are you sure what side you're on
He listened to my tears till dawn
I take out the trash, I sweep the floor
There ain't nobody, who can show you how
There is a woman in Somalia
And so I've learned the meaning of the sun
They say that time's supposed to heal ya
Oh but it's crossed my mind
He told me I was beautiful
Maybe I waited too long
I always was one for tears
Or did someone do somebody wrong
You said you would love me until you die
Oh let me see your beauty when the witnesses are gone
So I twist and turn
Junk bond trader trying to sell a sucker a stock
Thinking of the crowd you're in,
With open eyes so we could see
And face pushed deep, reflections meet
They don't know you, they don't even mind the weight
Rain runs over my face
Through the cold of the day
But the water keeps on falling from the sky
Always changing sides
And all this waiting, for the power
Did you think I would curse you
I just cannot believe could do that to a child
Twentyseven people, even more
You'll never change what's been and gone
In my living room late last night
Without a care
I don't wanna dream about
Do whatever it takes to resist the temptation
And if I don't come back
And a tear from your eye brings me home 
We're all the losers now
I'd never dreamed that I'd love somebody like you
But what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too
That could think of dreaming and getting a glimmer of God
You said that you would die for me
Viktor was sent to some Red Army town
But maybe you should plug it with a beer, cause 
But it's time to face the truth
I'm sorry if I smothered you
But I didn't feed you to the cops
Colours fade and turn to shades of grey
At every occasion, oh, one billion day funeral
In the death cell a single note rings on and on and on
All these walls are caving in
And though I may have lost my way
They don't laugh at jokes
Like the tears in your eyes
You swore you wouldn't lose then lost your brain
Days go on forever
Farewell, somebody's gonna miss you
Have faith that when you call on me
I remember a song
Why's my wallet in the yard
Que tu comprendras
And as we say our long goodbyes
It's like that I've stopped breathing, but completely aware
It's hard to explain
And if you care, don't let them know
Sometimes they just get caught in the eye you're pulling him through
It's so uplifting, fuck yeah 
For my land locked blues
Signal when you can't breathe no more
Driving back to her apartment
You say you do, but you don't deceive me
And hands in the sky
I must stay here, in an endless eventide
All the memories of the fights and nights under blue lights, all the kites
I leave a kiss on your answering machine
To my left they rose and leaf
Why does my soul feel so bad
Like I'm inside your life, I'll follow you forever
Like this lone bachelor in me 
These tears, they tell their own story
Whirl around me, make me wonder
So please help me stay awake, I'm falling
Come on baby and throw me a right to the chin
Love, love
Your lips they stay perfectly still
And I have read the golden seal
Almost break you up
A moment one solar flare would consume, so I nod
More than anything I want to see you grow
In the next seven days 
I'm pretty when I cry
I want the world to go away
Fill your pockets with the dust and the memories
See the storm is broken
Dance me to your beauty with a burning violin
I tried so hard to be attentive
I have my troubles too
And I'd never dreamed that I'd lose somebody like you
Boy, you best pray that I bleed real soon
Army dreamers, ooh
And it's dark in your room
But tide will dry, upon my baby's back
I don't recognize this street
The best thing about life is knowing you should be here
Walk me down your broken line 
His collar's pulled, begin to be aware 
And this is dangerous 'cause I want you so much
Once too often I've retreated into the depths of my despair
Secure the grounds
He says he's happy, he looked pretty good but I think,
On and so forth, of course of course
And they say she's in the Class A Team
But a mother's love for her son
I wanna sleep next to you
The joke we always knew
And the friends I won't now make
Swimming the same deep water as you is hard
The government is corrupt
I say I won't be long
It's never over, my kingdom for a kiss upon her shoulder
I'll write you a letter tomorrow
Show me the meaning of being lonely
I just see the sky
I'm feeling strange, I need a change
Why don't you just get into my car 
He probably left her for a socialite and he didn't love her 'cept at night
Hold on, hold on ahh
All of our friends were gathered there with their pets
What have I got to do to be heard
I wish that car had never been discovered
I'd rather die than be with you
And it cut me like a knife
And maybe I'm too young
If my heart's soaking wet
I'm a hitchhiker you'll recognize passing
I believe there's positive, negative, positive, negative
When your day is night alone Hold on, hold on
Can take anything I like
But some things they just change invisibly
I won't let you walk away
I'm alone, I'm alone, I'm alone, I'm alone, I'm alone
Not to let anyone go
And I am the Water Boy, the real game's not over here
'Cause I'm lonely and I'm tired 
Just how sweet it could be
Finding love in a distant instant
With the end surely near
And even though I may seem to feel a touch of love
I played my cards too late
From those old lips to a town where its dry
You'll have to wait
My love is music, I will marry melody
Makin' my own way home
Telling your son a joke 
And I will bear my soul in time
I will look
If the sea should swallow up my house
It's the fault of no one 
But left to hang like yarn and twine,
With eyes that know the darkness in my soul
You see I never thought enough of myself
That's what they want, they want you Marshall, they keep screamin' your name
One thing leads to another
You give a little not a lot
And when you're gone
The ups and the sundowns
I'm wasting my young years
You're the one I need
Can't erase the words so the reality grows
Just for a while want to
Or look so brown
No one gets to come in
When will the flame break
This could be the last train
'Cause there we are again on that little town street
Because I'm pretty when I cry
I cried so many nights
Don't try so hard
Your sorry eyes
We're out of time and I can't breathe x
To your existing family
If you want, I'll try to love again, try
And the wind is gonna scatter it and cover everything with love
Punch drunk and the blow
Yeah I'm weeping warm honey and milk 
Just because you came across it and lost it
Silently sharing the same fears
We both dove and rose to the riverside
Don't know where to look without them
Wedding ring, a honey pot
What you do to me is like a page right out of Ernest Hemingway
A past so deep
Would it be the same if I saw you in heaven
You know life can be long
Stand here beside me baby, watch the orange glow
You, on the other hand make yourself known
And tonight will go on forever while we
It's broken up, pushing us
On the floor, at the great divide
The news that truly shocks
With the windows clear
Come around no more
Every time I pin down what I think I want, it slips away
Sparkled with broken glass
I'd rather fall myself than let you, drag me on down
It's not your fault
Came around, never broken
But those are just a long lost memory of mine
We are a fucked up generation
That's one thing
You'll be gone x
The taxi's waiting, he's blowin' his horn
And I swerve out of control
Yeah, I bet you you will You rap about it, yeah, word, kkeep it real
I could die a happy man I'm sure
Well, honey you're just being lost
On the corner of First and Amistad
Please don't turn your back, I
He is singing in her bat's mouth
That they should try to hold on
We'll shoot to kill, and kill your lover
As bit by bit, it starts the need
I wish I wasn't such a narcissist
I had seven faces
Walk the alleys in the dark
This is the part of me that believes in heaven
Way outside your safety zone
Walk in silence
I'm just trying to understand the way we are
Dahin wo ich sie zuletzt gesehen
Tears and fears and feeling proud
Back when we were kids, we would always know when to stop
She thought that she'd be the one who could change the world
We could go back to New York
I need music
If I'm a dog then you're a bitch
and light and light
In my lover's arms I wait for morning
That I don't know of your sins
You have turned me into this
It seems I only felt the thorns
My goddess hear my darkest fear
Even though I'll never need her
I lived, I lived I loved I loved
My clothes are soaking wet from your brother's tears
And it's really not surprising,
Staring out into the world across the street
Her eyes like windows trickelin' rain
you'll already know the situation 
You are someone else, I am still right here
And all the time they took talking in circles
I know you got history
On this country drive
I'll never rest my hands on his sacred head"
Anything
And I think you should know this
She must be tired of something
Pray for me child
So many lies
What did I do to deserve
And mend where you are broken
He explained how the end will come
'Cause I'm pretty when I cry
I was born to tell you I love you
Seems like you never really knew how to feel
Always danger
I drink good coffee every morning
To handle everyday
When I dial the telephone
Then the facts turned me pale
You don't come through, babe
This shadow suits me well
You had sent into the sky by now had crashed 
Once I was a soldier
I miss you love
Black and on the ground
It hurts my little children so
You have given me something I can't live without
I feel like I want to live again
All we do is try
Share some greasetea with me
We're still fighting it, we're still fighting it
Hurting parts of your garden
My eyes are rolling back, I'm rubbing my thighs with my hand
There are children standing here
Someone I could keep
And take my hand and cradle it in your hand
For so many years
I'd rather chip my pride than lose my mind out here
You feel the need to find some answers
Don't you take this away, I'm still wanting my face on your cheek
I lost myself on a cool damp night
One of these mornings
Come back to me my darling
As I've ripped out my heart and said 
He broke his own heart and I watched as he tried to reassemble it
The truth was unbearable
We have the cold to keep
Just don't try and understand
Just the memory of your face
I guess we're gonna argue again
Say something, I'm giving up on you
Photos show no tears in her eyes
And all my uphill clawing, my dear
If you loved me
You're a wasted face
Everything 
So we say don't let it go
The weather warmer he is colder
No one knows where the ladder goes
Into your beautiful garden
You gotta be strong,
We'll live our lives I know we're gonna find our way
But I thought you would be sure
I'm still learning to love
Took a drive into the sprawl
Same old story, not much to say
To be at home
I've got a hundred million reasons to walk away
Find a place where you can see
Because like dying young, idols got the best of me
Oh he beat her cold, yes he did
And I would do things
Which agrees with this watch of mine
I couldn't love you more
Now I am searching how to get alone
Just to help me dry the tears that I've cried
I'm leaving on a jet plane
I feel so alone on the Friday night
All of New York town
Left school together, went back to my place
And devoured completely
It is so strange the way things turn
Drivin' at ninety miles per hour
I guess my mother never loved my dad
I check the phone again, I call your mom
And she's got everything that I have to live without
Nothing to begin with
Dreams escape fire
My head is aspinning round
I am nothing without their love 
Rage, yeah woo
If you were wrong then I was right and this will be the right time
Lulling me to sleep
How did I get to this point of things playing
Holds her head high, then gets in the car
To losing you
Son, you've got a way to fall
You'd put your hand up and interrupt the conversation with a, but
No alarms and no surprises, please let me out of here
And should I fall from grace here with you
At this wheel I'd drive the earth for her
Oh heart of steel, don't kill thy song
There is a better world
Without you I'm nothing
Only chimes sing again 
'Cause you're so beautiful, yeah
Hope it's nice where you are
A kiss upon my cheek
We've tried the goodbyes
Go ahead, everything will be explained
Tell me you love me
I still remember the world
And now we're left here in the pain,
And the night never ends
She talks about her love
How can I give love when I just don't know how to give
Life goes by on a Talihina sky
But my arms want to carry
And I have never known the plan
I woke up and you were crying
With all these fucked up things I did 
How they run
And the flames burned away
I've got two Henrys and a dealer to pay
I was never told about the sorrow
Yeah when my world is falling apart
I'm working on drawing a straight line
I'm standing here outside your door
Looks like a thousand swirling eyes 
Now all you gotta do's remind me that we met
But there's a lot of feelings that still remain after you were gone
She used to kiss his weeping eyes 
And I love you, I swear that's true
And keep the things you forgot
I ain't got nothing left to give
She buys a new dress for the party
And so I fly into the brightest winter sun
Just tell me you love me
All the things growing up his daddy, that he had to see
I'm gonna miss the sea
It's a place of sorrow but we call it a home
Spends more time with you
Men weren't meant to ride
Let me see your insides
'Cause you have friends
Goodbye for now
You are
It might not be something you would do
But I don't care if I fuck up, I'm going on a date with a rich white lady
Happy glands in the mild issue of our disgrace
Then this I pray to you wherever
All that I keep thinking throughout this whole flight
Flatter and colder
And you still won't let me in
I don't want to play the brokenhearted girl
And so she goes from ship to ship
As I go moving crying the tears
But baby, I just need one good one to stay
Emerging from the gentle grip of night's unfolding arms
It�s last call, last song, last dance
With ivory skin and eyes of emerald green
'This world never stops,' you said
I never knew till someone told me that
From place to place, and bed to bed
And as it fell from the sky I asked myself why
If I'm still here hoping, that one day you may come back
The ice was getting thinner 
I wrote you a letter, I tried to make it clear
I'm sick of the secrets
I wanna talk and laugh like we used to
I never needed you to question what I spent
This, my saddest song
Looking at this world through my eyes
I can't say a word
You don't need me back
He looks up at the sky
There isn't anything that you can say
But what I said is done
I'm all tired of tears
So please understand that I don't answer the phone;
Just in case it hasn't gone
Remember one thing, the dream you can see
All in the end
I wanna get this right
You know that this time will turn all the locks
So you can see me, I put makeup on my face
When we were kids, when we were young
I remember little things, you hardly ever do
I've been wandering around wondering how
Me and Lucy never wanna end
If only I could try
I had hoped you'd see my face
You'll never touch these things that I hold
I gotta think about what wisecrack
I found what I need in you
I cheat and I lie
She was all right but she can't come out tonight, she broke away
My friends, I'm gone
I saw you this morning
'Cause my mind has lost direction
Immerse your soul in love
The eyes of a fallen angel
A spineless laugh
So please wake up
Fell to my knees and I wept for my life
I lay down on the cold ground, and I
Everybody hurts sometimes
Grey areas
Everyone ends up alone
In white light
I won't share it like the other girls
And you'll laugh and embrace all your friends
The thought of all the stupid things I'd done
So come back to your life on the lam
What did you think
Can take away your pride
I'll be waiting, waiting on a brand new day
My best friend took a week's vacation to forget her
Think of the past,
And in my dreams you're alive and you're crying
I'm working hard on walking out
And though I covered my eyes I knew
Is she standing in my room
Say a prayer for me,
His voice is dry and hollow
Through these towns they built to change
Now you still speak of day old hate
Clothes of sand have covered your face
Broken down like a mirror smashed to pieces
And I creep in, everything's loud
There is no one left in the world
Still a little hard to say what's going on
Long gone from the city
I'll turn on my SAD light
Another way around you
Sometimes I find myself alone 
You're still the same
Getting drunk, getting stoned all alone
There's a place in the sun for anyone
They keep you close to me my dear
And I hope you're waiting for me
That's the same way you showed me, showed me
I'll be the one, if you want me to
Sweet lover, you should've come over
And at the gates does Thomas ask to see my hands
Except when you signed it
Wednesday morning at five o'clock
Don't you know you've got your Daddy's eyes
Paris or maybe hell
Where no one knows my name
In my hands, and smile, we will miss you
Some would say a man grows strong
I just remembered that time at the market
But as long as there's a road
A life with love is a life that's been lived
Now I'm picking up to put away anything of yours that's still around
When the day is done
But if I had to lay it on the line
And if I stand here silent, I almost start to feel you fading in
Before you put my body in the cold ground
Still a little bit of you laced with my doubt
So I'm taking these pills for to fill up my soul
I hope it stays dark forever
And now all the good kids are messing up
I'm so tired of America
The last selection in the ballgame
Now there's nothing here for me
You've had your fun you don't get well no more
I'll lay you down in clover bed
Where has my heart gone
Yes and no are just distinguished by
How I needed you
Until you're sleeping 
It's a comedy of errors, you see It's about taking a fall
Spinnin' so hard I can't stand
Improvise, do something really clever,
This bouncing baby boy's now turning baby blue
Cold comfort for change Did you exchange
And I never meant to hurt you
That somebody loved me
It seems are slowly fleeting
When you said that we could make it through whatever, ever
Whatever you say, it's alright
It's slipping away, there's nothing we can do
Get your Tbone
My heart had a crash when we spoke
Just another moment in your eyes,
Strangers are singing
That you're relying on to lead you home
And a bad taste that she left when she was leaving me
And now we're stuck on rewind
Can you bear not to share with your child
And nobody makes us wait
This boat is sinking
But just remember that when I touch you 
This has got to lie down, down
I never said I was perfect
Have you been thinking 'bout her or about me
And life 
When I look at you I see forgiveness
Until the day you die, this is no easy ride
Step one you say, "We need to talk"
Can start me crying
Is there some idea to replace my life
As the daylight comes around, I turn
Then the line will never be crossed
And they smell like sleep
What matters most Everything
And this solitary moment makes me want to come back home
Did you add up all the cards left to play to zero
To find the places we used to play
At another window
My old heart, it's been thirteen hours
I'm starting to scare myself
And our echo starts to fade
Ooh, this unrequited love
Just a little bit of your heart is all I want Is all I want
Whoa, everything in the room is spinning, I think I'm going to fall down,
No more pain
But the apple doesn't fall too far from the tree
And she held on to all she had left of him 
You gave us someplace to go
And feeling so very lucky
Just take what you need and be on your way
This used to be our pride and joy
Everybody knows his name
I tend to lose my concentration
Tiny tears
'Cause you're not coming home tonight
Keep my eyes down below
Don't drag my love around volcanoes melt me down
Your death by information
Behind enemy lines
I get lost and I can't sleep 
So I watched the world tear us apart
Why did you leave me in silence
I'll stay our here all night, it doesn't even matter
Words that scream and bounce right back
And I wish you could have let me know
And all my words were bound to fail
Just died, yeah
Leave me standing in the starring role in some tragic lovers play
This tide never turns,' you said
At some stranger's
I play you're song just to hear you say that
The pavements, they are a mess
An uneven trade for the real world
And washed it away down the kitchen sink
But she used to have a sugar daddy and a candyapple Caddy
Yes, I have surrendered what made me human and all that I thought was true
And don't embrace the past 
What was meant to be 
All this pain, begins to feel like pleasure
All you say is sacred to me
And they ask you how you're feeling
You're gonna catch a cold from the ice inside your soul
But I don't want to carry on like everything is fine
And now you're asking me to listen
You don't see what you possess, a beauty calm and clear
Where did your long hair go
Where you trade in your blues
And please remember me as in the dream
Oh Left my sweet soul
At seventeen I learned the truth
A throwaway from an open grave
The daylight aiming on what we do
To the vengeance of the sea
Sitting straight, feeling faint, an exhausted smile
Not tonight my love
And mine
Gonna make you like the way they lie
How can you stay with a fat girl who'll say
The TV's blaring, the radio is turned up loud
But no one will give me a map
And it's never burning out, Never burning out
My kids were being quiet
As I am soaring I'm one with the wind
Till I let my pride cost me one
When I'm pulled away from you, I fall apart
There's no one in the world who could replace you
And no one should deny
And song 
Hey, come here
Carry her, my angel
To our love send back all the letters
What would really happen if no one ever came
Love is love's return
I would never place my hands to your face
My heart is oh so true
This one last try, goes on and on and on
I'm sorry, I know that's
Holding back the fool again
It was worth it, feeling abandoned
Writing the words of a sermon that no one will hear
I wanna stay inside all day
Things aren't what they seem
Everytime you looked at me
I wanna fly, and never come down
There's no one here 
Just love
That's why I turned away
Dare to believe
The rhythm of my footsteps crossing flatlands to your door
Whose bouquet set a course for bloom without decay
Carry all your thoughts
If there is anyone who is in the sun
I'm shining like fireworks
You don't need to worry about the others
Leave me when you cry
I said "That sounds pretty good"
I want summersad songs behind me
And we will only need each other, we'll bleed together,
In my nothing 
You give me miles and miles of mountains
There is Emmanuel of mothers 
Lover, you should've come over
Body free and a body less, ya
It's dangerous, to be sleepin' alone
I really think you and your girlfriend need each other
All of those nights,
I am folded
It was long ago and far away
Right in front of me
My eyes are red
The many ways I've tried
Oh yeah, come on baby, come on baby
You're the truth, not I
That you stay surrounding me
Sais e minerais, evaporar
Nothing stays the same
A piece of your cake
You are coming down with me, hand in unlovable hand
Shine your teeth to meaningless
I can't wait for long, I'm sorry
Don't you think the colour has gone
I said, "Sir, let's just go west"
Greed's all gone now, there's no question
Turning the sign around
I could never touch you, I think it would be wrong, oh
Out of the evergreen that you helped your father cut away
It ain�t a lot but it�s all I have
Have you ever tried sleeping with a broken heart
And now I am sure my heart can never be still
He said "really, I just wanna dance"
And all of the mothers raise their babies 
And stop pretending that we care
'Cause you and I, we were born to die
Are you my friend when I need one
But I've got nowhere to go
Only yesterday was the time of our lives
No one laughs at God in a hospital
You know that I'll catch you when you're falling down
Just because you got yourself in some shit
Hey yeah
I get weak
I'm half the man I thought I would be
My father's love was always strong
I know I did us both all so wrong
Have no fear anymore
Well I can't explain why it's not enough, 'cause I gave it all to you
She's all I dream
Sometimes I think maybe I'm making a big mistake
Still harder getting up, getting dressed, livin' with this regret
But fall asleep next to me
I woke up and one of us was crying
You're talking at me but I'm still far away
It was my voice that moved the first rock
It's not like I planned it
How can I feel something if I just don't know how to feel
Let me stretch upon your carpet
I steal a kiss from her sleeping shadow moves
And I almost touched your blouse
I was always looking
Soul I'll be blessing you
I don't have a past, I just have a chance 
How clearly I first saw you smilin' in the sun
Instant correlation sucks and breeds a pack of lies
The echoes and silence, patience and grace
Do everything you did
Maybe I was too fat
A little trick I picked up from my father
A time for change, take the pain away
It hurts to face it
What a wicked game to play
With the blue quilted violets across the breast
But when I get to your apartment I climb the rail outside the building
Somebody to cry for
And a photograph of my traveling friend
And now I know that love is dead
But I can try, I can try
And treasure every moment
Once it held laughter
I kissed your mouth your back
But he washed me shore and he took my pearl
You're just like an angel
So come on courage, teach me to be shy
There's a million reasons why I should give you up
I'm missing just one thing, a brand new start, yeah
That's deeper than my pride
How we gonna breathe How we gonna be together
The silence is hurting
Ever dies
All of my life I've tried so hard
Now I've got the needle
These thoughts and the strain I am under
And keep you from the loneliness of yourself
And everyone lifts their head
I walked up the steps and stood on the porch a woman I didn't recognize came and spoke to me through a chained door
I am just a man who knows how it feels
I think I left the faucet running
And cold war kids were hard to kill
That I knew you didn't know me that well
I feel so broken up So broken up
Is it better than keeping my mouth shut
I saw your face in a crowded place
Some words when spoken can't be taken back
I can't breathe 
Every chance
And it's not the good kind
Now highways turn to tidal waves
Will some day turn back to batter like a joke
Or sells love to another man
I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I guess it makes sense
Hour after hour day after day
I love it when you read to me
That's breaking my skin
I walk through walls, I float down the Liffey
I still remember the look on your face
Some of us will always stay behind
My, way home
You want to cross that bridge all on your own
Sometimes it just feels better to give in
There's not much entertainment
I'll take the pain
Torn into pieces
As the sky returns to gray
I thought you'd catch me if I fall
No prayer can ease the pain
I won't try to change your mind
And I sighed and bleeded like a windfall
At the end of the day
To the devil's water
And I'll be gone and I'll be gone
This is never ending, we have been here before
I just wanna hold her,
Seven miles above the earth, 
Don't try to fix me I'm not broken
Make it up and you make a friend, ya
And though you've break my heart
Riding bareback
When you see me fly away without you
What's written inside of your head
And why'd you sing hallelujah
With your eyes shut, you cry in your bed
I'd change back, but I don't know if I can
I'm smiling but I'm dying trying not to drag my feet
I can't be there with you But, but, but, but I can dream
Well come on and break the door down
Defile my life
I walked alone on those Jersey nights, and I
Rain rushing, window pane, oh well,
When your problems seem like mountains
I've worked for so long
Only a man in a funny red sheet
You're the only one who finds it strange
I got some things, I need to say
Put me onto your black motorcycle,
Dream what you like, but you dare not sleep
this dance is out of rhythm
It never was the time to let me in
Take me to my home
Are they the only ones who laugh at the jokes when they are so bad
To make plans
Brothers lie in shallow graves
I just want to hold you just because I can
And we don't want to go outside tonight
I really miss your hair in my face
In search of inspiration
There's no laws or rules to unchain your life
Alice died in the night
And I know you have a heavy heart, I can feel it when we kiss
Let me out, let me out, let me out, let me out
Crash and burn
Golden days before they end
But I don't want to cry my whole life through
He said, I'm gonna buy a gun and start a war
Now this place seems familiar to him
And I can't stand the pain 
For I am the parasite who travels twobytwo
What I've done,
Seems like they ain't never let each other go
Do not say the moment was imagined;
Maybe just for a moment things would seem all right
To let you grow into the person that I know, that I know you can be
Was it just a dream
He dressed up like a clown for them
'Cause he'll never hurt us again he'll never hurt us again
He wasn't my everything till we were nothing, and it's taken me a lot to say,
Or somebody else will
The fear of getting caught
In an moment more before we break
Was a junky, went in debt into his arms, it's sad
I have something to say
I wish I knew just what that means
You can't make me cry, you once had the power
I wish I was your favourite girl
Find it in music
She says, I can sing this song so blue
Mit dir stehen die Sekunden
After all the things we've been through I know it's never gonna come again
Bird girls can fly
Would it make you feel better
She tends to faint at the sound of a drum
It has left its seeds like a tomb inside me
Has got to last us quite awhile
And wait for the lights to go out
The escalator rises as it falls
And I remember how you told me all that you wanted to do
Your name is the splinter inside me
To return to oz  we've fled the world with smiles and clenching jaws
I want you to trouble me
Let me be empty
I'll be around the bend
I think I've outgrown
How does it feel, how does it feel 
It's not an easy thing to learn to play 
Another place to let their hearts collide
This is the part of me that needs medication
All the noise died away
And all of birds will sing to your
Everything would be all right
And all that I write is a grey, grey tune
The city blocks can't hold you
The sun drops
Nothing wrong when a song ends in a minor key
Dream that I'm dying to find the truth
I've gone alone, took all my strength
Older we're getting older
I need
Sore and sick, do you like that, do you like that
It seemed a place for us to dream
You wanted to find Elvis and I didn't understand
But whatever you got right now will probably suit me fine
Are we in space do we belong
Nobody gives a damn about me or anybody else
Thought maybe together you and me'd find it
Speed so fast I felt like I was drunk
Are you still jumping out of windows in expensive clothes
Someone who could never love you
I wonder, is there anything I'm going to miss
And dragged me down at the end of the day
I'm thinkin'
A little boy inside
Call it off, sorry refused 
I ask you if you remember
Oh if you would sing along
In this forgotten space race under my control 
Ooh wild horses
I'm miles from where you are
Drift away into nothing at all, at all
So I take a drink, another cigarette
So please hurt me
And I feel so ashamed
It makes me reckless
While the world waits for an explosion
No one looks like minglin', I can't see her or him
You've got to choose a wish or command
I was feeling sad
For the summer
All I ever say now is goodbye
Some ghastly predicament of mine you'll find
She was  years old and she'd never seen the ocean
And kissed me till the morning light, the morning light
Unlock her name from your grass
Come baby let's drown
That you've come back here to rebuild
Another moment
So old in my shoes
Spinning round inside my head
And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
Blood and tears
We eat them up, drink them up, up, up, up
Because the last time you saw me
I'm ready for my sun to
And mama didn't like it and you and Laney were to young to understand it
Hey man, tell me something
And dead men talk to all the pretty nurses
Drop me a line
I promise baby, one day I'll come back to you
And please remember me at Halloween
She's got her reasons, got my forgets
She pulled on his hand with a devilish grin
Any names, faces, or lines,
Enraged by things unsaid 
Oh, actions of mine 
In the cold light of day 
The spinning top made a sound like a train across the valley 
A little baby fussing over my legs
In my life, I love you more
To battle is the only way we feel alive
Take the plan, spin it sideways
Oh, oh, right now I'm too young to know
All the holes we had to breathe
Thank you for all you've done, forgive all your mistakes
Hear me laughing Ha ha ha
And besides this shit is making me tired
Tell everybody
I can see the tears in your eyes, baby
There's no one left to talk to, honey
A song to say goodbye
It's harder now that it's over
When you've got the fear
When you know damn well that this is wrong
But why should I lie Everything reminds me of her
By the second verse, dear friends
How you looked wet from all the rain 
And it seems to me
Told me I'm strong, hardly ever wrong I said, "Man, you mean"
Crash land, no illusions
I'll tear myself away
So scared of getting older
Every pleasure burned to the wick
'Cause my chemicals, yeah, left me a beautiful disaster
Caught in his hair
See the stains of winter's grass
Before your father hears us
Many of your dreams will be destroyed
Through myself and back again, where I don't know
It's gonna kill me for the rest of my life
I put in front of me
The glass house that you lived in 
I know I should've fought it  at least I'm being honest
As the light pours in
You roll out of bed and down on your knees
Wish I was too dead to care
He might have stayed at home
Father snores as his wife gets into her dressing gown
So baby, how can I forget your love
I never knew what it was to be alone no
I walk the streets to stop my weeping
Forever, always, look to me
Fall asleep while swimming
So tired of the straight line
To the people who you met
And I fell apart but got back up again 
I'm running fast
I never needed words, I never needed hurt,
And know the stars are
Maybe I'd be outside as you passed on your bike
Should I feel fright
I miss my mother, I miss it when
The boy you can fear
And it feels like you don't care anymore
Situations get fucked up and turned around sooner or later
No more his song, 
All the cracks, they lead right to me
I awake so alone
In front of me
If you were here beside me instead of in New York
And I became nothing when I found you were dead
All of the sun is gone away
But in case I go there
Is that I never heard the sound
But somewhere out there across the moonlit sands
I love you though
You know, some things in life may change
I've been out walking
Half off the price they're asking
And I'm tired of justifying, so I say to you
I knew it would end this way
Catskilled mansions, buried dreams
Our love, in a ball of yarn
Out here forever
A man who drinks just to drown the pain
To say my last goodbye
My wounded rhymes make silent cries tonight
I told you, man
Well I see that the world is upsidedown
Shine a light on my life
The way you left me for dead
I tried to make my breathing stop
You'll be a bitch because you can
And if you will, keep me from waking to believe this
You're laid out on the floor and you're not sure
We are anticithere it is There it is
You lying, trying waste of space
'Cause he'll never hurt us again
But the strength I always loved in you finally gave way
No fear of my heart, absence of faith
I found another way to let you go away
With my little red party dress on
I'm gonna walk there by myself
It's to Jimmy Eat World and those nights in my car 
These feelings I can't shake no more
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes
James, he came to my place
But in time things must change
In the morning, at the top of the stairs
Looking at my lost reflection again
A clear heart of air appears as we shiver on the seats
And you said it would be funny
Everything I never would miss again
Cotton case for an iron pill
Want you in the world
And I can see it written on her face that she had never felt this way
She didn't say a word, she just walked away
A voice is calling,
It's all gonna be okay, yeah
But there are things that line my path
They call your name out loud and clear
On a rolled up coat against the window
So help me stay awake, I'm falling
Mr Curious, well I need some inspiration
Now I don't know why but I still try to smile 
I need your strength
Weep not for paths left alone
And man, did I lose you
Every step I take
Trip on fence post line
I can't believe what I had to say
So unkiss me, so unkiss me, yeah
I don't really need to anyway 
He showed up to the parties
Feel, my skin is rough
So I never want to leave you and the memories of us to see
Sunshine been keeping me up for days
And you know I would never hurt you
Don't let your life pass you by
Can you stop, please
That rises from the shoes on my feet
I'm tired of hiding behind these lying eyes
And a part of me keeps holding on
No happy endings
Now that you gone
The librarian and secretary's son
I really need to know
I could be the one
I miss my mother; I miss it when
As if they're someone else's days
Old friends I never visit, I remember what they're like
I'll never forget that Christmas I sat up the whole night crying
Mr Jones
I once was blind but now I see
Ain't got no check for em, if you checkin' in
I'm tired of the weather
It's a long time since I
Something slow
And I don't want this world to shine
I wish that I could stay
I only wanted love from you
And that was the day that I promised I'd never sing of love
Bright waves roll easy and still,
Now, when you look at me, you're condemned to see
But reality sets and you're stuck in this plastic life
Make no difference what you say
Baby up ahead,
So, so upset
I get lost in the beauty
And someone, they could have warned you
And leave you to an empty room
Tidal waves don't beg forgiveness, crashed and on their way
But you don't have to call anymore
A woman said, "I know my son is dead
A hesitating pulse is good company
In loving memory of the one that was so true
It rained for jewelry and for credit cards
I have to come to terms
With thunder crashing in my head
The end is near again
And all along the fire below would rise
so short of air, 
Without wearing a stitch of clothing, we were both deeply in disguise
On closing doors
Until all our cares have blown away  yeah
Don't feel too good
And I can still remember giving in
Yeah, yeah, yeah
When they know they're your heart
Motor window wind
I took off my glasses
Nightmare
And I held my tongue
When you realize there's no one waiting
I will hold the candle until it burns up my arm
Inside you're ugly, you're ugly like me
On the waves of a sinking feeling 
I've been cycling in circles 'round your empty streets
We turn onto our backs and see
That's why I can't love you in the dark
All the papers had to say
You and I have something different
I've lived for years without a life
And when you stand in front of my eyes
Just to feel like you're okay
He was so very nice, he was so very kind
I have travelled the world
The road it winds, it twists, it turns, oh my stomach burns
Of all that is hoping and waiting for you
Everything I make, I only make for you
Laugh about in front of family
As That the empty feeling turns from black to blue
You're throwing it all away at the end of the day
I wore when I was with you
Is the empty, empty page
To change anything
And all I've got is time until the end of time
All the white horses are still in bed
There's nothing left here
There was a time you let me know
A daft life
I am broken but I am hoping
What was it you wanted Could it be I'm haunted
Wild horses couldn't drag me away
"I think it's dark and it looks like rain", you said
One of the devil's daughters
I know how I begin, and how I'll end
For you and your children
A falldown drunk with his tongue torn out
When I dream I dream of your kiss
Just trying to bribe me
I know you have a lot of strength left
Isn't it something
When my father runs undressed
Nothing's quite the same now I just say your name now
I'd rather live outside
You stare politely right on through
We fell asleep on Beaula's porch
I'm coming back around again,
We know to fear what others fear
Asleep in perfect blue buildings,
Beyond the gray sky
And finally see what it means to be living
There must always 
The clock forgets to tick and I the same
That tells of how the seedlings feel
And you sink in your chair
Why's lipstick on the mirror
You can�t feel me, no
Lately I just can't seem to believe
I never thought we'd be here
And we'd grow old
With you by my side
Did you ever love me
My eyes been stung with dust, I'm blind
For things they can't
I'm just trying to say
I gave you everything, what did you give my soul
I know what I should do but I just can't turn away
My sweet prince, you are the one My sweet prince, you are the one
Unwelcome care, and a conscious dream
But he never could get drunk enough to get her off his mind
There's so much sad, gonna flood the ocean
I tried to sweep out all the ruins that my emotions left
What seems impossible Don't hurt me
Never quite managed the words to explain to you
To smoke my tears away
And live our lives, stigmatized
Goodbye,
'Cause no one will hear it
Oohdon't wanna try don't wanna try try try
Got a broken heart and a name on my cast
Nothing prepared me for your smile
Yesterday seems like a, life ago
But I'm trying to take some comfort in written words
Did I grow up according to plan
Wanna tell you that you'll be all right
Among your noise and fuss, I've let it go
Whoa, oh, yeah,
Hear the song our heart is beating to
Round here, hey man, I got lots of time
We cannot even choose a side
There's just a little bit of dust in my eye
The woodland spring has put the darkness from your thinking
Bones and Oogie on a silver screen
The things you've told him all along
The first time you ever saw me cry
In the crowds of all the people
With their cap in hand
I'm sorry to go
Work it, work it baby
The world tilts back and pours and pours and so
Verse after endless verse
I got the message long before you said you knew
I feel so nervous 
That you feel the same
My heart will be unbroken
If that's dead, then the head
I need you now
My fatal desire
So fucking scared, I'm not scared
This innocence is brilliance
You were always there
You remember it all
I said I hate myself and I want to die
That won't dry for many years
And do whatever it takes in your heart to leave me behind
Brother, see we are one in the same
Just down the street from your hotel, baby,
I had news to give the wind
At the bottom of the ocean she dwells
And there's no one road
Now you've seen his face
Yeah, she was beautiful, but she didn't mean a thing to me
The doctor, he asked which way we were headed
We died just before him
Yes, you build that wall
Well, your faith was strong, but you needed proof
And we can sup on summer skies
He waits to hear her say "forget"
I still don't know why we were holding on,
Since you've been gone
Though I never knew you at all
Into silence
That's the one thing that he could never do
Somehow we lost our heads for the last time
Your heart broke when the party died
Your friends flew south many months ago
Nothing I can do
I see hope is here in a plastic box
So come back and we'll take them all on
Burned to glass
I'm happy to say I had better to do
Ride the wind that brought you back away
Who dreams he had you with him
All of your failures are training grounds
And you may go but I know you won't leave
When the words take days you can rewrite and erase anything
Has anyone seen lightning
I'm not sure all these people understand
I tried to call you from the party
Cheer up, honey, I hope you can
I'm not the shoulder for a bag, don't wanna carry your heavy load
Why leave me hanging on a star
Into the dawn they carry me through
You're waiting for something
I kicked in the door
And I'll take you for who you are, if you take me for everything
In celebrating nothing
Some are dead, and some are living
If you feel just like I feel push people
And I'd die for the truth
To lead him through the dark
Save your advice 'cause I won't hear
And I'm trying to figure out
Can't hide what has come
Several times, over several days
The kind that you find when you mind your own business
The love A woman of your kind is rare
I never thought that they'd mean everything to me
Keep on making the same mistake
Wakin' in the dawn of day
I am falling 
Something that's mine 
And for those who think it's heavy
That has already been burnt down
See the things that I've been missing
These things they go away
She glows and grows with arms outstretched
And when we break, we'll wait for our miracle
I wish you could stay here
Your body's cold
You won't say the words
And now you tryin' to tell me that ur sorry
And the moon, it leaves silver but never sleep
And yet it cuts like a knife
In the morning, through the window shade
Going nowhere take it from your eyes
And we've found the music
If only that someone was me
I'm just so tired
But she kept runnin' away from this world
Lili, easy as a kiss we'll find an answer
'Cause black is how I feel on the inside
Now men with purple hearts carry silver guns 
New York cares
If your heart was simple just like mine is, then you would know just how it feels
That she is beautiful, but she don't mean a thing to me
But not today, no
While those around you crawled
I need to walk away from ya
To any sound of engines
Learned to sing
Say that you love me
Days when I still felt alive
'Cause things are gonna change so fast
Make a place for you to land
And three and a half minutes,
The sorrowful Midwest
To stop the ice from getting thinner 
She says that they're all dead
Of the sun on the steeple
There are so many skirts under the table,
My silence is my selfdefense
There's no meaning anymore
Which one of us would be the fool
And live my life, and have friends around
The seasons have changed from the present to past
Yes I cried, yes I cry, I cry, I try again 
Felt like, I was just a victim
You'll see that you can breath without no back up
I will not turn again
This sordid affair is ending in tears
So don't be fooled
Yeah I just wanna die without you
You, take your economy car and your suitcase
Silently closing her bedroom door
It's easy to forget, sometimes we just forget
Nothing left to face
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with
All winter
Just let me bleed
The judge is on vinyl, decisions are final, and nobody gets a reprieve
He lives for love, he loves his drugs, he loves his baby, too
There's nothing left to beg for
Somebody else would have broken both of her arms
That you were just with her, and I'll still be your fool
Cry on my shoulder
How you kissed me when I was in the middle of saying something
There's nothing left to do
Let me tear myself apart I need to breathe
All of these traffic signs and lonesome bars blindsiding me and
It's time to turn off
On the one you're leavin' home
Lay down with me, tell me no lies
Between two hearts
You cried but no one came
Jetzt könnt ihr noch jemanden aufnehmen
I don't wanna feel the pain
Can't find no poison, now I've got no cure
No such details will spoil my plan 
Tadzio don't you fight
I could feel myself growing colder
My body turns and yearns for a sleep
I think, "You're damn right there is, but we can't talk about it now
I will be your angel
I'm singing a sad tune
Skies are crying, I am watching
Near me, I thought you told me
Weathered faces lined in pain
Frozen in fear every time we appear
I need you in the world, my simple girl
'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
Silent all these, silent all these years
I open my mouth and I try and I try, but no words came out
If we would try again
Tomorrow is tears,
I still remember the sun
And I never thought this life was possible
The man with the foolish grin
And wait to strike 'til their backs were turned
This was my first love, she was the first to go
'Til it was too late, too late
In the wind I crunch, I want to die
Lonely little love dog
If you're choking up, take this paper cup
No hope, no love, no glory
But the winter scent in her hair
Need you there when I cry
And I thought that I found myself today
They will know how I love 
Or happily in the the dark
Did you think I could hate you
Get your glad rags on and let's sing along
In my mind
He used to call me poison
It never was the time for us
But now I've got to crawl to get anywhere at all
The city looks so nice from here
Dearest the shadows
Wind in my hair, you were there
Baby, I don't care if you got her in your heart; 
And I'm so sorry
Close your eyes and count to ten
Lifting the mask from a local clown, feeling down like him
Unusual fools
Across the county line
And why do you look when you've already found it
But I couldn't do another year
I share it all with you
I guess we'll never meet now, it wasn't meant to be
What I want from you, is empty your head
So we're speeding towards that time of year,
Waiting for some thin' to break
And tears will dry
Do you care if I don't know what to say
I wait for the good Lord to make me feel better
Could be your biggest mistake
Doll eyes
Sad news from today's call
And I feel all right, so please
Maybe I had just a glimpse of your soul
Put off on your son
For when I'm alone
Round here, we're never sent to bed early
And It's to much for me today
Why, bleeding is breathing
But if you run away I won't be all right
Has brought this fate on me
Around the throat of the one I love
A warm summer's day
I came back to haunt you
Wasn't there something I should have tried
Well I was thinking how it must feel
Outside the cars speed by
In my life, like a song
So good when it ends, they'll never be friends
Where someone's last goodbye
And run in thickening streams of greed
How do I turn this thing around
And all I ever wanted was for you to know
And I could liken you to a lot of things
They laid his body down in a church yard
I'm lonely, but I ain't that lonely yet
Daddy's love makes me whole
I gave my life away
Your picture is far too big to look at kid
Maybe I didn't realize
If I had a bill for all the philosophies I shared
Daddy gave life to mama's dream
I don't want you to change;
Right on the inside
Who you foolin
And only as bright as you wanted me to be
Is there love there, even when I'm wrong
I'll leave them over to your eyes
Hear the crowd cheer
A pity invitation to an awkward house
That when the bell rings I just don't want to go home
'Cause we're just under the upperhand
Ooh ooh oohoohooh
Torn between the lover
I said somebody's got to take care of him
No reason to be ashamed
Played by the gate at the foot of the garden
I get a little warm in my heart when I think of winter
Maybe it's time to stop swimming
And you promise to keep it between you and me
I need you to stay
Cold, cold heart
With her hand in your head
But the wind keeps blowinme around
She says I'll wait for you like in '
You won't feel any pain
Left all my kinder parts rusting and peeling
I'll get home and meet my friends at our favorite bar 
Once there was a man, who had a little too much time on his hands
Since you're gone nothing is like it was
Be our best mistake
I'm not living
I lived, I loved  I was here
On a black I mile
I've got the keys, I'm letting people in
Oh, Lover, you should've come over
How do you turn what the savage tame
Turns us into compromise
You didn't talk for awhile, you were freezing
And now the old flames will pass away
Eager to burn the wooden castle
By the light of dawn
Take your memories, I don't need 'em
Baby, I know the first cut is the deepest
Was an endless land until our ancestors
It's hard to say that I was wrong
You never really can fix my heart
Take a deep breath, take in all that you could want
I held my hand in the fire
And who you thought I was
And who's to say it's wrong
Regard me, dear
Why does it have to be so unfair
Think of all the places we could be
He used to think of her, she used to think of him
This used to be our playground used to be
A family is waiting,
The gardenhead knows my name
Even if I think that you are right
She can't sleep at night
Been kissing me so long, oh
Sew this up with threads of reason and regret
She no longer needs you
Hold on to myself and don't look back
My knees went weak and you saw me cry
I am trying
Miles away from those I love, purpose hard to find
Do you know, who's that guy, 
My friends keep telling me hey life will go on
I don't care
Cause you always learn to hold the things you want to say
I showed up insecure
Oh America, my friend
"Why why why are you letting me go" she says
And all the real people
Na na na na na it goes around the world
One thing's for certain, I'm insecure
Me and Lucy walking hand in hand,
We're slaughtered
And what you least wanted, holds you down like a stone
And you'll never see your home again
Went and had a talk with my boss
When I see you in my dreams at night
But, I'll be okay Is that what you want me to say
Can I let go, and let your memory dance
Don't worry, you won't die alone 
And one day we'll get the best of them
Like the surface of the moon
But if you send for me, you know I'll come
The sun, the sea and I
This loss isn't good enough for sorrow or inspiration
To leave and turn to dust
Spit out all my air
By changing your perfume to the kind his mother wore 
I'm more than a plane
So I'm left to pick up
I'm holdin' on, I'm still holdin'
And I'd been shifting gears all of my life
Like every day, of course
That I don't love you no more
Yes, I still remember every whispered word
That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale
As we lay in the stillness
Force the darkness unto me
And I know, and I know, and I know she gives you everything, but boy, I couldn't give it to you;
And all that followed fell like mercury to hell
I'm a mountain that has been moved
All the battlements are empty
I don't want to make no waves
I knew you'd be gone as soon as you could
Now I'm staring at what once was the wall
Now you need me, now you don't
I put my heart in your hands
I'm not cryyyyyyyyyying
Is it what I need
Wornout places, wornout faces
I guess that's how this one's gonna go I'll be the giver and you'll be the taker 
Knowing all the things you just escaped
Little white flowers will
Things were all good yesterday
More damage than a soul should see
Go or go ahead
Clean my sparkling teeth
The wheelies are cutting pavement and the skeksis at the rave meant
And this loss isn't good enough for sorrow or inspiration
But all I ever did was look up to you
You've shown me eventually, what you'll do
And though I love you
Cast down by an angel 
I got no plans, I ain't going nowhere
The radio station disappeared
'Cause you know that I can't trust myself with my  am shadow
And, I find myself trying to stay by the phone
And put me on a plane 
Played Gloria, talking about Hosanna
As soon as the storm is over
Nothing takes your place
'Cause I'm too tired tonight to call your name
And it remains for me alone
Or happy just to get it done
That's the way this wheel keeps working now
She never loved me back, ooo I know
I know I've been a liar and I know I've been a fool
Figured he'd never let you leave anyway
You touch my hand and start the car
You broke my mother's heart
What would it take for things to be quiet
I've been talking drunken gibberish
Possibly maybe, possibly maybe
Lie beside
I hope that it will stay
With fine winding tendrils
Academic or street education
And you won't guess what he's done" 
Someone good
It hurts to feel
It'll drain the power that's in you
A ghostlike sense of state
And I've forgotten what you've said
this is the tension mold
Ever defrayed your soul
The pants are tight
And empty beds and bad behavior
All my time until I die but I don't believe, I don't believe
It's as thin as our skulls yet it's thicker than air
And all I could think about was Monday
I'm jaded now whatever that means
And hearing the trials of the people there, who's to care if they lose
Everyone around you has murdered someone's something sacred
Haunting yourself as the real thing
Hey little train We are all jumping on
I know you've fallen again
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah
And now youjustfallen
So I drift through these days
All my dreams and all my balance
But all of that was ripped apart, when you refused to fight
The clouds are rolling in
Well where are you now
Would mean your life was over
At four o'clock he got off and you called up 
I will fight until we're the special two once again
From your fingers and your thumb
And never saw his father anymore
Hold on, hold on, my brother
'Cause I am, I'm lost without you
Watch our souls fade away
That I would be good, even if I lost sanity
"Hey I'm doing all right"
A warning sign, you came back to haunt me and I realized
You got me trapped inside
All that's left of yesterday
With the windows all cracked
Hate me for all the things I didn't do for you
Sorrow in my soul
In spite of what you say
A Russian life was very sad
What's going on behind the eyes
I was never, no, I was never, no
I will freeze till you leave
I've been washing the sand
Stan How's it feel to be the man
There is a wound that's always bleeding
It's four AM and I can't sleep
It always leads me here
And did you rush to your phone to call
And it's finally quiet in my head
I never needed pain, I never needed strain
And sets me down in your warm arms
No you can't stay mad at the setting sun
I carry it on 
There's a tear in your eye
You could, you could if you just said you're sorry
But don't bother to buy insurance 'cause you've already died
I've been havin' mine
Been so long since I seen your face
I'm gonna search for someone just like you
Rain, it wets muddy roads
And I found another one
Somehow everything I own smells of you
I brush my teeth, I put the cap back on
Studying my case must have made up their minds
I sing tonight
And anything to make you smile
Arrive in time to catch the late show
When she no longer needs you
I learn to cry for someone else
Then build it again by the light in the hall
If you're dreaming are you dreaming of me
Someone to share your regrets
I'm so angry, I don't think it'll ever pass
When I'd much rather sleep somewhere with you
Personal things
I know people change and these things happen
Where the Iceman's mule is parked outside the bar
You just turned your back on the crowd
Where darkness is the only thing we see, and cold
"Daddy, look what I made", dad's gotta go catch a plane
Just makes me wanna cry
My mind changed me so much I can't even trust myself
Is it wrong to swallow whole
Everything I said, oh, well I meant it
Nobody's gonna come and save you
To buy the truth and sell a lie
This wave always breaks,' I said
Dead men lying on the bottom of the grave
About the things that I forgot to do
A car was stalled, the engine was dead
And I'll put 'em in a letter
And to lie to you, rather than hurt you
And now you're back, you don't get to get me back
All hail the heartbreaker
I can see it in your eyes, deep inside you want to cry
Lost my mind
Like two perfect circles entwined
For the moment, we're alone
But I miss the way life was
That's because I am
Wherever you're headed
I was standing on the wall
As cars and people pass
Then you go and cut me down, but wait
Oh, the corn has grown stalks
Watching you fall, fall into me
There's so many ways our lives have changed
And though you say you've found another who will surely speed you on your way
But she just drops her pearlblack eyes
Thought I knew myself so well
That it makes a fiery ring
Have I still got you to be my sandy shore
So you just stepped out of the front of my house
It always turns out to be a different way
In a bad way, did you love me Do you spite me
Tomorrow tomorrow
My hand doesn't shake
You spent everything you had
Black suit, black tie standing in the rain
We need to talk about it
It's not hard to see
And the snow is softly falling on her petticoat
My dreams are all the company I keep
Two will love you so much
She's still calling around to find half an hour
Burn it backwards, kill this history
At a ceiling full of stars
And I don't know where we are all going to
Light turns to
While you are underneath
No one can
You've been closing me in, closing the space in my heart
A carried aloft by a parachute in June
Someone's talking back
And that bond will never be broken
The weight of the world
The white queen walks
Or to call out your name through my phone
It isn�t any trouble
Don't wanna try no more
How does it feel to realize
At the Bottom of the ocean
'Cause things are gonna change so fast
'Cause I seem to have lost it
We can change the colour
Nothingman
And you just don't love me no more
I was wondering if after all these years
Until he brings out a gun
And are soaked from the morning light
I'm still driving away
When you look inside, all you'll see is a self reflected inner sadness
Something is growing
This time next year, we'll be no more
And yet in all, she thinks that he'll be with her forever
You suggest the struggle goes both ways
When you say you didn't love me anymore
To the soldier who faltered 
But all I do is just lay in bed
Our whole lives laid out right in front of us,
And I searched behind your eyes for you
Leave the world alone and later
Between warm sake
Was everything a man could want to do
To find a little girl by your side in the wood box where you're sleeping
I just want my life to be the same
So many tears I was searching
Looking for special things inside of me, inside of me
When the first star you see may not be a star 
Will I ever see your sweet return
The things we do just to keep ourselves alive
Consider yourself lucky if you think of it as home
As they chart up your insides and put them on display
Well it's alright
But I wasn't one
I was just so happy in your boxers and your tshirt
A summer storm graces all of me
And now I see it's all but a game
The same sky we lay under
"I didn't want to tell you this,
And if you promise to stay conscious, I will try and do the same
And cherish them in parts of me, that savor every kiss
Born into society, a banker's only child
And you may smile when you find that you've been wrong
She told me how you'd died at last, at last
So please, please, please
Time can break your heart, have you begging please, begging please
Radiation sore throat got your tongue
And the dealer wants you thinking
I don't know what I don't know, it's harder everyday
Like the wheel on the wagon you wanna break
You knew just what to expect
To stay away from me 
In the cold light of day
Now I wish they'd leave me alone
She tastes like the real thing
But in the end
Until Jesus comes
I'm a bird girl 
And how can it matter Ohohohoh Ohohohoh
To see those tiny tears in her eyes
And I'll tip my hat to those who can't believe it's me
I got a good one for you dad,
Oh, why is everything so confusing
Take me in your warm embrace
But could you find it in your heart
And there goes my life
Where have you been Where did you go
that always repeats, 
Every little bump in the road I tried to swerve
In a bed of all our clothes
Why can't you see this boat is sinking
Till the break of day
Her green plastic watering can
No, don't get lied to
Will you take what's left of me
I know that you're alive inside
This could be heaven
With the devil snappin' at my heels
And it's so hard not to search
I'm just a tired man, no words to say
You've been my golden best friend
I'm like a soldier coming home for the first time
How long I'll stay 
Among the fields of gold
Broken bodies at my feet
To say the least
How can you love me if you don't love yourself
In their sleep of the dead
Got me ten feet off the ground
Was a coal black egg until the god inside
I don't know what else I can say
But I could not tell what was said
If you just give me a sign
Who knows how to love you without being told
'Cause love songs and poems have all lead, they've all led me to this
I guess than you did leave me something to remind me of you,
I don't do too much gambling these days
These LA lights, no no,
The cars and freeways implore me to stay away
Push me out to sea
We never dreamt you'd go your own sweet way
And God's silence
I need this, I, I need this
I've got nothin' to lose
Long ago she was pulled from the mire
I've learned the hard way to never let it get that far
Well, I'll go to college and I'll learn some big words
It was the summer 
Wild, wild horses, we'll ride them someday
I have no choice but to
How come we've reached this fork in the road
But it doesn't sound the same
But I always thought that I'd see you again
This weight will now be satisfied,
She don't know what it was like for people like us growin' up
I'm not savouring life
I've lived my life without regret
Never thought not having you here now
Show your rays when things come undone
A damn shame, the girl can hardly spell her name
Nothing is taking me down, down, down
It was good what we did yesterday
Well don't stop calling, you're the reason I love losing sleep
Is never waiting for the wings, and
And I thought we could wait for the snow
But none of them is going to last 
I don't love you and I never did 
Burning in the corner is the only one
It's the kinda ending you don't really wanna see
Underneath a winters sky,
Hey, little train Wait for me
When will this winter end
Me and my broken
It sounds like someone else's song
Have you left a seat for me
For someone like me
Watch my life
But she up and died 
This used to be my playground
'Cause life long cracks
Oh when the ice is melted away
Maybe we're victims of fate
Now true colors are showing
Let's get together and talk about the modern age
So now it's just another lonely day
Once upon a summer's day they went walking to the woods
I guess you needed more time to heal
It is the world to mean
Yeah I wish that we could see if we could be something
Can you now return to from where you came
Oohoohoohooh
This face in front of me
Weil immer was geht
'Cause I been caught in between all I wish for and all I need
It hurts to wake up
Ill drink less
Ist es nun still und ohne Leben
I'm not the type to get upset and cry
But you think about yourself too much
Until everyone knows that your smile is just a ghost
I wanna go back to the old ways
My last night's lost tune
'Cause somewhere there's a place where we belong
Even when you died
And won't feel sorry for
And he'll be forever screaming, sometimes I hear him say, on a quiet night, he says
That you need to speak your mind
A sandpaper kiss
I realize what I am now too smart to mention to you
Good times for a change
I got to see the land
But that's all that's left
'Who the hell can see forever'
In the white sunshine
I prefer peace
And when I'm dreamin', well I know I'm gonna dream
Concede to do the work for free
Polly, come home again
A lesson learned to me and you
Now it's time to sing along
A woman weeping in despair says
I still wish you'd fought me till your dying day
Near our bodies unexpected
None of these long legs are mine
Never thought she'd look my way
And why do they always say
Until our veins run dry
No, it's not going to stop
Nothing is important to me
We gotta live our lives
It was so like you to visit me
"Richard Cory went home last night and put a bullet through his head"
Hard done by you
And does he drive you wild
Kiss my falling knee 
I want to hurt him
I just wish that you still were mine
The wrath of millions of thieves lies disguised
'This dream never ends,' you said
And a little rain never hurt no one
So you fed me shit to digest
When I was young
And it's not like her to drive that slow, nothings on the radio
While the limousines wait in the street
So we'll just carry on like always
Don't be afraid my son and trust me,
Hurting ourselves, hurting ourselves
You're still a liar
If I could open up my window
Now, I'm coming home, on my back
I'd be the father of your child
Oh, Caroline, why
Things don't work that way
And we tend the garden all day long
And I have learned that even landlocked lovers yearn
There isn't room for two of us
God please, don't take the girl
Thems the breaks for we designer fakes
I won't call you names
So comfortable, so habitual
This town has got the youth of me
To get you out my mind
'Cause I, don't want to make things any worse
My heart, I wear you down, I know
No matter how I try
Who will love you
Nothing's wrong with you and me
And then I was on top
He used to always cheat on my mom and beat her
That's what liers always try to do, it wasn't me, 
Still I rattled your bones
Faded away with tears in the rain
Angel sweet
But I was caught in between all you wish for and all you need
As the world is soft around her 
As you climb up the stairs
You can tell the sun in his jealous sky, 
And I think you should know this
And the wind is blowing cold
The silence keeps it easy
They should deliver all my blessings
When I can't wait to get outside
How to ever make it home
But it's the way I feel right now
The love My friend
What leaves you crying, and what makes you whole
Standing on a doorstep full of nervous butterflies
And I feel your burning eyes, oh
As we die, both you and I
I'm ravage like a dog and meat
No one will love you
I spent last winter in New York
I'm just asking you to hear me
'Cause there's no one there
I know it's asking for your benediction I know I know
And you dropped the note and we changed key
You're always going to be afraid
And just when I get so lonesome, I can't speak
I see why you left 
I let go, there's just no one, no one like you
I hate to wake you up to say goodbye
I'm of age but have no children
No, no, no, no Melanie C You know it's time to say goodbye
Still the sun can't warm my face
Standing alone at the top of the stairs
Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye
You are me
Underneath the walnut tree
Forgive me this sin
Angels to die
Her love was a joke from the day that we met
No one will play it
Hoping you would come around
Down in space it's always 
I just wanna go back to being the same I just wanna go back to bein' bein', baby, yeah
All the pretty stars shine for you, my love
Or so they say, hey
I'm gonna see some folks who have already been let down
If you have to go, don't you cry
One more night, I dreamed it was a good one
Your blood boiling
Sophisticated points of view
Baby, I've been waiting
Now the feelings are right where you saw
I'm too hard at work 
On all those hooded sweatshirt walks
I know what you'll say
Empty party afternoons won't come back
Are you cool with just tonight
There's a toad in the witch grass
But now you never show it to me, do you
Just to ask them how you are
Sure as it was over
Someone caught us in the kitchen
You touched my heart, you touched my soul
Got lost in the fire
There probably was a problem at the post office or somethin'
And telephones, they can't replace
I'll remember to love
Almost break you
City bird, maybe these hands that feed you need you
To love me like they do right now
You are, you are, you are my everything
And they say it's the fairest of all
We all go to sleep in the same place and in the morning hope that we're all the same
To make me dream of you
Half painful instrumental
Heads are holes and clouds
Thoughts of changes that
These clouds we're seeing
Your destiny may keep you warm
Nothing to hold, all hope deleted
She tied you to a kitchen chair
And the smiling children tell you that you smell
Quote we never talk unquote
Dropping through sky
For all the things I do
How would it be if you were standing in my shoes
I catch the rainfall
Over the sea 
When you want more than you have, you think you need
What I look like
There ain't nothing we can do to protect you
With an old love letter
I make believe that you are here 
Were not enough, it used to feel like dreaming
"Isn't something missing
For the first time that we could drive
You were there by my side
It takes a while to grow anything
And explained I was young, he would say
So please put your sweet hand in mine I've been told only fools rush in
There's an angel in the snow
What's so funny 'bout peace love and understanding
The wind, moon, the earth, the sky
Yes, it shows
As I read the words I hear you telling me why
Everything I went through you were standing there by my side
Your voice is the splinter inside me
I need you, don't say no
And sign up with evil, Angeles
That I still love you so
Torn to pieces by her longfingered hand
Oh my friend, we have all come
Like I was poison ivy
You never said a word to me about what passed between us
My son is married and tells me we don't talk enough
I can tell, I can tell how much you hate this
Oh rejoice, and holy fuck you're bleeding there
And then nothing's left undone
And I'm on my way back down again
When the silence beckons,
His tears have turned to poppies
I'm a star, you're a star
Body of water, toxic and timeless
Well I wish that I was as good as you at caring and trusting
Is that alright
And rejoice, your hair it smells like burning hair
Yeah, still
They told a tale of bad goodbyes
For girls in the eighties
And all the broken glass swept off the avenue
And you don't wanna look much closer 
Adding up hours till her demise, she counts herself to sleep
It's not that I love someone else
Saw the ocean all around
It will all be over, and here we are
And you got down to tie her laces
I've been waiting up for you to rescue me,
But it sounds like bubble gum
On that starry, starry night
And held the darkness over day
These matters be
All my time until I die
I think we've gone, and lost the fire
But I hate your guts
If I'd only knew
My heart and I have
This isn't rain, you rapist werewolves
And the wind will be wailing
Never know how I wanted to feel
Inspire in me the desire in me
There's always an end to it
Und das Atmen fällt mir ach so schwer
I walk home alone with you
In endless circles
My love is pure
I can't get it through my head
The last thing they remember
Baby boy I'm staying here
You walk up to her
If I smile and don't believe
I lost my patience once, so do you punish me now
Her hearts a bloodstained egg
So hold me now,
The feeling that you need someone
They look at you in disgusting ways
The kids were waking up hung over,
Something's been missing
These aren't tears of sadness because you're leaving me
Nothin' else to do but close my mind
But lately her face seems slowly sinking, wasting
Is that what you want me to say
Sometimes I can almost feel the power
And we are still alive try, try
Don't make me sad, don't make me cry
And don't ever think of trouble
To see the empty road at happy hour
Once I was a rich man 
In the night time we are found
Walking through the city streets
I'm in the city you hated
To that voice of reason inside my head telling me that we're no good
Your oppression reeks of your greed and disgrace
But the day looked so bright Bright
Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now  Oh, shit I forgot
My name is Leslie Anne Levine
I don't know what you feel like
I can't say
But when the color goes out of my eyes it's usually the change
I want to taste the salt on your skin
You look in the mirror
He's soft to the touch
But tonight I'm gonna give it one last time
And so it goes a man grows cold
And I intend to love you
The sea would electrocute us all
My mind my mind
But nothing ever happens
Well if we take all these things and then bury them fast
There's distant lights
Skip a life completely, stuff it in a cup
And now the music divides us into tribes, 
Better come with an army
It may sound absurd
And I've been secretly falling apart
The aching kiss before I feed
And I looked around
I love how you walk with your hands in your pockets
I'm not much for dancing, but for you I did
Ohohohoh What is love and what is hate
I only wanna make things right
Can't you see you hurt me so
It's old news
Five will love you so much
My lips are pale plum
Bring me back to you
Don't become a ghost without no colour
We didn't get tonight, we don't have tomorrow
Anyone, caught in your mystery
They might be psycho killers but tonight I really don't care
Don't call, don't call
He and I had something beautiful
In a dream you appear
Don't ask them why, because life is short
What have I done to myself
I couldn't even look at him
You will always be a loser now"
'Cause his momma's fadin' fast and, Johnny hit his knees
I guess this is growing up
Suddenly everything has changed,
In his arms I must stay
Who are oppressed by the figures of beauty
Picking up the ticket shows there's money to be made
Nothing for me every day
To our love send a dozen white lilies
But I'm still looking to breakout
While he's turning around the open sign
See these lines
What am I gonna do while I'm looking at you
I look around the grave
A burst of rain, brief and loud
If you hadn't left me waiting in the cold
Nobody seems to care
Stretched across my shame
Standin' at the top of this huge mountain
And laughing break against your feet
Nobody else can see
The city breaks
Saying please forgive me
His Bonnie on the side, Bonnie on the side
There's only hate
I was thinking that maybe I'd get a maid
Some day when my crying's done
I've seen the brightness in one little spark
Or the lies I'll tell you every time
From the room upstairs
I cry at night, cry at night, I'll cry for all the words, all the words I didn't say
In between tonight I know it's Ta'zo
To take you in my arms
I just toss and turn right there beside ya
Something I can believe in
The Face could laugh and cry
So I won't let you close enough to hurt me
In lackluster, in dust we layer on old magazines,
No one's got it all
I'll hide all the damage that's done
But she's nobody's baby now
All the ghosts, all the ghosts
I don't want to die,
To someone I
And I am still inside you
Now that it's easy, ever easy all around
Get a little bit of Bourbon in ya
Let's pretend, happy end
Then I'll follow you into the dark
Long winded promises of future company
What if I could sing just one song and it might save somebody's life
Say goodbye to yesterday
She was doin' it every day
Here in my hand 
So why am I ten feet under and upside down
To say a single word
Stood by the gate at the foot of the garden
It's got lots to do with magnets and the pull of the moon
And she says it's high time she went away
Always one
There's a kid a floor below me saying, "Brother, can you spare
Sometimes darling, you just need someone else
For everything I just couldn't do
Now can't you see something's missing
My face it's all wet
The sun is bright, the sky is black
The sweeping insensitivity 
And the clothes you left, they lie on the floor
Until later doesn't always come
To keep you off my mind
For I'm broken down
She always dreamt of a fairytale life
Don't call me, don't write
I want to fly in your silver ship
Don't leave me here with these tears
You tell me that you need me
Just someone to keep my house clean
Around you now
This boat is sinking this boat is sinking
So they took the registration and the car keys and her shoes
I'm so cold from fear
Well, if I could tame all of my desires
Do I feel lonely too
Oh I've searched for them across the country
Why would she treat us so thoughtlessly
Promise me the sun will rise again
Something I can believe in now
I'd always want you
I wish that without me you'd be spending the rest of your nights awake
In the storm, by the storm 
Cracked up years behind me
You, you're the lonely one
It could've been me and you until the end of time
Went out, and had a church of kids
It takes the pain away
This brokenness inside me might start healing
All the world is waiting for the sun 
My head, oh
It's not what you thought
In my heart, you have remained
But I'll try to leave behind some days
Where is the madness that you promised me
But she didn't know what I knew
And the storm keeps on twisting
Do the things that you always wanted to
As daylight broke, I saw the earth
The more that I fake it and pretend I don't care
There were birds in the chimney
Even if I make a sound
We might as well be living in a different world
And misty memories of days gone by
Until you are ready to confess
I've seen the movie and I know what happens
And I thought that I had control
You're far too short to carry weight
For you to burn
Setting suns before they fall
For we're like creatures in the wind
Every night I fall asleep
I came home this evening and nothing felt like how it should be
Tell me what's the use of holdin' on when all we do is hurt our love
I can resist anything but, the temptation from you
You just look a lot like me
All the waves of blame arrange as broken scenery,
The time will never come to say goodbye
Into soon the sky 
I'd do anything to have her to myself
And the thing that makes me mad, 
And it's true that I stole your lighter
I'm just trying, to breakout
It's a dark road
Feeling right here in this uniform
Somehow it seems colder now
I remember at Michael's house
Here, silent all these years
No, I don't want to be the only one you know
I see it in the way you stare
Oh but when you're gone
But I still sing glory from a highrise
Far far away a train
But it doesn't need to be saved
Crashing towards the driver's seat
Hopefully, the hate subsides, and the love can begin
Tell me what your telescope says
Down on paperback 
Let me die
Your opinion was the law of the land
What am I waiting for
Just stay with me a minute, I swear I'll make it worth it, babe,
Of everything we knew
Darling stop confusing me
I can't begin to start again why can't I just be perfect
I won't bring you down
But still I don't know why, no I don't know why
We tried but there was nothing we could do
I think I, I believe I
From inside his mouth, I lick the scars
For your information, there's an inflammation in my tear gland
You find that all her words
Taffy stuck and tongue tied
It's not so much a storm
Together we'll find a brand new mommy
Why'd you have to wait
The singer in the band made me want to cry
The rivers carve out your hollows
I want back my virginity
Engine drivers headed north to Pleasant Street
The subway that only goes one way
There are no candles in here
Arms outstretched into the sky
A guiltless twisted lie
Amazing still it seems
It's not warm when she's away
I'm not afraid of anything 
Everything else is a waste of breath
Then you walk, under the streetlights
You and all your pieces made me come,
But pretty soon the day came for change
If I lose my head, just where am I going to lay it
In the shade, in the
Wrong until you make it right
I just wanna look in your eyes
The snow kissed the curb
My body's aching, but I can't sleep
A nightmare comes
Of falling out of your mouth
So you send So you send
And he's talking to me
That way there's no way, I will crush your pretty toenails into a thousand pieces
I loved you in the moonlight
Oh but I know love as a caging thing
Some say love is a burning thing
Tethered with tears in their eyes
Oh, and I'm on my way to believing
Steal the pressure and the pain
It's you that I hold onto
And rejoice, the bed you sleep in is burning
We got California drowning out the window side
I don't want to be the one
And he'll drive
I just want to make sure you are really okay and wanted to see if you were checking in on your medication too
You stay home
It turns to a stage, they're gone, and this spotlight is on
I'm scared and standing right in front of you
In this proud land we grew up strong
She said a bad day's when I lie in bed
I won't cover my head in the dark
Fallin' out, th and Powell, a dead sweat in my teeth
But I�m still hoping for a change of heart
They long to ring bells of warning
So you don't have to call anymore
If we run far away
I don't believe in true love anyway
Someday when you're lonely 
No I never told you
As you are so beautiful,
Suspended like spirits over speeding cars
Got a wounded soldier stance
She used to come and visit me
And anchor this lost soul 
And the other side of a loop is a loop
Done with what we've lost
From breathing easy, and talking straight
At night I will protect you in your dreams
Oh, how I need a hand in mine to feel
And time won't turn
Ah, fool
As someone long prepared for the occasion;
If you're not the one then why does my soul feel glad today
Lonesome was the place where Georgia was found
The sun would stream on the sheets
I should've watched those eyes,
But one was shut all the time
'Cause I'm a fool for you
You will never see the one you love again
As it chokes on a bone
Deny everything
But of all these friends and lovers
Those things I said
We made plans to grow old,
I feel nothing anymore
Says, man, you should try to take a shot
It was a quarter past four
He is waiting to meet you
I'll forever know
You're the sounds I've never heard before
And no alarms and no surprises
I looked over Jordan
Oh yeah
And no one's going to tear me down
What it was
I got a life to lead, America
Broken inside me, it falls apart
Please send for me
And then I'm not so scared somehow,
Weep not for roads untravelled
It was his devil twin
You shed light into this empty space
Talking making plans
It's hard to fake but I'm faltering
At least we both know where the other one sleeps and lets end this tonight
You could have one day of pure and simple happiness
And I now have nothing
Hold on too tight
I'm thinking I can give you a call
Run away from me baby, run away
Send this smile over to you
But I'm not sorry if I do insult you
Wherever you are
As we learned how to fight
You shone louder, longer
Hold on tight
So close, no matter how far
There is something wrong with me
We'll make rainbows at night
And I wish for one more day
I got tired of it day after day, after day
Everything reminds me of her
Remember life
And get him to swap our places
Or let me drink my fill
Tellin' you that I've had it with you and your career
And you're drinking them down with cheap alcohol
So there goes my life
Couldn't, 'cause it's true
She was put to the test
God, let me go
Let Jesus hang and Buddha sit
To hear the time in his mind
Jukebox fuckup hanging round the drugstore
And couldn't see this place could soon become my hell
Look at ya, look at ya Ladies and gentlemen
I'll be alright when my hands get warm
Tried hard to settle down
I've been drawing the line and watching it fall
As time stands still
I like the ivy and the ink blue,
I'm weightless I'm bare
Oh this glorious sadness that brings me to my knees
Hearing no bell from a steeple tall, people all in dismay
How can I instill such hope, but be left with none of my own
Mr Curiosity
'Cause everything is just gone
If we live to see the other side of this
Frozen from the failing mess you made your own
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood
Though I made plans with you to always have time for you
It stops the hurting
When she puts her eyes on
The signal interrupts
Little part of your life you're keeping together
I can't stay for long, I'm sorry
I kinda like it in my brand new place
To work from  to "
"Kiss me goodbye
William, William it was really nothing
I tell her I promise its fine, but she cries herself to sleep
Run, run, run away
At dead of night, 'til break of day
And they call as they beckon you on
The lack of space for the lighthearted
No tears to damn you
And you, you always have a reason
Talk to the man with the reasons why,
You come to bury me
You can't cry
What you're all about these days
Previously I never called it solitude
And things sorta start reminding me
It's horrifyin' right before your eyes
On something magical
It's ink that lies, the pen, the page, the paper
Was beautiful but nothing really was there
And she broke your throne and she cut your hair
You put the good times into my fun
Shouldn't change you,
Hope your're feeling very clear
I know it's over still I cling
Enjoy a drink now and then
In Detroit with the Nashville tears
I look over my shoulder
So won't you be kind to me
Four months of calm seas
You'll know we are equally damaged
Hello, teacher, tell me, what's my lesson
But don't break your back
Watch you burn
You'll be the end of me
Better come
You are my center
And I wanna see 'em rolling, rolling back
The heart wants
I'll stand up with you forever
I was standing on the surface of a perforated sphere
To the sea 
I still love her, loved her more when she used to be sober
Their eyes are sparkling
And I feel that you do inside
See, honey, I am not some broken thing
"Don't stop this train
And sail us to the moon
And get really pissed and go home and have a fight
Or is it mine
Without my love and my best friend
The bittersweet taste of fate
And I've one more night
Only kisses on the cheek from now on
Forever is right where we were
I love my, get down for the
We're older now, the light is dim
No one around
And of your past and new walls painted
Next door TV's flashing blue frames on the wall
World was on fire and noone could save me but you
Please don't drive me blind
Here I am, there's nothing left for you
I was stone, stone, stone in love with you
You're using all your looks that you've thrown from the start
She sees a million stars like holes in the sky
Finding myself in these last days of existence
There's so much hate for the ones we love
I'm so afraid to love you, but more afraid to lose
But some things a girl can never forget
I'm sorry for blaming you
And trees without leaves and notes that don't ring 
Where no one needs a reason
Whole body feels so weak
I put my hand in my father's glove
The nicest man I ever met
What once was Emerald City is now a crystal town
These streets we travel on will undergo our same lost past
And that cold wind will blow
That it just is, 'cause everybody dies 
And I can't live with myself today
My leather glove grips the wheel
Down the Forth, into the sea
And cruel as a grave
In your arms, I was half awake, half asleep
A golden age I know
Compels my hands to do
Other people say she's dumb
In the garden Snake was a charmin' 
Life's too short and I feel small
I see you walking hand in hand with longhaired drummer of the band
Fun Fun is the one thing that money can't buy
You made her think, maybe, I wasn't so dumb
You're there through my wasted years
Are you the now or never kind
I've got no where to run 
Here's two for being unaware
Closed eye and hoping for a better life
swingsets pay
I don't care where I start
All along, not that strong without these open arms
Or is it just a waste of time
Only tears to dwell upon
My heart's burned
You trouble me
And if you come and see me, you will upset the order
The stupid thing that will come to pull us apart
But he won't call anymore
Ever since I was eight or nine
See it almost makes me crazy
And I wanna believe you
They kept the door closed at all times
Let's go down to the water's edge
But they left soon
Oh rejoice, you burned your whole beard off
Givin' me a million reasons
Your face is light and cocaine white
Oneway love I took for ours
I thought you were my boyfriend Thought you were my boyfriend
You can say what you mean
I cry out
So go ahead and lose yourself in liquor
I wear this crown of shit
The angels sang a whiskey lullaby
'Cause I'm sending all the signs
You meant more to me than anyone I ever loved at all
So aid my end while I believe I'm winning
Just come inside
Tell me you love me
And I'm not ever coming back
I mean, I went and found the modern world
I'm growing old and I wanna go home
Our friends say it's darkest before the sun rises
But I was gonna set things straight
Dead hearts are everywhere
The patchwork girl has come to cinch the deal
Three o' clock in the morning
Now I'll never have a chance
Into my window seat electric chair
If you ever find the thing that you lack
Hush child, don't make a sound
I'm missing you again, oh no
So come rain on my parade 'cause I wanna feel it
But I had to start with ya name
'Cause it's broken
Took your soul out into the night
I'm waiting on the other side x
I just had to come back one last time
You still have us
Waiting for the miracle
Everything you intended to say
I'm ready to live with my family, I'm ready to die in obscurity
That nothing is as scary as election day
"But it's just rain" I smile
So you can be sure that you're in control
At the sight of a beautiful woman, they feel nothing but
And when you jump up the earth wants you back
In these winter nights if I'm wandering all alone
I always end up feeling cheated
Let forever
Impossible things
And cry on me, yeah
Can we simply starve this sin
We're glad for what we've got,
Except to those who hide their needs
Don't say "is he gone"
I won't pretend, that I can't see the end,
Push people x
No encuentro forma alguna de olvidarte 
Don't want to go on and speak now of what's gone by
'Cause everybody cries
Sewer line touches the edge of the suburbs
So that the mouth can barely speak
I'd love you anywhere
And you think I ought to shake your motherfuckin' hand
Even though she doesn't believe in love
Those are words I'll never say I'll never say
With the airlift or the rescue
It's life's illusions I recall
You just walk away
Tried to tell you I never knew it could be so sweet
Is all we have to breathe
Who knows, maybe he's not deranged
And when I let him in I feel the stitches getting sicker
And in that bright October sun
My mistake, I didn't know to be in love, you had to fight to have the upper hand
And there's someone who
Come back home from bars
I know I shouldn't look but I can't turn away
I should really hear you sing again
And he never shows his feelings
The shadow grew as he approached the ground
Baby, let me love you
When we're together, I feel perfect
Is that alright Yeah
No one sees me here, It doesn't even matter
A hundred times around
I need you to stay
Is sweet and heady
'Cause maybe something's wrong with me
It's almost over, and here we are
It's your right to shun dependence
The way you lose these wasted blues
Can you promise me if this was right
Hello helicopter, have you heard the news
I had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him
Gonna walk, walk, walk four more blocks plus the one in my brain
Do you brush your teeth before you kiss
They hate you if you're clever and they despise a fool
Oh I wish you could see the love in her eyes
I'm finished, all I know are the facts
The Lament of the Monastary ends the song
To hide deep inside their sunken faces and their wild rolling eyes
And I told you to be balanced
For in death I'm caressing you
Joe turns the TV on with all the lights out
And the moon is laying low
Who has said that my sayings were wrong
We'll carry on, but then again
And slowly finished laughing in the glow of our headlights
I'm always wanting you
But I was made the way I am
And memories like spies
And I feel your burning eyes
How I used to be and everything I'm cold
No one will ever love you honestly
The love The waves you made will always be
Hey, I won't change direction and I won't change my mind
Did you notice when the clock stopped running
But I talk in the mirror to the stranger that appears,
You just stand there in the glass looking at me
Freeze is well cheap though, so I'll take three if I need to
Hold me tight
She walked right into my mirror
I am my mother's only one
All I had to say is goodbye
Walk inside, gets noticed
Can't go with my heart
When they call out your name
In disgrace with a shameful regret
And true love waits
Whenever you kiss him
Here we stand, there's nothing left for you
'Cause if I don't we'll both end up
It shouldn't have been anyway, no way, no way, that's right, that's right
You made an even call
I think that we both need to relax 
I laugh out loud
I'm attracted to the light, I'm attracted to the heat
I promise you I will bring you home
In the suburbs I, I learned to drive
And you painted pictures of
Spat out on new terrain
And I'll bet you are just fine
Well, that's great, but I don't break that easy 
And I told you to be patient
Hear you me my friends
And I'm sad, not sorry 'bout the way that things went
You couldn't be there, why couldn't you say to me
It seems I've stepped over lines you've drawn again and again
Are you wasting away in your skin
Your eyes are just like black spiders
And it's been so hard
This circus is falling down on its knees,
For the first time, there is no mercy in your eyes
Sleep or die
Though you're not mine
I only want to be a relief
From you, my love
And all that ever mattered
Reminds me of you
There's nothing I can do
Ooh, I'd like to go back one time on a rollercoaster ride
But how many times can I walk away
You forced me to become strong
If you set me free I will not run 
You're scared and that you think that I'm insane
I can be the one
And just as your back's turned, you'll be surprised
You played yourself to death in me
When I'm not so kind
And the feeling that it's all a lot of oysters but no pearls
And isn't it sad that you still have to ask if I care
My worries weigh the world
The book of love is long and boring
Stuck on you till the end of time
I need your loving hands to come and pick me up
My insides all turned to ash
All those rather dreary rain clouds still bother me
I don't feel the pain
It could be a joke, it could be a statement
Money won't get there
We are like a wishing well
You know it's time to say goodbye
But when you tell them my name and
Better find the one that fits
My heart don't care anymore
The weight of water, the way you taught me to look past everything I have ever learned
On a faulty camera in our minds
Everybody knows that I'm a mess, I'm crazy, yeah
Everything makes me nervous
I was naive
Waterfalls
So tell me, did you really think
You turn into a song
Two sides twist and then collide;
But if I'd known how that would sound to you
I'll pull out my heart and I'll feed it to anyone
When a good thing goes bad it's not the end of the world
And your wounded eyes
I don't know your thoughts these days
If I let you down
Skin white as winter
Nude as the news, nude as the news
I just want to hold you when the goings tough
Can go home with anybody I meet
But my heart is wild And my bones are steam
You have her face and her eyes, but you are not her
Frustrated fireworks inside your head are gonna stand and deliver talk instead
Tease me, by holding out your hand
Poison oak some boyhood bravery
I feel like a shadow, I feel like a shadow
And these are my many letters
So maybe don't give me cold shoulder
The white trash boys listen to their headphones
Oh, I Thought I knew it all
Just can't take the thought
Oh, my god
Laughing into the fire, is it always like this
And if I died right now you'd never be the same
You'll always be someone's baby
In the sea again 
You said that you would die for me oh oh
I feel like letting go
I'll be forever grateful to
For a quick hand of gin 
No regrets
It must make you sad to know that, nobody cares at all
Try and try and try
Precious friend of mine
All alone, but here comes goodbye
Forever the name on my lips
Menu, write message, so where are you and Simone
I'm falling into memories of you and things we used to do
'Cause I've got noone but you
And won't you kiss me
I heard all you said and I took it to heart
Better find the one that lights the way for you
That you just let me out
You give me three cigarettes 
We always pull through
Wish I was too dead to cry
Another coughing, shaking fit in a bathroom
Wish I didn't know the meaning of
When you love someone but it goes to waste
Makes me want to say
I try to think of things to say
And you treated my woman
Du hast der Fügung
Or the black bear
Her eyes were bright, tonight he finds her
They said it'd bring some closure to say your name;
But it's too late now, I've let her go
I'm turning my cell off, just to breath
Out of control on videotape
As if on an ocean
We'll stick it out, skin pierced for something
Sweet Adeline
If I thought of joining you
Catch up with the sunrise
It was from you, all the times that I've cried
What's so amazing about really deep thoughts
If you have a father or if you haven't one
Together we cry, oh, we cry, we cry, oh, we cry, we cry
Do you cry, do you pray, do you wish them away
Yes yes y'all, to the beat y'all, feel free y'all, it's unique y'all
And I can see you push your hair behind your ears
And it's stuck in my mind
And I never let you go
But I'm going to stop pretending 
To feel the rays, love again
And when we look to the sky
No need to focus
Wonder if she's gone to stay
Should have known what it was like to be you
Inside of me
I will always be 
We don't open from outside
The few words I say they mean nothing at all, at all
And I remember every word you said
Since you're gone there is a heart that bleed
And you are by my side
Don't call me a Contra
Your final coffin nail's been driven far too much
Somebody, please help me mend my broken heart
She led him upstairs, she led him upstairs
Never meant to cause you no pain;
I'd do anything for you, anything for
I got a job that pays all our bills
Shoot myself in a different place
Oh, I hope one day you do
Oh, someday baby, someday
Ooh, yeah, yeah
You make me cry
So I'm embedded in the frost
Do it all over again, it's always the same
Will you let me in
Pretty face, ugly mouth
Washing you out of my hair
Into the hills and looking down
Tear me to pieces, sell me for parts
Music when the lights come on
Dancing around in your old suits going crazy in your room again
I was just thinking, merely thinking
When I'm lonely
I read the signs, I got all my stars aligned
It's colder to turn on your side
Ich mag die Ruhe hier zwischen all den Bäumen
Need to feel you on the line
Oh heart of steel, you reel me in
whatcha say
Hold On, what do you take me for
I, can't believe my bones
No more nights, no more pain
And the word says
I thought you were my boyfriend
Head in pain
'Cause she's gone, gone, gone, gone, gone
I die when he comes around
Does he watch your favorite movies
Did I treat you like I did
It's gonna kill me for the rest of my life
So can I please
As I'm staring at Alpha Centauri
Think of all the people we could meet
I mean, if I get sidetracked
Please don't forget me or cry while I'm away
At every occasion, once more, it's called the funeral
I walk the water
Please look at me, oh please look at me, my love
When you feel so tired but you can't sleep
Daddy I've got nothing left
Just a product of my childhood
I wish I had missed the first time that we kissed
Come back and say you love me
I've come to realize we all have our place
I am done
That in time things would change
Mourning our way home
I guess we always settle in and we know
Forgive me, Hera, I cannot stay
Have you been screening your smokes
They don't just care
And we passed out in each other's arms
Well there's just an empty space
Ever so sweet,
Was supposed to grow old with you
I'm being cruel to be kind
But by then their heads are gone
All secrets and lies
I heard about the cool breeze and the cool nights
Lost are voices heard along
To trade a common comfort for a view
Better sell it while you can
As the days go on and the places fade away
Take off your shoes
Can't do nothing at all
Sing us a song
Have a drink on each other and call it a day
Time can come and wash away the pain
Just keeping the peace between the sheets
And realized I loved you in the fall
This feeling's running out the door
To love me
Some people take her for granted
No no I can't change
Tyres that grip in the wet, shot of baby strapped in backseat, a good memory
Let's hear what you think of me now but baby, don't look up
I need your affection all the way
Your heart is not open, so I must go
If you're so very good looking
Midnight late last week, my daughter's diary
My head is empty
But I could never seem to say
But the water keeps on falling from my eyes
The world in my hands
What do they keep on fighting for
That changed its mind on me,
All the stars are burning for you 
Then suddenly, things seemed to change
The vodka tongue that spits it out
There is nothing as lucky
And you don't need my secret midnight call,
In a brick yard, it's raining up in heaven
Feeling scared today
It's the same way you showed me
Stay wit the rats cause the rats is real
I promise that I won't bite
But no bonds can hold me from your side
The smoke, it sank into my skin
Let me take my fall
We watched the horses run their workouts
I'll never know what we were fighting for,
She was raised in a New England village
The caravan comes back for me
But all our love 
And I was hanging on the words some poem said in '
Next to his name
Maybe something's wrong with me
'Cause I don't think you see the places inside me that I find you
This Martian ends her mission
You say that "things change, my dear"
I'm feeling things are about to change
I'm gonna write a song
A year ago today we stood
You will have to say goodbye
The pieces are only as good as the whole
You needn't be
So you found a girl who thinks really deep thoughts
'Cause I had to say goodbye
Blackened stones, I beg you, speak
I was born, born
And you'll realise that you love me
Babes, old bags who say
And get away from this place
mis dias sin ti son tan absurdos
This splintered mast I'm holding on won't save me long
If I died tomorrow
We are shadows
Ultraviolence Lay me down tonight
It's ok, don't need to say it
My friend
Fill these spaces up with days
Home now, end of the night
I feel me slipping in and out of consciousness
This life could be the last 
I feel like goin' home
Ichabod Crane with that motherfucking top off
And the distance is quite simply much too far for me to row
I'm nothing much I know it's true
And they can't help me make amends
Said, "I died for you one time, but never again"
And you'll fight it, you'll go out fighting all of them
Tomorrow's gonna come too soon
This is life, life immortality
Tell me that you'll wait for me
I have seen peace
Let me burn it all
Now we're tired, battered fighters
I've got some imperfections
But I'll show how I'm feeling until all the feeling has gone
I want you so much but I hate your guts
Wrap me up, unfold me
All these pieces 
And strangers break their promises
We dry soil, heartmill
Cause it will come back to you
When the night shows
Snare another pill and
And they took all their things
Just tryin'a find my way, some way, oh I, oh I, oh I
How did we ever go this far
I've been waiting for you ever since you've been gone
Fell off the hay bales I'm over the rainbows
When I loved you
Take a leaf of paper draw your mind
Round and round and round and round and round
You didn't know how to react to being seen
Than the strength he had to get up off his knees
This is the way that we love
Worth a righteous one
If there's one more chance for us here tonight
It's not mine, but I want it
Something's different
Oh, my love, at least we had it
Don't let me let you go
I will set the mirror up to face the blackened sky
Through the dark
Ask the moon
Of the place we heard that everything would be
A rush of blood to the head
I I I I I was robbed
Right here like a storm left over 
There's things I can't imagine doin'
Searching for the things to say to keep you right here waiting
It was dark as I drove the point home
Set down with due care
As if I'd rather be alone with me instead
Only get closer 
Swear I haven't got a clue
Gentle moon
All the things that I wanna do over
One more time, let me kiss you
Doch der Abend wirft ein Tuch aufs Land
Did you think that the night would posses us,
Someone to have, someone to hold
Too dumb to fight, too dumb to save
In the shadows buried in me lies a child's toy
We'd share a popcorn and we can go to the pub at night
I'm going back to the start
Or combing your hair again,
To my nightmare with the devil
To see the way that light attaches to a girl
But there's someone who's torn it apart
An idea from an another man's mind
You're the Christmas promising the Summer
Bring it on and bring it strong
I should be laughing right now
And we would only need each other, we'd bleed together,
Flowers in the love of my arms
But fresh lilaced moorland fields
Beneath the sheets of paper lies my truth
Have you put them aside
And your mother got scared and locked the door
I didn't feel pain, 'cause no one can touch me
It might be everything I've waited for,
I couldn't find a friend around
For a moment, I didn't need you
And I look over me like a doctor looking for disease,
Go down to the outlet once again
Everybody knows that I'm the best, I'm crazy
And I got the point that I should leave you alone
and it feels like it's snowing
Exciting and new, shameful and true
That's why it hurts so bad to hear the words
And take it from someone who's been where you're at
And I can be one too
I only did what I had to
How amazing it feels just to live again
I too am tired now
So help yourself to this bitter pill
And somehow you left me neglected 
Your hair and dress in ribbons
Leave me to die, you won't remember my voice
'Cause I can't imagine my life without you and me
Our hands will not be taught to hold another's,
While you're sleeping with your pride
Collapse the light into earth
When the sun came up,
And look outside, find the reasons why Find the reasons why
But if you're trying to break my heart
But she don't know you like I know you Slim, noone does
Some were ripe and some were rotten, I felt nauseous with the truth
Every heartbreak makes it hard to keep the faith
That's how you fight loneliness
Do you talk to me
But to know that another man's holding you tight
I saw you outside that wall 
And I will wait for you
Was there one you saw too clearly
So when I go home I'll be happy to go
Feel like a failure, 'cause I know that I failed you;
Everybody needs a soul
I wanna start this over again 
Oh, this ain't nothin' new
I can't wash away your scent
They can make me turn my back on my friends
Inside my bedroom all alone
Seasons came, seasons went
Nowhere left to go but down
Relationships don't get deep to me
It's so weird to be back here
Now everything is imaginary, especially what you love
It has changed you
And the hurt stops
Dance around this floor much quicker than you
Of tears from me
A different name
Everybody knows
Nothing survives
C'mon, you little lifegiver
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Sometimes sugar, it just takes someone else
As long as you're something to own
I'd wake up beside you, you'd hold me in your arms
Their minds say 'gotcha heart'
There's a vintage thirst returning, but I'm sheltered by my channel surfing
It's still me, I never changed
Wish I could go back and change these years
And now you save love again
Big wheel climbed to the top
We've lost it all, the love is gone 
'Cause I'm shouting your name all over the town
In oceans of this tragic part of town
To the door and I thought you were there
And all the gods come down here just to sing for me
To love her
It's the time we had apart to sort things out
A mind that knows itself
All of the days have passed us by
Told me you were not alone
This could be heaven
Continued on into the clouds
Did you ever think of me
As I'm doing my hair
Thought you'd be looking for the next in line to love
And I'll pretend like I've got something to say but I've got nothing
Now I am calling
Should've held my ground,
No, I don't wanna fall in love This girl is only gonna break your heart
In my lover's arms I move in time
A lullaby
You've scared them all to death
Hours slide and days go by, till you decide to come
You You were a friend 
The times I've had with you 
Light the way and let me go
To the lighthouse my friends
Is not of my own design
But I don't mind, at least I've tried
Where they sell old jewellery
You said you saw it coming, but you didn't see nothing
Open containers that sing songs
And she tied you to her kitchen chair
Who sang me into life every day 
I thought that I was over you
The worries are washed out to sea
Do I imagine it, or do I see your stare
However long I stay, I will always love you
Now I'm outside your house
It is the nature of the business
People I've loved, I have no regrets
For my heart lies
And the flags are all dead at the top of their poles
Through the streets and through the playgrounds
She has trouble acting normal when she's nervous
And we should spend some time apart for both our sakes
Try to put a word in for me
When your world's crashing down
My eyes were wet and red
Don't you think we should have learned somehow
I don't know where it's gone
She had wellconditioned hair
No sign of love behind the tears
And love so distant and obscure
Knifes you in the neck, kicks you in the teeth
Too close for comfort, bed and breakfast in a spoon
Wherever she may be
Between, half the time I'm so dead
I return
With my eyes on the back door
You might be right but I don't care
In every heart, there is a room
A classic case, I suppose,
Tracer lighting up the sky
Ooh ooh ooh
so bitter, so tough, 
I'll carry this flag
'Cause if you don't, then it won't be in peace that you rest
You think I was scared yeah 
To ask for these things we'd lost
But I'm always wanting you
Crave my heart and it's bleeding in your hand
Thinking of winter
Six months gone and I'm still reaching
We'll work on you
But I have not left your side
There's dry blood on your wrist
Except back to you just one last time
But a cold stone's all I see
No words can explain, the way I'm missing you
It's the chance I've got to take
I'm trying hard to breathe
Because before too long you'll be a memory
All the playful misspellings and every bite I made that left a mark
It never crossed my mind that there would be a time
And now we're stuck on rewind
Will no one lay the laurel wreath when silence drowns the screams
But soon the world had its evil way
Come back, come back, come back to me like
Won't disturb the peace on distant stars
Can we fly
If I could walk around I swear I'll leave
Handsome groom, give her room
Come back and bring back my smile
No, you don't have to love me if you don't want to
I am feeling very warm right now
Sinking feeling
Well I held you like a lover
What's left is torn and thrown
And I saw your hand
Fly over a city of canals
If you're not for me then why does this distance maim my life
I gotta stop pretending who we are
When you're scared to accept
But I'd be love and sweetness
And I'll be holding all the tickets
Why does my heart feel so bad
And I feel the whip
Oh, lie to me
It's deeper than love
And if I sleep,
I'm at home in the clouds
The last mistake before you die
Think I wanna die if you don't stay
Not where the black coach
Oh dear, you look so lost
Like my father's come to pass, twenty years has gone so fast
Strange what desire will make foolish people do
Would you let me rest in pieces
His money on the side, money on the side
And feel the world turn round
Don't cry
Reaching out, reach for me, emptyhanded
I just want something I can never have
I'm coming home to my sweet mother love
The pen must have slipped to the side
Didn't do the things you meant to do
Falling to pieces, forever in doubt
And history books forgot about us
These days I sit on corner stones
Close to mine
That nothing's going to change, not for me and you
I don't know anything about her
Said, I'm gonna buy this place and see it go
If it's worth the going, it's worth the ride
To keep sober like the rain that's falling down
Riding with the windows down
The darkness helped until the whiskey wore away,
Who can't stay away from you
With one hand high
'Cause I feel like going home
Innocence in your arms
Woah, I am one,
And please tell me you'll stay
There is another world
But now I'm taking you home
Oh my love, oh my love 
Leave it all up in the air
 years old, slow walking alone
Staring down at the irony of life
You're in the arms of the angel
Wondering when the call comes
Our heads full of thoughts
Without you, and I know sorry ain't the cure
When you beam it out all across the sky
Things are never gonna change, ooh ooh
That's not the shape of my heart
I want to do some laughing too
I never sleep still
Oohooh, darling, oh love, come on
Even if you cannot hear my voice
And the angel who looked upon him
But the time has come to leave
I have to kiss them
'Cause you can blame me for everything
Smoke's filled the air
Bending up my Nikes
We used to talk
Story of my life
Probably still is for those of them left
But I was waiting
He admits it took too long to admit that he was wrong
My head will burst, my life will end
Have kept their fires burning
My love Where would I be without you, Glo
Stillborn the trust in you I have lost all trust I had in you 
But we can still support each other
She's my angel
That can bring you right down to tragedy more oh me
All I can do is keep breathing
Yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah ah
Dass die Sonne an diesem Tag auch auf mein Grab scheint
I tell you sad stories about my childhood
But you're long gone, yeah you're long gone now
A wind can always turn
That we don't know the meaning of
And it's one more day up in the canyon
We'd never turn out to be real
Slowly up the stairs
Oh, love, well I've waited for you
Holding you, holding you, holding you
Anybody waiting at home for you,
So now you know the words to my song
It feels like it's wearing me
I'll be all that you need in life
Even in death, our love goes on
Take a look at me now
Out of this home
Sing a song for the new breed
Jesus rides beside me
This town is crazy
Your father cried on the telephone
And we argue the tiniest thing
Just smile back
Still ridiculed despite how hard that I have tried
And everybody's been abandoned and left a little empty handed
I've got a sickness pounding in my head
And it feels
But my heart will stay with you
'Cause it's all been done and it's all been said Eyeliner
But my heart is heavy, and my hope is gone
Now I know all the wrong turns
You just might find if you give it time you will wave hello again
All around this place every night and
That the inevitable end was near
As I say goodbye to Ruby's arms
They're picking on you still
That her eagerly death had had
Like the feeling you get when you realize you're dead
Take back that sad word, "goodbye"
Something new 
To look into your eyes and see you looking back
Everyone of us is hurt and everyone of us is scarred
We're all gonna die"
When your smile is so wide and your heels are so high
No one will love the way I do
Since you have been gone
Think I'm goin' home
Nestled in your wings, my little one
I sit and watch the children play
All those lonely nights, lonely nights, lonely nights
I will not say I'm all right for you
Money
I'm tired of words and I'm too hoarse to shout
And I can't stop bumping into things
I'll always love you, no matter what you do
Why won't you just believe
Let the funeral start,
A drunk man sits by the gate she's driving through
Burn my knees and, burn my knees and
So do what you're gotta do
Visions from a dying brain
And the best is yet to come
Drinkin' tea in bed, watching DVDs
And all of the lights will leave
So Jesus Christ, this goddamn rain
Or just how wrong you are
Doin' things I used to do
If you've still got some light in you then go before it's gone
And his wife, she stayed for a couple of days
Who've been stamping their feet to a different beat
And I still hold your hand in mine
And you're modest and shy to the end
Coming down on our homes"
Lookin' at the stars
"Wake up, paul don't be scared
You got yourself framed on the wall
And by that honor had your own restored 
If you'd just stay, I'd subtract
My love
I'm so tired
Seems like you never really knew me
Here comes Frank and poor old Jim
And I, I got you down
Settle down, two kids and a swimming pool
Every night I feel you burning
Slowing down I look around and I am so amazed
If indeed, I cared at all
And I can't suppress the memories
And I cannot hold a candle for every pretty gun
Well, I dance the two step look at you swing
Nothing wrong, nothing right
We pulled too many false alarms
They're the prayer that I say every day
I can relate to what you're saying in your songs
No, it's not the good kind
To find somebody
Lights burning
These hands would not be taught to hold another's,
And wait for their victims
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece
Who could have counted days
But it might not be here where I feel safe
Running away from the world outside
You don't know what love is
I placed all my trust at the foot of this hill
Some guys have a beer
I want what's yours and I want what's mine
And I hold a record for being patient
These are
Can't you just let me be
Tiny tears make up an ocean
Tell me why I can't be there where you are Can't be there where you are
Could make me feel bitter or treat you unkind
You can choose to believe
I thought we'd be growing together
I'm broken
There's nothing I won't do
I saw my reflection in my father's final tears
Your parents had arrived
Guess I thought I could never feel
I see it all now that you're gone
I got family
Than when you turned away, when you slammed the door
I got a room full of your posters and your pictures man
When I come back I'll wear your wedding ring
Would you help me stand if I saw you in heaven
They left me dizzy, Won't you forgive me
Light's gone, day's end, struggling to pay rent
To the one thing that I need
And no matter what I do, I can't make you feel better oh oh
And I won't be back till next year 
The maid needs a maid
'Cause it's cold out here
And while I wait, I put on my perfume
Every time I walk out the door
But we're all planning to meet
With my scalding tears
I don't need any help to be breakable, believe me
I don't care to say what
She's a myth that I have to believe in
Can't pretend
I was used for amusement
You sound like a song
'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah
It's all the same if everybody leaves her
Can't say I agree
The sound of lonliness turned up to ten;
Well, I no longer hear the music
Why don't they just admit they're scared, cause its already showing
I know you really loved me
That we're not in love
The only thing I'm taking is
You fixed yourself, you said "Well never mind
Think there impressing, but they ain't do shit
Couldn't be much more from the heart
You can look in my eyes and you can count the ways
Put on your gloves and your black pumps
It's so dark outside
I put on my best, but I'm still afraid
So you can tell everybody
Oh I got nothing
Turns to nothing today
Maybe you understand that, city bird
I keep having this dream, I'm pushin' Hailie on the swing
The day breaks and everything is new
Does it matter
This is my new age
And dance with my mother and me and then
Though I carried karats for everyone to see 
Fine lines of love and hate 
As even broken hearts may have their doubts
You're gonna walk so far
All the play fighting, all the flirtatious disses
You'll be alright
A fifty year old, reminiscing what I had
Pack and get dressed
Once there was a great storm
Because there's nothing else that I do well 
We are never sad, 'cause we are not allowed to be 
Use my hands to use my heart
I was so confused as a little child
Alright, relax
The hazards of love, the hazards of love
In some sacred place
Did you think I'd leave you here
I ain't the steppin' stone, to be steppin' on, I ain't nobody's crutch
I lay in tears in bed all night
Please don't you cry anymore
What makes a house grand
Don't keep me waiting
You can't hurt me now
Whatever you want
No I can't stand the pain 
Because the hardest thing is never
These words will fade when you explain why you hate them
Big veins
He put a cloth on their lips
She said one day she'd walk away
Holds his head in disgrace he can't escape the truth
And like a new disease she's still too young to treat
But you tear and tear your hair from roots,
Somewhere I can't bring you back
Well take a look at me now
And how I miss someone to hold
And I was meant for you
It's only fair to tell you now 
He was down for his brother
Did you call his name out as he held you down
They say that Richard Cory owns onehalf of this whole town
Tell me why I feel so low
Don't let the days go by, glycerine
The days go by and nothing brings me joy
Take it with the love it's given
When I see stars, I feel in your hand
And I didn't need you till melody
My eyes are lungs, I'm a prophet and I speak in tongues
And below the angel dog
I stand here alone
But I'm working all weekend
Will sacrifice
Where I'm broken
I felt so ugly before, I didn't know what to do
God is a place where some holy spectacle lies
'Cause there's just an empty space
Lit through the darkness at one fiftyeight
I don't know where this road
Lonely, that's not quite my problem
It's been cold, cold Campbell's from the can
I'm trying not to think about you
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be
Baby bring me love or something else
Did you touch them Did you hold them
And my fingers press onto the strings
Whenever I'm alone with you
But could you send back the only man she loved
And how much did it cost
Now you sit there thinking feeling insecure
That I'm the one you'll hold forever
'Cause on a cold day, you can walk through metal
When no one's really listening
What did you whisper in my ear
And you shouldn't try to mix the two
And I should really watch you dance
Do I stay or do I go
Don't you know this life goes on
My grandaddy was a player, pretty boy in a pair of gators
And I love my sister, Lord knows how I've missed her
So one last time, I need to be the one who takes you home;
Many friends I hope
Dreams that deny for all these years
As memories came flooding in, the tears blew up my eyes
I will not let myself cause my heart so much misery
It will kill you in the sunshine
"What's left to lose
And over my shoulder as I walk away
Playing the show and running down the plane
You don't hear me when I say
"What is it You look like you've seen a ghost"
Heads out sometimes 
Will the patterns show, we'll know what to do
Now on the bus, nearly touching this dirty retreat
And the clouds are goin' by me
Be the one, be the one
We know what we've lost when it's gone
Stone, stone, stone in love with you
You're gonna taste the grass
Now you're starcrossed
'Cause each time I feel it slipping away
Whose name I never could pronounce
So you leave me feeling dirty
Everyone of us is scared, everyone of us is hurt
No one knows who we are there
Sings so soft as if she'll break, says
This is the fear
And it stings when it's nobody's fault
Your good friend
Was always tangled up in knots
On my side of town
You're so quiet and you never make a sound
I hope my mom and I hope my dad
I tell the kids that it's all okay
There is really no one left
Felt the chill upon my face
Walking down Brick Lane, feeling blue
Remind me, how can you stop the rain from falling down
Two hearts fading, like a flower
Open mind for a different view
'Cause these are the days of our lives
They say that good people
Like I used to feel you breathe
Do they all look like mine
Quiet hands, quiet kiss on the mouth
Walks on his own with thoughts he can't help thinking
I love him so much, it just turns to hate
You're the nicest thing I've seen
Like the world has lost its mind
Only what's left is right
This whole life it's been about
Cause something goes on once again
You wanted more than I was worth 
Just starting to crawl
So many days
It's the end of the discussions that just go round and round
I really, really need a raincoat,
My face is all lit up
The hammer may strike 
Then it all just falls apart
Pass me that lovely little gun
It's to dying in another's arms and why I had to try it 
Maybe it's love, but it's like you said
I am feeling so ambitious, you and me, flesh to flesh
Nothing's changing anyway
Wish I could learn to let this sleeping dog die
With no one to share 
You're gonna blow your mind
Why's the message pending where the fuck are ya
It's so easy to hate
And I'm not coming back around
The letter's in your coat
Tiny flickers in the night, always looking to be right
Oh, Mary's ambitious, she wanna be a politician
Another two years older
And my brother and all my family rise from the seats to sing Hallelujah
Now haven't anything to grow
For a minute or two
I would hold you in my arms, I would take the pain away
A flag white as snow
Get up, get the gunge
This story's old this is the end
Just you sleep a little baby
So I'm someone to hold true
Here is my unopened letter to a world
Run off with a dancer
Her mom and dad went down to Charlotte
Today I stumbled from my bed
But I'm alone with you
Where I'll watch your face
I'm so resistant to this type of thinking
I guess the winter makes you laugh a little slower
When I say shut your eyes, eyes
Like black night
Uh, uh, you don't care a bit
Eager to wet the paper heart of children birds
Dissolved in some dream
It was dull and browny red
Together we cry, yeah, yeah
Says "I've seen your picture on a hundreddollar bill"
Tiredness fuels empty thoughts
If our love is at the end, then why do I still want you
This world is just illusion, always trying to change you
It burns in my stomach
When you were mine
She'll say yes, because these words were never easier
She's raising hell to give to me
So I play the numbers game
Speak to an ear deaf to my voice
And every breath we drew was Hallelujah
There's just this human heart that's built with this human flaw
I'm so tired but I can't sleep
If I may weep
Because your eyes are always saying goodbye
Cool as the deep, blue ocean
Just to say goodbye, say goodbye 
We never get so close to death, makes you so alive
The low fuel lights been on for days
I wish that I could tell you something oh oh
Get it off right away
Make you tired, tell you lies, make you fall
But you, you were almost gone
I'll sing it from the bus stop
You're just a piece of the puzzle so
That defines the meaning of their lives
Lost inside his bedroom
Thought that I'd forget all about the past
From those days
I say, "Oh"
Will always lead you home, home
Take my money, take my wallet, take my credit cards
All I hear is the sound
Give me your lips and with one kiss we begin
Oh my God, Barbara, she looks so much like my mom
Breathe truthfully at the garden glen, that grew masterfully over your
It's getting harder to pretend
I guess it was just a dream
So come over now and talk me down
Still tryina find my home sweet home, oh I, oh I, oh I
Oh I know that I left you in places of despair
You're the saddest sight I know
Nobody nothing's said
Why it is though she's the door Always, she can't be the room
When your heart was open wide and you loved things just because
Oh, sleeping children better run like the wind
Fear, fear, fear
And I'm weeping warm honey and milk
I loved her then and I guess I love her still
Viva forever, I'll be waiting Melanie C Viva forever
Well I got bones beneath my skin, and mister,
Goodbye to everything I thought I knew
And show you the way to go
I'm searchin' for a face
I send this smile over to you
Like I did last year
Sit on the floor, wearing your clothes
We'll float in space, just you and I I could still fall in love with you
I got an attitude of need,
I say to myself
We'll leave our sins within the carpet twine
If you ever say this
To break my fall
And all their tearful words will turn back into steam
I'm not the table you can come and lay your cup down on now
We were out on a date in my daddy's car
But I will fight for you, be sure that
And I'm too old to dream 
Spinning 'round my head
I'd sing to you just one more time
I had the notion that you'd make me change my ways 
Even though I told them not to
I'll do anything for you to see you smile
So hard and It never was the time for us
And now we must eat those tears
Always a lonely widow
In the corner of your eye
I hope you're with someone
To cut through all this worn out leather
They spotted a sleeping swan
How long it was to get around to her side of town
And I'm sorry every day
They keep erasing all the streets, we grew up in
I'm losing grip, what's happening
Search within yourself for feelings
Just as sincere as a dog does,
The sun was always shining, we just lived for fun
Hey, open wide, here comes original sin
You measured no one that I've ever known
I guess we only settle in to what we know
But you loved me
Stranded starfish have no place to hide
Well, here's the consolation that will change your heart and mind
And nothings gonna blow me away
To losing
'Cause I can't make you love me if you don't
In his eyes
We're high above but on the floor
When we get off tour I think we should
In your arms Don't hurt me
We were a gold mine, they gutted us
Letters always get burned
'Cause nobody's going to save us
Ask me should we try again
You straight in the eye
I'm holdin' on
No one comes near
I'mma break that birdies' neck
What makes winters lonely 
She cries harder and harder
And there's a memory of a window
It's a dizzy hot and just damn forgot
The mark that still remains
To handle every day
You can break everything I am
You want to feel how it feels
Little light, will guide them to me
Ants are in the sugar
Because I know fine well that what I did was wrong
My hands are broken
No alarms and no surprises, please
And hold your bad luck hand
I am flying on a star into a meteor tonight
Your hair was long when we first met
Lacking me inside
The days were endless
Well, I don't know about you, but I never get tired of it 
I have decided to start things from here
I guess you need no one,
See the liar that burns within my needing
You're the one who's always choking Trojan
And someday you will ache like I ache
Doesn't matter where she is tonight
You better watch what you dream
Oh, it's funny to think it through
You are taller than a mountain
Wonder this time where she's gone
Does she need you like I do
Oh when I rush to the start
'Cause if assholes could fly
And when just one remains
Down in your car, out by the pier
Do you still care
That place in my mind
They're all good but not the permanent one
Seems to be all over you and everyone else
The refrigerator's whining so I've got reason to complain
The lights in the sky
Two halves are equal
Going through every out I used to cop to make the repetition stop What was I supposed to say
If you only knew the way I feel
I said sometimes I hear my voice
Breaking apart all this love in my heart
Tapping doors, but irritate
Today's the day I realized that I could be loved
That we will meet again somehow
Have I still got you to cross my bridge in this storm
Hold up
Where do you think you're goin'
Headlights burning bright ahead of you
I walked around my room
To do or say
There's no more crying and there's no more lies
And I'm here to stay
Chasing through the city with their stars on bright
On your face, on your face, on your face
Backhand, reversible roles
I never cared before, I never cared before
You got vacation days then you might escape
It shouldn't have been anyway, no way, that's right, that's right, that's right
I'm not as strong as I thought
Can't believe that I feel
You look like a skeleton, a little dressy thing
To hear your voice, to see your face
I'm lookin' for a place
And catch a plane to Barcelona 'cause this city's a drag
The phone has been disconnected
You caress me smoothly
Through the mouth of your eye
I have torn everyone who reached out for me
I remember December
I don't even wanna breathe
And spending it all
'Cause I look through the camera eyepiece and cannot see
Our feelings are positive, negative, positive, negative
Until those rainy days that make them stay;
With every grimy word
Is it fast enough so you can fly away
It's not an habit, it's cool, I feel alive
Never thought I'd get any higher Never thought you'd fuck with my brain
Isn't something
See I thought love was black and white
I can hear it in your voice, I see it in your eyes
Cocaine flame in my bloodstream
And wishing will just leave me empty
On a guy with a suitcase and a ticket getting outta here
Just a little older that's all 
This whiskey got me Feelin' pretty
But you're always on time, so
You've done no wrong
Down in the valley where the fields are green
I close my eyes when I get too sad
They come your way
I take my last match with desperate passions and a few up facts
And all the lovers with no time for me 
I never meant to cause you trouble
Until the end of our days
Come and spend the night
I knew it the moment you walked into the door 
I'm praying for a miracle
'Cause you never read the signs
And though I pleaded and I begged her not to walk out that door
Morning will come and I'll do what's right
There is a road I'm always walking 
It keeps on falling
I count the steps that you take
The wicked thing about us is we always have trust
We really wanna know beyond love
Your lonely windowsill They'll carry you off tonight
I hope your wish came true, mine betrayed me
It was just like a song
I try to make the worst seem better
Do not choose a coward's explanation
Made me live in memory
So maybe I do, but that shouldn't affect 
My sister called me just the other day
As long as I can see, into your room and feel
I pull off the road
But my feelings can�t know for sure
And when the spring arrived
We're falling forward
But darling, I want the same thing that I wanted before
But lt's the way I feel right now
Can you stop this pain
These days I barely get by
On the streets you were policin' that was you
And the door shut shut, I was vacuum packed
He said I'll rent a car and I'll drive home
Something inside that was always denied Bye bye
I got a dream to heed
These are my snow covered dreams
And I can't go back
Now there's nothin' left
Ancient history, some would say, another state of mind
Just to lie with my mistakes 
And Ill let your smile just off and carry me
So who needs girlfriends
We walk in the same direction
And never read a single word
But still I chase
Leave me out with the waste, this is not what I do
What can I say, I am left behind
We been on top for too long just to let it go under
And I don't need you or anybody else
Has her leash and a face
Nice dream, nice dream
In the pain is there healing
Where the sun shine slows
No name for her but as it comes
How did we ever get this far
They say I'm better off now than I ever was with her
And you say, "Allah hu akbar"
I bet this mighty river's both my savior and my sin
Like a Star Wars poster on my bedroom door
Time will never, never ever change it
The Litebrite's now blackandwhite
Stop thinking about the easy way out
Oh, be my rest, be my fantasy
The one thing that always tore us apart is the one thing that I won't touch again
Oh, but wise men know when it's time to go
But to wait for you is all I can do 
Crossing my fingers and my t's
The cleaners are coming, one by one
And the city I walk in, the city I walk in,
So is it goodbye
Nobody girl
Oh my baby baby I love you more than I can tell
Many, the lives we lived in each day
He had a try out with the Sixers
"All your friends and your foes
And everybody does
I�m stayinabove the flatline
But no one saw,
Can't do right tonight
First love grows then it does, and it's all white lies
I've been outside
I've been searching 
And winter unreal
Breaking the waves
She's all I'm always wanting
You see it's not the wings that make the angel
A little, but I'm hoping it might kick start
Getting killed by a car 
So pour another glass of wine
Kick them when they fall down
And by all that I have done wrong
Oohdon't wanna try don't wanna try don't wanna try
So sick and tired of all these pictures of me
When you think you've had too much of this life to hang on
I thought Johnny would always be my best friend
Did someone's heart break
Lemme be your downfall, baby"
Recall the deeds as if they're all
And time changes many things
And if I could only stop the car
And the waves came and stole him and took him to war
Even God himself and the faith I knew
I knew it would never last
But still I'll hide from you, hide what's inside from you
But I wouldn't have you how you are
Cut off my wings and come lock me up
Shaking in my doorway like a sentinel, all alone
I can show you I'll be the one
Though this is not her lord in case
Do you believe she said that
Of guilt and shame all over me 
Katie, don't cry
She takes a drink and then she waits
I'm kicking the curb cause you never heard
She said a good day ain't got no rain
But he speaks with his eyes closed
Beautiful heart
Life goes on as it never ends
There's no rhyme or reason
I have seen your face and it's too much, too much for me
What it was,
I don't need much
A certain something certain
Ring out the bells again, like we did when spring began
To pull me up, take the pain
It just ain't right, it just ain't right
Singing all their songs
Around 
When they see how dangerous it is for guys like that
Says what's up, where've you been, is something wrong
mis dias sin ti son un derroche
Where the darkness does fall so fast, it feels like some kind of mistake
I never meant to hurt you
Sing me anything
Some future in my eyes, bright
So as I write this letter
The fate of all mankind I see is in the hands of fools
All this time I was wasting
Or it can make you tired, tell you lies and make you fall
Only love, only love
You know it makes me so angry
I don't know how I'll feel
I'm gonna find a reason
I find everything pursuing
There's nothing left to salvage
And on my deathbed, all I'll see is you
And I wish I'd known that you were bleeding while I sat
Not to tell you that I still hate you
She left us at that video store
My face is all wet
Just because they knew your name
Right on, right now
Dry your eyes mate
Looking in your eyes
Another sadeyed stare
I fell in love with the actress
Soon I know I'll wake from this dream
Oh baby come on, let me get to know you
You got out and said I'm sorry
Or am I a fool who sits alone talking to the moon
Hide out and then run when no one's looking
And I understand you must keep moving, friend, but I'm headed home
We will say goodbye to flesh and blood
And nobody nowhere understands anything
He woke up from dreaming and put on his shoes
All the things we should've done
And the darkest thoughts, yeah, I guess they're my own
Your name, forever the name on my lips
I feel it in the air
You still don't think I'm going to see this through
You could say I knew it all along,
I want you to believe in me
But there's nothing I'm planning to take
Saw the boardwalk start to fall
Screamed, "I just completely love you
Jesus Christ, that's a pretty face
I could sing you your favourite song 
When I bow down to pray
With the pictures of your mother
But I need sorrow, baby, life's sorrow is the drug
You don't deserve to be lonely
I thought we were supposed to be
Put ice in my veins
My tongue will taste of gin and malicious intent
Ultraviolence In my linen and curls
They say you ain't grindin' until you die
The plans were never finalized
Cause every time you fight the scars are gonna heal but they're never gonna go away
A handshake of carbon monoxide
I've tried cutting the ropes,
Bye bye
And she said I'll wait for you
And maybe it's wise
But now it seems that moment has arrived
She just walked away
A black sheep boy revolves
We'll grow old together
Watch, I'll even cut off my finger
Pretending there's glamor and candelabra
Yours was mine through to my bones
The kids were young and pretty
It's ok, she don't want the world
By the ghost of you
A vacuum of sorrow to swallow up the day
Miss you want you by my side
Did I disappoint you or let you down
While watching sink the heavy ship 
Well I walk in the air between the rain
Flashback
I want to hear he pleases you more than I do
And late in a star's life
So many won't get the chance to say goodbye
I'm lacking in imagination he said hello
Sometimes my courage fell to my feet
I can't even think straight, but I can tell
So I turned on a picture show, I disappeared the lines
Compile thoughts and compile thoughts and
What the heart wants
"I can't wait forever" is all that you said
But never in my sweet short life 
Puts on a smile and breathes it in
I took you to the train
I can be the laughing stock, I can be the hoax
I went and messed around with her heart
Had no one ever
I close my eyes and the room is spinning
Without you I'm nothing at all
You flash before my eyes, a final fading sigh
You said that you would die for me
But compared to your eyes
Was the most you ever knew
Son I know you don't want her to go, but someday you'll change your mind
Footsteps on the front porch, I hear my doorbell
I've been under the ground
Don't break yourself for me
Trust just don't come easy
Take this sinking boat and point it home
I wished your love away
the sky is tired of seeing 
Just let me say that I like that, I like that
I've been staying up and
I'm bearing a cross, she's turned into my curse
Well, you can come inside, unlock the door
My heart is yours
No one else will know these lonely dreams
I've been searching in the pouring rain
Don't remember them being here before
Never hurts me to say goodbye
Then I swallowed your words, and spit them right back out
Still trying to get to you
Yellow roses in the graveyard
But now I'm scared that's how I like to be;
I don't want to hear you say
You'd kneel down to the dry land
I loved the way we used to smile
My life your tarot, and my picture your fate
Made everything look wrong 
I never conquered, rarely came
The weight of it
The walls and the ceiling move in time
For walking in my shoes, ah
And I'm kicking the curb cause you never heard
In this hole that we have fixed 
I know it�s out of the question, honey
My fake plastic love
Oh I wanted words but all I heard was nothing
For the love of the crowd and three cheers from everyone
I can't tell you that I'm something I'm not
I picture you in the sun wondering what went wrong
You let the needle drop
Could I laugh again
The gallows and the graves of
Something real, make it timeless,
No matter what I do
Why don't we hit restart,
We don't need to say goodbye
I can see the stars
When you're living your life, well, that's the price you'll pay
He stole your heart from you
Waiting for your call, I'm sick, call, I'm angry, call, I'm desperate for your voice
Oh, Mary K, I can see your face
Your hands are shaking
Then I'll be your pride
Life don't get stranger than this, it is what it is
Could you ever believe beyond love
'Cause I would not lie
So this is where you are, and this is where I am
I will end where I began
To know you all wrong; we warn
Only when we get to see the aerial view
Left with a trace of all that was 
Brenda's
Without someone to hear her cry
When I look you in the eyes, all I see are the lies
I knew they'd comfort you
To sit by your side
But my heart is overflowin' anyway
I miss it all, from the love to the lightning
And she says that I am the brightest
I have nothing left to give
I heard the wind rustling through the trees and ghostly voices rose from the fields
Are the wonders of my world
And these nights I get high just from breathing
You go it alone
I need a good alarm to wake me up
To make you mine, stay with me tonight
Well this is all new
Making up for all this mess
The face I came to know is missing too
You really hate
I've been up half the night, so get off it or leave
'Cause this will be the last time that I let you
The branches bending low
Nothing could be bring me near
Well, that's because I am
That they forgot to bomb
It seems it's written
And you never left me no messages
Would hold me slender limbs would hold me
Through your eyes I can see the disguise
Maybe not with words
Say you'll be with me, when the heartache ends
Without you is all my life amounts to
What I was thinking 
And the stars were new in the sky
The past has let me be
I said, "Babe, you're not lost"
But don't go tearing your life apart
Pray to be, shake this land
You know that I need you
So I can hitch a ride
It's sad to hold, but leave your shell to us
The wall breaks on the phone if at all, if you call 
'Cause your walk with a pelvis, white boy Elvis
Sometimes it feels like there's three
On random notes of parchment I'm scrawling my existence,
It's who we are
pero al menos aún respiro 
Now she seems to be sand under his shoes;
I don't think it's that bad
The times have changed and I will now move over slowly
And these memories, lose their meaning
I am good, I am grounded
From that same head that you have twice removed
But what you break is what you get
Offer up your steps so I can climb
You say I have turned
I know that living with you baby was sometimes hard
And round, and round, and round, and round, and round, and round
When I hear someone has taken my place
I hope we both die
What a piteous thing, a hideous thing
Everything she's ever known
In all the dogs and cats
Left me alone when I needed the light,
Who makes you feel safe in your sleep
Disappeared, no trace
I dreamt I traveled and found you there
Or just hold on to love
It's here and then it's gone 
They say they don't know when but a day is gonna come 
How could this love ever turning, never turn it's eye on me
I want to be still
You can have your own car
The book of love has music in it,
No one will find us
In your life we take our cover try being someone you're not
I still don't know what love is
All doors closed but he's always open,
The horses are coming
'Cause that's all they knew how to play, hey
When I think of love, as something new
Stay, stay and watch the coals
For me to have to walk away
The sun on the sand, on her knees and her hands
I try to keep the house nice an' neat
Alone
That's abandoned and cold
Cell phone number here, call if you have the time
Like I thought she would
Zusammen im Zeitraffer
I only need one more day
Just one sign that could show me that you gave a shit
You're sitting down to dress
Remember me as you fall to sleep
To a flake of your life
Oh, Caroline, no
Will fill your head
Through the nighttime, through the dawn
Love is good and love is blind
A fragment of light
I hope you find what's right for you
You philosophies on art, Baroque moved you, you loved Mozart 
Baby, let me explain something, it's all down to drugs
Loneliness "
But I can't place her
Oh I wish, I wish you could have stayed
When each and every angry word
Don't give up hope my friend, this is not the end
Pretending life is worth the fight
Than flesh and bone
'Cause we keep them going constantly Stands forever
Close your eyes
And talking in rhymes
And be too stubborn to die
It seems worse than it is
I see an elevator, a moment I am above
I never said goodbye
And too old to just break free and run
Everybody loves the things you do
I heard your wrists got bruised
Good one, good one, good one, good one, good one
Tell me, how can you stop the sun from shining
When they've tortured and scared you for twenty odd years
So many times,
Cover me, all I need every
I could stand with you with your snow boots on
All the fires of destruction are still burnin' in my dreams
By what's beyond our bed
Under the leaves of that old Lime Tree I stood examining the fruit
On that night right by your side,
So you build that wall build that wall
Jed had found our booze drink and drank every drop
I think it's time we move on now
Laying alone in this room
And jumping in harder than
But nights like this
Well it's time to surrender, it's been too long pretending
And send that old devil back to hell
Another world
No I can't let you go
And I've heard all the stories 'bout the black cabs and the way they drive
With every single letter, in every single word
Like a swallow
Tried and failed as we walked by the riverside
While the roaches climb the walls 
Now that I'm laughing even deeper inside
Oh, I believe in yesterday
Some love holds, some gets used
Won't upset the pace on distant stars
Being a bad bitch on the side
Have heart, my dear
Seems like yesterday
Never thought I'd fall so hard
You'll be handsome and you'll be beautiful
How can you hurt someone so much your supposed to care for
One final dance with him
All the things you put upon the mantle
For the miracle to come
He smashed it with a telephone
She had it on the bathroom floor, and didn't know so
Distorted eyes when everything is clearly dying
Always fade
Saw my reflection in a window and didn't know my own face
Try to keep from missing love
It keeps my temperature from rising,
And we saved them for a rainy day
Deep in the cell of my heart
'Cause you are, you are, you are my everything
I'm reaching for the phone
Caught a lovely butterfly
Never seen the light
Since you're gone the world is not the same
Communicate through pursed lips
Adia, I'm empty since you left me
Her writing's honest
Tell you I set you apart
I keep going right back
When I was sure you'd follow through
Yes all you have to do is cry 
Its color's richness won't appear within your view
You don't need my help anymore
Like the leaves of fall
And let me go alone on your way
I'm miles away 
And that's what I've got to face
And I see no chance of release
I'm gonna be the man who's growing old with you
Try to put myself on on the inside
You're watching them as they're looking at you
Then she moved to LA with her firefly stare,
To a place where I am blinded by the light
You gave me all your love
You'll hurt your knees
Well mercy me, I'll be goddamned
Pulling your puzzles apart
As they stared to the sand,
The painful scream that I, heard last
Looks like Jesus and his friends involved
Let's take a dive swim right through
Sometimes I am so in love with you
I live, I learn, you will always take what I have earned
You saw her bathing on the roof
You make me feel like I am home again
Inside I'm screaming,
And it's too hard to focus through all this doubt
And this awkward kiss that screams of other people's lips
Or say things to hurt you
You believed in
But the water keeps on falling from my tries
I can't tell you anything you don't already know
I've stood in a thousand street scenes
I'll wait by the backstage door
You was broke down crying a mess
To someone I don't know
And you will destroy anyone who would try to harm 'em
Everything inside of my heart
Ignoring the phoneI'd rather say nothing
I see the shadows that we cast in the cold, clean light
There's not a love that's perfect 
Lucky old sun is in my sky
Wooden floors, walls and window sills
When we are alone
But baby, I just need one good one, good one
The worst of it now, I can't remember your face
You can smile with all those tears in your eyes
Little bit of love, little bit of love, little bit of love, little bit of love
To the sea
You raised his children
We were born, we were born to die
I can't be as sorry as you think I should
But I'll try my best to reach you
On those endless games
So now I'm sleeping next to mousetraps
Can't quite see the end
And the world is so tough
Of what brought us here today
Don't swallow this time
A new world just around the corner
They all end up broken
You made me beg for admission cards
So one last touch and then you'll go
With every hope and dream I've ever had in doubt
You and I have been through many things
Find my way home anymore
And a little trouble makes it worth the going
It's coming 'round my soul
My hand is okay
I knew that somebody did
And when I awoke, I believed I'd taken a bride called Mary Stanford
And I know you care
And she may drive me crazy
Get down to the inside
You're a loser, a rebel, a cause without
Once it held dreams
I can see your face in our secret place
And that line is what we reached
Sly curse
Nananana, yeah, yeah
God wouldn't let it live
Why did you turn out the lights
Now I'll always be right beside you
The hurt is killing me
Uhhuh yeah
To this western town
I should be laughing right now
That I can't say what's going on
Our feelings get greater
Or am I lost
Another year ago today
You forgot me long ago
But I don't know what we were fighting for,
I forgot the start
Of course I didn't know that it would happen to me 
Once I was a lover
They say if you love somebody
And you cut me loose
Will I ever see your sweet return
Too many years I've cried for you
Am I being paranoid, am I seeing things
Looking across the faces I've know
With her I'm complete
God knows I've got to live mine
You need her
Was trying to get to work on time
The people all call her Alaska
Besides, what would I say if I had you on the line
I've done some things that I want to forget but I can't
Now and forever you are still the one
As I play the part of a saint on my knees
I need you, you want me
Such distance from our friends
Help me stay awake, I'm falling
He laughed at my sins,
If you're all done like you said you'd be
You can do whatever the hell you want to
The bad things in life were so few
There's nothing you can do
Nothing I feel pulls at me at all
It hurts to grow up
Yes, I think we got a problem
These flowers will never fade'
There's a shadow in my place
I didn't know that it was over
Until I'm taken by these bolts of pain;
Around your neck and tug you to the ground
I hate to love you
We could rest and remain here, easily
She's always done much better with boys anyway
You are eighteen year old girl, who live in small city of Japan
I wanna come apart
If only time could just turn back
It's all in your mind
Oh but now I don't hate you I'm happy to say
It's only fools  they make these rules
Where Sophie's down in the valley where the church bells cry
Am I the only one who feels ashamed
Put all your fears back in the shade
I'm looking for love this time
Who drives himself insane
Daddy, please don't cry
With your body next to mine our hearts will beat as one
And I'm hanging on to the words you say
That's toxic clear down to the bedrock
I can feel the blood rushing though my veins
Treading on people's toes
Just bones, a lonely ghost burning down songs
She can feel my heart, fell asleep to its beat
She's a moving violation from her conk down to her shoes
Do you wanna run away together
Busby Berkeley dreams
I'd lay down my body I'd lay down my arms
I'm trying not to wonder where you are
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
And sorry that you're the one she got
Then up the stairs he would carry me
Top hats and tails for thrills, red lips and famous hands
How I wonder what you are
I love to see everybody in short skirts, shorts and shades
But life happened, house, kids, two cars, husband hits the jar
You turned your eyes to me
Nothing compares, no worries or cares
It's the disease of the age
Mirror, mirror, where's the crystal palace
For things to be quiet
Is it cruel or kind not to speak my mind
At night when the stars light up my room
The stars are out tonight
Fire's not burning
The transience of life
It seems farther than ever before
We believe
Strobe lights and blown speakers
To lie here, under you, is all 
Just do what you're gotta do
Because I hold up the weight for the team
How's life Tell me how's your family
When someone takes advantage of your kindness, you think you're never gonna heal
In one single moment, your whole life can turn 'round
"Son, your life's an open book
But sober with no place to go
Oh baby, all the lights go out
Now that I feel it's time to spend the night away
And Pops had nothing to let his anger on
That I'm losing my best friend
But sometimes
And so the kiss became the cold
And fly him out to Spain
I'm glad He set you free from sorrow
Your windows my door and nothing can stop me
Open up my hands
Your face it haunts my once pleasant dreams
Don't die, don't die
What if she thinks so but just didn't say so
Warmer than warm, yeah
And now, I guess
Is already in my life
Don't you know I have faults like anyone
Like the back of his hand,
And we're set alight, we're afire love, love, love oh'
Never quite said what I wanted to say to you
A shehive stare and chase 
And I just wanna die without you
Wrong or right, black or white
So the morning light can shine on you
All we are is too fast for love
Friends that last
So if I leave my room
How can you love what it is you have got
I worked for the Capitol Air, in the bags
Same old boy, same sweet girl, five years down the road
Long for one last showdown from a box in a crowd
How can I rely on my heart if I break it with my own two hands
But you're not feelin' it at all
I can't keep up with your turning tables
Your heart yearned to stay
They say that time, will make all this go away
Everything's complex
Oh my friend, how did you come
It's just the end of a world that you had with one girl
But I hate your guts
I'm waiting, I snort and I stamp
What I'm tryin' to say here is not worth, it's not worth your time
'Cause my path has lost direction
This isn't a mob, I won't need to change 
And Martha, Martha, I love you can't you see
Now, smell the rain of london, it still insists
Sorrow's my body on the waves
About that guy who coulda saved that other guy from drowning
And that's the way that you feel honey know
Who are we
In colors on the snowy linen land
So I swore, nonetheless, up and down, it was only me
Where were my senses
And I'm fiendin' for a cure
I must be one
I wouldn't want to go messing anything up 
My toes are warm
Feel numb wanna hold you
And something's breaking up Breaking up
Stop pretending, 'cause we're going down
Isn't someone missing me
We found the ground
It's a frightened dead boy,
Tracks will fade in the snow 
A whisper from your father couldn't fix it
Sticking around for this shit
I guess I should have heard of them from you
Or are we ashes and wine
I took off my clothes,
Ooh don't take it all to heart
To sing
I start to miss you
And if you don't then lie
Oh rejoice, the sky's fucking falling
When the trees start to sway
And if I bring a little music I could fit right in
Oh we're shadows
This is the sound of someone losing the plot
When you lose something you cannot replace
When the wind was fresh
When we were liars, lovers in combat
But you are everything to me
Mmm whatcha say 
To collapse and call to them
I've checked the phone, no messages on
Can I say
I wish we'd had a better goodbye
Messages waiting on me when
No regrets, they don't work
Ain't that the way it always goes
There is a black river
I am staying right beside you
I know I'm acting a bit crazy
I never thought he'd be an old man
And when I come home
I don't believe you when you lie
Running out the melpomene, nicotine
So many nights, legs tangled tight
Goodbye, Norma Jeane
Fall on your knees, 'cause this time I won't be so kind
Look out on a summer's day
They crawl from the oceans
Why do I have to fly over every town up and down the line
They measure the room, they know the score
Your place is in the sky, how can I show you
Did you ever make it out of that town
My problem is I don't have much to say
Some things always stay the same 
Holding on the telephone
While you're chasin' ghosts
Her father doesn't know what to say
Come around come around no more
Before we were lovers I swear we were friends
They're all scared and stiff
I, I know how I feel when I'm around you
Began the night believing
We burn the gallows they erect
There is too many ways that you could kill someone
Baby, I know you hate me so
But spring came bearing sunlight
Just like they told you it would
Why is this my life
So dizzy, Mr Busy, too much rush to talk to Billy
I've been catching all your ghosts for every season
I told you everything, you know my feelings
My mother lies alone on her back at night
Daddy, daddy, please laugh again
He's looking right through me
I caught your eye with a camera's flash
Living the life that we could've had
We sing
I've got the picture, long gone
Comes with a price tag, baby, face it
I can take the pillow cases
As it tints the shade of you
The silence scares us more than leaving could
I almost forgot it was twilight
i don't find something 
I think I want to change my oxygen
Upset with the past, but it's all that holds us now
Out of mind
Bringing the clouds down to the sea
With tears in your eyes,
Something suddenly unclear
We never ask ourselves the questions to the answers that nobody even wants to know
How I found a love so pure
I knew my loss before I even learned to speak
Some people wanna steal her heart
And it hurts me to look into the mirror at myself
I'm in California dreaming about who
I know I was a lot of things
But I've done it enough 
The river flows
You gotta tell me its true
But something we will always want
Look underneath the house there
And cry on my shoulder
The nights are so unkind
I am done with it
I'm gonna love you  percent
Trying to break your fall
You were always on your own
Someday maybe I'll get to where I'm going
I don't want a stormy affair
Over rivers, farms, and state lines
You can make it last forever
'Cause we've been this low and we've been around this bend
The moon gravitates around you
I sing it while
And I won't listen to your shame
For a heart that can't be broken, oh
This is the part of me that learns from sitcoms
Tiny tears make up a sea
And ignite your bones
To cover up the pain
I hear your voice, "You must learn to stand up
He told me he was sorry and everything has changed
Everything's ending here
And I do love you
Put my arms around her, tryin' to change what she's saying
I wish there was an overthecounter test
Her life was stole
Sew a cape of rainbow
Oh wild horses
There is a part of me that I try to hide
How am I gonna stay here without you
And the dancing centaur queen flies past
I've got a dying urge to feel the way you do
Unaware that I'm tearing you asunder
And before you know, goodbye will be farewell
You'll never feel the heat of this soul
But my brain knows better, it picks you up and turns you around
Is this how you wanna go down, right before my eyes
I'm as calm as a fruit stand in New York and maybe as strange
She's the one that makes my dreams
Give me the truth
I'll cheer you up, fill your empty cup
I won't try to take the sadness from those eyes that I love
The chocolate, rose, the kisses
Head stuck in a cycle, I look off and I stare
For so bare is my heart
They'd only hold us down
Oh, into the sun, ah, into the sun
And tell him that now, that you wish he would die
In the morning in the window
And you hope she'll sing
And he found someone who understands
Rest assured your love is pure
Cornereyed I saw it lock in
Red, blue, green
Stranger came and pulled a gun, grabbed her by the arm
You're giving me a million reasons to quit the show
Tears drying on their face
Oh rejoice, his hands perform hexes
To trade the handshake for the fist
Take my photo off the wall
Well there may well be others but I still like to pretend
As we moved together in the dark
But they'd only remind me of you
When my mouth is this dry
That July ninth, the beat of your heart
And your day was rough
And you were waiting
I'd be less angry if it was my decision
And go on and try to tear me down
And still I feel I said too much
Couldn't read the number in the dark
Or feel the touch that I adore
Every day together always
I'm not half what I wish I was
Maybe I was too pale
We'll be strangers if, we see this through
I didn't sell my soul, I didn't sell my soul 
It all comes down
There is no room for promotions out here
Picking apples for the kings and queens of things I've never seen
Angels lie to keep control
I thought you'd ask me not to leave
I've finished kissing my death
It's a sad, sad situation
Help me, call the doctor, put me inside
No bad dream fucker's gonna boss me around
Why can't we overcome this wall
But then you said, the emotions are dead
It's a lonely book 
My heart was blinded by you
So goodnight my dear
So I mean, it's cool if you keep quiet but I like singing
Hey just let the bullshit pass push people
Ohoho, it's dangerous, it's so out of line
You are lost and found
You can throw away all these letters
Sits down by the fire
Like the strangers that you've met
I got a plan to get us out of here
Diaries left with cryptic entries
This queen of heart's dancing on her throne
The words have been drained from this pencil
This is the part of me that thinks outer space is all dead
Don't give up the fight to stay alive
Oh but dear the sky is low
Lose friends to the air waves and the airlines
But I need to
And you got less, and it hurt
Try to push it back
And honey you know me it's all or none
One more little one I love you
How long did we all
I'll go to sit beside you 
A gift to tear apart
Walkinbarefoot now
'Cause if you want, I'll try to love again
Everybody bow your head for the greatest inspiration
Carrying the world on your shoulders
Walking in the countryside
I need to stay afloat When nobody's around
Only they can hear me pray for
Can't even rest when the sun's down
To a place where you belong
Now the time has come to leave you
I can see by the way you wash them clothes
I almost forgot who I was
Catchweed into the fold
'Cause I'd rather stop now
They say it's not becoming
What if you could hear this song
I'll find somebody like you
I have all of life's treasures
Gone through days
Glass on the pavement under my shoe
Until I'm empty
Why life gotta be so tough
And the wind makes them groan
Oh when I sing all that I can sing
Because of me 
No, we don't dream anymore
Is taking me home
There is no night time, it's only a passing phase
All the things that never were
This of life I know is true
Ain't no coming back
And not a reason
A child to your chest that could lay as you sleep
Kindness comes over me, what was your name
Is it too late to remind you how we were
In the arms of an angel
With your kind of hesitation
Give me these moments back
As you stopped to say hello
I don't need the passion too
Of a sinking feeling
Gotta get rid of this pill taste, what are they chattin' so much for
I've been alone all along
No change in his
That hides behind the cause and the effect
Yes, now you're gone
A little death makes life more meaningful
And stayed out way too late
Of the life you could have had
I'm finding I'm falling in love with the dark, oh yeah
You can tell me, I can handle it
That's the day I knew you were my pet
You and me, won't be unhappy
Won't come your way, yeah
When I'm not around you
And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine
Flesh and blood and the first kiss
Look in to her eyes to make her listen again
You were always good for a rhyme
Some simple thing that I've done
Slightly bemused by the total rejection
What is closer to the truth
I sincerely saw your skin for the very first time
Just look at who I have become I am so ashamed
The saddest part of a broken heart
I can't get by on an odds and ends love that don't ever match up
Yeah make yourself a photograph and laugh at me please
So I crawl back into your open arms
And try and try and try
I won't be the lonely one, sitting on my own and sad
I've seen this room and I've walked this floor
It felt so good to hear her voice
Dance me through the panic till I'm gathered safely in
That's the way that you feel
I knew that something was wrong
Then he began to smoke crack
I thought that I found me a cure for feeling old
Can't get no love without sacrifice
I should've turned around,
Hear the crowd call
"Come home, come home
She stole the keys to my house and then she locked herself out
Escaping one last time
In your regret that sounds absurd
The circus awaits and you're already gone
Then in my dream
I feel
It's all in your mind 
And the lines on your face did tell
Stone cold
I don't know if the change made was grave
There was no one in the town and no one in the field
But I won't hold my breath
'Cause I, I keep going right back
I wonder how you touch yourself and curse myself for being across the sea
I know it's hard to take, but her mind has been made up
And waves are crashing and stars are falling
I know I'm lucky in a lot of ways
Just thinking of the women who've taken your place
And I knew that
New wings are growing tonight
Violate me, show me your religion
To all you wanted always supportive always patient
I will paint myself out
When you're around
You made me smile with my heart
'Cause everyone feels just like you
Playground school bell rings again
You're gone and I gotta stay
I view visions of you, then you're gone
But you're not alone, and you're not discreet
All the things that I never thought
Can't you see that this is life and life is killing me
So here we are again, the same old argument
Still tryin' to persuade me that
That she could feel and
That I would be loved, even when I was fuming
You tell me that you're sorry
Turn down the lights, turn down the bed
And now I'm a crushed credit card registered to Smith
Overhead
There are some things I'll live without
I will not watch the ocean, 
The feelings come and go
I don't wanna change, I wanna stay right where I lay
I'm not one to hide my face behind the pain
I'm sorry for wasting your time 
Bet you're sorry now, I won't be coming home tonight
But I'm still the same underneath
And I'm strung out again
It's an inside joke
Hold you here until the pain has all gone
God would they vomit and run 
All shocked and broken all shocked and broken
That can mend These broken bones
The pressure of days, do what I say
Wind it up and let it go
And I walk down to buy her flowers
No I will not let you down
When we get delayed can we cast a line towards anyone dismayed
But I know that I still need you here
Mutual misunderstanding
These miles have torn us worlds apart
"I'm starved of mirth
I should've called you out,
And when I dance for him
When I don't, ooh
There's a road ahead
You got me, you got me, baby
And map my face out line by line
The talk of the town
You think you're so beautiful So beautiful
How's it going to be, when you're not around
And left it on First Avenue
With my hand on my heart
You turn to rocks and omen
Stay well away from trouble that you caused
Characters of flaming eyes
So don't come back for me, who do you think you are
What you crying about
For years and years and years and years
And warm me up again
Her mother does her best to console her
You don't believe me 
But a house, a house where
And half Jack
But I'm broken too,
'Cause my feelings never change a bit
At every occasion I'll be ready for the funeral
Why you turned out the way you did
Reply to Caroline Thanks so much for response
Why you got to be mean
The quiet voice she gave him
And I couldn't help but fall in love again
You cannot have fire if the candle's melted
And she went down down down there, down there for me, right on
This story is for you
It's just like being alone
I'm faithless I'm scared
I'll take your pictures all down
And I don't understand the same things as you
Don't you wish that we could forget that kiss
Waiting until dark
But if, let's say, it won't work out
He was sleeping on the streets and homeless
Brides in veils for you
'Cause I can hardly see
Though my vision is strainin'
For something to believe in
Now that I'm falling to the sunlights and a song
Although the sun will never shine the same
I really don�t know why I�m staying here
And I don't mind
If I close my eyes, it's all the same
Boys get discovered as winter melts
Every image to your face and heel
A love that should have lasted years
And the kids
To this western town
Step one, step one
Say the words that you say
And you tryin' to come back home
And this song's my sorry 
I promised I
Am I so insignificant
'Twas Halloween and the ghosts were out
A beaming sunrise buries the night
Y sin ti todo es tan aburrido 
And love is not a victory march
I got no distance left to run
And well, try so bad to tell me that you
I'm on fire
Watch me now, and I'll be someone new
They argue "Walk this way", "No, walk this way"
There's only lies
And I'm ready for my sun
Please let me go
I'll probably be the last to know; no one says until it shows See how it is
And if I hadn't set aside the fact that you were brokenhearted
Antiseptic and tired, I can't remember your face
I'll be misunderstood
Keep me in your heart for a while
Saying I'm sorry
Before it's coming to an end, yeah
I'll be here when you come back
Like falling angels, the world disappeared
Take your space and take your reasons
I'll never kiss your lips again
Your wings won't spread up against the sky
I am here for you, if you'd only care
Sing me something soft,
But still you lived inside of me
Change of season, love can die
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder
And that I'd climb through your window
She's never gonna love you
She's a tear that hangs inside my soul forever
my days without you are only an echo, 
This you surely knew
I'll win you back for me if you give me a chance
And now we're all alone
My kingdom for a kiss upon her shoulder
It's been a long day without you my friend
Our eyes are in the flowers
Will you say to them when I'm gone
I'd hate to intrude
And there's no more pain
She's a little better than the one that used to be with me
I've been kicked off my land at the age of sixteen
I hope that you will just let it go by
This lady of the flowers and her hypnotic gaze
Better run run run run run to me
There on your face 
And it's so hard to take
This lonely little love dog
Bear paws and rascal power
What would you think of me now
Let me break
In rough blue waters in your eyes
And now my head's hurting, you say I always get my own way
Somebody get me out of here,
I blamed my father for the wasted years
And I hope you feel better
That hangs in a basement
Think I just remembered something
Though some may hold the rose, some hold the rope
And the bird girls can fly 
Can die
Moon and sun
To break from what
But I hate your guts I want you so much
Do you know I cry
An unwanted sun pulls rank in the sky
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew ya
So you can struggle in the water
Everything just takes me back
All my time until I die I've been told only fools rush in
And watch as it dies from bleeding
Now does that sound familiar
I guess it's luck, but it's the same
If you don't want to be with me just say and I will go
Hide my head, I want to drown my sorrow
I can still feel the breeze that rustles through the trees
And spare the good people it takes
The actor's gone, there's only you and me
And it hurts to say
I wanna' bleed, show the world all that I have inside
We will keep it alight together
Cause you are the greatest
But for some reason you didn't
In my lover's arms I find relief
The colder water
They say start as you mean to go on
Nobody lives
And that was so many years ago
Et que la chanson de Prévert
Every night when I go off to bed and when I wake up
To fear the beating of your drum
You step a little closer each day
But it's hit me since you left us,
And children lived in Leningrad
After soakin' the body of Jesus Christ in blood
We'll wish this never ends
This can't be the end
It's her eyes that fill with water
And I was wrong
And I did feel like coming, but I also felt like crying
Is all hope lost
And I'll watch your face
It just gets hard to believe
A fouryear offense to the devoted type I may have got an invitation but I wasn't invited
Mama tried to wash their faces
I'm not a man of too many faces 
He says the choices were given,
Scream my name just one more time
It will all go black 
Everybody's got them
Any street
Memories of a life that's been loved
So she named the baby Elvis
Please, please, don't tell my mates
We will stay warm together
Cymbals crashed, the lights went blue
It's in the water now
And I felt my head exploding
And it's not what I was seeking
Sorrow found me when I was young
By the look of the clock
The salt you breathe
And sit alone and wonder
And someone can say they love me truly
I saw a spaceship fly by your window 
And you who love to love and believed we can never give enough
Ain't no other cats got love for me
Well, You measured no one that I've ever known
Slowly I relive a better past
Battle cries and champagne just in time for sunrise
And miles and miles and miles and miles and miles and miles away
How could I let things
'Cause you are not alone
Out here it's like I'm someone else,
I found out yesterday
Everybody needs inspiration,
Who will fall far behind
I know you want the sin without the sinner I know I know
Just going to wait it out
When the hour is upon us
There's a fire inside of you
Blinding wall between us
Don't turn away
When you say love is a simple chemical reaction
The last defender of the sprawl said, "Well, where do you kids live"
Tell me that you turned down the man
If I was walking through a sad art gallery
Of the future
I lay down next to your boots and I prayed
To a place I've seen in a magazine that you left lyin' around
Taking all light from my view
They'll put that smile back on my face ya
Love is blinding when the timing's never right
And I feel your warm hand
This, I need
Of your name
He drops to his knees, says please my love, please
Lacking in the social graces
Thought I'd see you, thought I'd see you
Been draggin' a dragonfly
Shot up hot from under the sea
I might believe you if I didn't know
Die for anyone; what have I become
In the living room when you kissed my neck
After all the lies that I made you believe
I'll do what I can to show her the way
Twinkle, little star
That you're not the person you wanna be
Oh could I be the sky on the fourth of July
I would do at this moment
You just gotta let it go
But tonight, you're on my mind so
Your actions speak much louder than words
Past the blues, past the blues,
Don't ever let anyone tell you you deserve that
Where are you
Nobody knows but me
And I don't think that I can fight
I know you're coming for the people like me
Where everything was fiction, future, and prediction
We were , maybe less, maybe a little more
A history so deep it hurts to look
He waits to hear her say "forgive"
I am on your side
I know you love the song, but not the singer I know you've got me wrapped around your finger
Broken down and hungry for your love
Was covered in snow
I'm here for the hard times
Inside it's warm
Why can't I cry about this
Seems like it was yesterday when I saw your face
Open your eyes Open your eyes
Would you hold my hand if I saw you in heaven
All our dreams come true
I did this for you too, you still got me around your finger
You leave all that we were undone
Among the trees and by the river
This is love, this is porn
Oh, why you got to be mean now
Someone suddenly my fear
But awoke in each other's eyes
I get along but the trips always feel so long
That mean enough to me You're right
An ounce of peace is all I want for you, will you never call again
As the plane was touching down
Years go by, will I still be waiting
Let the clouds roll
And the lead in the life 'cause I never play fair
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Two to none
This is the mess I've made
As their shoes fill up with water
Serve it up, don't wait
I keep a leash around you
Shatter in the blink of an eye
I want nothing more to doubt
Now I'm darker than the deepest sea
No one knew what they could do
I don't belong in the world, that's what it is
And though I may not look like much
Hearing the trials of the people there, who's to care if they lose
You're the one who's always bruised and broken
An empty house is not a home
When you're born into trouble
It was over my head
Oh, my baby, don't cry
You got me, I got you, yeah you got me and I got you
'This night always falls again
Sound like the wind in my ears
Press my face to the ground
Weep not for the memories
Yeah yeah they cheer  can they see my hand in the air
As friends, after so long
Let the golden age begin
In a future
There was a time I thought I'd die
People pushin' by, and walkin' off into the night
I know there was something that we could compare
Every famine virtual Retrovertigo
A sin you swallow for the rest of your life
And I hope you die
My hands before my fading eyes
So cry if you need to, but I can't stay to watch you
Cut out my tongue,
She had seen her own body outlined in chalk
Oh my heart, don't break the promise
I go back to the places we've been
I remember you quite well
Just be careful when you shine
Till you came and made sense out of everything
Scratching at the surface now
After the show you walked right past
You see, it was my fault Of course it was mine 
Yes, you could say we're a team
Yesterday was cold and bare
The book of love is long and boring,
But I'll be home, I'll be home
Apron strings around my neck
That I didn't break your heart
The morning will come
He hasn't been sober for days
All those drives, we had a million questions
I always figured there'd be time enough
And say everything's fine
Still I must obey, still I must invite
We could be a beautiful miracle, unbelievable,
Cause my heart caught fire
If you take me there you'll get relief
And I shut my eyes
They fall among the voices and the wine
I wish you had a favourite beauty spot that you loved secretly
I just don't want you to do some crazy shit
And now I am supplying you the time and space
But I'm still around
Run fast for your mother, fast for your father
Stole underground
And part of this terrible mess that you're making
Digging for Kryptonite on this oneway street
Can't lift a finger, can't change my mind
Kiss the ground that you walk on, baby,
A heart that's full up like a landfill
And I will never forgotten
I'll send you all this message in code,
Did you really think I wouldn't see this through
What once was a Emerald City is now a crystal town
Fighting for a lost cause
I am older now
And if I am crying
So is it better to tell and hurt or lie to save their face
I wish that you knew when I said two sugars, actually I meant three
My eyes are falling
And I forget about you long enough to forget why I needed to
I'm stronger than all my men
This town has dragged you down
God only knows what we're fighting for
Or change the moment when it's gone
All the white horses
And you were right, right from the start, it took everything you had, but you finally broke my
Not the name that you call me with
Oh mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head
Never thought all this could expire Never thought you'd go break the chain
I truly understand Please, don't cry now
To treat me so nice,
Feeling the monster climb deeper inside of me
Was a parliament of owls
In the moment
And though my edges may be rough
The hopped up boys are lookin' for their trouble
I have seen what I choose and I've seen what I need
Give my gun away when it's loaded
I wouldn't worry, you have all your life
Ooh, the years burn, burn, burn
Fall apart right here in Northside bars
Passed out on the floor 
We might kiss
But I'll be back, don't try and follow me
I've reached the end of my tether I've torn all your letters up
So I quit school and that's what I did
Comfortable, not drinking too much
And the soles of your shoes
And there ain't no healing from cutting yourself with a jagged edge
I fell apart but got back up again
This is the way that we love And I'm wastin' everyday
Up to your hill
Because this happens every time I knew it would
You're calling off the guards Am I coming
I would show you off like a trophy
I guess you are at an advantage
From this situation laden with hearsay
Repeats  times
Every line
And find some beautiful place to get lost
This might be the time to break down
Well the day begins, you don't want to live, 'cause you can't believe in the one you're with
I was the one
All the memories are getting colder
You take your heart,
They wish for different worlds
Oh my Barbara, she looks so much like my mom
Ever since you found yourself in someone else's arms
The mother of your children every really play
We never change, do we No, no We never learned to leave
Weeks are slow, days drag on
It is the evening of the day
I close my eyes to see
And sharpen them with lies
The pretty lies
Oh why can't I be what you need
Music starts playin' like the end of a sad movie
I never really knew how to move you
'Cause I can't wait to figure out what's wrong with me
Washes yesterday's garden
"I can take one thousand showers
Where she may come from
And now I guessed I should've listened
Of color she left in your black and white field
Nothing can be changed
Does he let you tell him all your favorite parts
It's only lies that I'm living
I can love you desperately, though your love ain't guaranteed
'Cause the love that you lost wasn't worth what it cost
You said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she
Ten different ways I could end this night 
When you change your point of view to underfoot very good 
Like michael back in the day
I hope that I find you in heaven
This has got to die
I waited for a bus to separate the both of us
If it's all in my head, there's nothing to fear,
Have seen everything to see
Is there anyone I could call
The mother of the willow green
Everyone says I'm getting down too low
That just can not be controlled
Ever since the day I left you
You've dreamed of thousand dreams, none seem to stick in your mind
In fact, you have become
I don't know where else I can go, mother
I know, let them not weep,
So I'll keep my head down
We think the same things at the same time
He said, "Girl, you better try to have fun no matter what you do"
And you're not even around
You always smile but in your eyes your sorrow shows
But it's starting to all make sense
Love is hell, hell is love
With cold, cold Campbell's from the can
Let your son grow
Oh feel our bodies grow
But no one seems to notice any change in her figure
I wish I had a river so long
The fall, the fall
It's out of love, ooh ooh
Before our innocence was lost
The holding up on bended knees
Let it flood right through the houses 
And I look, and I see, you could be breaking souls again
I've had enough of this same old game
There's pictures of you and I on the walls around me
And I don't know what his name was
Hey yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Then the air went thinner
And now the time has gone
It's so hard to say goodbye
Up tight against the side of me
Lonely little love dog that
Uncry these tears
So now you're scared of love
There's nothing here that you'll miss
It's hard to even fathom which parts I should believe
Forgot how to cry
I'll say the things that you said
Waiting to keep the appointment she made
Rain taps the window
To do everything in truth
Children are playing
And do you think you deserve your freedom
Now there's flowers in your window
For everything that I've done
Let's not fuck around
Is all that I'm asking for without her I'm lost
I hope that all is well in heaven
To burn out all your tricks
Somebody's go to stay
It all goes wrong, she sets things tragic
I never tried to feel this vibration
The words were scribed on every page and now there's
Your mouth that never tells lies
I'll be flicking stones at your window
And I die when you mention his name
Disagree on the sidelines
And I would like to think so
A savoir comment
Why tell me about anything
It made us restless
A man can be happy with the weather
Well I must remain in tune forever
I don't do too much talking these days
And when I wake you I'll be the first thing you see
And you just laughed
Someplace where no one calls it wrong
There's only smoke 
So I wait for you to call and I try to act natural
It's one step away
When you need directions
Said, "Never pick sides, never choose between two"
A song that no one sings
When you look at me
Is banished to the past
I can't stand to fly
Forlorn from today
Being tonight
Drew walks by me
Now it's too late for you and your white horse, to come around
Instruments shine on a silver tray
I'm screaming out for a second try
Well, maybe I don't need no angel at all
Say it one more time, baby
Maybe now everything will be so clear
You want me to cry and play my part
So then I move my hand up from down by my side
A brush through her hair, children kissing upstairs
Sees some people smoking off to the side
That's where she lies, broken inside
I saw a shooting star and thought of you
Who's the loser now
And it feels like I'm flying above you
It's hard to let your children go, leave home
I can't break through your world
Dangerous 'cause I want you so much
We must get older now
Brush down my sparkling sides
Rows of houses all bearing down on me
Well, I did my time in the jail of your arms
Emotion sickness
That was me, me, me
You told me you were coming back, right back
The tears have stained all the pages
But after one too many I know that I'm never
How you'll still be there, when the heartache ends
When all, all that I did was for you
But when I pick up, I don't have much to say
I still want you
And there's no more crying
Can you see the handwriting
And it's ok, she don't want the world
Too much, too bright, too powerful
We may be just a little fuzzy 'bout it later tonight
You will look for me
I've heard there was a secret chord
When fear strangles a soldier's pride
The fangs are stuck inside my skin
Heart pain
She lives in a bungalow
I'm sorry but it's too late and it's not worth saving
Me colder when it's over
Stormy weather
I'm wondering for days and hours
So I try
And I'm closer than I've ever been before
Hey Ain't life wonderful
And something reminds you, you wish you had stayed
And the water filled your tiny lungs
As you blocked his head away
The blankfaced stares on the subway as the people go home 
Bobby got a shad fly
And your ship may be coming in
I sat down, got a fat frown
And when the money comes in for the work I do
Smoking his last cigarette
The quiet one
It's not my fault
We played out on this movie screen 
Let's slit our wrists and burn down something beautiful
Don't you know she's got a know know know know know know know
And a blanket on your bed,
Where I lay my head
Run away from me baby, run away Look at ya
Dig a shallow grave and I'll lay me down
And I don't need you telling me how
And where is the harmony, sweet harmony
Tell me your worries, I want to be told
The aching starlet
And you had an apology in your mailbox since last July
But the moment's magic swept us away
Shiny guitar hung on gold lamé
So are you gay Are you blue
A shallow grave, a monument to the ruined age
Has a little hard luck
How's that thought for you
I'll keep them still
Now I'm writing just to let you know I'm still alive
It's a lifetime guarantee
I always find the words to say to keep you right here waiting
I saw you falling on the floor
The little wet tears on your baby's shoulder
How much I love you
In Carthusian Red I get cut along
When we just stood still
Until I'm out of breath
It's just a name
And I want to go home
Lights will guide you home
"Daddy please, daddy don't leave, daddy  no stop it"
Isn't something missing
And he'll make war, oh, war, on who you were before
You kissed the boy and make him feel this way
Everyday is silent and grey
I don't feel it anymore
Settle like dust on the shoulders of the old friends
Love me, love me, love me, love me, say you do
Yet I always try to hide
And no one understands, my dear, no one really cares
Counting his questions in the neon light
And I'll throw it in the current that I stand upon so still
Angels might call by 
And Barbara, she looks just like my mom
People you hate will get their hooks into you 
It's all in her mind
I've said some things I wish you'd never heard
And all I wish is gone away
I didn't need you to reply
Old friends, winter companions, the old men
I get the point  fine, me and mommy are gone"
My head is twisted severe, body's rushing everywhere,
As bottles call my name I won't see you tonight
Sounds as loud as a lover's words
It seems that the winds have stopped
And it seems that I can't live a day without you
The sun has fallen down
Delirious with pain
'Cause my heart has found its home
To meet him eye to eye and face to face
It will drop down on the floor
In case you would go walking
And you'd speak of your loved ones as I clumsily strummed my guitar
In his head it's like the weather
Those singing morphine alarms out of tune
I can deal with some psychic pain
Cruelty to the winner, bishop tells the king his lies
So we wait and see
I'd always love you
I never was the fantasy
I caught a long wind
What we did suddenly
Wild horses
When it ends
Here on earth
I had tender feelings that you made hard
I'll keep chasing the soles of your shoes
There's only pain
The tight grip and the sun lick 
Rabid sleep through benediction
Kiss me goodbye
Believe, relief, believe
Just your skin against the window
Contrast and compare
And when the hour is upon us
And I said I'd find a better place we could spend eternity
I look at you
I'll try to put a word in for you
We are blessed and sustained
Take a look, you may see me in the dirt
And tonight 
Like the dream of you I had
Can make everything alright
You were supposed to return
Sometimes I just feel it's only me
Another time undone
You're already the voice inside my head 
I thought I saw you breathing
Tried to get by on bread and water
Moonlight tonight
Left this haunted town
Sometimes I pretend
A man has to have a little bit of variety
I'll stay up all night and crash on the plane
Clinging to his picture for dear life
Any place you've never been
I was so excited to 
I don't expect anything
Follow me through a city of frost covered angels
Oh when I sing, oh when I sing
But if love is like stone
Searching for something
I've given a lot of thought on this  hour drive
We'll start talking again
There's something inside this weary head that wants us to love just instead
So do you think that we could work out a sign
My cave is deep now, yet your light is shining through
And you can have this heart to break
Like a walk in the park, like a hole in your head
We couldn't wait to get outside
Well I hope the ground is what you find
And the weight is crushing down on my lungs, I know I can't breathe
For this heart's a little bit older
And if you call
She thinks I can't see the smile that she's faking
But my heart is open
What we don't touch we cannot feel
On my soul
Every corner abandoned too soon
And I don't know how we separate the lies here from the truth
Mary's got the same size hands Oh
The singer sheds a tear, fear of falling out
The quickest tongue to divide and devour 
And end up together
Are you dying to believe
Barely conscious in the door where you stand
Life can show no mercy, it
Yeah, throw me tomorrow oh, oh
But there's a price that you'll pay
Can you find me space inside your bleeding heart
My heart wants to hold
Now I must come back down
I know, I've gotta let you go
They've been going nowhere for days
Against strangers
And I always find, yeah I always find somethin' wrong
I like to believe it was all about love for a child
Everybody taking different sides
Someone who isn't you
Gather your skeletons far inside
And 'Someone Save Temptation'
I've learned to fly
Ain't no use in you trying
I guess I still care
A fraction's left up to dispute
Metal heart, you're not hiding
Don't look back, keep your head held high
The water's clear
si alguna aparece
Can't you hear their call
That's all, I don't even think of you that often
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts
And wild is the wind
Got to walk out of here
I read about your Uncle Ronnie, too, I'm sorry
Have you abandoned me
Please take it easy it can't all be my fault
I know you'd rather see me gone than to see me the way that I am
In the garden with my mother
No one knows you, till it's over
What was your question Love is the answer
I work these hands to bleed 'cause I got mouths to feed
She has won Now it's no fun 
And would you get them if I did
I've made my mistakes 
Burning in the corner is the only one who dreams he had you with him
And you're walking away, away
See no use perfecting lives with strangers
Through all their lies
Why'd you have to let it go
A gag is placed between her lips
Loose the taste for kissing
One hand on the trigger of a telephone
Creation comes when you learn to say no
There's a feelin'
I'm still remembering the time
But I take it all back now
This song is for the rats
C'mon, angel
New plane
Start, stop and start Stupid acting smart
Especially when I have to watch other people kissing
But I know I'll do the right thing
Because none of it was ever worth the risk
And formed the bruises that you said you didn't want to fade
Never letting no one take it away
If it'll slow down my higher brain
And nobody seems to like him
Ducttape and soldered wires
Its either love or hate, I can't find in between
I'd spend a lifetime with you
Oh babe I can't hide it I can't even find it in you
I won't deny the change
When you're too in love to let it go
You'd be hers if only she would call
A little jetty fight
There's nothing left
Look inside a skeleton 
All the torment and the pain
it's tearing up inside of me
It was the only thing I felt I could do
I'm so tired of you, America
If the wild bird could speak
Knew we'd put up with anything
Spending my time
Something up your sleeve
And Jane came by with a lock of your hair
Poor girl, lonely 
On this barren road 
And gave those children everything we had
It's gettin' dark, too dark to see
There's such a chill
The one on the only, the all for all
Where the water flows to
In the tower above the earth, we built it for Emmanuel 
And you feel hopeless and homeless
You give me a little bit
Some people don't even know his name
Did you hear the news about Edward
my days without you are an excess, 
In a beautiful world
You are missing in my heart
Everything is different nothing's really changed
You don't need to bother
No blinding light
No, I can't forget tomorrow
Jeddy  is what we first called him
I will scream my lungs out till it fills this room
Aww, this skin
I can hardly speak, I understand
Paint your palette blue and gray
Can you please stop time
The only one I loved and not forgive
Now I truly love you wholly
No you still don't like to leave before the end of the show
Never thought I'd fill with desire Never thought I'd feel so ashamed
Oh, yeah, yes 
Never ran away for the sake of scars
Damn, this place
And when no hope was left in sight
You'd better get down on the floor
Till death do us part
Kick the door
You are so fragile and thin
All shall fade to black
You stayed inside
I will not leave you all aone
Without you on my mind
If all the sons, all the daughters, stop to take it in
That you don't want around anymore
Explaining what I feel, that empty feeling
I guess I should have heard of that from you
And the future hangs over our heads
When I threw that drink in that guy's face
You came back soft without a sound
And ev'ry day I wanna dooohoohoohooh
Or with whoever she spends her time
The future's unclear
Lose my hands to use my heart
No rowing could outrun
But since she lost her daughter
In my room
Just one smile and I'm wild
At least I can say that I've tried
These are the things that I
Cashmere, cologne and white sunshine
Than I did before
We broke up a month ago and I grew up; I didn't know I'd be around the morning after
In this love
On the one sunny day that winter gave up
To teach us how to fly
Some of them living, some of them dead
My sweet prince My sweet prince
And dream of sheep
I'm running out of clock
Army dreamers
Something borrowed, something blue
I think about the places I'd go
If there's anything to say, if there's anything to do
Kicking shadows on the street for every mistake that I have made
Not yours, not mine
He's not a fool
At least I remember taking them and not a lot else
He's the smell of the moonlight wisteria
They pissed in his hands
In each line there
So kiss me hard
We are the resin
And now with postdemise at hand
Didn't mean, didn't mean to leave you stranded
It will light up our way forever
Darkness falling, leaves nowhere to go
Now I'm at a place I thought I'd never be, ooh
You know, I used to live alone before I knew ya
But know right from wrong
And maybe you never need more than that
And the hardest part is letting go
He said he had to see my face
You look a lot like you'd
Black and light black 
Come upstairs and I'll show you where all my
And colder than yours
Because of people who were "nice"
To end
Yeah, 'cause we are broken
I woke up today in London
Let me break the things I love I need to cry
Doors swinging wide, you walked in to hide
If you ever get that chimp off your back
I took the pictures in my head
Watch what you say to me
Is leaving Never a thought for ourselves
You and me were kings over the parkway tonight
Like a skyscraper, like a skyscraper
"There's plenty of time to make you mine tonight"
Yes, I fear tomorrow I'll be crying
All the seasons where you dye your hair
Flaming flowers that brightly blaze
My feet are always heavy as I inch toward the door
I'm falling asleep and I can't see straight
And the only thing I know is
The love I give returned to me
No one's gonna love you more than I do
How long have I been in this storm
Sometimes I stand on my roof at night 
And so is the girl you used to call
Did you hear me laughing in your head, when I saw you stuck in a rut again
And things get bent into shape
I'mma give you the world
﻿And look no further for happiness
Where would you like for me to hang my head
No sleep today
Round here, we talk just like lions
Crazy as it sounds you won't
Long ago in some black hole before they had these pills to take it back
She loves her mama's lemonade
Can you stop the train
Goodbye my friend, I won't ever love again
Nothing yet has really sunk in
Once undone
Before you kiss me you should know 
That I don't feel you or recall, I'll put your bones out in the yard
I've looked at clouds that way
Seasons change in a gothic way
I see just who you are
You know that I wouldn't mind
I love the things that you've given me
And all the cracks will crawl right through me
That we shape
And ground never seemed so far away 
Hot, hot, weather in the summer
I'm dying, I'm crying
I know if I'm face to face that she'll come to her senses 
All that's left me kept me strong
Goodnight, always to all that's pure that's in your heart
i will already look for what makes me 
Please stay where you are
Telling strangers
Sometimes I remember all the pain
To live the life that I have made in song
I love no one
You say I'm crazy
And it's all in your mind 
A secret kiss
Appear, my dear, and cry for me
Hell bound Airlines, time and price
And she's walking out
Desperate, I will crawl, waiting for so long
Two guards for one uncharged
Do you know how lost hearts fear
No, I've changed my mind again
Something about this might
But I'm not lost, I'm not gone
I'm just moving uncomfortably slow, yeah, slow
Pluck every last daisy clean till only I may love you
Life was a party to be thrown
I'm'a try to be a big girl now
You're a sadeyed lie
To keep me from sleeping
And though an autumn time lullaby
And you try not to put on any sexy clothes or graces
Now don't be sad
From finding life out on my own
Into the fire
That this time was forever
You held my hand so tight
I'm tired of postcards, especially the ones with cute dogs and cupids
I heard voices of friends vanished and gone
Or a problem is a task disguised in work clothes
There's nothing to do but I don't mind when I'm with you
Where there's no one here but me
Casting your gaze way out to no man's land
All he wanted was a toy
Captain of my feelings
Then maybe I would tell who I was
I hope that our few remaining friends
And expose all the lies
The last three years were just pretend
I'm so lonely, lonely, lonely
Don't just stare like you never cared, I know you did
We could go back to Woodstock
Out on the front porch
In the halls I'd rather hear silence
A soldier's down
Take your eyes off me so I can leave
Setting off the car alarms as it passes by
Mother don't worry, she's got a garden we're planting together
The room's suddenly spinning
Always under or above
Don't let her see
So tired of life
Only you can mend
So why you looking at me like you're a lady
Should of known, when I hit the ground running
You're free with a history
Is there a chance
And there are days when I'm losing my faith
But sometimes a someone is so hard to find
The reason that the sky is blue
If you're lost and feel alone, circumnavigate the globe
Weakened knees call
'Cause I'm sleepwalking
Honey I ain't nothing new
Other people not
Into Judy's room 
I wear myself out in the morning,
I remember it clearly
A walkon part in a war for a lead role in a cage
In love together, we found a way
Baby pit bull butterfly
Well I did my best
Two tickets to a film I don't remember
You and me alone
And the pavements they are a mess
Oh, my babe, just say goodbye, say goodbye
but at least i'm breathing 
How can I fall asleep at night
Remember all the things you'd say
Is anybody here I know
The world shrinks
Is he dark enough
And if it's alright I'll beg you
That no one knows the name of
But I can't sleep
Started carrying her books and doing lots of drugs
I understand what I am still too proud to mention to you
Reach out into the darkness 
I know the feeling of finding yourself stuck out on the ledge
She is your marrow and your ride home
Behind the rings on their fingers imprints the ink deep in the inner
Last night I dreamed that I was a child out where the pines grow wild and tall
In a voice that's hollow
I was only dreaming
It's knowing that he knows you now after only guessing
Why she's given half her life to people she hates now
But stay with me a minute, I'll swear I'll make it worth it
When there's nowhere left to fall
Would've sung to your beautiful heart
And so there's a change, in your emotions
I'm sorry,
And so I pour myself the stiffest drink my stomach can stand
Still he's not satisfied
This ain't no free rent, come and pitch a tent, you ain't tying me down
We were ordered to burn
I wonder how you decorate your room
I was crazy thinking you were mine
Wanna feel your warmth upon me, I wanna be the one
Where it begins or ends, what it means to be dead
So used to losing
Who showed me how to kill my cares
I got the antiChrist in the kitchen yelling at me again
Be mine
With a smile on your face
My father's house stood shining hard and bright the branches and brambles tore my clothes and scratched my arms
Ran into you yesterday
A future for us
Why am I running away
In these jeans of his with her name still on it
You don't know who you are, but you know who you wanna be
So come back to your old black sheep man
Nobody cares if the people
When she says she has no time for you now
If I could tear you from the ceiling 
Take your hand and walk away
Who died and made you in charge of who loves who
And you coming back to me is against the odds 
Snoozing in cobwebs and the cement
Here by my side
So grab your mother's keys, we leave tonight
She was lying on the floor
But clouds got in my way
In the cold light of morning 
No you will not be alone then
Like a drug in the water
You see the cripple dance
You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it
It makes me see what I want to see
It's not a trick, your senses all deceiving,
Come on I need it
And still, if I yell at the top of my lungs
When you get what you want but not what you need
I've been living out of this here
Please don't worry lover, it's really bursting at the seams
Walk on water, pretty Mary K
But the wrong words will strand you
And it gets too much, yeah, it gets so much
And then I heard what you say, man, that was ugly
"Love is watching someone die"
You're a rose and you're laughing now
It's the price we pay for the summertime
It seems like we've been losing control
Now it's your time to look after us
Can't you see I try
All animals lead us to light
Drags his bones to see the Yankees play
I don't need to be, yeah I don't need to be
You wouldn't have begged me to hold you
Oh, how do I show all the love
Held her there, kicking and mewling, upended, unspooling, unsung and blue
I hope I'm paranoid, that I'm just seeing things
And my skin is clear and you can see what I'm thinking
Papa went to other lands
When I think of yesterday
The first time that you introduced me to your friends
So let the light guide your way, yeah
You are such a funny bear
You said I was on your mind 
Out of the lightning
I'll grow old
And may no man's weight
Will you say when I'm gone away
Three wasted years, standing still
I love you
Nothing is pure anymore but solitude
Are you afraid of being alone
This tide always turns,' I said
'Cause it's all in her mind
Ever searching for the one Melanie C Ever searching for the one
And I'll see you when I get back
You're looking skinny like a model with your eyes all painted black
Put your insides all on ice 
Seen how things are hard
All of you, all right
And she may cry like a baby
Saying that you were leaving, letting go
It's just that he's not around to play along, yeah
You'd give your life, you'd sell your soul
Stay up all night with the stars
I can't prepare for death any more than I already have
Now comes the night
I've been dreaming about you and only you
You bloody mother fucking asshole
Jackie ooh
Along with everything that was lost and won
In somebody's life
You know how the time flies
Keepin' warm
He said, I'm gonna buy this place and burn it down
But I got my man
You heard me on the radio about one year ago
This dusty barren land had given all it could yield
And dad moved back to the other side of  Mile on Novara
And return her to the harbor where she goes to bed
To know that I am happy with some other guy
'Cause on a cold day, you can see forever
How's the husband How's your kids You know that I got married, too
So I'm just waiting on fate to come
They'll tell you everything
Honey, don't you weep don't you weep for them
At night while everyone was sleeping,
Graceful swans of never topple to the earth
And it felt like a bullet in her heart
We want us like everything else
I won't let this happen to my children
I'm keeping my promise to you I got ya back now
Babies turn blue when they're ignored
Remember how to put back the light in my eyes
That you just don't believe that I'm sincere
Sometimes you make me feel like I am living at the edge of the world
By the river
Every time I walk out the door,
So one last time, I need to be the one who takes you home; Takes you home, boy
Only darkness every day
You have no right to ask me how I feel
I smell it still
If you love me got to know for sure
Say goodbye to Alexandra leaving;
Send photo to address, is it you and me
What a wicked thing to say
I know the day will come
And New York is getting kind of cold
Yeah, I took your love for granted
But either way I can't breathe
They will stay there forever
You took my soul and wiped it clean
I watch them cut, watch them touch, watch them do what they came to do
It's rocking the boat; we gotta get control of this
You are the ways of my mistakes
To our love let all the jilted lovers cry
Now way back when
I've been missing you
Pain is just a consequence of love;
But still I never learned to live
Ten guys on whom I can depend
I try to wash him out but like they say, the blood is thicker
Do you come
That borders your back yard
We are, we are, we are, we are
Slowly those feelings
Times have changed and now I find I'm free for the first time
Would you stand in disgrace or take a bow
Those motherfuckers got it wrong
She said, money is like us in time
I just want something, I just want something I can never have
I'm gonna stop wasting time
Drowns the startup chime inside your heart,
So call it quits
Still I remember scenes
I panic and pace when I can't see the right thing to do
The game you're in is just a game
I was central, I had control
The sweetest sadness in your eyes
In the trenches, in the hard rain
I wander the halls along the walls and under my breath
Ending with letting go 
'Cause I'd love love love to dance with my father again
And we both like to stretch the truth
Burning in his eyes
And that REM song was playing
Bury all your secrets in my skin
Blue battered naval down slip kisses
Your sister groans, 'oh, usurper to the holy throne'
I was young and at home in bed
Do my hair quickly
There is my trust in what I believe
Yeah, for the rest of my life
I'd go back in time and change it, but I can't
Our faces painted white by midnight
The water will dream for them
I promise you I will learn from my mistakes
A bit for you, a bit for everyone
With political connections to spread his wealth around
I will never believe in this again
Hold me darlin', for a little while
Don't have a soul on my side
I don't wanna be there alone, oh oh
If I had just one more day
When it was dark, I saw shapes
I've cut all my losses
They're not home to find us out
Stop 'em at the th Parallel
Inside your precious heart
He's lost in the rain
Armageddon, come Armageddon
Of things heard only in Hell
And you think you're so clever and classless and free
It's not what I believe in
The confessions of a broken heart
And unfolding
Tell her I miss her, Hailie just smiles and winks at her little sister
Most relationships seem so transitory
Sometimes I get to feeling
Seize the day or die regretting the time you lost
Now I'm alone again, where do I begin
So still I wait
There's a ghost in your old bedroom
Oogie knew there's never ever time
You never needed any help
This is the part of me that thinks all humans are ants
But beware my heart can be a pin
I knew I would leave you with babies and everything
All the tizzy, fizzy idiot things must get done
Because I love your handshake, meeting my father
Is to marvel with love at the sunset
I love it when you sing to me
I was lost from the start
I'll say I'll never wake up knowing how or why
And I never wanted anything from you
That was until the day before the day
Here's one to you
今は�だ�しlove song
All around the frightened trapeze swingers
They look at me with scorn
Be running up that road
Everybody's dying just to get the disease
We're proud of who you are
And if you've lost your love for me
Every night, alone now
Don't need no roads
I know I've got to say
I only can watch the countryside
Red light special at the mausoleum
The words I've spoken
I saw you crawling to the door
And all of the angels, they'd sell off your soul
How all the changes came about my way
Tells herself that no one will notice
Find your way into my heart
As my life flashes before my eyes
You can have my heart My heart, my heart
She's lost inside, lost inside
Ever searching for the one
Hold me close, don't let me go, I hope
In these jeans of yours with her name still on it
Why can't you hear me Why can't I sleep
Gave more than I took back, oh well So back away
The giving up is the hardest part
In the ashes and the dust
But your footsteps give you away
Go sing your song, try something new
The ability to laugh at weakness
She hid around corners and she hid under beds
Didn't need me to give him hell
I have choked my roots on the earth, as rich as roe
Gonna sing it to everyone
From this second story window I can hear the church bells
Hey  yeah  yeah 
They'll run down forever
Your hair was wild, your eyes were bright
Who cares, this is a tune coming in, that one noise is like
I kissed you
Now I will find relief
Stone
And if I need anything at all
We hadn't driven very far
Taxi driver
But it hurts me, thinking
Love to be with a brother of mine, how he'd love to find
That you would never come around
It blows like garbage through the streets
With this note you left behind,
It's a tired bus station and an old pair of shoes
They were getting older, sons and daughters
Then I would sing all that I could sing
And all those white lines that sped us up
No my blood don't flow anymore
Two wrongs make it all all right tonight
All veins in highway laps
She burns me up
Trying to be your friend
Spending little time with you
And if you ask me too, daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird
All the nonsense that you just left but yet
I died a little bit inside
Trying to believe that you're gone
Shadows all around you as you surface from the dark
But I played along with my birthday song
I say goodbye
And I know it's out of love
Cold wives and mistresses
'Build your castle, stop throwing stones
What I am to you you do not need
Is way too much to handle
If I wait for you longer my affection is stronger
It couldn't be right 'cause you're not right within
I'm grindin' until I'm tired
Wish we knew this from the start
These days aren't easy anymore
How you're plannin' to go about makin' your amends
You I held so close, in my heart oh dear
Take care
I think everything counts a little more than we think
Gave me your plastic bird
Why do you cry
There's so much this hurt can teach us both
Would you follow every line on my tearstained face
The King's Crossing was the main attraction, dominoes falling in a chain reaction
Mr Postman, do you have a letter for me
When your living in the darkness 
Here underwater we're down Here underwater way down
I am here still waiting though I still have my doubts
Hello, Heaven, you are tunnel lined,
Call it true, call it true love
I'm light as a feather
Just scratching around
I'm doin' fine, and I'm plannin' to keep it that way
It's all of the good that won't come out of me
I'm driving real hard
Everything gone white, everything's grey
They think twice, about where they're anchoring
In the morning, in the winter shade
And just try me
Blackeyed angels swam with me
And now, I guess,
Pale white like the skin stretched over your bones
Where no one notices the contrast of white on white
And there's no way back home no way back home
When there won't be a moon and there won't be a sun;
But I ain't done much healing
A good woman will pick you apart
When you abuse the one you love
You'd think after  years I'd be used to the spin
I've always been in love with you
I've been praying for you silently
Yeah, all those stars drip down like butter
They were boys with their cars
Let's do something crazy
Paddle on, just around the bend and
It was on the bed that I knew what she'd done
That look you give that guy
Hear the garbage truck back down in boulevard
I like it in the city when the air is so thick and opaque
A good friend of American soldiers
And every step I take, I stay in the same place
In my secret life
Come back to the
I don't know you, but I still want to
And flooded the engines and radio
Take your life, give it a shake
I'll still adore you, you'll never need me
Risin' at the crack of dawn
I called up Eugene
Leave it on the table till somebody else with moneys got a use
Crosses her fingers and follows behind
I should've wrote a letter
It may not seem like very much
So come on, love, draw your swords
And wondering if the one I chose was the right one
I try not to think, about the pain I feel inside
Though I know no one can see her
That's why you're on your own tonight
I'm medicated, how are you
To remind you where to stop 
I want to be someone else or I'll explode
I do this thing where I think I'm real sick
Can I say it on the phone, if I thought you were alone,
So I drive home alone
When they're under your skin
Every step that you take
Until the Soviets turned their ships around
But I was just thinking, merely thinking
You'd never change, but that's not true
Almost nothing
You're the one whose shower's always golden
I carry the things that remind me of you
I thought I'd see when day was done
I adored you in every one of those
All the answers, honey
'Cause you're nobody girl
Discard my friends to change the scenery
I know you think that I'm someone you can trust
Or raise my hands to you
You are ready to use
The words are tightening around my throat and, and
I forgot my shirt at the water's edge
Ist es egal geworden was mit uns passiert
I'm not like all the other girls
Is a planet aligned
There's a corner of your heart just for me
In the darkness I will meet my creators
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
Fly to the side
And I can't love you any more than I do
To write about all of these faded things
You're travelling with my heart  I hope this is a temporary feeling,
Give a little, just a little bit
Oh, Won't you take yourself a photograph and laugh at me
And I keep it like a burning
Of your November downtown
Talking aloud as they sit round their tables
The cleaners have done their job on you
Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night
And mouth and eyes and heart all bleed
I know you remember me
She is starting to live her life from the inside out
But I don't believe you, baby
When I see my face in the mirror
And don't wait for the sky to clear
Would you cry with me 
And my father locks the car by the store
Part of the future
She tried to show him love
Well thank you, it was a real blast
I'm your becoming, so I'll always be nothing
Yes, and I feel too young to hold on
A free world of clear division
Everything you hated me for Honey there was so much more
Melt in me one more time
They push and shove and won't bend to your will
I've started falling apart
Or ever was
I lose my way and it's not too long before you point it out
But without you around I feel nothing but cold
Someone that looks like
Just keep in mind you need no more at all
I wanna have control
In your name in your name I find meaning
Will he make you feel like you're invincible
I wish you could exist to live on my planet
You fool
The man who could make you sure he was the one
We can let it change our lives can braid
We would do anything to bring him back to you
But I might hurt you again
Anyone can tell you there's no more road to ride
Try to kill it all away but I remember everything
The fact that you are married
Can I hold you one last time
Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
I heard her say it once
Now Ophelia wants to know where she should turn
I'm a foolish, fragile spine
Oh and still the beating never ends
I fought him off with my love
Before I met her I was sad
And I'm so high, not even you and all your love could bring me down
And it looks like I'm burning it down
Don't you talk to me
How did he learn to hold fruit in his hands,
But I can't imagine a life without
Oh I know that I love you, so please throw down your hair
All my bags are packed, I'm ready to go
You're using your headphones to drown out your mind
I see the sky, it's so beautiful and blue
She would pretty paint my face
What are you talking about
When the world ends who's gonna hear it
And who will say that I stayed much too long
I learned to live halfalive
There was nothing to fear, nothing to doubt
You always were the one to show me how
So tired of defending her life, she could have died
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
And the cardinal hits the window
If you never wanted to hurt me
All the distance in their prefix
But when she calls me, I do not walk, I run
When you didn't like my mother
Near me, touch me, feel me
Just remembering, just remembering how we were
While the hands are pointing up midnight
Passionate bright young things
They're not the only ones
And add to the list of all the places we hate
I was there to comfort her
To read the signs more carefully
It was real, It was right
He said "Son, have you seen the world
No one's laughing at God when they're starving or freezing or so very poor
A song to say
Our eyes are in the branches
At least that's what I've been told by everyone
And count the time in quarter turns to ten
Leave me alone
I'm still not sure
Before you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doin' just fine
Praising every moment because you're my only light
Our bodies will dissolve the chemicals in due time
Or maybe I even saw it coming
Oh find me, find me, nothing more
Look up, look up
For a set of new wings and anything gold
While moving across my land
I'm a man of the world and they say that I'm strong
John said he'd drive then put his hand on my cheek
These foolish games
Farewell my friends
Why do you keep on running 
Now I'm listening I'm heading out tonight
And seen behind those eyes
You wait with me, because you know
The valentines I never knew
To fix it up, make it up somehow
There are no reasons to believe, I buried my faith in another plot
But I've still got me to be your open door
Shards of words of a shattered voice
Oh, clouds of time
I have heard the crying sound
Put my heart in its recipe
On my own here tonight
And if you fall
I left a dozen roses on your grave today;
Missing all this time
It's got to be more
Sheila rides on crashing nightingale
Happy endings, now I know
Sometimes I breathe you in
Maybe why I'm sad to see us apart
Seeing lights, feeling pain, there's my cure on ice
Still we figure out the keys
Oh I'm running from it
To start
On a day so gray it's black inside
Gonna send 'em on their way
The pictures that she sees make her cry
Wanted everything to stop that bad
Doctor says the baby's fine, but you'll have to leave
I'd go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya
What's the point of this song Or even singing
Let her go, learn a lesson
It was hard to tell just how I felt,
I've been sleeping
Baby, never should say never
Movement release
That the last sight they'll ever see is a pair of hateful eyes
I can't blame you for losing your mind
This used to be the place I ran to
I remember it all too well
Singing 'ain't this life so sweet'
And if you say something that you might even mean
Giving me head on the unmade bed
All I ever did was look up to you
Is it could take my whole damn life to make this right
Yesterday you asked me to write you a pleasant song
Ruth seems out of her mind, swears she won't give in this time
Purple kiss of stardust
With your head upon my chest
Folk singers sing songs for the working, baby
In the end
I've got nothin'
I'll be the first to say that now I'm okay
Sons could be birds, taken broken up to the mountain
A heart floats in the bay
And this'll be the first time in a week that I'll talk to you
And you're, you're so long gone from the city
I'm a little bit scared of what comes after
You're a thousand miles away
'Cause ev'ry time I cry I know
Off through the earth
All the press still hounded you
But we�re light and light and light
Shredding him to bits
And God knows I've got to live mine
Tell me the truth, did you ever love me
You don't need to preach
How can I carry on
And I know how it feels to walk out on your own
And now you're lying in the bed again
With no place to go, no place to go
I'm such a fool I can't believe I let you in my life
She put that bottle to her head and pulled the trigger
Get your picture all over the world
Before one of us has accidental babies
My hands grow darker everyday
Give me a reason to stay alive
As I talk in tongues to myself in my bed
You're dancin' circles around me
Weepin' and drownin' my senses
As I'm leaving, she wakes up and says
I don't need you telling me how
Into big black armour
Your name like ice into my heart
I look up, it's just me standing in the mirror
And I don't need this life
I want you to sigh and fall apart
Just made her more interesting
And I bought it for you 'cause it's your birthday, too'
Gonna stand on that bridge
There's a skeleton in every man's house,
Like shadows in a faded light
And I haven't got a lot of time
Without a hand to hold
Well you have no right to ask me how I feel
And the words we say aren't meant for anyone
The seasons bring change,
And I'll take you away I'll take that kiss now, but 
And every time you go to sleep
So for the rest of my life
I'm far away from home
And I won't stand it if were broken apart
It's not that we're scared
Timid little teether
Alison Krauss
He calls down the day
You have gone too far 
Anything to pass the time
Of what you have just done
That's what I do, since I met you
Cut in deep, to the heart of bone again
I'm half Jill
His hands are shaking
Come on, come on
A warning sign, I missed the good part then I realized
You can tell them all how, how good it feels to be let down
If you feel like you're alone
Touch me as I fall into view
And if I chose to walk away, would you be right here waiting
No one's laughing at God when it's gotten real late
It's gonna be all right
We've come a long way from where we began
I'm a river that is all dried up
I always catch the clock 
Upon my brow the lightest kiss
Still I cling
And all that really mattered then was that I was a man
And we could never repair
'Cause we've shared the laughter and the pain
She dreams him as a boy
Turn around and see me cry
I left you in the right
I went to bed, I was thinking about you
And I am no longer afraid of anything
I see him die a little more inside
So I pull my collar up and face the cold
Hold on to your pillow case
Peace and love,
I can't escape the echoed words
You don't know if I care, you tryin' to find the proof
It's another family's turn to die
I never let you go
Say you're sorry, that face of an angel, comes out, just when you need it to
So let me ask, would you like that, would you like that
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I miss all the little things
Everything led back to you
And that old tooth I believe was a bear's
Close all the windows 
You always said I should hedge my bets
Goodbye my lover
They come and go as if they're someone else's days
Some people say she's funny
What the hell am I doing right
But it's alright, why don't you tell me again
Over and over in my brain again
Oh that drink went down smoothly, just like the one before the last you had
It's been stuck there since it came a few nights ago
I have called you children, I have called you son
But only in the street man
Call girl, no phone
Now every corner's filled with dust
You wouldn't have done
This sentence may seem like a lifetime, a scream
Here are all my songs
'Cause it's all just the same at the end of the day
And the calm weight of all things summer
I hear it's nice in the summer
I'm missing you, missing you like crazy, daily
It was pain
Baby, won't you breathe
No more crying, ooh ooh
You got some issues Stan, I think you need some counselling
Let's go and trip a dwarf"
I'll be wallowing in sorrow
And all the things your money can't buy
And I curse the life I'm living
If you can't make up your mind
Take a look, you may see me on the ground
Highlights, clear view on the vista 
You'd stay the hell out of my way
There's a seat here alongside me
The fact that I'll die
Plastic, go back to being plastic
I'm on my knees in front of him
Any town of any thought
In a town where your memories lie
With their teeth behind their tongue
The boxer isn't finished, he's not ready to die
And now stuck up inside my head, how they ever gonna grow
Tell me everything you saw
But if you'd searched the whole wide world
And the kids that keep me alive
I thought I would need
Will you remember me
Don't you know no one alive can always be an angel
It thrives in the dark
Makes me so sad, girl
I know you're not far, but I still can't handle all the distance;
Out and over the iridescent grid 
They stoned it with rocks till it collapsed in the reeds
Ship without a rudder's like a ship without a rudder's like a ship without a
Don't know what you are
She was twelve years old
Empty inside
So I try to hold onto a time when nothing mattered 
I always get lost when I leave the village
We waited in the blistering cold for you, four hours and you just said, "No"
Let me hear the rain tap on your street
You sure aren't gonna say
They were never meant to hold her so tight
I'm always dreaming and it's never for real
La verdad es que también 
Know that I won't try
And that's a fact so
To almost nothing
I walked through the door with you, the air was cold
Hey, I ought to leave the young thing alone
It's hard to see in a crimson love
As long as he doesn't love her
And I'm starting to scare myself
Kiss me now you'll catch your death
Loving you was really hard
Sometimes a man gets carried away,
I told them to stop
Excuse, oh no, anything goes
Sleep with candles burning
Someone's got a stamp that I can borrow
And it's your turn now to stand where I stand
She didn't even see me
It can be done
If I had more than my ambition, I'll have time for please
She doesn't care about anything
When two suns are shining
And it doesn't matter what I say or do 
Good bye my soul, unquote
I never knew, I never knew
But you listen to them never like "uhuh whatever"
The time for sleep is now
Who they'll kiss before they get home
And I remember the day
In the backstreets or the alleys of this town
Twenty years from my life
And for the moment you can hardly breathe
And if we turn back time
So we're alone again 
Now you say you're leavin' home
And blood rushes to their bed
They hurt so that they ended our relationship
I sing alone, 
I'm so tired of singing all the sad songs in my head
They're all full of shit
Shady made me, but tonight Shady's rockabye baby
Talking shit about a pretty sunset
I know it but can't help feeling differently
Something more like a feeling
When we were alone
I messed up let her let you go
There's a party getting started in the yard
You in the pain
It's more the feeling of it all
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry
Even if I tried alone
Gonna shoot everything everyone
And they echo through my head everyday,
She's homely and she's cranky, and her hair's in a net
With no one here just by your side
Little light, shining
But she makes sure you saw her
Something's just about to break
Me and my broken heart
And if you're ever around
He's wearing your clothes, head down to toes a reaction to you
Spend all your time waiting
Are you looking down upon me, are you proud of who I am
If I was flying on a plane above your town
To act and damn the consequence
It's been a long cold winter without you
Truly hate myself
Pour out of this life 
You touch me, I hear the sound of mandolins
All my windows still are broken
But now I tell myself I've mended under these patches of blue sky
At the comfortable glow from the porch, the one I will still call yours
And the mannequin's eyes
And now just take the box, take the box
For the love of the living and the live cut free
But I never told you
Their only desire is to die
And overanalyze your words 
Tuscarawas flows into
But I got, I got away
The story that 
A newspaper blown through the grass
When I see you walking with her
'Cause you were always there for me
At being somewhere the fates think you're not
Trying to occupy space
Lost in the moment of abandon, you're set free
The colour of blood, I'd say
If you have to let it go
I can't believe my hearts still pounding
La lullaby, la lullaby, help me sleep tonight
Your eyes are green, your hair is gold
I'm gonna follow the road and let the scenery weeping by
And now I try hard to make it
But that wind that blows across your room
Don't hurt me
mainly when it's cold 
I turn on my phone, now that I've grown up
Sitting back, looking at
I'd swear that I could hear him tell me he was sorry
Can't change my mind
Of the shadowlands 
You got in so late it's Sunday morning
Inside of me and such a part of you
I see your face in my mind as I drive away
Drown in someone else's tears
There are no friends to cheer him up and
And the everyday geezers' stares throw me off balance
As she wakes up alone again
You know you'll never be lonely, no you'll always be loved
Ghosts with just voices
And you never say a word
I knew we were laughing at you
We go cruising, entertain ourselves
It's hard to say if only
It's just what you think it is
All I really care is you wake up in my arms
There is three new holes in my wall
Let the window down
It's looking like a limb torn off
But I took the one thing that made me beautiful and I threw it away
Some snow would be nice
And still I wanna put this out
Wanna stay not to go
Be my shrink for the hour
Sometimes the first thing you want never comes
You're gone 
Die Unendlichkeit bestaunt
It's my life
Smiling dark eyes
But when they break they go to pieces
Of breaking up the silence
Through the glass of the roof
The seasons escape you
Don't think about the splash I will create
I never, never, never needed anyone
And this house just ain't no home anytime she goes away
My mama went off and left him
Ha ha ha ha It died out long ago
The ones we trusted the most
Lays her dying hand
Drunk on your juices
But it looked like you ain't laughed in while
I could die from the words that you say
Flashes bringing on
Around here
When they call it a lover's moon, the satellite
It'll grow back like a starfish
I like it in the city when two worlds collide
Keep on looking through the window again
To this heart a little bit longer
Father ruled by long division, young men they pretend
All my days
And never again will my letters start
Oh don't try so hard
Lonely, lonely that is me
Through your window
To rest
I may be blind
No other words would do 
It don't matter at all
Sometimes I'd listen outside her door
No, I'm not sorry if I do insult you
Something to believe in
Like indecision to call you
Out of the dark they carry my heart
Alone at the end of the rave
And I love the pain
Her feeling she hides, her dreams she can't find
I'll be around 
It's hanging around aloofly for a while
Goodbye my friend, will I ever love again
Oh how I wish things would of happened so differently
Just a little bit of your heart is all I want
This is the hardest story that I've ever told
A little bit of shame
And I know my time is surely gonna come
I'm still too tired to care and I got to go
Not a family or honest plea remains to say 
Now that you got everybody you consider sharp
And when it comes to loving me he's worst
But once I hold on
And let me live again
I wish I didn't really kiss
I don't want mudslinging games
To truly hate myself
They laughed throughout their talking
Someone else's atrocious stories
I just watched her make, the same mistakes again
Can I never let anyone in
I'm a sad girl, I'm a sad girl, I'm a sad girl
Because you're dead in my mind
And besides, you're probably holding hands with some skinny, pretty girl that likes to talk about bands,
'Cause it's his turn but his brother won't let him try
If living is without you
You grabbed my hand and we fell into it
Oh, you catch me if I'm falling
'Cause what is simple in the moonlight, by the morning never is
I feel more like a stranger each time I come home
Love me, love me
If someone else comes, I'll just sit here listening to the drums
I pulled the covers over my head and tried to catch some sleep
Now it's over and I'm feeling like
I've been waiting for you to come in
In love with the answer phone
And slide behind the unlit shades
Sit down and talk a while"
He doesn't stir so easily these days
Didn't know what it might be 'til it was open
Why did fate deceive me
My father would lift me high
It's dark in here
I try to quit
I knew it when you said just then
Wind, rain and hail
I will stay forever here with you
You're so endearing, you're so beautiful, 
Can't you give me what I'm needin', needin'
But tell me something, can they see mine
It's forevermore that I wait
I never thought for one second I'd have nothing left but shame
Why won't our love keel over
I wake, just to feel the weight
It's hard I must confess
You leave 'em laughing when you go
Probably maybe, possibly love
Around you
He's got it down now
I want to go home
So we pray for night
Son, you've got a way to kill
It was extremely kind, in a tiny  jar
My fingers in creases
That's the high and that's the heart of it
I've heard that you'll try anything twice
Eve is the apple of my eye 
So now here I sit
I'd like to believe it was all about love for a child
Still I push my barrow all the day
It's nothing to cry about
And if you die, I want to die with you
If you never say what you feel, feel
Training myself not to care
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I was taken for all the things
Follow the cops back home
My fever burns me deeper than I've ever shown to you
I never feel I'm quite enough
All that I had was all I'm gonn' get
Watching at the sky
I made a plan to escape
She could see from my face that I was fucking high
As he appeared, he spoke
He never even felt his shoe fill with blood
But that joke isn't funny anymore
I've looked everywhere, Mr Forbes
Each beat reminds me of you
In a violent place we can call our country
The early morning
I've been searching
I can't lose the sadness
I walked out this morning and I wrote down this song
The girl I thought I knew has gone
And damned them all to hell 
She got a bottle of tequila, a bottle of gin
And you'll be awake, you'll be alert, you'll be positive though it hurts
I used to pretend
Before it brings us down, down, down
Oh, my babe, just say goodbye
Cut you loose from a chain gang and let you go
Just one more and I'll walk away
As the words that we'll hang from
Well it isn't very hard 
Till your eyes shed
Little bit of love, little bit of love, little bit of love, little bit of love
Take a holiday in Spain
But she got me warm
Pray until you're number
You won't know the rain from the tears in my eyes
And if I'm gonna talk
Easy as two times two
I'll find some peace tonight
'Cause I'm so used to living underneath the surface
I need my girl
Tell you I'm sorry
I somehow see what's beautiful
But don't think me callous
And shake my rattled bone
And I'll say anything to make her feel alright
I'm not bitter anyway,
Or hate'll sing the ending that love started to say
Real arms around me
And it was be wonderful,
Poetry is no place for a heart that's a whore
Let the weather have its way with you
I've lost the best friend that I ever had
'Cause the world gets in your way
Time can bring you down, time can bend your knees
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain
Come around I'll let you feel the burn
Don't give a damn for your reasons why
What was your question I've got the answer
In our love
As the bruises turn to yellow
Bitter is the kiss that says goodbye
You make me feel like I am whole again
Your mother shows up in a nasty dress
No your lips they stay perfectly still
Let me be to go home
That all you want is to find home
How can I forget your tender smile
I say that shit just clownin' dogg; c'mon, how fucked up is you
The days were short and the father was gone
Girl you got to let him know
Learn to say good bye
My own words I guess
Are running out of time
And there's nothing there for you to do
Pretend it's all the same
Find me, I'll haunt you when you laugh
To dirt and to dust, it all fades away
Years go by, will I choke on my tears
I went and set the Thames on fire
But I'm always wanting you 
Is this the feeling I need to walk with Tell me why
A mess like this stuck on your hands with crazy glue
Don't me leave me dying, without a lover to hold
To remind me once again
Don't leave my keys in the door
I've broken all my promises to you
But he didn't have the money for a guitar
Why'd you sing with me at all
We tumble out into the streets
It's such a lonely experience
I need a raincoat
And things have seem to changed
I know this room I have walked this floor
Everything, as cold as silence
You're drunk sick from whoring 
I don't know what you are
But I'll remember to love you
That I can't see from beyond that line
Now he's sitting in his hole
Her wild feral stare, her dark hair
Through a hole in the drapes
Should seen the look on my face
The one you painted blue and glued with jewelry tears
Let me feel I'm falling
But even more it's the one we hate
One is the loneliest number that you'll ever do
From moving ground
These are the very words she uses to describe her life
But I can't hide my own despair
Do you want to go with me tonight
You said this hill looks far too steep
The caves of our mouths are forest darkness
And I am calling long distance, don't worry about the cost
She just needs someone to take her home
Why'd you take me out of my fucking house and kill my parents with me
Well I cannot believe
Your lipstick is smeared and sad
But I burned to hot to survive
And maybe all those secret times
And the stars, they seemed, to paint the most elaborate scene to date
I'm having trouble inside my skin
El cielo esta cansado ya de ver 
It's just the way I feel
All god's tears for her, they cry
You're so selfless, cold
I feel like giving up Like giving up
Sky is womb and she's the moon
And you left without a wave
Step into the line 
And I'll throw you in the current that I stand upon so still
All the things I should've given
A million miles away
Still not over you
Boy, your boots can leave a mess
You dropped the paper in my water
In the shadows counting these numbers down
The strange face in my mind is all too clear
But when the sun hits your eyes
Standing trial for your sins
Is no feelings, no feelings now and never again
No alarms and no surprises let me out of here
I got more sick
You're gentle now but I recall
Let's do some living after we die
And now the floodgates cannot hold
Belied your fort of lace
I'd put you in the mirror
I'd believe in anything
Just look up to the stars
Too late, I'm sure and lonely
And I'll feel pretty, another hour or two
Everytime I feel your touch,
I'm living over city
To make sure that she is safe and sound
I stray from love, this is how I feel
The pieces don't fit here anymore
I cannot cry because I know that's weakness in your eyes
See the world spinning round
It hurts and I can't remember
Number nine with my head on the bar
But it's all right
Go to my room and I close my eyes
But I would walk  miles
Where lonely angels sing you to your sleep
Where she may go
I could sleep forever these days
The sun will never disappear
See the muddy hoofprints where he carried you
And I cannot believe
Baby just let it go
Time won't fly
As if I can think of this no more
I could barely see her face
When the first bullet was shot
It's hideous right before your eyes
Yes for now we'll go on living separate lives
I'm not an addict, maybe that's a lie
Don't come across for me
No you can't come in
Just know that I am by your side
In bar rooms
Don't just wander back and forth and leave it
And the cold wind's hitting my face and you're gone
It hurts to remember
But you couldn't care less
As heard on Building Nothing Out Of Something
I see my mother in my face, but only when I travel
I am your whore, without a name
Stand in the mirror, you look the same
And his woman is free
But these handprints on the front steps are mine
Always with that melancholy smile
And be forever with my poison arms around you
Sundown paints the shadows through
We know we have to wait
With a view of the runaway
Would always make you feel better
At times of war
'Cause you said it'd be forever, and that was your vow
On my weak body,
That's not our problem, that's up to Brenda's family
Just to say goodbye 
But to think there's nothing wrong is a problem, oh
Of everything I wanted when you came along
I just feel it, that you're over us
It came to me tonight, so everyone will have a choice
So mother, I thank you
Mama, let my heart go
The first thing that I do before I get into your house
My short term memory is gone, but my long term's far from dead
And tonight a little rain never hurt no one
Well, I only wanna make things right
And I don't understand what keeps me breathing
And thinking on what you did
I've got enough on my mind
All you need is love is a lie cause
Better call the head nurse, wrap us up, to throw us in the dark
Sleep now and Jesus will come, dear
I'm no longer fine, I'm no longer running smooth
She looks like Mary, Queen of Scots
'Cause you're so far gone
Though it never felt right
Now I'm trying to be assertive
To stand out from the crowd
They come and go
You took my heart away
Oh, to realize something is ending within us
Talk about tomorrow, girl
I did what I had to do
I spent so many years learning how to survive
Oh don't misunderstand
And it seems, it seems
I don't want to risk our paths crossin' someday
I work to eat and drink and sleep just to live
So many hearts in great demand;
So leave me at the roadside
And my life is starting over again
Through your eyes I can see the dismay
And I'm singing
You may be flat but you're breathing 
Once again to find a home
Guess I'd better wash my mouth out with soap
It's hard to notice what is passing by
And I just cried, being weak
Hiphop, gotta love it, fuck it
While the hours pass so slow
My heart became a drunken runt
This is the way you left me Oh, I feel as if I'm wastin'
Und es kommt immer noch Post, ganz fett adressiert an dich
Portraits hung in empty halls
And in a little while, we'll only have to wave
The sun don't shine but it never did
That aren't soaked and stained red 
I should have known, my family they never did pretend
I never cared before, before, before, before
And the days go by so fast
And sell some gifts that I got
You are someone else
To the pulse of the feedback current
Candied on the inside
Believing in everything
It's that sorta thing that makes you lose your objectivity
I drink too much, and I smoke too much dutch
Everything I've learned
Everywhere you go red roses
And slit the necks of soldiers while they sleep
Even new wine, served in old skins
The ghost of my joy 
It's cold as you fade into the sun
I want back the
Lookin' to the left slightly, then lookin' back down
We got airplane rides
Viva forever, I'll be waiting
My favorite dog is buried in the yard
If you could find a dry way, I'd forever be still
We were lovers and now we're not even friends
Tryin' to figure out this life
It's not just good, it's great depression
Don't build your world around volcanoes melt you down
Your day breaks
Oh rejoice, the world we know is turning
It's getting lonely down here 
Like my love
There's some things you can't hide
And your mother didn't mind,
I can see the wind coming down
And somehow I knew you could never, never stay
Your plan is flawed from the start
Which one of us would be the foolish one
When I was yours and you were blind
We go blind when we've needed to see
The rivers from your eyes
Watch my mascara dripping down
It's not a bad thing
Breathless moments
Someday my pain will mark you
That lies will lock you up with truth the only key
Now's your chance
I don't understand, you've already gone
�Cause I never seem to stay asleep enough
Your car crash in slow motion
And if I told you that I loved you 
Someday if ever you love me you'd say its okay
For they'll come back to you some day
I know we haven't spoken for a while
I know you're trying your hardest
Got a schedule to stick to, got a world to keep sweet
And so did I,
You make a sound that feels like pain
I can't breathe but I feel
I thought you would be there when I go
Try not to care
I see it all now, it was wrong
Oh, everybody sees right through
Oh, so weak in this need for you
You think your days are ordinary
And you told me not to follow you
One more year, down here
Sell the rights to your blight and you'll eat
Why can't you look at me like that
Then you'd be right too
Alright
She doesn't have to say a thing
Risked her love
In my sleep
How can you mend this broken man, yeah
No more can I say
You told me not to cry when you were gone
Yeah, some people wanna steal her heart
'Cause these boys didn't have no fathers neither
I don't think you know what I feel
Frozen memory
Sleep alone tonight
But when I'm around you still I lose control
When Monday comes, I want nothing
Everywhere I look you're all I see
Were spent by the telephone
Whenever I run
You got a fast car
It's better to push something when it's slipping
And I'm glad you got away but I'm still stuck out here
Come on I need it, oh
I wake up to the sound of music, mother Mary comes to me,
How you're plannin' to go about makin' your amends
That I was Thursday's Child
I'd die right next to you in the end
Yeah, I know sometimes things may not always make sense to you right now
Pleading one word
There is a blacksmith and there is a shepherd and there is a butcherboy
And sometimes I find I catch myself letting you back in,
And I feel sad I can't hear you reciting it through,
In the shallow gutter that lines the boulevards
Und es verdichtet sich die Stille über uns
And did you think you could just take it all away
Rather waste some time with you time with you
Some have gone, and some remain
Can you stop the fire
Let me know, let it show
It still feels like yesterday
All head south
That's when you've got to play it dumb
But he always got caught
Well I'll write you a letter
I am covered in skin
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
On the edge of a dream that you have
Is this my life I'm wondering
And you can't change me
Will someone put me on a train
I believe in days ahead
So now we're living living separate lives
I'm a sad girl, I'm a bad girl, I'm a bad girl
Who am I to need you when I'm down
This time next year, we'll be no more, yeah
Quiet as gondoliers
Ya me he olvidado de ti
It might not appeal to fools like you
We were sleeping in,
She calls around finds me crying,
And it's all predetermined can't change your destiny
So here we are, the witching hour 
I hope I find a place where I feel I belong
This is the end
Hold me up hold my hand
What the scene has got too sentimental
We can break the pattern,
I don't feel sorry when you cry
Everything's stinking
Operator, number, please, it's been so many years
They've got so much to do
'Cause your presence still lingers here
And make him eat every karat, don't fuck with dad ha ha
A lie to run
I'm hurting myself
And now you can't find, what you've left behind
Just thinking
Went away 'cause I didn't wanna face the truth
And I realise that there's something wrong
You're gonna walk on home
And you could tell that I was nervous so you held my hand
I'll Reach up and hold their tails 
I feel numb wanna hold you
That I never really meant to stay
I'd give up all the world to see,
Lost my job and lost my room
It's too late to apologize, yeah,
For the killer kiss, kiss
Tomorrow reminds me just where
Take Jimmy Johnson, take Tommy Thompson, take my best friend Bo
Ooh, ooh, baby
So I'll know it's you and that it's over, so I won't even try
It's a beautiful world
I can tell that you're lonely but it seems now
Just like thinking of your childhood home,
Trees keep fallin' at my feet
Senior year here in Mahwah
From words but not from beauty
Because in my dream, the girl was very young
This world is crying for so much more
Walking down this dirt road
The fairground's lit
She's laughing, she's turning
Or do you sit within your picture
Fill my mouth up full of sand
Turns around so she's now got her back to my face
Still I go to the deepest grave, 
And my mouth is filled with blood
Don't let them see what goes down in the kitchen
Talkin' to the one he loves and always will
A star sign out of whack
Who do you think you are
I'm gone, gone
Now I notice the streetlamp's hum 
All my resistance will never be distance enough
You know it'll shine until we fly
With all the luck you've had, why are your songs so sad
The way they comb their hair
And no there's no one to rely on
Oh my darling, oh my darling Clementine
This storm that's broken me
I shouldn't have laughed, 'cause I mean you no harm
Oh mother, don't look back oh mother don't look back again
Just around the corner from you
Through the summer and the fall
This highway's dark and empty
You poisoned all your children
Only reason I come around is for the
I'm not sure I still believe
You'll be someone they will look up to
for me nothing's easy 
Could you please, just once, just hear me
I want a to laugh again without her fail or the bell
I got years to wait around for you
And choice took far too long
Shut the window love, keep the world outside
I need your arms to hold me now
Dangling entrails from the gut of the sea
Now I'm broken
I, don't know how I feel when I'm around you
There'll be a place for you
He sailed the sea for a hundred years
At some point, every rose has to die
Eyes wet toward
I love you even more
But I'm your girlfriend, now I'm your girlfriend
Oh no, we came to love you
Close your eyes and look at me
Unknown the unlit world of old
When you've seen it a million times
Can I come see you tonight
Don't give a damn if you still can't see
Watching the lights go down
We watched him drink his pain away a little at a time
Everybody else's dreams are Freudian clues
With neither heart or spine
I'm sitting at this table called love
Still I don't understand
Left the only worries I had in my hands
And deep down inside, you know it's killing me
And when he's not home
I'll be a friend and a fuckup
I walked into your dream
Sacrifice the torture's orchestral tear cashflow
Underneath a winters' moon, The last we saw on, how we came too soon
Tell me when you hear me falling
If you walk away, I'll walk away"
I think that you lie
Just carry this gun, you'll even get paid"
I seen you sitting out on your steps
Can't stop loving, can't stop what is on its way
The earth laughs beneath my heavy feet
You've been lying in bed for a week now
In the car behind the carnival
Just give me 'til then to give up this fight
Just one more go
Jim told me that
She was with another man
While the memory of it fades 
There's no need to argue anymore
Stepping in my heart
At the ankles of our fear
I watch it lift up to the sky
And we'll get lost together
You'll remember me when the west wind moves
I'll make everything all right
No idea how it feels to be on your own
Our love is like our music 
Pretty Mary K took him back to town
Why she was late may trouble you some
All that is missing is you
Come to think of it, his name was it was you
Are you missing the love of your kin
Jumping headfirst
So give us a chance
As when we used to fall
I am your failed husband contender,
Why broken cisterns never could stay filled
At least I thought so
What good is a life 
And you move like water
Before life began to tear us apart
Went over the sea,
You dreamt of sex with tigers
I just wanna go back to being the same
Oh, we're still fighting it, we're still fighting it
Autumn, I will bring you back to life,
And she's waiting for the sailors in the jolly boat
Oh mother, we're stronger
With every bubble she sank with a drink
Waiting for you to come along
Millions of rolling eyes that still cling to me
Even when I cross the line
The colour of the earth that day
And taking in the homeless sometimes
Though I know you call me selfish for assuming
So you trying to do what they did
They're only words, they don't hurt
Send it farther on
A guide dog had to serve the role that you would not let
So damn proud of me
That no one knows the ways of
If you want to be like the folks on the hill
I hope you'll be pleased to see me
Possessed by a fury that burns from inside
As I try to find the will to forget her somehow
Well, you could try sleeping in my bed
Cause there's nothing to blame at the drop of your name
On rd, he never found the magic words to change this fact
Gasping for an extra breath
And if it makes you sad, remember all the things you have
And so I ask you, please
But your heart, is just sand
And I'm staring at the moon
Time will never change it, no, no, no
How different I've become
It comes with no reply
I'll make it without you tonight
I took the supermarket flowers from the window sill
Shoes keep sticking to the ground
Learning to care for the ones you hold dear but it's too it's too bad
My life had barely started since you jumped all on my heart
Morning will come, and I'll do what's right
What it seemed so hold these
If our hearts are never broken and there's no joy in the mending
The lot of the marina's teeming minions
Dam right I fucking changed
I was bitten on the entrance
Get too frightening
So heavy on my heart, heart
'Cause nobody loves you
I've been hallucinating you, babe
I've looked at love that way
You know I'd die just to hold you
She has started 
I know I never noticed then
I'll never feel that way again, no, no, no, no, no, no
Who would ever notice you
I love the shape your faces make
And doesn't feel she has to hurry
And then they handed her a folded up flag
Does she hold you like I do
I am weak
So good to me, so right
You're just skin and bones, there's nothing left to take
Say you follow your heart
Why are you so mad Try to understand, that I do want you as a fan
Your little lies of desire
And I know that it's not a party
From this dark trailer park life now,
Yeah, so much for the afterglow
Under ground, over mountains, through forests and deserts and cities
The horses are coming
That kind of gold washes off
Always seem to get the wrong date
He hopes that we can still be friends
So I took your hand
An angel kissing on a sinner
Twisting heartache into fine
To run and hide
But I guess that I can live without you
I gave you everything, why do you hate me so
And I've fallen by the wayside now
Jump off the end
Steam from a cup and snow on the path
You say you need no one,
Been living in an idea
My love is unusual
A sick stolen gift
Where'd it go to tonight the sun shall see its light
As with all else any piece
All I know is I'm sick of everything that my money can buy
I'm gonna stay right here
The angry are animals
Hello helicopter, will you be my friend
But that's all I need
No I would not change a thing
 minutes, a blink of an eye
Ooh ooh oohoohoohooh
Little wet tears on your baby's shoulder
I can't help but start
Scarred, your back was turned, curled like an embryo
To always get hit
We still dance on whirling stages
There's a meaning
And the fear made you so unsure of me
So, close your eyes
No one to roll over this night honey
Have no fear
When I found out you had cancer of the bone
Can you feel me
But I didn't want it to turn out this way
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
Because the moments I can feel you near
That's the whole and that's the part of it
A kiss goodnight
But you didn't want to play
I will never let you fall
No sense of time
I'm needy
All those sorrys, there's a million reasons why
But I still think it better if
All they said of a world without you
Everybody is the same in this long nowin game
She always loved the sound of your strum
And silver fills my eyes
Darkness falling, leaves nowhere to move
I need some company
I've been searching deep down in my soul
But I�m still hopinthere�s another way
Find him in the bat's mouth
We lived in Coney Island
Made of gold and silk, Arabian thread
All that's left is powder
I spoke to you in cautious tones
These are the tears
The smell of hospitals in winter
The stars at night turned deep to dust
Ooh, that's right
But I'd sacrifice my body
Gather round the home she rests
We gotta get out of here
We faded faster than the speed of light
Drop me a line and tell me how the hell you are
And I knew that the lights of the city were too heavy for me Too heavy for me 
You haven't spoken or looked at her in all that time
Everybody knows where that is
Under the earth 
And you think you know
In between molecules of oxygen and carbon dioxide
I'm not satisfied with where I'm at in life
It's across the sky
Still my heart beats, for you
And kills me for the rest of my life
Brings a change for you and me
Good things coming
Still ain't got a job
As if a good thing ever could make up for all the pain
And Mary, after all the pain is gone
It's just a sound going through your head
'Cause it's worked each time before
And Konstantine is walking down the stairs 
We were born, we were born We were born to die
I used to fill the sky around
I will never let you fall
Where pleasure moments hung before
Do we throw them back
It was night when you died, my firefly
Memories made in the coldest winter, winter
I wait, await the next breath
But when I pass your house, I won't stop no matter how bad I want to
But maybe for too long
When it came to mind that I didn't care
Mother, mother, mother
And so much has gone misunderstood
When I came into my land
I tell you now, they don't mean a thing
You're the voice that I like
And you'd be inclined to be mine for the taking
Let us hold to each other
We always knew that it'd come to this
Wait on the porch till you come back home
It's making me die
And watching you walk away
Do you feed and clothe yourself
He's pointing at my throat
Is anybody waiting at home,
And I will stumble and fall
Well, I hear my father fall
When you did the things you said were up to me
The dreams in which I'm dying are the best I've ever had
Well, I see you there with the rose in your teeth
I sucked the moon
We might as well be strangers in another town
Excuse me but can I be you for a while
And everything that you do makes me want to die
Let's join the little babes
Girls, forgive me one more time
I want to go and cry
For her mom
I'm gonna tear off all the petals from the rose that's in your mouth
So I can't tonight, baby
Are somehow out of our control
Three thousand five hundred miles away,
Calling and calling, so cold and alone
I live along a straight line
Isn't it a pity, oh, isn't it a shame
Now I see you in a better place
But I'm always crashing in the same car
Even if it's alone"
Don't lose your selfish ways for me
Hey girl, open your walls, play with your dolls
When I say,
Let's take the country road
No flags will fly, the sun will rise
The moment you were gone
The miles
But there's no one home
You make yourself a photograph and laugh at me
Don't get me wrong I still desperately love you 
There�s a search party but it�s getting dark
I'm all alone again
In that event, she knew just what she would say
I know because tonight is just like any other night
Make no mistake about it
Is having We didn't know it was wrong
I am the snow, I am the snow, I am the snow
I have no one
I'll see you on the other side
But for now it's just another lonely day
I spoke the words but never after the storm
And this is where I live but I've never felt less at home
When she makes me sad
Singing I never meant to cause you trouble
The winter as your scene
That are looking for purpose, they're still looking for life
You used to say I won't know a wind until it crossed me
I don't think I'll risk another these days
I walked the avenue 'til my legs felt like stone
Would you notice, if I left you
This love she feels
But the lows are so extreme that the good seems fucking cheap
Then later a movie, too
And then there's one just for you
And I watched you falling to your death
For that delicate look upon your face
Got no place to call your home
Let them over to your house
What if all the world you used to know
No I never was
It's hard to ever really know
And I'll borrow words from all my favorite paragraphs
Oh is this the dream I've been saving
And rid of all the shit we hated
No there's no making sense of it
Why're you scared I'm not scared
I ain't that mad though, I just don't like bein' lied to
One day you'll see the clear blue
And she said that I was the brightest
Maybe I'll sleep inside my coat and
To chase one and I think I've found mine
Try to find a light on somewhere
Into a thousand pieces around you
And as I stared I counted
Or sell love to another man
Only in dreams, only in dreams
The hardest game to play
All I wanted to say
Never let your thoughts run free
And then you got away, didn't you babe
If we only have one turn
You know war it has no heart
On the past
Well it's your hometown
I've spent ten years trying to sing these doubts away
Please let me know that my one bad day will end
I may not say the words as much
Hang on travelling woman
And across my heart
Don't trade it for gold
He never stopped to think that he was getting older
I know you cry
And just to keep me up, God I'm so tired of sleeping
Fully loaded, deaf and dumb and done
I've always known my heart's been held by you
Please his newfound lady
Would you find it in your heart
Missing what's gone
I just told the biggest lie
She find pictures in my email
Our voices in the breezes
Never a clean break, no one here to save me
Like the hammock by the doorway we spent time in,
In the early morning rain
Years go by, if I'm stripped of my beauty
nothing bleeds the same
And we have survived try, try
That I wouldn't cry
You see twenty years ago
He brings her to her feet and smacks her down till she falls to the ground
I have to climb your wall
Up to your door
Lonely, own me nobody ever shut it down like you
I said they're watching my every sound
Chasing tails
Don't wanna be stone cold
Read the paper
It's all downhill from here
I'm full in my heart and my head
Round here, we always stand up straight
I could document this as our first, as our last row
Hadn't been there long and didn't know what to say
You don�t need me
Stuck on the end
Sons are like birds, flying upward over the mountain
I picture you fast asleep
I've still got me to be your sandy shore
As if I could live off words and dreams and a million screams
I'll give you nothing else to do
Try to hold on
Well, she was my catatonic sextoylovedrugdiver
In hopes you're on the other side talking to me too
The downturn, brave little burn cub
Rip back the time that we've been wasting
And my love is wasted, sorry for this I never meant to be
I've been going alone to the cinema
Now he's on his cell phone in a Coupe Deville
It's so cold in Alaska Stephanie says
It was grass stain jeans and incompletes
Keeping everyone in
I used to bring you sunshine
Stop asking me to stay
Content to see my garden grow so sweet and full of someone else's flowers
And sing you a song
To come on all courageous
And after seven years in advertising you are none the wiser 
Or you'll be there when the next one's made
I'll phone you first I guess, I hope I see you soon
And the fight for you is all I've ever known ever known
Satisfaction guaranteed
Bye bye bye to all of the noise
Do you know how I feel
It wouldn't have worked out anyway
He's not half right
History buried in shame
But you're giving me a million reasons
My life had barely started since you jumped all my heart
I don't know go play Hailie, baby, your daddy's busy
She was all right, 'cause the sea was so tight
We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me
Then where's the blood
A song for your heart
Memories rushed through my brain
Richard Cory at the opera, Richard Cory at a show
It's coming up roses
I'm calling softly from the street
Black sky and black sea
Holy star
Like the stars hold the moon
Need to wave 'em over here Swear Simone's kissing Dan
Ocala is calling
I'm thinking of you
I hate my face
I'm changing like the seasons
Those nights would never end
And I need you in my life
You hated that, didn't you, didn't you
And it's so hard to do, and so easy to say
Or if the sky opened up and started pouring rain
There's a place where we belong
Oh tell me, did you really think
It's the loneliest number since the number one
The tears we shed
Under shade
I'm a junkyard full of false starts
Off the coast and I'm headed nowhere
We keep trying just so we can say we gave it all
Someone I could become
Not a fool
All the blossoms come sailing down
And besides, this shit is making me tired
And the story's all over you
I am walking the cow
I guess the honeymoon is over
Still it's you, you, it's you I can't deny
His name was Charles
There ain't nothing right, nothing wrong
Even heroes have the right to dream
Is that all you need
Your fingernails go dragging down the wall
It's all the good that won't come out of them
Who didn't really care to see, or give a damn if she
Well I don't look like they do, and I don't love like they do 
Hold your breath
Yeah, yeah
She doesn't want to feel this way
And the fight for you is all I've ever known
Lonely is the room the bed is made
Make a halo with your hands
That I would be good, even if I got the thumbs down
With brains that could explain
Do you still remember how we used to be
I see the sun reappear
I'm just scared to lose you
It was only one hour ago
Guess I'm not the fighting kind
That no one in the world could dare destroy
And so I'm reaching out for the one
Half underwater
I was counting on forever, now I'll never know,
Got in you and ripped out the seams
So take my hand
And promises and leftbehinds 
You talk in paragraphs
With my laugh, my lone companion
If we're alright,
Always warm on my back
You don't know anything
Well I had better end it quick or I could lose all my nerve
Fucking make up your mind, stop dragging it on
But the more I pull on your hand and say
I don't even know my strange old face
There's always something in the way
Ah she kissed me and got out of our bed
He wasn't welcome
I'll be in despair
But we could never see tomorrow
Run for your children, for your sisters and brothers
Your speckled face
Like a bird on the wire
My head is full of flames
I've lost you now, you let me go
I, I've been thinking about you, baby
They carved it up into the world we know
I'll take the long way 'round this time
You say that you're stuck in a pale blue dream
The spinning never stops
And you left with your head filled with flames and you watched as your brains
She's got magazines filled with hair pies 'Scuse me, I apologize
And though my edges maybe rough
My visions and my dreams, I cross all my fingers
Replaced by every day
These toilets are a piss take, queue's bigger than the door
Before a while it all made sense
To tell by his voice that he fell
Here her head, she lay
Maybe I should buy a new car,
Love is love's mystique
I think you're crazy, maybe
I will not break the way you did, you fell so hard
I'm empty with the need to
Pulling my world down
The lightning bolt made enough heat
I'll wait my turn
What has happened to love
The hearts that I touched will be the proof that I leave
Who couldn't get things right
I can not wait, I can not wait, if we can be, we can be us again
And put tears on my face
I needed fulfillment
Heaven, heaven's bodies
I'll be staying down
I tried my hand
All the white horses are still in bed"
Don't look in the mirror
It put its face up to my face so I could see
Oh I do believe
But I am dead and gone and lying in a church ground
Don't be afraid to cry at what you see
Left letters for you all
When you get home
I was alright for a while
And we cheat and we lie
Sometimes it just feels better to give in
And I don't really care, no, no, no
And you're lying in the rain
She was eleven years old
For your anger to end
Will you do all these things
Mercy mercy, Mr Percy, there ain't nothing back in Jersey
And when I pass the bottle back to Pete
I'm gonna give you only one reply
He was not that much older than I was
The killer in me is the killer in you, my love
I turned it over in my mind
Blue eyes and jazz and attitude
And the pain will make you crazy
And I would have liked to know you, but I was just a kid
I never got your name, I assume you're thirtythree
I get the final say
If all is broken and all is lost
Ooh, give me a fistful of love
But what happens when karma turns right around and bites you
She just smiles, she don't want the world
And though it makes no sense, I know there are no accidents
And a bolt of electricity
Makes it so hard not to cry
Where that bracelet used to be
I believe that my life's gonna see
The walking through walls
Sleep now and your angels will come, dear
She says
So take your suitcase, 'cause I don't mind
Somehow it feels so familiar
All the times, that I've cried
And alarm bells ring when you say your heart still sings
To take you home
There's a storm only in loving me 
Where will I meet my fate
Back and forth, it's like the weather
Water, water on the seeds
When I found out this love's undone
But I've got no plans at all to leave
Well on the way, head in a cloud
This hurt that I've been through
A song that became the world we know
Mother, the car is here
Stuck on the rocks inside Opus  stoned
Because I'm the girl who eats the scrub
Midsweet talk newspaper word cutouts
Upon the instruments of death, the sunlight brightly gleams
Why you gotta be mean now
In the city where we still reside 
Did he fill the empty spaces
Than the strength she had to get up off her knees
Armed to the teeth
You had your arm around what'shername
And all the way home held your camera like a Bible
And it's hard at the end of the day
And all I ever did was look up to you
Everybody but Heaven knows how I was wrong
I keep my head from getting lazy
To the vines and no one saw it
Now that I finally found the one thing I denied
Though it all looks different now
You come circling through the light
I sink deep,  thousand feet 
A crown of gold
You took my heart away and my being
But everything else is the same
I look deep in your eyes, hesitate a while
For all the hurt that you feel,
She's not a drama queen
I'll make the most of all the sadness
Just pull the plug, yeah, I've had enough
The bed's getting cold and you're not here
You never seem to be home
Something is muffled, another chuckle
But the feeling's overwhelming, it's much too strong
I got my rings around me
Everything is new
Your voice is all I hear somehow
In rooms unfamiliar but until now
No one standing at your door
But for them nothing changed
Why did I turn away, away
You're sleeping again, alone 
Someone I don't recognize
When it's all the stupid things
You kill me, you always know the perfect thing to say hey hey, hey hey
In your arms Don't haunt me
Let me sleep
I hope you find what you're looking for 
Your father's body was judgment day
My heart can't carry much more
The door is closed again
A lie I didn't have to tell
How much lessons did they teach
We're waiting by the willow
No paranoia, careful to all animals
To make me feel this way
Getting strong today, a giant step each day
Man, you wanna see this kid, he was so fucking unreal
Half hoping for a showdown
And so where does my heart
You'll start to think
There's a life to be found in this world
But you don't really care for music, do you
If that's all you will be, you'll be a waste of time
'Cause I'll return as soon as possible
Show me love I've never known
Just looking in the mirror
Ain't nothing stopping me now
And there this was
We should mind, the war child
Outside it's summer, indoors it's cool
The lights went out
Gonna be good for everyone
With your empty pillow
Everything has changed
Oh, mine has learned to kill
Dark clouds cover her paradise
A lonely road, crossed another cold state line 
With your friends alive and talkin', that was you
That's the wrong thing to do
Now you got me right where you want me
Tired of sittin' and hatin' and makin' these excuses
So these lighter days can soon begin;
I make my bed, I change the sheets
And I know a father who had a son
I'll be alone, but maybe more carefree,
I don't know what to do with your clothes or your letters
When she was just ten years old
Now that you're gone, my heart is missing something, so it's time I push my pride away
I will bring a mirror, so silver, so exact
And you always will
The memories of your devotion
Well yeah I saw inside the mirror and your smoking gun,
I'll be back tomorrow, that is if you're here
They quiver and they shift to the floor
Won't you help a brother out, out, out, out, out
What have I become, my sweetest friend
I thought that I heard someone say now
Careful, gentle, trying to keep the water warm
Gonna rise to the occasion yeah
On my mind
Rather waste my time with you 
You make me feel like I am fun again
I wish I was the last thing on your mind before you went to sleep
Why didn't she tell me where to go tonight
To pull you from the liquid sky
'Cause beyond every bend is a long blinding end
On the streets of Philadelphia
I'm asking for
Look sadder and sadder still
Pull the ripchord, the ship has lost it's sail
As crazy as I was I, guess I wasn't much of one
Throw an old line out to sea
I never thought I'd die alone
"Stop crying and bring me my son"
Somebody good 
Take the pain away
But never is a promise and you can't afford to lie
This is the part of me that loves my parents
Don't know how else to say it
And there he prayed
Is the fire of hesitation
Better call the fisherman, 'cause they're coming on land
And I used to talk
And I don't need you
Hard to find a new soul, as silence takes it's toll
In your eyes anymore, only sadness
I'll never live the life that wakes me in the night 
While the children of makeshift hills
And what's small turned to a friendship
If I was standing on the balcony
Like the taste of your smile
I hope my arms
Wish I'd been a prom queen, fighting for the title
Must've felt just like old times
I've looked in the greenhouses, one, two and three
Can you imagine us years from today
First the glass, then the leaves that pass, then comes the snow
So, who am I to say this situation isn't great 
We gotta leave, leave, leave the city
And you can tell the sun in his jealous sky
You say it's a good thing
And in the twilight of this hour
You gotta make a decision
Looking after number one
You gave me roses, and I left them there to die
And that was called love for the workers in song
Rebel, my new last name
'Cept you my love
I've got a question and you've got the answer
A man inside a room is
I can feel it in my bones
Was tainted by the rest
Where in the world
Then the sky turned black,
Searching for light in the darkness of insanity
Sends your words past your lips
And here I lie
All the world is waiting for the sun
It's my birthday and I cannot find no cause for celebration
And whatever may go
Will you miss me when I'm gone
You've been racing through my mind
I lay down on my bed and fell into a deep sleep
When I was a kid, I thought
To stand in your shadow is to be home
Ash, and urn, and silence
I'm lost without you
So dear friends, your love is gone
Besides, we can't believe without bleeding
And then the bridge disappears
I'm not crazy or anything
But I'm sure gonna give you a try
Be true, 'cause they'll lock you up in a sad, sad zoo
You can have my seat, I'm sticking round here for a while
I didn't understand
Let go of my hand
Making love was just for fun
In this life we have to learn
And from this moment on
Never got the chance to go that far
But when he wakes he goes the distance
Listen to the breeze, whisper to me please
Or showing up for work early
 You're not going to stop
When we were running in the rains
In a moment of truth
I killed a party again
He's found the answer that was lost
Can I save my life at any price
Can't you see the wall you built for me bis x 
How do they sleep at night
I really don't know life, at all
So the water's thickening 
But I admit that I provided a full moon
But five or six bring you out to the car
Free with a history
And you'll kiss me in your living room 
Tallulah, find the words and talk to me, oh, Tallulah,
I saw six eyes glistening in my womb
Your face is so unclear
By the tree in Ennis where we used to hang around
Your just jealous 'cause we're young and in love
PS I love you, too
Everything that was right
Maybe we'll both sit down and have a few beers
I guess she spent her last quarter randomly
We buried our love 
But honestly it's fine
I wish I'd never seen your face
You're on your own my little nightmare, you cannot stay here
Just one look into your eyes
I guess I always will
This is a place where I don't feel alone
I pick up, put down the phone, like your favorite Heatmiser song goes
I am terrified of all things
Be still oh rusting river
He was always such a nice Boy
And in the river made o' light
I can, I die
I'll dress like you need
Hello from the outside
Where the fuck could they be still not over in the corner,
La lullaby
Whenever paul thinks of snow,
If heaven is on the way
Cette chanson était la tienne
If you have to go, don't say goodbye
None of it was planned
Some people think he likes to go out dancing
They slip between the sentries of the heart
And if all I ever did was let, let you down
You took your coat off, stood in the rain
Is this the return to Oz
Man, it's a miracle that she's not living up in a tree
With every sour second rate kiss
A certain callousness complies
Don't make your home out in the snow
No regrets they don't work
They make me think I shouldn't be here at all 
But in my heart it was so real
And these nights
Let go of what's in front of me here
nothing bleeds like
You look so beautiful tonight
But we run back, scratching at the door
Just relax, alright
And it eases me somehow to know that even this will change
But when that water breaks you know you're gonna cry, cry
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Still loving what's gone
I'm all alone with my deep thoughts
So tonight 
Possibly maybe probably love
Oh, I miss that feeling of feeling X
Woke up and for the first time the animals were gone
I've got my maple syrup, everything but you
I have no fear anymore
I try to read a bit, but the story is too thin
Because I learned, I learned to be alone
I've been getting calls in these hotel rooms
But for now I move my feet on the ground
She wouldn't say
From my fingers to your bitter face
Think we will ever die
'Cause I know you care
It's only your shadow, nobody else
Sad veiled bride, please be happy
It's all new
Cold light above us
I'm flying
What you love
Like a burning
This love is fading way too fast 
Removing all your skin
Feeling hazy in the ballroom of my mind
It don't matter when you turn
I ain't mad, I just think it's fucked up you don't answer fans
But the less time that I spend with you
This is a battle and it's your final last call
Is this the way it's got to be
There is no one as lucky
Brothers and lovers, she and I were
This breath collapsed again
I cannot drive the streets at night
Won't come your way, yeah 
I know you didn't want to leave
It's the wrong kind of place to be cheating on you
From inside his mouth, I lick the blood
She used to pray on her knees
'Cause time will fly, upon my baby's back
Plug up your wormholes and give them, to feeders and spirits be freer
Now I'm trying to wake you up
I can see me darlin' ahead on the motorway
Felt like this for awhile
The language of love
I took down the posters from my wall
I thought that I needed some space
Then you'll die, you'll die
'Cause it was you that wrote it too
Our blood is cold
When they open up she's lookin' down at her feet
I live all those moments again
All alone on your face
While I wait
There's vultures and thieves at your back
Has me looking in your eyes
I wonder whether they got in, turned away no doubt
And stains on the carpet and stains on the memory
Hold on tight with
Oh, I love you
You're calling too late, too late to be gracious
Damn, who knew
Nice dream
Fistful of love, love
Will sorrow be the only lover I can call my own
'Cause I will be coming back
I took a piece of you the day I left the womb 
So ambition cut you down 
To the way it was before
Got my rings around me
And is he bold enough to take you on
Now that we're living living separate lives
Because they said she was not a good mother
Not sure what I mean, don't know what I sing
Do you hear the jet plane yawning miles across the sky
But I got nothing to say
Misty sorrow swoop unbound
Lookin' at your feet Failure's complete
You promised, you promised that you're done
And all these memories come rushing
Washed up thirty miles west
Brings a change for you and me 
Are all down at Bobby's house
Irgendwo sind wir gescheitert
Now I'm drunk as hell on a piano bench
Sat on a floor in a grey, grey mood
Beyond the ridge to the left, you asked me what I want
Under the stars and stripes
I cannot go to the ocean
But I don't mind
I wanna bust down the door
If you walk away, I'll walk away
You're still mine
Oh baby here comes the fear again
You'll never learn a thing
In case you would come walk in
Quiet like the snow
I was looking for another you
She held the world upon a string
So I'm grindin' with my eyes wide
Now all we wanna do is go to red places
Can't feel nothing
Or wheeling through an endless fog
And the first thing that you want
That every plan
I'd never notice 
Blank page was all the rage
Behind thin walls, you hid your feelings
You're not alone in anything
And stop pretending
The one who would never never
Because you're not done, you're far too young
And I thought I wouldn't have to be
That would show you
And then they went on to say that the pearly gates
I can see the signs,
Oh, summer in the city
Comes from nothing at all 
No girls, no sweet romance
I lost my love my life, that night
And never even think of counting sheep
And every birthday card I threw away
Don't it look that way
You're like a picture on the fridge that's never stocked with food
I'll be here where I've always been
I know somehow,
But there is another down in a dungeon who never gave up the fight
Never had a drink that I didn't like
I wanna kick these blues away
Someone found the future as a statue in a fountain
Cause these are, these are
Does it hurt to hear me say
What are we doing in this dive bar 
Paid for by the allies, so invest
I'm gonna die of loneliness, for sure
Where are you my angel now
You'd better bend before I go
My heart My heart, my heart
That it just is, 'cause everybody dies
And there's a river made o' light
Your voice is small and fading
You know I don't care
Just slipped through my fingers as life turned away
If you hadn't discovered which I did inside of me 
Or you'll end up a wreck
Would it help if I turned a sad song on
She packed her bags and turned right away
You crossed this line
Never change
The recklessness in water
Your touch, your skin, where do I begin
Apparently nothing
Black heart, crawling its way
But it's your heart, not mine, that's scarred
The life may leave my lungs
Could you imagine when they turned their backs
How can you just walk away from me
The airwaves stretch and they groan
Push it out to sea
Tell me the truth
The hurt of missing
But she just hangs her head in pain
Nothing unusual, nothing's changed 
I can eat my dinner in a fancy restaurant
She's looking for a new beginning every day
Is this song to you Ooh Ooh Ooh
So much time so far apart
This is a foreground
I'll walk into the sea
Sensitivity builds a prison
The ugliness of being a fool
Power to the people, we don't want it, we want pleasure
You have changed so much that I don't know,
All I want is nothing more
Johnny, you keep on using me
We walk the streets to feel the ground
I'd rather fuel a fantasy than deal with this alone
By the fallen stars 
War child, war child
Make it that you're sorry and the
And we will share a drink 
She painted filigrees, she was the acid queen
There's so much ahead
I've got your picture on the wall
Staring back from the mirror's a face that you don't recognize 
Last time I didn't know
What can I say
His shiny, shiny teeth
I've been running all my life
Sometimes baby, you just need someone else
A lighter heart A lighter load
And you know that there's a place in the sun
Who'll set my heart free
And I bet you didn't know under that live oak
Sidewalks
I was scared to fix what I had broke
When she laughs
Let them be broken, broken
That form a wall to hide
That I can hold onto
You're a friend
A funeral keeps both of us apart
You had the grace to hold yourself
Disbelief that I do suspend and
Anyways, I hope you get this man, hit me back, just to chat
The TV's on but the only thing showing is a picture of you
To see that little light
It was late at night and we'd been driving since noon
He drives a Chevy Malibu
Sometimes I think so hard I can't remember how your face looked,
But you still kept your hand over my mouth
And we do what we need to be free
Long as afternoon shadows
May you rise as you fall
Silent and cliché, all the things we did and didn't say covered up by what we did and didn't do
An act of God and nothing less will be accepted
I'm not in the mood for laughing
That called you what you like and even might
Never seem to get in the place that I belong
y no entiendo de fútbol 
It floats like the sky
And you don't even know where I start
And go home again
I knew this was our time
May it hold you through the winter of a long night
Hold On, what did you say that for
As a new one appears
Can you hear room 'three eighteen' 
It's just, when it's summer in the city, and you're
Yes I cried, yes I cry, I cry, I try again
And I'll hold on to it
Tallulah, it's easier to live alone than fear the time it's over
And you will never be forgotten
In the cold light
Someone somewhere dropped me on my cranium
Nothing's quite how it seems 
No, not "baby" anymore  if I need you
To see everything looks the same
To even say these thoughts aloud
Like a serpent's kiss
Baby how did we end up like this Where are you now
And the pretty woman leaning in her darkened door
She was so pretty
By the beautiful and good in this city
With her darkest secret safely packed away 
And think of things that might have been
Like I'm made of paper
Fill your heart with smoke
Right till the end Ooh
I was left alone
When you first said that anything goes
You cannot come and see me, for I set myself apart
Its just a bad dream
Yeah, it's more one thing now
I'll walk that line
You can sing me anything
Close up these eyes, try not to cry
'Cause my life's become as vapid as
There's no one to know 
Still agreed to disagree
And read my lips
Tick tock, they're waiting for the meteor
The breakers in the bar, the neighbor's greeting
As you tear and tear your hair from roots,
But I'm warning you we're growing up
Let's have a toast for the douchebags, let's have a toast for the assholes
Doesn't she look good 
You can't believe it, you were always singing along
I told the doctor off
Snow can wait, I forgot my mittens
Your hand on his arm, haystack charm around your neck
No one's laughing at God when they see the one they love
Something as good 
It's calm under the waves in the blue of my oblivion
I'm so tired
Won't take nothing but a memory
Throws the planets out of line
Never tell the one you love
Where I used to think
So I'm feeling used
Offer signs that it's over
And you can make it last forever
By the way your hands were shaking 
mis dias sin ti
From this second story window I can hear the children
nadie piensa en ti como lo hago yo 
Jacqueline was being such a big girl
And took the stairs but didn't stop at the street
It's all in your mind
Nose dive in the flood lines
Just in, just in case I like the dancing
Hoes like vultures, wanna fly in your Freddy loafers
That oh, my heads to blame,
All the good that won't come out of me
But it never made sense to them anyway
You'll say, "Oh, sing one you know"
Dear friend goodbye
A battle that lasts a lifetime
Frightened by my feelings
I'm so sad, so sad
And his mother cried in bed
With no one here just by your side
We left for a convention left for a convention
You're the only one I wish I could forget
So the wind that blows across your room
You're gonna make it big someday
And let me know what you find
And prayers that are sad,
Yeah, I know you care
And out and away from everything that makes me what I am
And I know it was me who called it over but
To make a trap for fools
Livin' alone
What if I'd been born  years before you
bits of a child, 
Oh, daddy, please don't cry
Why put a new address on the same old loneliness
I've only been your lover and friend
You gotta call me man, I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose
The day news came my best friend died
I need your love to hold me up
But no matter how hard I try 
Until you turn eternal, we belong
A place where I can go
But we can't read between the line
Laziness cuts me like fine cutlery
And I think you need it too
Still wanna go
And I swear, I waited and waited
How many times can I talk this way
The first true love that folded at the slightest touch
That keep on falling from your mouth
I've got to break what I'm making
Lord, show me the way
I try to call but I don't know what to tell you
Your faith was strong but you needed proof
With the vines climb trees towards the light
And still you call me codependent,
There's things I remember, things I forget,
But I got my hands on you,
Will dance
I have to cover my eyes
I can take the rain on the roof of this empty house
We're a rubbernecker's dream
All right
To the one thing that I need, oh
Just because
I should have held your face,
And when you think you've sinned
A light that might give up the way
For breaking your heart
And I don't think that I'll see her again
The earth is warm next to my ear
So it never has to show
So hold me up, tie me down
I've gotta live with the choices I made,
His body's too young to look like his
In your hospital room 
The days go on forever
In heaven, where we never say goodbye
I can see, nothing
'Cause someone's bound to hear my cry
Pull me over just to say "I'm a fan"
I've got two little arms to hold on tight and I want to stay forever
With a little bit too much to say
I've looked at life that way
You took my thoughts from me, now I want nothing more
Highway warm sing silent poetry
By closing up the garage door and turning on the car
I asked her to stop
I would've done it right, I would've moved us on
No, I don't want to meet your friend
Because everyone has hopes, you're human after all
I've got the feeling, can't satisfy you
You will not see me fall, nor see me struggle to stand
Wild and free, I can feel the sun
Catch his dreams today
Tempting fate
Who's gonna walk you
I have seen pain
I was embarrassed by its honesty
All he needed was a beating heart
I was never enough
I'm gonna call my home
I'm gonna make this work
It's a beautiful thing when it starts to rain
Paper cuts
Well, let me say, you're not too far from maybe
Sometimes I miss her so much, I want to hop on the next jet
And who are the trusted
My intentions, were full of pride
I don't wish you hurt
Everything gets smaller now the further that I go
Something absolutely wrong
Until his dad gets here and stands by my side
When there's nothing much to defend
I can't believe how close I came
And everywhere you turn
You are my only, my only one
Like the kind that converted you to me so long ago
People on the soldier side
The softly spoken words you gave me
Vom goldenen Balkon
But I shit in your bathroom
Thinkin' how things weren't so cool to me
Left and right
Your skull inside a ball 
Save everyone, inside you
She was cold and all alone do be do be do do,
You're there through my wasted life
And kill the phones
Oh I just wanna die without you
Every day for us something new
How can we make things right
Fire's gonna burn
The hole in the hull defied the crews attempts
The lines in the letter said
And your Daddy was an alcoholic
And a blinking midnight clock
No one, what's your history What's your history
To lift the sun into the sky
We could get a house and some boxes on the lawn
This moment is perfect
We need to find
I think you can do much better than me
To wash away our pain
We'll never get so close as when the sunward flight begins
'Cause I'm feeling like
But we sacrifice like lambs
Flames fell into orbit
With your talk of four leaf clovers
I should have quit, but instead, I took care of you
If you're searching out for something 
But the damage is done
Still you wait for Joey to come
Goodbye my love
Days die off and hope cannot last
Sometimes I feel I've had enough 
Here I am left in silence
I don't want be a bad woman
Lost my own return in spite of
You want to know, know that it doesn't hurt me
They took away the bottle and the hat he was under
Alone without you by my side
The trees had burned down to the ground
I've got to let you know
Call out your name
All he needed was a gentle heart
Nothing's more
This time, we'll fade out tonight
You've turned me away
In despair or incoherent, nothing in between
Something he was not looking for
Let's run away, I'll take you there
Hello I'm still here
Life is short but this time it was bigger
But I got 'em back
I'll leave out the teasin'
They laid out on the grass
You couldn't love me more
Just be glad that you did and stay there
Blow the roof off the place
Don't give a damn if you still can't see,
Too many years I've cried over you
Well, I heard there was a secret chord
Little firefly in her jar
In love with her or so it seems, he's dancing with my beauty queen
Try to detect you when I'm sleeping
No one will love you the way I do
The card was never read
You might sleep, you might sleep
Give a little fist, give a little fist, fistful of love
No one's picking up the phone
Your heaven's invention, steeleyed vampires of love
Remind me why we decided this was for the best
I'm sorry about the other night
But through it all I still feel lost without you
When life was new and it was fun
For the love of that girl
Are you happy out there in this great wide world
So this time don't think it's a lie
I know that the spades are the swords of a soldier 
The world doesn't matter
When the night is cold
To think I might not see those eyes
Is it your fear of being buried that makes you so afraid to speak
I need to get paid
Son, you'd better wait to shine
Is ever gonna love you more than I do
It was just like a movie
I got no expectations 
No matter what happens now
Well, I'll confess all of my sins after several large gins
The waking up is the hardest part
You can tell anybody
Without the reign of terror over every momentary change
She is everything to me
My eyes are just a little sweaty today
I feel like no one ever told the truth to me
Stay alone
Of the hole that we call our home
And I'm drinking them down with cheap alcohol
I'd will the meaning of
Somewhere lost in war
Tell me you won't give up 'cause I'll be waiting
Or with silver spoons and coloured light
You foolish child
And nothing was left for you and me
I am a bird girl now 
Yeah, and bring it soon 
This is the best feeling
'Cause I can't let go
Spread the word of consciousness you seek 
But if you want, I'll try to love again
'Cause I knew, I knew, 
And I'm so happy, so happy now you're gone
Go cry about it, why don't you
Just a name
He said he was in love with me
Heaven can wait
I will never sleep again I, I, I'll never even close my eyes
Of someone else
She covers her eyes and hides
When you get lonely if no one's around
Or did someone do someone wrong
As you sit and watch me sleep
But the morning finds our bodies
You were fashionably sensitive but too cool to care
Electric fences and guns
And pause it at our favorite parts
Never stuck around long enough for a one night stand 
Before your war against the suburbs began, before it began
I will not make the same mistakes that you did
This thing is slowly taking me apart
It's Christmas time and the needles on the tree, a skinny Santa is bringing something to me
And seconds, they seem like a lifetime, a dream
Pantyhose running in the cold
Another mirage folds
I'm dreaming 'bout those dreamy eyes
Tuck the whole thing
Leave me alone,
That's the truth
Well, they're lining up to mad dog your tiltawhirl
Then that would be my worst mistake
Leave a note for you, my only one
I'm gonna stay down & Ride For You baby
I tried to murder the lonely,
Is suddenly tasteless
This is a song about the everyday occurrences that make me feel like letting go
Never let the summer catch you down
You made it out alive, oh what a relief
Look down and laugh at me
But me I'm a single cell on a serpent's tongue
Walking with no shoes or socks
And pain is just a simple compromise
Say your goodbyes
I think I want to change my attitude 
So don't come back for me, don't come back at all
Back then every day was different
Poured the old ginger beer down the sink
Your golden lies feed my role 
Where I'm seeing you there with your hands in the air
In living every day
The sea spread out there before me
Stay right where you are
Now all I ever do is bring you down
Our ambition cuts us down 
Pink pill feels good
All you can do now is watch the shells
Mr bones from town said he saw you the other day
Think I got myself in trouble
We're alright
Come on and dance with me
So darling if you love me
And I know all the steps, 
Believe in you, believe in me, we're meant to be together
Just remember what I told ya
And stay awake through summer like we own the heat
I guess I never will
Never thought we'd be here
I'll find somebody
Until a new one comes along
When he was eight years old
And I get more than my share
Why wasn't God watching
But chilly, Mr Dilly, too much rush to talk to Billy
Supper's waiting on the table
It feels like we're oceans apart
Straight into my mind
I call her name
Your supermarket Jesus comes with smiles and lies
I will break in two, for you
Burst out and from its shattered shell
I've given a lot of thought of how to write you back this fall
And even though you're not all alone
Look at ya, look at ya
And you can't breathe without coughing at daytime
So, what if I never hold you, yeah, or kiss your lips again Whoa
I look at her, she stares almost straight back at me
But I swear that I could hear the laughter
Gave me sunshine, made me happy
And it's crowded and cold
It's a match made in heaven
Did you know how you would move me, did you know
Oh god help his fate
No, not of you, of all that's been told
I've got something in my throat
Everything's all right
How to be like somebody else
And I am here right beside you
I'm sorry
'Cause if you do it and you're still unhappy
I can't breathe
What makes the world go round
You just say you're out there waiting
Do you feel like you belong
What makes it so easy for you to be walking by
And I lie, here in bed
Begging you Don't I love you
But the local kids would still go swimming,
To wash over Georgia and kill the hurt
And it's no sacrifice
But we fake, we fuss, and fracture the times
Free in our love
You never find the one you want
Without a sound
A cross country miss
Hey, let me in, let me in
And I'll never get to show you these songs
Tell me that you care
And the tears come streaming down your face
They say I've gone mad
I hate me for breathing without you
How in the future it will affect me when you go
The stain in the carpet, this drink in my hand
With his ultraviolence Lay me down tonight
'Cause I know I've got to say
Wipe all of your tears and look you in the eyes
Hates the sound that goodbyes make
You can mend
And the bed where you lie
So we've got nothing to lose
Find a place nearby for her to stay
Behind this same remembering sky
They were crying when their sons left
I look for a corner or a quieter room
Looking at my father buried in the ground
Deep down I must have always known
Sometimes I find myself sittin' back and reminiscing
Father, you left me, but I never left you
From here to Birmingham, I got a few friends
It might start now, or maybe I'm just dreamin' out loud, but until then
Holdin' on
Her perfume was so
Keep breathing my angel, if you go down I go down with you, keep breathing, just keep breathing
And anyone who wanted to could contact me
The girl in the dress wrote you a song
When it filled with circus dogs, the parking lot
I may have made it rain 
If you really want hell, hell
That I might break out, yeah
With eyes lowered
Many years have passed since those summer days
I'm finally happy now that you're gone
Feel the volume of the sky
Where I stay in all day
I wish I could laugh
And you, you bring me to my knees, again
And it seems like there's no way out of this for me
But she just drops her pearl black eyes
No you will not be alone
And the light of God
It was the sweetness of your skin
You could stay within these walls and bleed
The flames of hell they give me hope, I drown
I just wanna talk
And I don't know where to look
If you're looking for love 
So you slept in a stocking cap and wool scarf
A generation drenched in hate says
I'm far too ashamed to do it with you watching me
Your tshirt lost its smell of you
I only wanted to have fun
And figure out what's stopping us
Where every new blood
Enjoy the ride, the medicine show
I'm back on the motorway
The same dark dread every morning
I'm never gonna let it slip away
Now I know you're sorry and we were sweet 
Work your way 'round that room
And even if we drink
Don't turn around and see if I'm crying
I wanna make a big mistake
I search in snow, in vain
and on any given day I'd rather ride a limousine
Know they're right, and have done it right, could I get to be like that
And leave you like they left me here
Sweet Sundays, sweet Sundays
But one can't carry the weight
I cared for and loved
Maybe we'll hit the bluffs and find ourselves the same old rum
Oh, I wish you knew the deal, gotta learn from far away
Just a thought
You've got to be so strong
All dressed in white, going to the church that night
You're in your oldsmobile driving by the moon
May we meet again in another life
I wrote you a letter, darling, tried to make it clear
I want all that is not mine
Sinking under the river,
But don't walk away, don't walk away
In need of help I came to your door
It's tearing me apart
Would he have loved you, and not let you down
I can't swim in the silence of your skin, skin, please let me in
And I miss the lips that made me fly
Give me back my point of view
He starts with her back cause that's what he sees
One more song about movin' along the highway
He says, bad day, looking for the great escape
I've always been right behind you
She looks down at the ground
How you kissed me at night
When I'm gone, but I'm trying to give you the life that I never had
He thinks he's going crazy
There's a woman crying out tonight
And from each tiny caravel
Nothing's been the same
Falls on the round toes
Losing the star without a sky
The open window lets the rain in
Crushing me inside
I'd stop my dreaming
Be sure to come around
Hate me tomorrow
He is shaking and dancing in her bat mouth
Swear I could hear the sea
His father was a very mean man
Comes from a place that's far away
Nothing compares to you
Until exhausted, close our eyelids
Stoppin' baby's breath and a shoe full of rice, no
To give me some reason to move
You took everything but it left you empty
I would trade, give away all the words that I saved in my heart
Return in the caves
It's a sorry sight
Where's that love you promised me
Maybe I'm just out of my mind
We must get older
We're all doctors trading sadness for numbness
These days I don't have much to say to you
I know how you are
"There's no time for running away now"
I done drawn a line between you and me
The first thing I saw as I walked through the door
And I was promised
Hell when you're around
And I believe in therapy 
Why did you go away baby
And run from them, from them with no direction
And I sing at the top of my lungs 
We've to feel alone 
I said, "Kiss me, you're beautiful, these are truly the last days"
You say you know what he did, but you idiot kid, you don't have a clue
Feeling so small, I stare at the wall
At sunrise the monkeys will fly
But not this time around
I'd rather you never heard my voice
Lady lights a cigarette
I've kissed your lips and held your head
To shatter all your plans
'This feel never goes
Into a thousand dreams
I started looking for excuses
For us to say goodbye, what a big surprise
Is made up on your side
And now I feel too warm again
And you told me you were scared
Combs her hair and sings her psalms
But all I got are these roses to give,
You say you got the most respect for me
I looked deep within myself
I cannot repair
No wasting away
Unsalted peanuts to stretch my miles
And I say there's trouble when everything is fine
But I'm still trying to find it
She lives by disillusion's glow
Looking out my bedroom window
And pretend that he could wish himself health on a four leaf clover
To a place where you belong
I watch your eyes
There ain't much to rake anyway in the fall
Someday they'll open up your world
Now you move with the tide and I've heard you've found peace of mind
I waited a long, long time
I was never more alive or
I'm standin' on the bridge
Let the code of silence repeat  times
'Member when I was so sick and you didn't believe me
Goodbye, my friend 
I show you all the beauty you possess
And I know everybody
I don't care no I wouldn't dare, to fix the twist in you
I thought that you'd be here by now
Do you think I wanted to turn back around and teach a class
The world revolves around us,
Sleepwalking
And making love was just for fun
The PA painfully starts boarding
She'd scolded me for my sinful and wicked ways
Instead of being sixteen and burning up a bible
When You feel like my dreams are so far
Stumble through the crowds together
No one knows where we are
And tutting my heel and strutting my feet
Don't waste your whole life trying
And now we're barely breathing
We are leaving new friends, leaving this town
There's a couple getting steamy in the car parked in the drive
Breeze still carries the sound 
We're ripped apart by the crow and the vultures
I will not let you down
To the sun and the dust
Oh, love takes time
If it's gonna be like this forever
Gonna make you break out of your shell
Everything to me
Well I walk upon the river like it's easier than land
And then one day she's gone What should I have done
Ooh their breath is warm
An exquisite extreme, I know
But at the end of my life
To hair and contentment
Everything is tragic, it all just falls apart
I said some awful things and I take them back
Well, let the poets cry themselves to sleep
You cross that bridge all on your own
And sometimes I despair
Oh my love 
Don't want to stay here
Or dig myself a little hole
Crashing down was my biggest mistake
Waking up from this nightmare
When the world gets in your way
I just can't wait to get back home
And still be addicted to them hoodrats
Lost in a simple game cat and mouse are we the same people as before this came to light
Had to wake up face reality
I fall for her
So I'll drive away with all my things
It's so noisy at the fair
Leaving the note that she hoped would say more
We used to take turns
Really wanna prove to us today
Up against the wall crying black and blue
I never thought that I could be so bold
Waiting for my father both of us were scared
While I recall all the words you spoke to me 
That brings you back home to me
Oh Jesus Christ he wasn't to know
Your eyes perceived by the sound 
Long haul, counting the miles
And the will to show
Evil's in my pocket and your strength is in my hand
That are right now headed silent down the highway
The years go on and
Please don't fade and please don't cry, 'cause it's all white lies
Pinning space to the world
You think
And now I'm riding, all over this island
However far away, I will always love you
Standing here in the dark
Just sit still, does it hurt Does it hurt
We all learn to make mistakes
And it's so hard to say goodbye
But what can I do if I do till its gone
And here comes another panic attack oh
Miles away from those I love, purpose hard to find 
You seemed ashamed, ashamed that I was
Don't cry
Making me feel so cold, yeah
Newspaper blow across the court
With wishes of a sandman and a night light
I listened when they told me
And in the morning you'll awake feeling new
But somehow, I found my baby that night
Good kind
The same old madness everyday
When flowers gaze at you
If you think you might come to California
With my feet on the dash
So I'll Lay here with you till the final goodbye
I need you
You'll never return to this place 
I've forgotten how good it could be
And maybe follow another sign
'Cause you're giving me a million reasons
Or any situation where I'm better off than dead
I thought how could I think of leavin'
Each and anyone
But it's calm under the waves, in the blue of my oblivion
Never got the whole in love thing
Nobody ever learns
Your voice, it sounded kind, I hope that you like me
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head
And I guess that I miss you
But to take on the world at all angles
I laugh 'cause it's so damn funny
Hey, are you lonely
And they say back then our universe
There's no force behind my mouth
But now I'm asleep on top of a mountain, I've been covered in snow
Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I see your shadow so I know
I got my eggs, I got my pancakes too
Apparitions worth their weight in gold
Time heals everything
I feel all alone in a crowded room,
And when I asked for a separate room
I'm alone
At the end of town
In a hectic test a no one protest
It's summertime and though it's hard to see it's true possibilities
Found the lake was wet
I've always been with you
How I wish I could walk through the doors of my mind
Eating at the heart
Oh despair, you were there through my wasted days,
Made my mistakes, let you down
 pounds, wearing black and white stripes
To find a place I've never been
Playing class reunions without end
The roar of the Forth road bridge
Ain't much to rake anyway in the fall
But this time fleshed out full face
From high up on this mountain I can almost see
It was the day that he turned on his kids
Now a hole in the head of this wounded liar
This is a big world, that was a small town
I'm still in love but all I heard was nothing
Oh, God, Johnny, don't point that gun at me
She loved me
Softly in her sleep
If you think that you're strong enough nice dream
And when the church doors opened up wide 
I'm awake in the infinite cold
Never meant to cause you no pain baby, yeah
Nature has its own religion, gospel from the land
You stood alone in the halo's haze
Where my grandmother drank
But when I start to try to tell you
And tear it from our side
Fresh fuel for the sodium flares
Before I dive right into you
Voice dry and hoarse
That and give other people hell
Wondering, when Jesus comes, are they gonna be saved
I still hear them
I am the fire burning desperately but you're controlling me
So I could see you see me sincerely yelling back
To a whole new world that had since been in disguise 
We hurried to our death
To rid the disease
And you'd help me out of the dark
I would have stayed in your bed
He spends the afternoon between your thighs How's that for gratitude I apologize
When the truth is I miss you
Anger steaming up your glasses, you've been holding parties all your life
You die when you're young
I feel nothing 
Looks like an early winter for us
I tried to get my head around that one So right
And I don't think they'll ever go away;
Eyes always stare
But can you take me home
Who's gonna talk to you
They don't hear you singing to me
Never mind the pain or the aggravation
But they did and so did I that day
Then you would recall the deadly houses you grew up in
Pick up her dirty clothes
I believe our love can see us through in death
What a fool I'd be to start complaining now
I will try to find my place
I was dressed for success, but success it never comes
I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
And you're gone too
You have changed so much, that I don't know,
It's so typical of me to talk
Could it be that everything goes 'round by chance chance
Like something that can never be replaced
The fingers unfold 
You make me real Discard my friends to change the scenery
Way back, when we were just kids
And I'm tired of being all alone,
Babe, you're not lost
I'm going to ride this plane out of your life again
We are just kids
I'm not sleeping
But when I call
I know the past will catch you up as you run faster I know the last in line is always called a bastard
For to fill up your soul
When I get home, I turn off the alarm
So just kill me now and let the good times roll
I try to keep myself occupied
I often wonder what it feels like to be you
To this love
That anyone here will be thinking in modern ways
My mother birthed me far too soon
Our love is broken
The buttons on my phone are worn thin
You were supposed to grow old
And I can eat here every night, what the hell have I got to lose
turntable scratch
I'll be waiting outside till you're ready to go
This year's love had better last
Broken hearts want broken necks
There's nothing left to try
I miss everything about you
And if it makes you sad to give up dreams you've always had
On the Northern side is a Fife of mine
The unrequited dream
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Down to the burning cliffs 
I hate it
I'm tired of this smile that even I don't recognize
The life he leads is unsafe
If it was all a mistake
Sweep me off my feet
Our blank stares and empty threats
Around your neck and tug you off your cloud
A savage Beast, I've got nothing to sell
I don't know words but I will hear them
This road won't go on forever
Don't say a word, Please don't leave
I feel sad
Made our choice, a trial by fire
Why does tonight, have to end
But don't forget to entertain 'cause this is your first defense, this is your first defense
Where a man with missing fingers plays a strange guitar
This darkness will turn to light
But somehow never quite this clear
Well it's alright, why don't you tell me my friend
And if you come and meet me tomorrow
Her legs around me, in the morning I cried
I took it for love
And know that I meant something in somebody's life
We never knew what friends we had
'Cause there we are again
Clear as a bell and sound as an old engineer
Lili, take another walk out of your fake world
Bring back those nights when I held you beside me
And all the friends that I was telling
This is just a dream
I wish that I had gone up with you too
I'll grow back like a starfish
And we'll never miss a party This offer
Darkness, darkness everywhere, do you feel alone
How can there be so many personalities
Maybe, some part of you just hates me
I find the map and draw a straight line
Do not hate her
Down, downstairs to the man, he's gonna make it all okay
Here I go, so dishonestly
On our bodies we share the same scar
And all those nights
Mr Postman, do you have a letter for me, a letter for me
And when his life came to an end, he tried to grasp for his last friend
It ain�t the same since I'm living without you
And never look through me
I sleep with eyes wide
Wild is the wind
She takes a plastic pill, she plays the weatherman
I may have lost my way now, haven't forgotten my way home
Where nothing's heard for miles but the sound
Take a look, you might see me coming through
Marries into what she needs
"Kiss me goodbye"
It's just a simple line
There's no need for denial
It's the way your shoulders shake and what they're shaking for
I've done it again, another number for your notes
I think about it on and on and on and on and on again
And the love you leave behind
Cold cold wind blowing
Can't believe it's over
But I know that that wont come true
By the pool last night, apparently
Somedays aren't yours at all
Though I'm not old
The train that goes to the Kingdom
I was gone
'Cause this has got to die
As weeks went by, it showed that she was not fine
I die a little
'Cause the names you drop
Oh love, please send for me,
Never tell the truth
And I go back to December all the time
When striving leads you far from home
You meant everything 
I got nobody on my side
To ugly duckling girls like me
Cold, but I'm still here, blind, 'cause I'm so blind, say never 
If I die this instant
Soul mates never die
I think I made it very clear
The leaving lover that I still favor
Feels like I'm starting it all over again
Of Your galaxy dancing and laughing and laughing again
Oh 'cause nothing is lost, it's just frozen in frost
Well it's hope, the endurance of faith
Lonely people tumble downwards
As someone long prepared for this to happen,
Sell the rights to your blight time machine
Before the right one
you're just jealous 'cause we're young and in love
That losing me could mean something
Give me a little fool love
I thought with a month of apart
No one else will have me like you do
She says I'm too dumb to fuck
It was my turn to decide
And my clothes don't fit me no more
I can't beat myself, I can't beat myself and I don't want to talk
And the winter moves about Illinois
I wanna make it right
Run fast for your mother, run fast for your father
As we lay in this bed thinking out loud
I'll be an outinout, bornagain, from none more cynical
Go to sleep and dream again
And fell asleep in this layby
I'm gonna be the man who's coming home to you
I cried a little bit, you died a little bit
I'm like a son that was raised without a father
That has stained their souls' together now
I married an executive company head
You'd been to the station to meet every train
You've already gone, why am I clinging
Some degrading song of praise 
To watch the things you gave your life to broken
And he's back again
I wake up to find you lying awake with your hands in your head
I don't think that I knew the chaos I was getting in
I don't wanna be here alone, ooh
Shot guns with no guns
Just another step until I reach the door
And the shells jumped through the smoke
We no longer have one
Touch the bottom of her chin and let out a sigh
They make it hard
So leave me alone, you ought to be proud that I'm getting good marks
Sure my belly's tingling a bit, somethings happening I'm sure
�Cause I don't wanna leave this dream
Bring some peace to your mind
'Cause I've been waitin' for ya for so long, for so long
But there's one thing we've got going
You raise your sticks and cry and I fall
In the world
You break your
Something's missing
To repent for someone else
And the lightning sang
There was a moment
Slightly bemused by his lack of direction
Till then walk away, walk away, walk away, walk away
On Tuesday mornings, I want the same
If anything should happen, I guess I wish you well
Hit me like a fever when you left me baby
I can't wait for long my darling
A brown eyed girl in hand me downs
I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone
Stingy thingy into little me, me, me
Mmm, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I could have lost myself
It won't matter, what's the point of this
The building fronts are just fronts
I'm trying to make you proud
From the back of your big brown eyes
So the next time he hurt you again
Your voices aren't clear enough after all
I fell apart, I fell apart 
Dear Lord it took so many of my people,
Don't let me be carried away
I know just what you're saying
But things have gotten so bad between us I don't see us ever being together
And sometimes I get jealous of all her little pets
A while ago somewhere I don't know when
I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night
There's no one here to blame
I will feel so glad to go
I never was free
'Cause you always find a way to keep me right here waiting
From all of the tears you have shed
The deeper the thoughts, there's no more pain
Oh it's been such hell, I wish you well, I hope you're safe tonight
And time is on your side
Some may say a dream
Ladies and gentlemen, we are floating in space
They don't know you and they don't watch you walk away
The way that it was and could have been surrounds me
Hey, but I don't care 'cause sometimes
Dead in the stare of a thousand miles
To love you, again and again
I swallowed the sun in your form
Call, break my own heart
The thought of another man
I felt loneliness and shame
Every step that I take
It's hard to make sense, feels as if I'm sensing you through a lens
They choke me to the bone
Who I was before
It'll have a nervous breakdown and fall
Ransom notes keep falling out your mouth
Why am I the one
Now I don't warm my hands in your coat
Instead of run in place,
Never now we need the other centralize the force of rot
And she walked along the edge of where the ocean meets the land
But you'd always wanna know what I was about
Your face don't look like before
Watching trees decompose
Have you got a key
So hurry up and run to the one that you love
So we've put an end to it this time
'This night never falls again
Early Thursday mornings, wipe away the flies
Here I stand I'm all alone
We wish our lives away
This ain't nothing but an invitation to the blues
Totally fucked, can't hardly fuckin' stand
Put it in the box, put it in the box
That almost made you cry
A pair of dull scissors in the yellow light
You were talking so brave and so sweet
Feels like you're still there
Catch the breeze and the winter chills
Was saving money for you in a jar
The only things that you really tried
Never, nothing
Can you find me space
She, a punk who rarely ever took advice
It's come to this, release me
And I lay my head back down
And then the cold came
Seen into the eyes of the weak
'Cause I just can't think for you
I'm here singing
Yeah, I know I'll see your face again
Her love's a thousand miles away
I do remember the swing in your step
I'm spending my time
It's only your shadow, filling the room
And sometimes I wonder
Now starts the craft of the father
For all those starving eyes to see
PS I'm still not over you
And I hope the sun shines and it's a beautiful day
And I always was
Under the waves in the blue of my oblivion
I've got a flask inside my pocket, we can share it on the train
For the one who had a name
It's just a season thing
I drank a thimble full of fire 
In the shadows buried in me lies a child's toy
This plan of mine is oh so very lame 
An empowered and informed member of society
I'm losing it but you're the same
She prays one day she'll find someone to need her
And I claimed I didn't care for you
Of darkness in the valley
You couldn't ever love me more
But not for such as you and I, my love
Then you move when it's your turn
Visions of love and hate
And all breath expired
Hope you're not lonely without me
And I will say thanks if you're pouring my drinks
To pick the shit up, leave it clean
And I like my candy and your women
When I was young I knew everything
And I'm writing just to let you know I'm still alive
A stoic mind and a bleeding heart
Let me photograph you in this light
You'd maybe think there's something wrong 
And wishing I was was ten again
It's not him who come across the sea to surprise you
And rob their houses
Excuse me, I really didn't mean to ramble on
And after that you didn't bother
I need a phone call
They poked a million holes
The better part of me
My sister called at  AM
But these kids they lost their graces
It don't matter 'cause I have no sex life, and all I wanna do now is inject my exwife
I loved and adored 
It feels like I'm looking at life 
Rock you strong in these arms of mine
Always crashing in the same car
Now she in it, can't change it, she keeps her mind on her wages
I'm just the pieces of the man I used to be
Read me your favorite line
It's better not to holla back
Even though I'm not her minder
You left and it lingers on
And sit here
A happy surface but the underbelly isn't there
It's always had that ghost who always almost
But you couldn't wait
So I don't think it's going to happen anymore
We sing out
And I know, and I know, and I know that you got everything, but I got nothing here without you, baby
A monument to commemorate our time
You got away, I never once heard you say
I can't believe your thinking
Tell me do you really think you go to hell for having loved
To stop the blinding mirrors
I took the advice 
Gets time to become resigned
I remember the time you told me
Now I never leave my zone, we're both alone, I'm going home
And I didn't understand
To let you walk away
Dear Slim, I wrote but you still ain't callin'
To ever fall back in your arms
All I wanted was a kickabout in the park
Or paint my shelves
They disappear as reality is crashing to the floor
I strain my eyes and try
Don't go back on your words
Searching for the things to say to keep me right here waiting
Be careful darling you might fall
I'd fall down on my knees,
Love is kind
Do you look for hope in other people's eyes
I'll leave my window open,
Now what have I become
Harold
Don't cry daddy
Well it's very hard for me to say these things in your presence
Got into a car,
Is this the bed I chose to make
You tell me all the things you do
I'm waitin' in the dark
And their kid's not back from that party yet
To love you in my way
It's about to fall apart
Goddamn, I hope I can pass high school means nothing
These arms will not be taught to need another's,
Time will make sure I'll get over you ooh
I'll do anything for you,
On love, On love
I'm wondering will I ever see another sunrise
I walk back in the night alone, got caught up in my song
You take the fall in sacrifice
On a cold day, nothing's gonna stop us
But everything's the same, this town is pitiful
He'll never return it So when you come back, we'll have to make new love
Brenda got herself a boyfriend
And know that this is right
And when the morning came, I was ashamed
Inside the times we never had it right 
The night plays games
Get a little bit of bourbon in ya
Off forever
I'll take a quiet life
For when he died, he took a part of you
Because I know today has been
She don't recognise your voice no more
My sneakers in his hand
I can feel myself fading away
We shared together, they'll stay with me forever
Lying on the floor
And run far away 
'Cause the look in your eyes is killing me
Through buildings gone missing like teeth
How this felt one year six months ago
Sweet Sunday morning, all by myself
All in all, it's been a pretty good year
The boy done wrong again
Dreams and schemes and circus crowds
That's when a lover breaks
When there's nothing that's worth seeing
I just want them to know that I gave my all, did my best, brought someone some happiness,
'Cause daddy felt like a bum, see daddy had a job
Does he hold you when you cry
That reminds me less of youth
She says that she'd love to come help but
Smoking your cigarettes, and talking over coffee
I don't understand why you have to always be gone
And anchor this lost soul
With my head in my hands
Around the holy kingdom
hunting reasons that make me believe, 
Just jealous 'cause we're young and in love
My revolution thoughts
What my mind has seen
I am the daylight when the moons shines no
Though it seems we had such little time for us
Seeking out the memories I hold dear
Like a first love,
I wanted to talk to you 
And we'd lay there in the darkness
If you'll just consider thiseven if it don't make sense
This disease
Lead me to your door
The past is still the past
Before we'd left the bay
You'll say you understand; you'll never understand
And when she was lonely
'Cause I can't find the words to say what I mean
We're all laughing with God
Is just hold me please, hold me squeeze, hold me, hold me
'Cause I am afraid of the light
Thy nervous blood will become undone
Feels so hard to say
You healed these scars over time
When my love for you is blind
Spoken words like moonlight
He may conceal a king in his hand 
The face that fills the hole
Iis harder than I ever feared
But you've never been a waste of my time
I've grown tired some
Someday we'll go round the world
We need lies
It's damned if you don't and it's damned if you do
Do you fall upon your knees
With nothing underneath
Don't despair, you're there,
As there's mistakes I've made 
These dreams of you keep on growing stronger
They want to feel the bulges in their pants start to rise
I'm told what to do and I don't know why
Look both ways when you leave the building
And as these shadows fall on me now
Pretend
The angel from my nightmare
And Eve said let's give it a try 
And I don't want to be alone, my heart is yellow as an ear of corn
Sidelong and glancing still in tiny dancer land
Meet the real world coming out of your shell
How long I'll wait 
And the only time I've touched you is in my sleep
Yes for tonight I'll lay here with you
Trying to find some explanation here
She fell in love in the first place
You can call me if you find that you have something to say
They take the simple things inside you
And they made you change your name
They're not around you
No one will love you, love you like I do
And we've been dead for a while
Was right there in your smile
Christian brothers gonna take him down
The damage is done The prodigal son is too late
Pale under the blistering sky
And I will give up this fight
My lover's gone, 
He's in pain and misery x
Turns around in front of the mirror
It's last call and you're the last one leaving 
They would not listen, they did not know how
Now our impulses will bite
But it's all just a show
At least now I can say that I am trying
And find some kind of grace
When you tell me everything is wonderful now
Sometimes I hang my head
I lifted her head, she looked at me and said
And I'm so tired of singing all the sad songs in my head
I didn't get it 
Her beauty in the moonlight overthrew you
I'm begging of you, please don't take my man
Joey will come to see your flowers
Take away leaf falls short
And if I died right now you'd never be the same
Swirling clouds in violet haze
So how can you mend a broken heart
And, Martha, all I had was you and all you had was me
Until we put him in the ground
I've made the change,
When you walk around, know you are beautiful
Down, the flames of hell they give me hope, I drown
Sometimes so it reminds me
And everything's so strange
And you got me
I will sacrifice
Make room for the prey
Sweaty hands and my foot in the appropriate place
I tried my hardest just to forget everything
Just bend the pieces till they fit
"Hurry Come inside"
Every glamorous sunrise
I know I'll often stop and think about them
When I'm still so close
I cannot wake up in the morning
Maybe we can get ourselves back on the right track
Since we kissed through the darkness until it was dawn
And I hope we hang on past the last exit
Tell me to stay, oh why
Oh, it has begun
Shedding no little tears
I found a place so safe, not a single tear
I just wanna show you
I'm guessing this is growing up
Erupt again; ignore the pill, and I won't let it show
With what I've done 
Our love was made for movie screens
Should've never said the word "love"
In the dark, in the dark
Secure for future generations
Carve out your heart for keeps in an old oak tree
I've had it all forever
To see the earth through painted eyes
To be honest, I really don't care
If art is still inside I feel it
And there's plenty of things to do on his dime
I want to be your friend
Cops shone their lights on the reflectors of our bikes
You, I thought you knew me
Clocks will carry on
Ice cold winds swept my heart away
There's a heart on the line, and it rests with your eyes
Your people and your land
You're gonna give me all your sweet mother love
Hey can't stop what's coming, can't stop what is on its way
I'm not a film star beauty, I'll send a photograph
On repeat Caravan and we danced around the room
I took a drive in my car
In you when imp so damn scared
And the sun, well, she could not save you
Out in the garden where we planted the seeds
Come and take these tears away
There's a different song 
Our love was like the water 
For lookin' at you straight in the eyes
When she is dancing her little home dance on me
And the sky was a woman's arms
Standing in the dark outside the house
It's the dawn, you'll see
Two words I always think 
If I could start again
I just want it back the way it was before
I opened my eyes
Trying to wake you as daylight it breaks through the eye of the storm
Where the hell's my credit cards
To get my way I would run from her to him
I'm coming home
Signal if you can't say, "no more"
It is by the grace of me
I realize I made a mistake
'Cause the music is boring me to death
When I was three, three maybe four
The hours are pretty bad
Before you advertise, all the fame is implied
You can't stop the fire,
She knew they were destined to become sacred roadkill on the way
Oh, it's no cause for concern
Polished off the whiskey tonight
In the afternoon sky
And you look and you look
Grateful our cold memories bide
I love your kind patience
They'll bring us through it every time,
But where did we go wrong Oh
This is my life support, shutting down, for the final time
You give me flowers of love
Maybe you'll think of me and smile
When I woke up today
How to think
Like the open seas and shores
I'm falling over
Starry, starry night
I was here
And you can see my heart beating
I've been waiting for a break
Take everything away
By the radio
I could still hear inside my head
'Cause inside you're ugly, you're ugly like me
That's what the white coats say
You look so tiredunhappy
But all will pass, and end too fast you know
Mama, don't go, daddy, come home
For the life of me, I cannot believe
Live or die
And you're coming up roses
I've looked at love from both sides now
Reach the light inside
Fake everything
Really wish that we could go back to the way that it was
Change is hard, I should know
Start to weep, then say goodbye
Tear the skin off your nose and you've got nothing to be grateful for 
And no more shall we part
Is there anyone
If our hearts get torn
Is what makes me bleed
When you're alone in your room
There's a muddy field where a garden was
Our paper flew away 
Another day will dawn
I see you with your man, your eyes just shine
Losing her
On a maddening loop, these clothes
Touch me with your naked hand or touch me with your glove
And tell it like you still believe 
Joey will come to while away your hours
Wake up in the rain
'Cause you are the only one
And number all the jets and airports
I love you forever
What you needed was to be rid of me
Be my friend
But you will stay
And I always will
And in a wide sea of eyes
my days without you are so absurd, 
Later that night, when I was asleep
You've got them on your side
Raindrops falling from heaven
Riding on waves, walking on sand
I wonder what you think of me
How I wonder where you are
You once talked to me about love
That's when I think
Sing a sad song in a lonely place
In the powers of the earth, we wait until it rips and rips 
Newborn life replacing all of us, changing this fable we live in
Good for you, you've just become
It doesn't mean I have to come deal with it
I made you mine
Our love would never die
Please don't follow me tonight
Endless thoughts and questions keep me awake
The laughter's all gone but the memories are mine
To carry home my little soldier
I'll try and try, until I die, to make you understand
You can take away everything leave me lying on the floor
Take 'em to the bartering lines
It's been so lonely without you here
You turned white like a saint
I hold no grudges
And I'm thinking I'd
What's in front of me these days
So write some sad song about me 
Hope you're feeling well
And I've been thinking 
Fifteen years gone now, I still wander this parapet
There's no need to argue anymore 
The broken lights on the freeway left me here alone
But if I fall for it again, I would be a fool
Still a little bit of your face I haven't kissed
It's cold as a tomb
When will you laugh again
The day I break your heart
Now his part is over
When Johnny came home with a gift for me
No you're not fooling anyone
I swear our jet is crashing in my mind
You are the morning bird 
I can hardly breathe I need to feel you here with me YeahEh
Am I ready to leap Is there peace beneath
All that we were, all that we knew
I'm sleepwalking
What must we do to restore our innocence
The night has always known when it's time to get going
Now the drugs don't work
Laid down in a hotel bed
I'd play a song that would never ever end
Life is a oneway street, ain't it
Who will love Aladdin Sane
No no just another phase of finding what I really need
For something lasting
I thought she was Mary, Queen of Scots
And fall into my arms
And when the night is cloudy, there is still a light, that shines on me,
Without you, what does my life amount to
You get the people and the government
But please don't leave me now x
I sure need a good companion
Hard to find the strength now but I try
If I should believe
To see how we're ending
But your mother kept it all inside
I'm trying to be brave
Find me space
For to leave her is to love her
Little babies' eyes, eyes, eyes
Can't go to her family, they won't let her stay
We fear how we feel inside
'Cause none of us thought it was gonna end that way
Cold You broke me from the very first night 
Will night bring light or gloom
I would dig a thousand more if I needed to
No one else could e'er have stole me
And I can't believe how dumb I sound
Exquisite music Alexandra laughing
It would be so fine to see your face at my door
Just smile dear, make them thankful for every breath
But you won't miss nothing
But please, don't take the girl
Return to the clouds
All the glory when He took our place
This kind of fate was meant for me
You got no chance at all
Summon to the sky
Thinking 'bout the good times
Love of mine
Annie goes if you couldn't guess
And there's kids playing guns in the street
And you're a mess
My heart don't beat like before
See the sterile soil, poison sky
What a mess now C'mon
No earthly ships will ever bring him home again,
The soft and the black and the velvety
To go over everything
This song leaks out onto the pavement
What the hell am I doin' right
I'm sorry I can't be perfect
There in my rear view mirror disappearing now
trash on the floor, 
And what is past is done and gone
Feel your fire when it's cold in my heart
And it's all right where it belongs
Drag him out your window, dragging out the dead
To bury my love under this bare light bulb
As you threw me to the ground
There is nothing to save
Nervous, I'm knocking on your door
Put them back together, do it all for love
Changing a rope for a size too small, people all get hung
After all the things we've been through
With the door closed, shades drawn
Oh, I don't know, the past couple of weeks I guess"
I still care for you
By lying and tearing us up
And it kills him inside
Stuck on you till the end of time
Maybe you're a mourner, maybe you deserve to die
I know it's time to face all of my past mistakes
And I can do nothing without his permission, that wasn't part of the plan
And they never came back
You are true honeymoon child
Sometimes I wanna call you but I feel like a pest
Just know I'm right here hopin'
You won't be there, you coulda warned me
I say thank you
It has me led to the backroom
You lie awake and think about the girl
I'm gonna drop along the way today
And I bought you this coin, it says 'Number One Dad'
Oh, you couldn't face the freedom on your own
She had a dream, woke up in shock
Surrounded, surrounded
A light that shines behind the veil, trying to find it
Between the busy ones and the ones who don't care
She's waiting to make up
Here's your warning
To me you're precious, may you always
But you never let 'em show
My heart is open to you
I need another place
Make the most of your life, while it is rife
I wish I could just make you turn around
Like my father's come to pass, seven years has gone so fast
But it's done
In ths river 
But they say it will work out fine 
I'd like to be my old self again
That's inside me now
Didn't want no more voices in her head
But I feel too sad
Father he enjoyed collisions, others walked away
He kissed his boy as he lay sleeping
Talking 'bout stupid things
'Cause it takes something more this time
But you still can find me if you ask nicely
I was looking for another chance
Please don't go crazy if I tell you the truth
We're just two lost souls swimming in a fish bowl, year after year
You left me behind
To be functioning properly 
And it kinda made me smile
I fell asleep on a late night train
So if it makes you happy, then keep kneeling, Mom,
Try to make you love again
I'm resting my mind
I guess I'll go home
And when I go out, yeah I know I'm gonna be
I am some son
I fell apart, I fell apart
She coulda been a movie star Oh no
So I'm holdin' on, I'm still holdin', 
What a child will believe
I wonder if you feel the same way too
And my brother and all of my family rise from the seats to sing Hallelujah
And where is the lamb that gave you your name,
I can't sleep here
And we can never repair
And laughing break the mirror sweet
And she was beautiful, but she didn't mean a thing to me
Just to dream of you,
Oh, how the rain
Wishing I could hold you tight
Just what it was I had
There's nothing you can say
My recollections are
Can't remember what went wrong last September
If you see me out on the town
We live in a generation of not being in love, and not being together
It's like they're scared of me
I wish could remember
To let me bleed
So I'll sing Hallelujah
'Cause it was happy, oh, I was sad, and
And if you never stop when you wave goodbye
Would you know my name if I saw you in heaven
Where feelings mean nothing
And I get upset that something was lost
Seasons stormy weather
Don't you know she's got a babe I know
And I loved her
And now look for you from within
They all depend on you
I've got your pictures on my walls
I can't find a flight
I guess you don't need me
Every city's got to have 
Just because, I want to know
But more the crowds that walk all over me
You'll never know the way it tears me up inside to see you oh oh
That I can't even see anyone when he's with me
And we could only see each other we'll breathe together,
You know I plan to retire some day
You're just waiting for her
And the castrated ones
Na na na na na it goes around the world, 
I closed my eyes for a second and when they opened
All hearts could be warmer
I just want to give you everything I've got
If the sun's on its way
To camouflage your scars
I feel for you
Oh, I don't care how long it takes
Hold me so I'm not falling apart
Why would you think your boy could become
Of course you protest, that's what you do best
All I know is that you're so nice
Sometimes I just wanna hide 'cause it's you I miss
You could rule the world,
It breaks your heart in two
Can you see the light
Forgive me, girls, I am confused
Would you call me a saint or a sinner
That before I knew how much I had to lose
All my past and future
This silly game of love  you play, you win only to lose
Been working at the convenience store
Though she may seem an awful bother
The things my heart wouldn't dare
And lie awake, every day
Will be the last thing you'll ever need
I miss the way the sunshine would light up your face
If you say no then no it will be
See the storm broken
Clear the way for my crash landing
But I need
You think your days are uneventful
The wick is burning returning what we have
I'm not crying
Searching the shores these long years
There was a riot coming
The caves of our mouths are bear's bellies
Wrapped up in your arms and our friends were laughing
But if you never try you'll never know
From win and lose and still somehow
Seems like it's been forever
How does he feel
All the ones around me
A side parade, with a single balloon
To change the names
It was you
It's not right, not okay
Little lies cross overboard
I remember it well, taxied out of the storm
At Mann's Chinese Theatre show
That hide and then shatter your mind
It ain't in their hearts they're bad
Honestly I know where you're goin'
Even if I come back, even if I die
You're the shit and I'm kneedeep in it
With her cup of tea looking out of the window
Breathe you out, breathe you in
Begged him to stay in my cold wooden grip,
You will never stay in my home, on my way
Who cry when they see you
And even if you're in the arms of someone's baby now
Deep within the corners of my mind
But you've no need to fear it
She covers one eye 'cause she can see into your mind
Just you and me girl was a beautiful time
"I don't care for this careful behavior"
There's things I'll take to my grave
And I search for you in every passing car
I see eyes of the white menace
Give me that little kiss
You're headed for disaster
 years old I remember when my father told me, "Son,
I know he'd never hurt me
If all the statues in the world
Burnt lungs, sour taste
I just have to let you know how I feel
I pray for the night
And I will swallow my pride
I'm missing you again, oh no 
You'd better say it now
The same old scenario, the same old rain 
I think I want to change my air, my atmosphere
Darlin' I never showed you no, no, no
This one world vision
It's been a long hard road without you by my side
Cause that is when, when I feel that I'm not just counting time
Uns verzweifelt geliebt
Ah, the last time we saw you, you looked so much older
So hold your fire
Seeing you cry it makes me feel like saying sorry
To be played by your dark, twisted games
So many lifeless, empty hands,
Of the crumbling difference between wrong and right
Of all that is to come, the dream has just begun
Love, it taught me to lie
I lived it out from hour to hour
'Cause your voice always helps me to not feel so alone
I get a coffee and the paper, have my own conversations
An early winter
Her diamond curse, it comes with mine
The ribbon was crimson
Each grain carefully wrapped up
Where kindness is a card game
'Cause love takes time
She's standing inside but you surely repeat
You need a ride Delilah 
Shotgun, aimed at my heart, you got one
Happiness hit her like a train on a track
I don't know who your boyfriend is
The ocean is blue
I wasn't blind but
I'm so sorry
I thought we'd be genius together
But do you really feel alive without me
Oohdon't wanna try no more
And accept "someday, somehow"
The only thing that never really changed
But I love her
Now the bombs drop around our feet,
And think of someone you physically admire
And how eventually our hands will just turn to dust,
Now I bade a friend farewell
And I'm dreaming in your living room 
I am my mother on the wall
With fading lights that lead us past the lives that we destroy
And when the night falls in around me
Begged him to stay by the light of this ship
But still they lead me back
You and all your pieces,
I'll be home when I'm sleeping
Something separates me from other people
A paperweight, junk garage
If I laid on the earth 
You didn't know that I was watching
We looked right in their eyes
It cuts like a knife oh now
Like a last breath you would breathe
To make it all right
But I'm drunk instead with a full ashtray
Oh, my babe, at least we tried
But I guess you don't care
She's laughing in her sleeve, boys
They can comfort you, some even try
I'm sober now for three whole months, it's one accomplishment that you helped me with
The truth can't hurt you it's just like the dark
Ada, I've been hoping you know your way around
My true love, my whole world
But you always keep passing me by
And I think she's gone but I'll be sure for safety's keeping
All my sorrow and pain
Don't say a word,
Did you know that I was sleeping
Don't know how you won my heart
Passed it last night in a dream
These wasted blues
I'd rather spend it bein' close to you
It's only fair to do the same to me when you're not home
For I'm left with nothing but this bloodless river bank
There's something missing in my heart You are missing in my heart
I've run out of complicated theories
And everything you need to know
And I can't handle this
It's ahead of me
I'm all alone with my heartache and my good intentions
But anger, her skin makes them sick in the night
But remember when I moved in you
mis dias sin ti son tan oscuros
Through the wall he threw me
All the good things you are
Stella I love you
Better call with some resistance, better way to feel no shame
And there's plenty of ways to wear his hide tonight
He cut out my tongue,
Breathe, keep breathing
I've felt you touch before I know your way
The bond has been broken
I wish nothing but the best for you, too
There's a dream that I see, I pray it can be
We're in pieces 'cause you're over us
I could fly you away with me
The hell out of this town
By your side
I could make you smile if you stayed a while
I'm tired of dancing on a pot of gold flake paint
When Streetlights kissed, upon your lips
That's what I'd say
Out my mind
Maybe it's all right
He's as damned as he seems
Be running up that hill
A fool to let you slip away
People you love will turn their backs on you 
I heard all you said and I love you to death
We have the answer to all your fears
See, the life I've had
And I'm nothing now without you
To fuck up their lives
Speak through these walls
Will carry me over
Her heart's a bloodstained egg
The news men know what they know, but they
I hope your heart won't have to hurt anymore
Only have these eyes for you
I waited for a while
I found myself face down in the ditch
Well, it's all in your mind 
Is still without a rocker
If we fight what's true, will we ever be
So stay with me Evelyn
When the world's crashing down
Well, they trade in their places
I spent two years alone with you
For I've found myself attached to this railroad track
"Did you get enough love, my little dove
And run to them, to them, full speed ahead
And she may wisely cling to the ground
Better at your game
Oh water that had kept me alive
I'm on my broken knees, no end of sorrow
But I am closer to the clouds up here
Baby, daddy ain't leaving no more, "Daddy you're lying,
I still see your reflection inside of my eyes
Your needle and your damage done
How can I love you if I don't love myself I love you
In a wave you say goodbye
Take my tortured heart by the hand
I make believe that I have a new life
You know the words so sing along for me baby
As I try to find the will to forget you somehow
Don't want to hurt anymore
If I'm goin' fuck bitches then they better be tight
With the way I fear
To those of us who know the pain
'Cause I've made my mistakes
Can't seem to hold you like I want to
Had a talk with my old man
The snow and tickertape blurs all my senses numb
I'm more than a bird
And a bank account and everything, accustomed to the finer things
All broken down by
Tears in waves, minds on fire
Is it dark enough 
Something about me stood apart
No regrets now, they only hurt
And I wonder where these dreams go
Refuse to rest assured
Who's left and who's leaving
Here I'm standing on the seashore
And is that alright Yeah
Charity standing orders, on Sundays ring road supermarket
I'm in thoughts
There's just a few things comin' my way this time around, now
I can't believe you're gone and
I'd tell you that it's simple and it was only ever thus
Fallen angels flown away
And soon enough my strength will return
You cross the border of my heart
Just a nobody girl
Give me the mysterious love
Give a little, a little fistful of love
Things that were clean, things that knew what an honest dollar did mean
The breakers in the bar, no reason to live
Maybe, maybe you'll leave the light on
I don't believe you when you say that
Now it looks as though they're here to stay
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
Is what I was tryin' to do
I'm no longer yours and you're no longer mine
I didn't feel right anymore
Like talking it through
Hide my face, hide my face, can't let 'em see me crying
I never wanted anything so bad
Don't run, don't hide
Tell me I should stick around for you; tell me I could have it all
Her winter lips as cold as stone
Now, we've got something to prove
I can't give you the heart you think you gave me
Fuck money, live up and get free y'all
By the waterside and knew
I got two left feet, no, I'm no Jackson neither
And whatever's going down
I will settle in and watch 'em rolling back
She said to give this you this note just in case
We both enjoyed a good fight
And I'm struggling to breathe
The time always comes to say goodbye
I will make the room up nice 
And goodness did heaven know
Regrets and mistakes, they're memories made
"Maybe you didn't know him at all"
How your promises rang hollow
It's no wonder that you feel so strange
Up north's getting cold soon
You say "Anyway's the only way", be careful not to gamble
Only love can save us now
They call them rogues
The crossfire fight for action in between your thighs
Give all my things to all my friends
Just one more line I repeat over and over again
Bulletproof
But I can't bring you back to life
Nananana, yeah
Who can spend the reflection that they see
I will fight for one last breath
So alone in love
Watching the days go by
So that the pure can shut their doors
The streets are silent like my lifeless telephone 
From the only place you've known
Sometimes there's no one left to tell you the truth
Brandishing themselves like a burning branch
At ten, I shaved my head and tried to be a monk
Oh my Barbara, she looks so much just like my mom
Fathers lost without a trace
I thought hell if it's over
Is pouring out to rest
And this is how I feel
A curly headed darkeyed boy
All the change in my life just fell away 
And tell me how it feels, tell me how it feels
I know I'm not your only, but I'll still be your fool,
Who regrets the things they've done
Into the flow of encrypted movement
And I crawl back into your open arms
No one knew me, no one knew me
Don't back down, concentrate on seeing
But I thought that this meant something more than broken hearts and new addictions
And we could only see each other, we'll breathe together,
The sky is falling
And nothing's gonna make this right again Right again
Bleached and blinded by these nights
Hear my feet, they are made of stone
There were times I'd wonder
Lucky that you found someone to make you feel secure
And when she was happy so was I
Way, it's not my fault
I can't remember how to
I'm missing your bed
And your heart is breaking
Let me seek the answers that I need to know
If you're looking for it
I watched it eat you up, pieces fallen on the floor
Go firmly to the window Drink it in
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright
To start over again
The way my broken heart is hurting me
Who doesn't long for someone to hold
That I was brave enough to die
But please, I beg, don't do this to me
Please don't hold me down
I don't need your reasons
Play dead dear, it's your only hope of pulling through
Come on, come on, come on
'Cause I can't sleep alone at night
Through the center of the storm
And we got stories how we slept with all the movie stars
You were mother nature's son
To every laugh,
Lonely, lonely that was you
In the pocket of my blue jeans
I'll only make you cry
And men can do terrible things
I think we're doomed
You smell of memory felttipped electric child
In the shadows, I will listen to their every movement
A patient better driver
I'm growing old and I wanna go home, I'm growing old and I don't wanna know
But I ain't never comin' back
Blackened sky, I beg you, weep
Looking for something forever gone
But I can never find the words to say
They crawl in like a cockroach, leaving babies in my bed
Like you knew my name
I wish that I could stay but you argue
Speak my name
Wish I'd died instead of lived
Nobody else 
Through the darkness and the light
If you ever feel loved or needed
You'll drink that turpentine
I try to make a sound but no one hears me 
Let's talk about all of our friends who lost the war
Traveling endlessly
So please stop explaining
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
But the brightest of the planets is Mars
But forever's gone away
She's running out the door
The smell of death is in the air
My brother would remember sitting in the hallway
Like dying in the sun
And saw that it was headlights
Stormy inside
That call and say, come dance with me
I will feel my way down the darkened hall
Run run run run to me
Or I don't want anyone
without silvery moons, 
Don't ever go away, ooh, oh, yeah
Hate me today
But now I come home
Baby, you took my soul
When you come back I won't be here and you can sing it
You see real life's much different
They want me gone
Then it saddens me to say 
I'll move back down
And the tumblers are drained and then flooded
As long as when the check came they got first dibs
Just remember who's still around
Oh, a little bit possessive, little miss obsessive
I'm at the mercy of the ghost
I'm using lipstick again
He says opportunity knocks once then the door slams shut
'Cause we all get tired, I mean eventually
Well this is something else, who would comprehend
And make it out when the sun is ruined
You're hurting me
The only thing that's real
That people they just ain't no good
The skin of my emotions lies beneath my own
We flew together, love thought they'll fly forever
Now if you're calling me out,
Suddenly I know I'm not sleeping
And though I can't be with you tonight you know my heart is by your side
As you come off all concerned
I thought I'd spend my last days holding your hand
No one laughs at God when the doctor calls after some routine tests
That she knew she just had to leave him
I've got my pride
In the town where I lived
We had change of the moon
And every time I try to fly, I fall 
Leaving rope burns, reddish ruse
Do you think that you could see your way
Just to find a home that's for the restless
This isn't just goodbye
For one more sweet embrace
When you get up in the morning and you see that crazy sun
If you'd only let yourself believe
But you taught me how to trust myself and so I say to you
It seems one thing has been true all along
Do you feel
When everybody else is soundly sleeping
New, new world
How did we get this far apart
Honey, cling to me
And turn this up on the radio
I could never touch you, I think it would be wrong
Let's spend our last quarterstance randomly
To translate what we truly dream about
And I'll still love you even if I can't
My head's above the rain and roses
And untouchable 
Angels will call on me
I tried to stay away, just in case
The promise you gave
Have I still got you to keep me warm
And I'll sing in your ear again
If you've got visions of the past
Till I forgot why I stayed
To be in love with
Nod my head, don't close my eyes
Like a crack in a wall
In her sleep she dreams of winter
'Cause I know I just can't stay here in heaven
I've given a lot of thought to the nights we used to have
Every night, I'm paying hell for glory
The home we reside in
I hate everything
I know tomorrow you will be
The game looks easy, that's why it sells
My toes can talk
It's not about not about angels, angels
Cause someone's coming home
Can you feel my trigger hand, moving further down your back
Quote, hey listen 'cause I'll only say this once
He has no one
Life and the soul
And I pat your hair down 
And you won't disappoint me
Garbage pails and darkened jails
And he felt himself floating up to falling snow
Two times I fell asleep in a dirty basement
We'd spend the whole weekend lying in our own dirt
So, don't make me sad, don't make me cry
They don't leave when the moment comes
Don't worry about it, don't worry about anything
We'll be waiting, waiting where
And leave you alone
Here comes the start of every sleepless night
But when you call me baby
And hold onto you,
So come on baby, let's go shut it down
She took the oldsmobile out past condor avenue
I'll move back down
I know they're still talking
All the things that I had to havelive
Plastic wings and plastic smiles
You see I'm trying to find my place
A time I thought I knew
Take us anywhereoh yeah
And the jokes, they're always bad
Can I die with you so we can never grow old
My only friend
No more hurt
Mother remember the blink of an eye when I breathed through your body
Slowing my heart stealing my breath
Not just for today
The softening of sound
The dream carries me on
I feel so faded, so far gone
Gradually gone
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
But I can still read what you're thinking
The will to death is what keeps me alive
Never knew pain, never knew shame
Well my dad was sick
A man in the park read the lines in my hand
So she got on an aeroplane
And if you hate me, hate me, hate me
Oh, But I was wrong
Would happen in a thought from now
He sits all alone
These days
Let's see how fast this thing can go
What if I ripped your heart apart at the seams 
Wouldn't have to have one worldly possession
When it's really been so long that it starts showing
But darling bless your soul
As if we ever needed anything to entertain us
Here's to the nights we felt alive
When life was just a game
'Cause the sky is breaking
Well I'm not a child 
I know you miss me in your living room 
Will you stop working for the dead and return
I listen to sad songs, singing about love
Who restrains
When you loved me
Repeat to end
Don't come back to me, don't come back at all
Well I have nothing
Would be like it was before
Am I the only one here today
Moments that I have shared with you
Got turned around
Yeah, I want to do some laughing too
Breaking my life in two
Making up movies in my
All dreams escape fire
Listen, little child, there will come a day
I want to give him pain
For the tide has turned
I am sinking, merely sinking
Will you worship moons in winter's night
Like the leaf clings to the tree
Kick the door cause this is over
The kind you'd find on someone that could save
A life of the night
Dreaming a thought that could dream about a thought
She always said that you were the one
Let's have a nice clean cut
Will you say to me a little rain's gonna come
'Cause I don't think you know how I feel
You got wires going in
The sky darkens, my life flashes, the plane that I was supposed to be on crashes and burns to ashes
And through the life force and there goes her friend;
 minutes, to make up my mind
I've walked these miles
Now for the first time in my life
There is so much space between us
Shuffling days and Lonesome nights
Stars in the sky
Like it was meant to be
Only silence as it's ending
I will see you in my dream
Childhood living is easy to do
Heillos versunken, trunken
You'll learn to say when
Oh, he says, bye bye bye to all of the noise
You don't have to call anymore
After you're gone
Sometimes you let me in
How can we go forward when we don't know which way we're facing
I've got to tell you in my loudest tones
Floating upon the surface for the birds
A mutual friend's parents left town for a week
My head, oh, oh, oh, oh oh
There's nothing I wouldn't do to hear your voice again
Moody It's got me x 
Isn't someone missing me"
A very violent flight
And I swear you moved overseas
With the fucking phone
I can't lie
I forget to forget, nothing is important
There's a love that could fall down like rain
And into the room, is it always like this
And finally he just stopped and finally he just stopped
In my life, I've loved them all
This is the deep and dying breath
Samson came to my bed
When things go wrong
And if you're not mine
Cold wives and Sunday papers
Hey, dad, look at me
But I swear in the days still left 
Then say goodbye to Alexandra lost
From the brightest reds to grays
Park the car at the side of the road
With words like 'Lost and Found' and 'Don't Look Down'
I used to know who I was
'Cause waking up without you is like drinking from an empty cup
 minutes, of bliss, thirty lies
Could we ever bring 'em back once they have gone
I long for peace before I die
And I feel so much older now, you're much older, too
I can't find the words to say
I know a man, he came from my home town
It's sometimes just like sleeping
I'll always love you
But I always cared but I always cared
Or the sound he appears to make
I can't think about you driving off to leave barely awake
In my broken heart game
Now it's like a fairytale without a happy ending Happy ending
So why change now
I loved you and I should have said it
Sail away with me honey now, now, now
But the proof's in the way it hurts
Tail in hand, dizzy and clearly
I wish, I don't wish I still smoked
In the longest of nights, stir him at your breast
Like a house that caught fire, it burned and flamed
Tonight, tomorrow and everyday
And I will not turn again
And you flew with it on your back
Chasin' the ghost of a good thing
Home We gave her everything money could buy
Lost on journeys we walked on
And burnt me up
But that makes it worse, yeah
And I wanna see 'em go down in the river where they go
Dear darkness, dear
Your hair is black, your eyes are blue
But its time that has taken my tomorrows and turned them into yesterdays
Seem to wash away
Limitations are set
Ever searching for the one Melanie C For the one
Everywhere I turn, there's something blocking my escape
But ain't no sunshine when she's gone
If someone took a picture of us now they'd need to be told
And maybe I'm just stupid
But I'm not a miracle and you're not a saint 
The leaves are changing color for us
Everyone of us has hope for you, for you, for you, for you
And blind him with your kindness
Wait a minute, wait a minute,
He has no one
When the thunder calls for me
Like everything I'll never find, again
By three or four years
Since you've been gone, it's not the same
Walk around this town like we own the streets
We could smoke 'til the sun goes down
I am too scared to come out
And left a stain
I focus on the pain, the only thing that's real
I don't know how to let anyone else in
Yeah yeah yeah
It's shaking; my life is crashing before my eyes
Through this wicked world
Well, maybe I am, maybe I am
We're either riders, or fools behind the reins
Let's pretend the fog has lifted
Eli, the barrow boy of the old town
Am I lost with you
No one else will have me, only you
Yeah, yeah everything is wonderful now
And put hands on her mother, who's a spitting image of her
And angels with their gray handshakes
If your soul was deep just like mine is, then you would known not to give up
And Dublin in a rainstorm
No I wouldn't have kissed your face
To bear to hear the truth that you have spoken
I'm pining for the moon
All the days of my life, I see them passing me by
So pay me money, take a shot
Smiled in my room
You gave me a reason for standing still
Is still burned in the back of your mind
Of what is and what was
Get the flan in the face
Before you do as the Devil pleases
Shows that we are united
I knew that I'd get like this again
Oh, look what you've done
The days have come and gone, our lives went by so fast
I'm losing you again
There ain't no memory, that ever gets old
Ooh what a waste of
Her mama called me a thief
Please turn your back and walk away
Take me You promised, you promised that you're done
Fly away to someone new
Is the rise of an eastern sun
And it's way way way it's way to cold
It's empty and cold without you here, too many people to ache over
A million years ago
In my dreams I can see you
We're just dancing, no big deal push people
And try to feed your hunger
Or you could just let go and be lifted to the sky
It was a trial, you made a mistake, we know 
Confronts and then dies
My dog won't bite if you sit real still
I was so young, you should have known better than to lean on me
Samson went back to bed
Hailie, I know you miss your mom and I know you miss your dad
You're tearing me apart
I slip concealed back to the keep
But today
We all want to kiss her
When I lie here with you I'm sure that I'm real
I keep making these todo lists but nothing gets crossed out
I'm jaded now, whatever that means
Anybody could've told you right from the start
The curves around your face
Wouldn't mind it if you were by my side
Gotta be honest 
Make the days okay
Well, I got tar on my feet and I can't see all the birds
And she's always gone too long anytime she goes away
Hoping you'll stop by
Shooting stars and satellites 
I want to go someplace and find you there
The surfaces verses
You can make it last forever you
We looked good for eachother
You never hear me talk about one day getting out
Drinking, saying that to them it doesn't matter
That guy was complaining as he looked at the ceiling
Corre o que correr, custe o que custar
My friendships
But they still turn me inside out
Other people know it by heart
You can't say I haven't tried
'This world always stops,' you said
It's just sadness takin' hold
I don't care for myself
Say anything, say anything
By some wave and end up on your own
They tie me to their wooden chair
But who said that I wasn't right
They cut off my hair but it looked alright
Two points for honesty
It's hard to deal with the pain of losing you everywhere I go
Staring at the sink of blood and crushed veneer
And on cold leather seats
Some words are just unspoken
Kept crying out
You took my hand and danced with me
Everyday is silent and grey
Houses move and houses speak
You show your kids the truth, hope they never lie
Everything's cool, yeah
Although it's not easy, I know you believe me
I listen to you cry
Some things never do change
Through the sleet and the rain
Can't lose the sadness
Two words that could describe
The sound of the car driving off made me feel diseased
Where I belong to when I'm not around you
I see my vision burn, I feel my memories fade with time
You wonder if she might be single, she's alone and likes to mingle
I am like the old tin man
I'll keep holding on to you
Hung in shame
Did you know how you would move us, did you know
She's just the way she is but no one's told her that's okay
How there is light in the river
Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light
Trying to find a way to carry on
Cover the mirrors
Who has dressed you in strange clothes of sand
That soon your face will fade away 
And what I choose is my choice
Throw me in the water
Remember times when you put me on your shoulders
But baby, I just need one good one
Will you take me to the other side
I guess I need you, baby 
Can you hear my call
Of this life, well hang on
Honey, I hope you can
In the way that we did
The baffled king composing Hallelujah
I will love you till I die
And now that he's gone, my heart is missing something, so it's time to push my pride away,
When it comes down
Because now the room is spinning
Your guts and callouses, you had kids to feed 
In that mess of details
But you were too busy looking into your affairs
Holding each word he spoke,
'Cause no matter what I say
Really too late to call
It's painted with roses and thorns
Take them back, take them back to your red house
And I won't fear this
That's kinda how this is, you coulda rescued me from drowning
Don't let this desperate moonlight leave me
If we make it we can all sit back and laugh
It's just a movie 'bout a movie to old to die"
And 'Tell my mother not to worry'
That look on your face
And probably you know all the dirty shows I've put on
I love you the first time
I've got to take what I'm making
And I walked along
Too deaf, dumb and blind to see the damage I've done
We tried to hold on
No one cares
Whenever I breathe out, you're breathing it in
When the light of your life sighs,
He lifts his head, handsome, horned, magisterial
You're gone
When it doesn't mean anything
Of my wrong turns
Climb trees, Michael Jackson, it all ends here
And always is this
They'll tar you and drag you through town 
Everybody trying to put us down
Everything else I lost it
Put it up too much to call home
And everything's a mess
And too afraid, much too afraid to sing
�な�を�っ�る�だ�う yeah yeah yeah
Was losing all my friends
I'm not sure why it always goes downhill
Counting the days that pass me by
But this is no easy ride
I'm gonna be alright
You want a top hat on your head
And then the truth
And the sound it makes when it cuts in deep
And leave my love
I don't want to run away but I can't take it, I don't understand
Arm wrestle your mother simply over
All my old friends, wait
Now you're asking me to listen
For that second chance
And if you chose to walk away, I'd still be right here waiting
I been with you for too long to start over with another
I watch you sleep, you look so peaceful
I watched the clouds drifting away
When I can't feel what's in it
She's got sword in case
I wish I didn't have to make
And all the baggage that seems to still exist
I jump to the sky for my people
I'll be everything you need
And do you brush your teeth before you kiss
So break me to small parts
I'm not comfortable with how we never talk
Guardian angels who left me stranded
The Atlantic was born today
I'm gonna change everything wrong with me
It's not enough to say I'm sorry
I wish it was me
'Cause it reminds you of innocence
To the only place
There is no love here
Are soothed beneath the artist's loving hand
Bells and footfalls, and soldiers and dolls;
Don't wanna look, �cause i know how it ends
For fear I'd have to say goodbye
With his face paint white and red
Someone stole my shoes
Please be kind
I pace around the parking lot
Speeches won't be made today
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet, lead her up the stairwell
And if I should ever fall in love again
My future is not set,
Let me put on a show for you, tiger,
In my life, the compromise
I am the Water Boy, the real game's not over here
But I can drive you home
As hours start to fade, deep into the night
She tried to hide her pregnancy from her family
Just bring me back my girl
We'd drink and get high until late
So I think it's time for us to have a toast
It's never done
But you're the only one
Just get on with work and sometimes things'll hurt,
Don't throw your hand, oh no
I'm so tired of being here
But fear surrounds me like a fence
It must have hurt your pride
Listening to each other breathe
And they will sell them for nothing
Your pure heart
It's as thick as our skulls yet it's thinner than air
There is nothing as lucky, as easy, or free
Now these years locked in my drawer
There's a house on my block
Your cold, white brother riding your blood
We might as well be living in another time
Pretty words that you whispered
It's gonna kill me The rest of my life
Don't think I ever believed that
Is this the way it's gotta be
The mind that knows itself
Remain your funny valentine 
You wake up in the bed you make
Dear darkness, dear darkness
But we need pills
All the LA women
How does he kiss
On the day I sunk in this shunt
Hiding in the shade
With eyes that watch the world and can't forget
But it's alright, why don't you tell my friend
Exposing them as fakes
Don't lift a finger let me show you
No we, we could, we could hold each other tight
I can never go back to the way I used to be before this started
Why'd you have to break free
I know the distance is a factor
There isn't one nail without dirt under it 
That I'd been crying over you
I am barely here
'Cause though he's gone
And if I dried his feet 
Like a joke or a memory
Cool your aching head
It's been  months since May
If I only could, be running up that hill
Hey man, tricks can't wait to hear my emotions
There are worse ways for a guy to spend his time
And they get so red in the head you think they're 'bout to choke
We'll find a place
But you don't want to sing along
You're everything that we can't see
And I know I wasn't right,
Laughin' and kissin' it's a match made in heaven
Sometimes I wonder where you are
See the love the love the love the love
And on her jacket there's a picture in white of Che Guevara
I'm so sad, sad
Hold on
Conversation lost its hate anyway
I don't have to pay for this shit
The car to drive right through the shops
Still love's all I see
But it's alright
Please say there's no regrets, and say you won't forget
I am locked in my head 
When it was always about to hit me
Your quiet eyes
Managed to save just a little bit of money
Everytime you told me to leave
Lost him lodged inside a flue
This is my way of saying goodbye
Break this bittersweet spell on me
It'll be summer in Dallas
Simple promises you said you'd never break
Just like our last kiss
I'd tell you that I loved you before I even knew you
She peels away my fingers, looks at me and then gestures
Help me to feel the strength I did
You are an expert at Sorry
I am wasted, losing time
Just to be the man who walked  miles
Showing you all the cards
On the first train to Mexico, ooh
Would you let me know
After a silent, peaceful night
And it goes on forever and forever but iujhiuhiuhiughi
The streets in search of anyone who'll take them home
I feel I can't hold on
It's been a long, long time since I last saw you
I never let it get me down
Keep us stuck here In the comfort, and the fear
Have I still got you to be my open door
And the distance between that was sheltering me comes in full view
You make me real Lately I just can't seem to believe
I wish these  hours would never end
I thought I heard Louis' voice
So when I have a shitty day, I drift away and put 'em on
I remember it well, there was wet in your hair
You know that she'll break you in two
All the cracks they lead right to me
I saw you were sick and tired
Just stay in when it's lookin' this way
Changing your shape
Yeah I'm free yeah I'm free yeah repeating in background
Moving pictures
That sings so we, can heal the harm inside
The thick and the grey
Just like the things I used to know
And I lie behind you 
And your mother's telling stories about you on the tee ball team
Tears and rain
As dog cries for a master and
But I don't have to make this mistake
Stones to throw at my Creator
Though I don't know how I feel
My head is a jungle, jungle
Fix me to a chain around your neck
I should've known this wasn't real
You were my addiction, I got strung out and crazy
You make me real But now it's just a matter of grace
But I'll still love you more tomorrow
With a broken sink for a face
Well a drinkin' buddy that's bound to another town
How could we know, that song, this show,
What if you spoke those words today
Auf der Schussfahrt zu wenden
Take what you need and be on your way
And I know I'll find deep inside me
I never cared about God when life was sailin' on the calm,
For I am the parasite who hangs from your skirt
I loved you so I told you, but it didn't matter much
A fleeting chance to see a trapeze
Your warm whispers
I am surrendering
You couldn't have done
I've dreamt so long I cannot dream anymore
Whisper secrets to the wind
It's the end of a broken heart
The sadness
They loved my friend Adam
Six years ago today
No one left to weep for us
There is nothing left to do but sleep
They say life carries on, and on, and on
Who makes me feel much taller than you are
Feels like I'm never getting back what I give
Falling into memories of you and things we used to do
I feel like my life is flashing by
Evaluate the differences in life
'Til finally there is nothing left
I wanna call them back out for applause
When the needle didn't sting
And I keep spot that we can go to chill
Does it mean nothing
I've changed my face, I've changed my name
Maybe I should just turn around and walk away
Hey little train We are all jumping on 
Let's take a ride and push it through
I'm still too tired to care and I got to go
Between light and nowhere
The Upper Peninsula and the television news
Every time you address me
I need someone to be one, I'll take anybody I can get
When I'm down you're always there
Who never became who they thought they'd be
We need to concentrate on more than meets the eye
Well I'm here to tell you babe,
I'm the moron who dances, ah
All the things you never say
Go 'head and laugh 'cause it's funny, I would too if I saw me
And my eyes hurt, hands shiver, so you will listen when I say baby
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
But sometimes I don't understand
Like a simple waste of time
Yeah, I was her man
Oh yeah, right on, so good
Say, would you let me cry on your shoulder
When the angel came
Good times, good times, good times
The more I cry, the more I cry
Nothing there in my glass
I don't remember the good times, I wasn't there when you were kind
To make you feel loved
And he'll become, become, oh, the prisoner I was
And you may case the grounds
An eagle comes down 
About forgetting yourself for a while
And I don't want to feel this no more
I still want you by my side
To say goodbye
'Cause soul mates never die
I have to cover my eyes
I don't know how I feel
I don't think it's that sad
Dripping with blood and with time and with your advice
And breathe me
Gave a thought to what they all could mean
Nothing can save us
And the more we tense up, avoiding pain 
And the charred remains of our country
Don't leave me in all this pain
My friends call
You're gone away
For any place
And I don't mind if you say this love is the last time
My friend, she told me such a story
And I'll be gone
Nothing's going on 'round here
And I start to miss you
In a place where we only say goodbye
His voice is overwhelming, but his speech is slurred
No, we couldn't care less
We could go into town and spend some money
But I'm still waiting in line
When I see you here waitin' on
The water's cold so cold
We're all we got in this world When it spins, when it swirls
To carry us away from danger
Knowing that for someone you're an angel sent to save
Endless summer, acoustic guitars
Everything means nothing to me
If I had a highway, I would run for the hills
They never really seem to want to tell the truth
If You can take away all my love
All that I know is I'm breathing
And I know you'll never return to this place
Or dressed on a stream
You in the dark
We sent out the SOS call
Need to learn to let it go
Hang your head in shame and cry your life away
And there's nothing there for you to prove
Mmm whatcha say
When there's no light to break up the dark
The names
But I hate when I feel like this and I never hated you
I'm much too old to break free and run
Rage and grace
I was counting on forever, now I'll never know
Get some sleep
And this song is for the stick pins and the cottons
On the first try
Maybe its time I saw the world
You come to me with positions
And the Bible didn't mention us
I'm a fool in the fetter
And I wish that my condition was new but I'm old and rusted
She climbed into a van with a vagabond
And snow
Never had a lot of fun
Well I thought it was already as heavy as can be
Among other things 'round town
And stay down
You told me lies
I knew it would
Sometimes a man gets carried away
And once again I turn to you
Cradle in a cry, cradle in a cry
My neck feels stiff until I wake up
All that's left of you
And you know that I'm in love with the mess
Till they swallowed the police
Move your hands across me
Can make a good man turn bad
With so much hate,
Who will save the war child baby
I really don�t know why I have to care
Me and the rest of the family here singing, "Where'd you go"
The heart wants what it wants baby
Cause hell what's it all about
In shattered pieces that may never be replaced
Oh you bloody
And no matter how you try
Life carries on and on, and on
Each time you get hurt, I don't want you to change
And you will catch me if I fall
I won't tell you lies
And every night I think I certaintly won't ever sleep sober or alone
A tribute to false memories with conviction, cheap imitation
The passion to find the utter truth
I bet your fortressed face
And it feels like fading light
And your mother and your dad
Don't you know she's got a don't you know
The star that I just don't see
I won't need any help to be lonely when you leave me
And street light caught in falling snow
Round here, we stay up very, very, very, very late
And trying to find anything you can feel that you can believe in
To stand beneath my window
Let forgiveness wash away the pain
There's nowhere I can find peace 
Am I the reason why you tossed and turned last night
There's too many people
Was he everything I'm not
Deep in thought I forgive everyone
You'll never drill for oil on a city street
One message beating through
The buildup lasted for days 
As for the clouds
I will be rising from the ground
Should've kissed you there,
Here we are face to face with the memories that can't be erased;
I needed a break when your book about dreams was taken,
And I'm light as the sun,
Child has arrived in the darkness 
Little wet tears on my baby's shoulder
And we're alone, love
They say that God makes problems
Apron and a bucket of plans, never ever
For years and years she tried to hide the whiskey on her breath
After the fact
I'm just having thoughts of Marianne
Of where the light would land
Memory seeps from my veins
Every secret untold
I'll sing it from my roof top
I know what I've done, 'cause I know what I've seen
It's a motherfucker
Which I obviously don't, or she wouldn't be gone
And I know I'm not alone
We will walk in fields of gold
Farewell my dear ones
And I, for one, have felt its bruises
I didn't get to say goodbye
And its water will wash away my sin
And so it's begun 
On celebrating nothing
Except we always woke up,
Don't want to spend
He was guiding me, Love, his own way
I feel it coming out my throat
And the days feel like years when I'm alone
We are ugly but we have the music"
Crying rain
Ooh my own was banished long ago, it took the death of hope to let you go
We're gonna live our lives, Gonna live our lives
Drink up, baby, look at the stars
Just to ask you how you feel
Now each moment is the same
Then the nurse comes round
You could have her, detective daughter copy,
I got a soul to feed
She's in her bed
I guess it's time I run far, far away, find comfort in pain
It wasn't meant to mean no harm
I am the spring, love is blossoming
The only girl he'd ever love
Will allow rest my head
And is he dark enough
He calls me to the ocean
Shannon just flew down Four days back in town
It shoulda been me inside that car
I don't know how long I can hold on
I thought it was there for good so I never tried
Was always waiting for the crush
Cold, cold water surrounds me now
Now all those feelings,
And the TVs try to rape us and I guess that they're succeeding
What if there was no time
Just nervous pacers bracing for bad news
Oh, oh, baby please don't go, oh yeah
How did it ever come so far
Friday morning at nine o'clock
And I know it hurt so bad, it broke your mama's heart
Stand inside an empty tuxedo with grapes in my mouth
And the nurse runs in with her head hung low
Singing lines
The ground never seemed so far away 
I know it well, ugly and sweet
Economysized dreams of hope
You say that they've all left you behind
They say the cream will always
And the world is caving in
This can be better, we can be happy, try
I'm just wondering why you haven't taken my life
I got my own way home, I got my own keys
But I can't contend
Last chance, make it through the divide
I just found a friend,
You'd always be there,
Shouldn't hold me back, shouldn't keep me from you
I hope you're not waiting, waitin' 'round for me
But older than me now
Tunnel and sky collide
This day will come
I've got a woman
In my home on my way
Her baby's on the way, with nothing left inside
That just couldn't wait
My love for you was strong enough you should've known
I thought you'd come over
Same old boy, same sweet girl, ten years down the road
Beyond the door, there's peace I'm sure
I no longer hear the music when the lights go out
You didn't mean to be cruel
I would do anything for you, babe
The setting sun destroys the light
This is where it has to start
Unkiss me, untouch me, untear this heart, oh no no no
The glorious ending of a knight
Leaving was not an option baby never, never
The smell of cold, car seat is freezing
Grab ahold to what I got
It's a grey day in the fall
Break my fall in vain
Come, come, come nuclear bomb
Who really cares anymore 
Did you see mine
Deep, deep, deep in the heart of your sins
The night of the living dead is on its way
As I'm watching you walk away
The war is on, too weak to move 
Acting like nothing's wrong, yeah
Of course I'll be alright
That everyone
And the pipe dream is yours now
Till I heard my dying mother sing Old Rugged Cross
Keep you apart, deep in my heart
This feeling is not sadness, this feeling is not joy
Throwing bits of stale bread
So just one more
You hold the best you can,
And now it's too late to hold you
I don't expect anything,
Oh let's go back to the start
Sing from a book you were reading in bed and took to heart
But that's all I wanna do right now
Older kids trying off the roof
Has its place and form to fill
I'm halfway home now
My love in this daze
Back to the same place I sat with you drink for drink
Ice water
And in between it always seems too long All of a sudden
Intake eyes leave passing vapor trails
Burning slowly, my one and only
I'm sick of all the games I have to play
I hope my love
The hours grow
It's gonna cloud our eyes again
The colored birds above their running
And ooh
And believe who you are
Cool heart and hands and aptitude
Sometimes I feel so happy
Sadness is my boyfriend
I've seen this happen in other people's lives
We take a walk along the dirty lake
And now all our dreams are cashed in
I laughed with my friend when she got to the end
Thought that you would stay forever with me
I was doing time alive
Why does my heart why does my, my, my feel so bad feel so bad
The dream that comes alive at night
Take me out of this world
Suddenly I'm so incomplete, yeah
You're right,
Of all the things we should've said
And you who were bewildered by a meaning;
Wild, wild horses couldn't drag me away
Lost moments blown away
When she's breaking his heart she still fucks like a tease
Why don't you ever learn to keep your big mouth shut
When will it start to sway
I know it's still the same
I guess I need you, baby
They're tears of joy
I can't feel your heartbeat
Your life will shine, File indisputable
Well, everybody hurts sometimes
Oh, you're almost home
Stripped of all my cares, my cares
You're the one who's always choking trojan
 minutes, to alter our lives
If she sees how much I'm hurting she'll take me back for sure
No amulets, not a charm to bring you back to my arms
So don't call me baby
I say that I'm a bantam lightweight
Wish that I'd go to bed
And she walks through the night with her child in her arms
"If we walk away, they'll walk away"
Do you know, who's that guy,
Sells love to another man
I'm not like all of the other girls
I breathe deep and cry out,
But it's all just the same at the end of the day
A picture of you, holding a picture of me
Just to know that my woman gives me sweet mother love
She knows there's people watching
Looking for something to open my eyes
Well, I fell in love with your sailor's mouth
But some things they stay the same
But I'd rather walk alone, than chase you around
I couldn't promise you anything
Call me on your way back home, dear
And I don't want your good luck charms
It's got a picture, "This'll keep you safe daddy, take it with ya"
Take a chance if you should go
And I only understand every other word
She once fell through the street
And the waiting is the hardest thing to take
Smile to keep the sky from falling down, down, down, down
We'll live our lives, We'll take the punches everyday
I've reached the end of my rope and it's time that I told you so
'Cause you know her tricks and you know her past, when she makes a face you just have to laugh
And the German dwarf dances the butcher's son
Just a little bit
Still, we've got our hearts on safe
Burns her to the bone
To be made of glass
Are you still into it 'Cause I'm still into it
I ain't about to to die like this
At dead of night, when strangers roam
The worst kind of sad
Started a search to no avail
You let me hold you tightly
There is always one addiction
But we're still sleeping like we're lovers
Has started in me as
Calls me on the phone
Give me something that I need
Now that the candle's falling smaller in my mind
Of you miles away
I am hellbent on extracting all of my revenge
You've been looking for someone you can trust
Round here, she's slipping though my hands
And being on this road is anything but sure
Drape your arms around me and softly say
Where I stay up all night
I never saw the truth hanging from the door
There's a dead man trying to get out,
And there's a thunder in our hearts, baby
I have seen your face
The lights went out,
The sun is out and up and down again
There's always some reason
But I was comfortable and warm inside my shell,
Falling slowly, eyes that know me
We spend our days together
I just finished writing Jubilee Street
And line them up in single file
They said 'Stop'  but we went on wholehearted
Take all evening, I'll just be cleaning
The face that we hide in
She is the one that I adore
Be running up that building
Oh, the room was silent 
And out and off in search of someone proud
Morning fields of amber grain
Downtown, Downtown
I don't care if it hurts
Maybe love won't let you down
I didn't get around to kiss you
I've been living in the shadows of your song
You're not the one to place the blame
Nothing left to hide
Pray unto your fear
Midnight moon shines through it all 
It jumps through your shirt, I can still feel your arms
Oh, right
Well you know there's a snowstorm
It was a straightfaced lie I believed
Everything to me 
How I'd love love love, to dance with my father again
Like a father to impress
The bus is runnin', it's time to leave
Yes, I know what you think of me, you never shut up
Back to the bench where your clothes were stolen
There's a burning in my pride, a nervous bleeding in my brain
The reception's gotten fuzzy
My dearest friend
In a dark room on the bed, he kissed them all
Last night your shadows scampered up the wall
So please forgive what I have done
Lovely life I thank you
And you don't even care
But she is dead and gone and lying in a pine grove
I'll keep an eye on the road
I found those pictures I took
Since you're gone I'm not the man I used to be
It meant the world to hold a bruising faith
It's not an enviable lot
For taking his hands
In the distance, moving closer with every hour
I hope you're not lonely without me
I don't want you to change
They come here alone and they leave in twos
I'm sorry that I couldn't get to you
Hope fills the heart
I'm your bewildered child
You've left us now, but we're not alone
I'll leave them over to your eyes,
I'm not what's missing from your life now
We want this like everyone else
In your name I find meaning
And you're singing
So I'd like to make some changes
Leave a little life today
She's thrown back hostaged
You're still the only one I've gotta love
Looking out across the next few year
See nothing wrong, see nothing wrong
Don't you dare tell me we gotta let it go
Leave me alone, leave me alone
What would it take for things to be quiet Find your way into my heart
'Cause I don't wanna know how it looks to feel like this
But when asked to make a point I tend to whisper
Unfold me and teach me
Sorrow's a girl inside my cake
I look tough enough
Because opportunities moved us away 
Everything will be just fine
Melt away and leave us alone again
Now you got me
I don't think it's going to happen anymore
Oh, come to me once more, my love
Sleep will not come to this tired body now
The state of what you've got
Catching things and eating their insides
The tragedy starts from the very first spark;
Own their seething lies
But I'm about to give this one more shot,
Well, all the apostles, they're sitting in swings
Someone is showing
In the heart of December
"Oh come on and have a drink with me
Let me rest in pieces
Shadow on the things you know
So let it be
While I'm melting in the rain
Watch my luck turn, fro, and to
You were the one that made me feel the way I do
Hold on, dear
When you reached down to take my hand
I was happier
When I was young, younger than before
Fifties, baby doll dress for my "I do"
Ending what had begun 
You still mean the world to me
But I ran till I fell, shaking in his arms
But there is another who is a little older
Found a woman there who said
Always so much fun to me
I loved you all along
Some things are better left unsaid
The clouds above opened up
There's no place left to hide
While she sings she make them feel things
Does he sing to all your music
I think I'll go to Boston
Heaven from Hell Blue skies from rain
When they're talking to you
All I have has left me gone
Her father would come to her in the night
I don't want no fight
I think you'd better find your place
Seen the look of anger
Did I say the world was fair
Where the cave man died 
And do everything
Because nothing like this ever happened to them
No longer fun and so far from interesting
He wore his passion for his woman like a thorny crown
You keep looking but you can't find the woods
Completely wrong, totally wrong
To lead him through the dark
Something inside me dies
I need a new direction to get me around
Face up against the glass
I'll keep my eyes patiently focused on you
It might have been just a dark pretense
I've lost my face and now it can't be found
My body turns and yearns for a sleep that won't ever come
You were perfect and I guess I'm just a creep
Like an inferno we shone rays
It's left this house empty now, not sure if I belong
So won't you help a brother out
Long horses, we are born
I feel just like
The ghost of your smile is always looking
Tell him how I feel
'Twas my greatest thrill
Only seven hours away
I still have a flame gun
I know I was a percenter then
Which of yourselves is truly gone
'Cause really, it's what I need
I barely have motivation 
Breathing the cold and sterile air
All I have, all I need, he's the air I would kill to breathe
Than the owner of that kind of heart
Your smile is like a breath of spring
And I'm painted black
Fall down beneath their own weight
Sunny days and rain
Trees are giving up
He'd say "Music was the home for your pain"
Oh, I miss the kiss of treachery
You are my sweetest downfall
It only gets harder the more that you know
' Hudson in the garage
It was so easy and the words so sweet
Take a deep breath and a good look around
"How I dearly wish I was not here"
I'd feel rather afraid and insincere
Before you destroyed my life
And watched the sun make the shadows long
And I'll make you okay and drive them away
What are we gonna do
If I could just hold you again
Or the land between here and the mountains
Hard to believe I played this game
Don't laugh at me
Wipe the tears from yesterday,
Will dance reflections of the fire in the night
Only one
We were merely freshmen
Seen nothing wrong, seen nothing wrong
You're not the only one
For months on end I've had my doubts
Screaming like this in the hole of sincerity
When I'm not, ooh
Ya buscaré qué hacer conmigo 
And it never would have gone away, no
In a better time you could be my friend
These tears just can't erase, I don't need them anymore
I thought that my first love would be my wife
And caring what I do with them
Some people said
I'm keeping up with the moon on an allnight avenue
For every second chance,
And what I wanted to say
Like a daydream or a fever
There was no tomorrows, and we'd packed away our sorrows
All around, all around
They say if you ain't grindin' until you die 
Still
I still forget just how to
Will you still miss me when I'm gone
Wanna fuck shorty can't stand shorty friend
Scratched in metal, name erodes away
All you wanted was to live for a while
Those were the days
When nobody's watchin'
And we did it when we were young
I could feel my eyes turning into dust
If I could just hold you,
Still they leave blind the will to begin
Working too hard
And I thought you wouldn't have to keep
Sundays will never change
The numbers lead a dance 
Couldn't stay to watch me cry
I love you the last time
Love is coming home
And read me the story of "O" 
You said you'd be mine
But she's got no more time, now she wants mine
I know, I know, I know what I am chasing
The needle and the thread
Hopes and fears
Don't you love the girls, ladies
I won't feel anymore
Face to face, I've something to say
Wearing a face that she keeps in a jar by the door
Rare as the feathers on my dash from a phoenix
How did you go bad
A son's heart's sewed to mother
She keeps screaming, she don't want me to sing
Still a little bit delirious
You laugh at every word, trying hard to be cute
'Cause my angel, she don't receive my calls
Oh, I will stare the sun down until my eyes go blind
Losing myself in this race
But don't say that you loved me
Maybe we didn't understand
I came down over the sleepy mountains where
I think that's well understood
It's that sorta thing that makes you think too much
I can change, and I can grow, or we could adjust
Already I'm so lonesome I could die
Can't stop what's coming, can't stop what is on its way
In the shadows stood up high for all to see
Never had a voice to protest
Right in this moment this order's tall
Nothing left to fear
Hindley wakes and Hindley says
I got all my ones to choose from
I'm so used to my life with you around
And float in space and drift in time
All we can do is keep breathing now
Then I'll go out back and I'll get my gun
She told me that you made some money
Goodnight, hope that things work out all right, yeah
You know sometimes baby I'm so carefree
Give me a little fistful of love
Strung out, a little bit hazy
We all became friends
And she thought about this irony as she stared back at the moon
Makes one hardened but
It is the day, I wake with my ears cocked up like a gun
Forgotten
I won't let go till it bleeds
Who keeps singing over everything
The times that you hurt me
I believe in you and me
Looking at you, looking at you
Old men comprehend
Believing no lies, telling each other we'll be fine forever
I know you by heart,
But where to begin throwing caution to the wind
And you make it stronger build that wall
This is her dress that I loved best
Let them be calm so I finally can sleep
Oh yeah, everything is wonderful now
Hard work forever pays
Remember, you promised me
Before fire could catch me
You'll want to be mine
And when I'm done I feel like talking
And you were somehow the rain this thing could allow
This can be better, you used to be happy, try
How I grieve now you're gone
Can't believe that I still want you And loving you I never should have walked away
When the chips are down
No sacrifice at all
Just remember when
We were having the time of our lives
And we're still making love
In my happy home I read the signs
She's never gonna see the light
You gave in, you gave out, outlived your dream of youth
Now I'm guiltstricken, sobbin' with my head on the floor
For people and things, that went before
So it's not hard to fall
It was two weeks after the day she turned eighteen
Their eyes can't hope to see
Pisspoor, ride in her sun bathing fireside
And lost in the haze of the wine
Why did you deceive me
If it meant I'd get the Jack part out
I saw you talking to Christopher Walken
Broke up and I'm relieved somehow
You're gonna walk alone
And somewhere in between I can feel you
You got to see the person I have become
I cover my eyes, still all I see is you
You talk too much
I know this song
No more lies
You got an attitude of everything I ever wanted,
And it's your final last call
That I still, I still love you 
When I mention how I love you
And daylight comes and fades with the tide
Brass buttons on your coat hold the cold
He may play the jack of diamonds 
Returning as if dream
Together we cry, oh, we cry, we cry, oh, we cry
Leave my wings behind me
Like a cat in a bag, waiting to drown
Oh, if I wait here, if I see you
And if you let me I might try to make you stay
And that's why I need you here
Even promises may bleed
He hears that outside, a small boy just started to cry
Over forbidden lines
And the places that you go 
And brought me back to you
And they will kill a man for what his father has done,
Do you hear the static of one thousand detuned radios
The only thing we share 
And all I can do is watch and cry
No pictures left in the hall
And all along I knew it was wrong
Brutal wind of snowy harlot
And you're givin' back some glares
It's two hearts living
When times get rough
That you were an island and I passed you by
It's unsung and I say
Where the rainbows end
Driving myself to death
Now love me if you dare
I let you go but you're still the only one
Turn your back on a payyouback, last call
So it's all come back round to breaking apart again
Well, you're just across the street, looks a mile to my feet
The universe will have it's way, too powerful to master
And here comes emptiness, crashing in
Will someone care to classify
Nothing could be bring me closer
And amidst this bitterness
One day I'm gonna lose the war
And love is just a camouflage, for what resembles rage again
A man needs a maid
But nothing cures the hurt you bring on by yourself,
We look so alike that it makes me shiver
Your soft skin is weeping
And so nothing left to say
No light no air to live in
Awoken by the morning bird
As I talk in circles round you on my bed
Dreadful sorry, Clementine
But you just tell them my name
Said your Jackie's gone
You're gonna make us scream someday
Show you all the pain
Oh, babe
I thought we'd be sexy together
Music turned into thin air
I see why you left
And present it in my mouth
About my world and when you came,
That you are my night sky
So I said I'd get my head down and I'd deal with the ache in my heart,
And you coming back to me is against all odds
Do you think you can tell
The things we used to say
So alone in love,
Someone said that you're fading too soon
Shake your ass out in that street
And it breaks me just to know
I left my cell, my pager and my home phone at the bottom
And there's no other girl like you, no one
The only love I've known is a chimney sweep
And girl you're the one thing caught in between
You know I'll always mean
I sensed my loss before I even learned to talk
A heart to wrap around so I can find my way around 
This whole life is a hallucination
The love you don't feel when you're holding me
So I'd hide yours with mine
'Cause all that's waiting is regret
They think are new
In the morning, the film crews start arriving,
I wanna die, I wanna die, I wanna die, wanna die, wanna die, I wanna die, I wanna die
An angel will die, covered in white
Are we meant to be empty handed
Mommy's in the manger with the little kids
I made my baby cry
I'd never dreamed that I'd meet somebody like you
How this world turns cold and it breaks through my soul
Watch fluent sea men rig their rudders so they'll
Only fools rush in
It's such a big mistake
Filled with pain
Never let you go
There's a ghost on the horizon
Down on my knees and my hands in the air again
I can remember where I come from
You looked all over town
Remember your families
Then return with a broken heart
I know you're gone, you said you're gone, 
I got the bruises to prove it
And once again you my friend are no where to be found
Older gents sit on the fence
The straight to your heart times
Your wild guess, everything will be explained
But you may be offended, and you may be afraid
All alone, all together, all together in the dark
Jumped into the river
'Cause they took apart a picture that wasn't right
But the only thing that
And everything went up in smoke
Can you forgive me for trying again
I won't tell anyone
I'll Take you away from that empty apartment
Watching all the world in war torn
She was hard and as cracked as the Liberty Bell
His name was Perry
I couldn't gauge your fears
And the endlessness that you fear
Don't speak with someone's tooth
You in the sea
So all of the businessers in unlimited hell
And nothing at the same time
Yeah, we never talk about the past anymore
It shouldn't have to be this hard
You won't ask and I won't say
Young girl, one day you will be old
Now you're underneath the stairs
And somehow I knew you would leave me
You can see my broken heart
Wearing that polkadot dress
I got dressed, and to that house I did ride from out on the road, I could see its windows shining in light
All along, not so strong without these open arms
My mouth is dry
At a cocktail party when listening to a good Godthemed joke
Don't wanna lose the time, lose the time to come
Don't keep me waiting here
She told her son
And I wrote a letter to my family
And nothin' holds relevance
I remember cheering from the towers
We've missed out on everything
I was glad I could give you a smile
I've slept alone before you
Hey now, count a thousand, million people, that's astounding
Must have been too late, I believe you were not lying
Oh, are you one of them
What was I thinkin' about Ah who cares, I'm maaaashed
You came, I think 
You know, sometimes it just feels better to give in
So remember me when I'm gone
And I held your hand through all of these years
Just sit back and listen
I enter your new life for me 
Talking dirty for a hobby that's alright
Whatever we called you
Like a river running dry 
A fist to the voice
I walked home smiling, I finally had a story to tell
Don't let 'em get to you
She can't see the way your eyes
There is my love
Goodbye on the hand
Wine left to rot and a voice that can't sing 
Just a little bit of your heart, just a little bit of your heart, Just a little bit, baby, baby,
And death is saving me
Lonesome tears, I can't cry them anymore
He had a tryout with the Sixers
As she told me "Son
I can't be sure that this state of mine
Oh, how I wish, that was me
Can't put out my stomach burning
Well I've never been the kind to ever let my feelings show
I'll cry on your shoulder
And a head that just takes up space
Get out of my bed
You just took the train
Everything we had
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
So just say yes or no, why can't you shoulder the blame
With a hairbrush and an air brush
So you got in a kind of trouble that nobody knows
Had to switch up look at things different see the bigger picture
It hurts so much just thinking of
I do not lay here in the dark waiting for thee
And I'm falling over
no encuentro forma alguna de olvidarte 
Only seventeen, but tired
But there's never been a song or a melody
Alexandra leaving with her lord
For the trouble you took from her eyes
For new bodies to haunt
You know that I've gotta say time's slipping away
'Cause everybody's gone at last
And someone has to speak
I still smell you, distance aside
You let me hold your hand till I had my fill
And the truth that's in the message
It's hard to win me back
Welcome to lookin' come back tomorrow
Suffer my desire for you
There were sounds in my head
A dream for the blind
The dizzy dancing way you feel
And I would walk  more
There ain't nothing right, there ain't nothing wrong
Good good bye, tinsel shine
And damn, this place
Honey, all the movements you're starting to make
Take time silently, feel real room, high five
So precise and so pristine, a perfect pane of glass
As it was
But you'll think of me
Please don't walk away
And drive around a faster car
I'll keep your memory vague
You were only four, but lord you remember it
I'll do anything for you, I'll do anything for you
And I don't really care who follows me there
Waving your guns
It's never over, all my riches for her smiles when I've slept so soft against her
Now I've got you right where I want you
No one deserves it
Take back all the things I said to make you feel like that
Up close the sound remains the same
How do you love with a fate full of rust
Though your whole world has gone up into flames
And I told you to be kind
Undo this hurt you caused when you walked out the door
I want to take you home
All of these ghost towns I keep traveling through
Oh, lover, you should've come over
For all the Mommy things she's done
My heart is just too dark to care
Say I'm still the soldier in your eyes
And now I speak to you, are you in there
And I'm constantly turned off
Don't be scared Don't be scared
Or ever thought was real
He said "turn sixtyeight"
With a note that said 'I'll love her 'til I die'
As I'm feeling my way through the dark
And the light's always red in the rearview
See me crumble and fall on my face
Is it time to let it fly
And I don't think you see the places inside me that I find you
But then you disappear and make me wait
And on to something new,
'Cause I can't hold on to anything this good enough
I loved the way we used to laugh
Oh, well, I never meant to cause you no pain;
If you never hit the road, so
With your back turned up against the wall
It lives alone and it barely knows you
Your hair is on fire
Just outrun the demons could you
I won't let this build up inside of me
My black shroud
I'm a sun that doesn't burn hot
I tried counting sheep but there's one I always miss
I'll take it by your side
While you've been pushing me around
And I'll wait my turn
All of the silence after the tears
And don't act strange, don't be a stranger
How could love be so thoughtless, so cruel
Never was much of a romantic
Lookin' at my scars
Stretches out like branches of a poplar tree
'Cause I've never been the kind to ever let my feelings show
Not knowing if I should try a little harder
The minor fall the major lift
But if they just knew 
It's been two days and  minutes too slow
To anyone about anything New Bracelet
Trouble is her only friend
I won't always live in my regrets
Oh, I've seen fire and I've seen rain
Just some kind of life with the edges taken off
Travelin' around sure gets me down and lonely
I'd like for the whole world to hear
Sprawled across the bed,
I never sleep
All your secret wishes could right now be coming true
Allie woke up AM
There is love left in my life, I will see
Them back for all that shit on stage
Hold Me
Is it the truth
In his own way, he'll love me till the end
I won't fake it like the other girls
One absence of truth 
The touch of your skin, giving life from within like a love song never heard
Is the one thing that I had, 
Like when I fell under the weight of a schoolboy crush
It could bend or it could break
I wait in  time
You see my ghost and you'll never forget it
I walked alone
Is it only timing that has made it such a dark hour
And heaven knows heaven knows
Possibly maybe
That hurt too bad to when we both begin to cry
Some great big disease
Everyone to see 
I wonder why you left me here
But it's nothing new
And can you explain this mess
I know it was destined to go wrong
I got a taste of paradise
But that's life, it's so "soso"
I'm out of melodies
Take me somewhere new
They stain their mouths with blood
I got scared by just how hard I fell
It didn't get there by itself
We got tickets they were free
Dust devil swept you away
Steeple guide me to my heart and home
This faint and shaky hour
Calling out my name This table is set for one
You know I can't let you slide through my hands
Like lavender the smell of your hair, 
'Cause Ed is watching my every sound
And you think I'm curious
Those days are dying in the dark
Lonely nights, lonely nights, lonely nights
This world you must have crossed
Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah
I'll be right beside you forevermore
While across the room he stares
Well that may be your best defense
Your grandson's hand as he plays with your hair
And I always let you go
But down in your arms, in your arms
She would change everything, for happy ever after
I attain my dream
Well honey here comes a lullaby
Maybe it's all right,
Hopelessly fighting the devil futility
Gonna throw a blue bouquet
Oh, there's gonna be an answer let it be
Put on my PJs and hop into bed
It's getting me down, my love
Spun the stars on her fingernails
I just wanna hold her;
Ever so sweet,
And everything
Someone to talk to
It seemed to last for hours It seemed to last for days
And be the bird and be the key
To breathe for me, breathe for me'
And all those mornings watching you get ready for school
Summer in the city
I drink much more that I ought to drink
This is our music from the bachelor's den;
It's a feeling that you cannot miss
But oh Medusa kiss me and crucify
We never change, do we No, no We never learn, do we
And everybody wants to be special here
So hold on, hold on
I never needed anyone
What I'm missing
And all my friends have gone to find
Out across the city
She better hold him tight, give him all her love
Through the coppice and the chaparral
So I'll wait for you, love
Hey, haven't seen you around in a while
In the pain in the pain there is healing
To feel the pain and hurt the worst
Don't believe their lies
And I've heard that music
For all the times she showed me wrong
Say you'll love me again
Now nothin' holds significance
And when you're standing in the shadow
That sorry seems to be the hardest word
When the light pressed up against your shoulder blade
I always feel like shit
Give your life
But my heart it still sings
Appliances have gone berserk
The neighbors were starting up their cars
All the mamas and the papas
Is there anything I can do for you, dear
Sunshine, been keeping me up for days
Too much, too bright, too powerful
At the end of the tunnel
Well, I love the way we communicate
I'm careful not to fall
Were you made ashamed Why'd you lock them in a drawer
And then home
And for the tiniest moment it's all not true
But that's all you've left me with
What to be done with her
It only takes two hours to Nevada,
But this is me swallowing my pride
And the games we would play
Until the day it was taken away
I'm falling apart, I'm barely breathing
It's time to make this something that is more than only fair
'Cause mine stopped working
And three days later was clear to all
Why does it have to go from good to gone
Oh, I will make my way through one more day in Hell
And I'm thinking about the only road, the one I've never known
All those years
Forget your dad, he's gone
Suffer fate 'cause it's the only lift you've got
Won't have to drive too far
A reason to fight
So here's my heart I'll give over and over again
You barely even make a sound
So I'm gonna buy a gun and start a war
And I tried to hold him
All my riches for her smiles when I slept so soft against her
Oh, honey sweet, so full of sleep
You think they're joking
Last chance, suffer the weight or get buried by this
Once again I'll be the foolish one
I tried so very hard
To get them off the hook would take miracle workers
Makes me love and love them more
Into the light of the dark black night
I was lying in my bed last night staring
Sailing in our separate ships
Takes four legs to make a ceilin' like a thing
I�m not carefree, no
There comes a time when every bird has to fly
I never made promises lightly,
Sometimes I cried my heart to sleep
We could go to the pictures, go and see something funny
tan faltos del aire
To the last speck of dawn
Why do you throw your days away
And your mouth, your mouth, your mind
Mary's got the same size hands Same size hands
I don't think we would kiss
You're my sweetest
And a paper plate of course, you think of everything
Well I thought that we could sit around and, talk for hours
I could drag you from the ocean,
People emphasize the weight of the world
Upon the pain getting deeper
I might as well take a gun and put it to his head
It's the stupid details that my heart is breaking for
But I've had some time alone, to hone my lying technique
How does he taste while he's on your lips
Holding down my feelings
I just want to fold you up into my arms
And keep that song out of your mind
My hours are slumberless,
It's for you, and I taste what I could never have
And I'm not coming back around again
Wiping the dirt from his hands as he walks from the grave
And falling down on your knees asking for sympathy
He's lying, you're crying
When you're little and the world is so big so big
We can chase the dark together
Leave me with some kind of proof it's not a dream, ohh
And her dad called himself commanderinchief
I'm falling in love again
Well, go on ahead and take this the wrong way
It'll feel like it should
I'm under attack again my dear
You can't break my spirit, it's my dreams you take
I will follow you and see you on the other side
Her loving nursed him back to life
Will you still kiss me if you find out
I still recall the taste of your tears
I need a place that's hidden in the deep
I'll bet she's beautiful, that girl he talks about
Solace my game
When I meet you in another life
Oh, your will is in my hand
It's a lonely place to live with just a ghost
You've done me no favor
All these things that I've done
These train conversations are passing me by,
With you 'cause you're leavin'
You that I'm tired
Oh 'cause I don't know
But the girl on the car in the parking lot
Nothing's the same when you give it away
And hold me for goodbyes and whispered lullabyes
And I built a home
Brenda's Brenda
I know you're always telling me
The world has changd or I've changed in a way
I said my goodbyes, this is my sundown
I could never leave your beautiful eyes
It's always the same
Your eyes don't like me no more
And tell you everything is all right
Need your light in my life
So tonight I'll sit and pick apart your pictures 
I see that kissme pucker forming 
And inside of me, lingers on
I didn't know what love was on that day
Tell me I'm a part of history Tell me I could have it all
A fitful dream, the morning will exhaust 
In a bunker underground
This time Ill take the chance
Oh, nothing means a thing to me
Then the magician disappeared as quickly as he came
Cause to trust is to depend
Drew looks at me
And maybe you'll be all right
And I've had recurring nightmares
When my heart's on the floor
To deserve your love and sympathy
That if I tried hard enough
This world was never meant for
I loved him so but I let him go
Where you say it's all right
And I was strong, strong in the sun
Only proves you're my best friend
A burned out world you know
She looks like the real thing
It's all ending
Something's gotta change
Sells coal and marigolds and he cries out
There is a house built out of stone
I had the feeling that you'd open up my eyes 
'Cause I wish that I could stay
Adulteress conditioned to a spin cycled submission,
You can always find something to do
'Cause I'm here to say that I sometimes do
I keep thinking in a moment that
But you've got to walk away now, it's over
Better make your mind up quick
But, you know I hated to close the doggone door on you
Does he lie below snagged in the fingers of a seaweed tress
Maybe you could not believe it
I'm getting to the end
'Cause when you feel like you're done
Your silence makes me hold my breath
So I lay my head back down
In backseat staring out the window
I'll cry about this
Step out the front door like a ghost into the fog
Now that I've really got a chance
But people are people and sometimes it doesn't work out
Or your face as you were leaving
Or the person
How my heart gets torn
But, is there a chance
I heard you driving in my car
I never meant to let it get so, personal
I follow your steps in the snow
This vacation's useless, these white pills aren't kind
You were supposed to grow old 
Oh, yeah I will, yeah I will
Oh Grandmother 
So when the birds fly south 
She'd fallen down to, now the streets are wet
But finally, it's mine
Following me in my desperate endeavor
Return
The first of every tear I'm gonna cry
I counted people as I neared the street below
And if you'd just rest your head, stop repeating the charge
I wanna hope to die
Saturday,  miles
Who's returned from the dead 
I will kiss you forever on nights like this
I may be mad
It's a lost fight
He held her tight and kissed her lips in, front of the picture show
I'll be staring at the sky
Damp with fog the bog that grows the former business sector
With every bet I lost
Like my father
It's hard to explain how I am getting by on so little from you
If you're not the one then why does my hand fit yours this way
Summer has come and passed, the innocent can never last
Here's to goodbye
Tell me baby, where did I go wrong
I had it all, but I let it slip away
You always said you'd tell me first
I'm ashamed of my life because it's empty
My father's house shines hard and bright it stands like a beacon calling me in the night
If you ask the church then I am no believer
'Save him, save him from the hand that he beats me on'x
Got no place to go
Kiss the feet of a charlatan
Time's running backwards from me and you
But I know you'll get out the minute
If you're done with it
You look in your eyes
Don't forget to keep your head warm
If it brings me to my knees
Winter has come for me, can't carry on
No, never have I loved any other man
This dream you've ridden on turns your world to explosions
Although she needs you more than she loves you
I hear your name
There might be some good ones
Tell me its just a lie
I try so hard to be happy
They scandalize my name
Hide and Seek Speak no feeling no I don't believe you
The shadowlands
Are always first to drop
Late night you make me feel like I'm desperate, I'm not desperate
It's not hard to dream 
It seems to me if you can't trust
Oh, what have I got to do to be heard
It's so crystal clear now
Tunnel vision lights my way
Together we cry, whoa
I beg for just one more tomorrow
There is really no one left at all
And this awkward kiss that tells of other people's lips
And read me the story of "O"
Oh, oh, oh, ooh
And nothing feels good for no reason
The cards were stacked against him
It's not something I would recommend, but it is one way to live
Your eyes were on the living room, your eyes were on the closet
Think not what the season will become
I'm not saying anything you haven't heard before
No one's laughing at God in a war
No one knows why she did the things she's done
I know there's little use in crying
I let them slip away from us when things got bad
Don't you know this is war
Now take it, take the box
Never have I turned since then
Say what up to life immortality
When they said they'd call you
Everything I love, everything I hold dear 
She broke his heart; he spent his whole life tryin' to forget
She talks to me
Here's to you and your lover boy
About things I couldn't say to you
Losing all control
Depression seeps in on a lonely messiah 
It's the same old storyline 
Shine like stars, shine like stars, shine like stars
Universe surrounds
I climbed the tree to see the world
Or I'll lose my place
How can I give love when love is something I ain't never had
Don't for a minute change the place you're in
You shut the door on everything too busy getting high
I let fall flowers of blood
Getting tired and sleepy in her bat mouth
But we really don't care do we
Just shine a light into the wreckage
It's coming apart
Promise is never over, never questioned it needed reply
Every time I pay the price
Somebody caused me strife
When I was three, and free to explore
That I would be good if I got and stayed sick
Wha, What's written in braille upon my skin
You really got a hold on me
I'm getting by in other ways
I feel I'm sinking
Love to aim at besides
With no velocity, an empty headed heart and far too long
For a brand new start;
Oh, I'm still alive
Let's exchange the experience, ooh
'Cause what about, what about angels
Well she tossed all night like a raging sea
My brother told me he saw you there
This wave never breaks,' you said
Don't let the days go by
Jackie left on a cold, dark night
Happens all the time, love
To get out of our little heads
Goodbye, my baby, don't cry
I have dreamt of a place for you and I
I'm down to just one thing
Than to have never lain beside at all
It's just a matter of time
The old familiar sting
Mmm what did you say
She collapsed with a flag in her hand
If I'm not made for you then why does my heart tell me that I am
But it's just a temporary high, 'cause when I close my eyes
Human in all our ways and all of pain
Driving down the pitch black road
Spend Sundays asleep I'm just another dreamer
Our minds are empty, like we're too young
The stickler is you've played not one beat wrong
Although my grandma used to say, he used to say
And if it makes you less sad
The pleasure that my sadness brings,
To have loved and to lose it
Where do you think you're goin'
Drive all night to hold you tight 
But I trtrtry to be good 
Now I'm wondering if things will ever change, yeah
And the hours that ran wild
Sometimes betrayal can make you happy
I wish I could remember
Just a little bit of your heart just a little bit, just a little bit of your heart,
This flesh and bone
And I'm not my body 
West Memphis please, I'm begging you to stop praying for me
And I'm sure the view from heaven
Had a second alone with a chance let pass
I know you care
Instead I've found no meaning
Who knows, maybe the plans will change
Knocking on that door that says,
Please don't walk away, Please don't leave
As strong as what I believe
And here I am in this uniformish pantsuit sort of thing
Now if you don't mind
'Cause there's a Continental Trailways leaving local bus tonight, good evening
This morning we drove out of town
I really don't know clouds, at all
She breaks down and cries to her husband
"Clever cover story" awards go to you
From our own separate sides
And the money was just rolling in
Of an endless static sea
If I have to switch the lights off, I wanna switch them off with you
And who's gonna be your woman
Then you have got to set them free
I needed you, you didn't need me
And that's when daddy went to California with his CD
That played when you died
This is the end
And you don't miss a thing
'Cause overnight that lake had turned as thick as butter
Out of time and I can't breathe
You're not sorry, no, no
Pretty Mary K walks along the dock
Angels will call on me and take me to my home 
I listened to his song
And I hope you are the one I share my life with
I need someone different
It's no sacrifice at all
But you had me and I loved it
But I'm gonna make it right
Where we all change
The concrete looks too thin to break my fall
This story is old
And kiss your face just so you know
Baby, I just need one good one to stay
Saw you crashing round the bay
Why didn't she tell me, and where do I go tonight
To cheat ourselves at solitaire
The first cut is the deepest
So mother, I thank you and I thank you for everything you've done
Keep you cool when it's still alive
It'll make your life a lie
Well I said anywhere, anywhere, anywhere I lay my head, boys
I bit a flashing lure
Sleeping well, no bad dreams
You're the reason why I'm closed
One more night, that was a good one
But I'm busy mending broken
All this independent strain 
Tonight, I can't hold a pen
You said that I was an asshole and I'd pay the price
My heart made the sound of snow falling from eaves
Where the jokes are cold
I've done enough
You know what you gotta do
Dreams, dreams
Sweetheart, got so much freedom
I wanna' scream let the blood flow that keeps me alive
When you feel embarrassed
The darkness that has been
And are you on the list
We, too, feel alone
God visits all lost souls
And if you look at your reflection
Fire and rain, now
But it hurts when you disapprove all along
The thickets thick with mold
Through a telescope because I'm so high 
The mayor's machines are there cleaning the pavement
I'm spending my time
That they can no longer feel love or sex appeal
In search of destination
But here it comes again
The minutes drag, then there's a world between us,
Blast those yellow reds to hell
We're nowhere near prepared, there's no way of knowing
And we sing this morning that wonderful and grand old message
I found the love, that I knew I had missed
Call, break it off
Guilt kicks in and I start to see
What are you needing
This is the last song I will ever sing
Do I get the gold chariot
There's so much I need to say to you
Pushing my face in the memory of you again
Has a mind to kill the other
It's just a little sacrifice
These days are all gone now
How could we not talk about family when family's all that we got
I will always feel free
Ain't life great
While I was waiting
The subtle grace of gravity, the heavy weight of stone
No one's gonna fool around with us, no one's gonna fool around with us
And if you have something to say
Then you could see the view
Things that made me love you so much then
Gets in his car and drives away,
And to me it sounded like you meant forever, ever
Now all those feelings
Lighten up when we can't breathe
I've been trying my best to get along
Shouldn't let you conquer me completely
To bring you back again
Well, Jesus Christ, I'm alone again
I really, really, really need a raincoat,
You know that darkness always turns into light
You like your girls insane
And still I have the pain I have to carry
The scarf off of your clothesline
No fairytale
Did you know I kept all of your pictures
But I know, Dad, the ice is getting thin
Phony people come to pray
It took everything you had, but you finally broke my
Then the stalks begin to sway
She always looks good in red
Your tears are cheap
To tear the world in two
Maybe it's change
Living, inside you play
Can't get out of bed
Never cared for what they do, no
And you hold me
I can move on with you around
Oh that reminds me of when we were free
Found a way to understand the time you're burning
U kept insistin' and resistin' that you would not fall again
When you're waiting
Twentyone is such a good number
If you want to show me
My heart
I need some sleep, I can't go on like this
And I'll be gettin' out as soon as I can fly
When you left that night
All those words came undone and now I'm not the only one
If you didn't wanna talk to me outside your concert
So I'll sing this song for every word that's come out wrong
From the sheer weight of my shame
I guess the love we once had
You know that I am home
Faded from the winter
Your lips, your eyelashes, your skin 
And on with my life
it's useless to sleep, 
Still looking at the road we never drove on
Their hearts say 'move along'
Of rain falling on the ground
Ya me he olvidado
The shades and shadows undulate in my perception
Even if the sun crashes into us I won't let go, I won't let go
Rebel mad and broken
The only way to let this go
And daddy, how are you today 
I never put wet towels on the floor anymore 'cause
I've locked up tightly I must say I've had my doubts
"I'll die alone"
All sorts of junk in the unattached spare room
Shaking hands with other men
Except we keep coming back to this meaning that I lack,
Papa was a rodeo 
Too many times
I was playing back a thousand memories, baby
Together we cry
And seeing mine warning me
Working on the record seems pointless now
It's all your fault, momma
I can't take my eyes
There's a song that's inside of my soul
In the city or the suburbs of this town
Faith has been broken and tears must be cried
When I realize I was acting all wrong
The sweetness
Like in a dream
Is easier to touch
Lighting up the stage trying to get a deal
From the madness of the governments
Goodbye You're my sweetest
I need to get away from ya
A black eyed dog
Come let away, that's what they all do
You are the everliving ghost of what once was
You can't love too much one part of it
To our love a valentine of blood
All you needed was time
As life carries on and on, and on, and on
And in the night we'll wish this never ends
All the promises I made that I wouldn't break
With every round
It is not these hiding places that have kept us innocent
Out in the streets just tempting fate
You see mom, I'm a good little boy Good little boy
I was the one you always dreamed of
On the streets of Philadelphia
If you take him back 
Papa was a rollin' stone, momma developed a habit
Got dressed drove the state line
There was little we could say 
These children are so hard to raise good
I sought after, after reasons to stay
And a light that just won't shine in the darkness
Your moon in a bella luna and
Some of them psychic, you better watch what you think
Mummy's in the doorway 
And we're moving slow, our hearts beat so fast
When you've no one left to hurt
But a brokendown jalopy of a man I left behind
You don't care a bit
While it is light
I still get lost in your eyes
And the last thing she said was "I love you, mom"
I've got no expectations 
You would, you would if this was a movie
It's half biology and half corrective surgery gone wrong
Something vague that we're not seeing
Lazy ooh lazy
You burrowed like a summer tic
Or hate myself for letting it pass by
Like the one that fell that I am now underneath
I won't regret saying this
The man needs a maid
Lost myself again and I feel unsafe
U keep insisting when you know our love is out the door
As if you have a choice
We're backdrifters
Blankly telling me, "Have a nice life"
Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot 'em
Still with hearts beating
No sleep tonight
Maybe I'm to blame for his short bitter fucked up life
'Cause I remember it clearly
So for now I'll keep believing your words
I just want to listen to your beating heart
When you're ready, it waits for us
I hold you and your eyes fall down
Just 'cause you're in the ghetto doesn't mean you can't grow
It's always been "Wait and see"; a happy day, and then you pay, and feel like shit the morning after
He said Dolores I live in fear
Of giving up control
Every time I close mine
Do you think about your sons
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead, yeah
You taught me about your past thinking your future was me
Like those who curse their luck in too many places 
My body is aching
Yesterday was cold
I was lost, I was lost
I'm listening, but there's no sound
They're trying to ignore us
To silent mountains, tall and proud
You're a bedtime story
All my life
And I just wanna show you
Oh, I'll keep taking punches until their will grows tired
It doesn't matter if
As the dawn began to break, I had to surrender
Why you gotta be
To make it easy, you lie
How does it feel 
But mama, he'll never touch us again
Apparently nothing at all
Stephanie says Stephanie says when answering the phone answering the phone
But I just see the memories
But something told me that it wouldn't last
He was made to believe
I know I wasn't perfect, but I kept trying
Just wishing so bad that it held some kind of truth
Living your end
And I wish that we could see if we could be something
And that I've been dying yeah
Sometimes in the morning I am petrified and can't move
The only one who's got enough of me to break my heart
And hope someone will save me this time
'Member how I asked you why are you so mean
To make this bold decision
I gotta keep it strong before the pain turns into fear
For that fearful leap into the dark
Outside
And I can see it now you're married and your wife is with a child
For terrible things I did to her in her dreams
Pack your things and go, oh
Losing the reasons why
To make me feel my life is heading somewhere
I remember the time you sat and told me
Sure i'm gonna say 
How do we call this love
Heartbreak did this
When things start splitting at the seams and now
Still upon the shelf 
It's okay  this'll help, inside
Till I learn to leave the past behind 
She hadn't been a virgin and he hadn't been a god
And how safe it is to feel safe
I'm finally numb, so please
How can I have feeling when I don't know if it's a feeling
So denied, so I lied
If you let me in
When you're dreaming with a broken heart 
Running away from the streets we knew
Through the morning, through the night
What I want from us, is empty our minds
On the overpass tonight, I bet we laugh
And wild is the wind, wild is the wind
Danny is lonely, 'cause Mary's in India now;
And now you're sitting on that train
How does he feel 
Mama please, let me back inside
Just like the tree that fell, I heard it
Both singing along, yeah arm in arm
Let's just paint you a pretty face
Never to see your face again;
You said you hate my suffering and you understood,
And I'll burn
So this is my cassette I'm sending you, I hope you hear it
In a fleabag apartment
Every restless night
I've walked too long in this lonely lane
Holding on until the end 
Giving you all my heart
I am undone
I have a feeling you don't have the words
Even in your sleep
Hoping that you think of me too
We would do anything to end what you're going through
To take you by the hand
Fade away and end up nothing at all
With these waves crashing over my head
There's so many times I've let you down
All this talk of getting old
"I've got your mind," I said, she said, "I've your voice"
'Cause if I could see your face once more
Always felt I was outside, looking in on you
And I wanna fight
So bright on cinder gray and spray paint
Only I can save the lives that blink within this canyon
I don't think I can close my eyes
Pick your favorite shade of black
You just hope that someone sits with you
No matter what you do
Cannot hide the stolid stench of death
And hope that you won't let go
Any thought of anywhere but home, my home
I'm sick of looking for those heroes in the sky
I'm keeping an eye on the world
And then the Welshman from India, who came here to stay
I am out of my mind
Agitated at the fault line
When those tears start rolling you'll be back
And when I left your place
I guess a guess is the best I'll do
Wild flowers on a cross by the road
So why'd you fill my sorrow
If all along the fault is up for grabs, 
To my right cross Seven Seas
And I lied, I should have kissed you
Goodbye
Couldn't wait for Saturday
There's a look in the faces tonight that's untrustable as the hope that you'll never return in a while
And on your face,
Once again I do I turn to you
Further along, we just may
A space in town
How did thee fare what have thee seen
Feathers fall around you
You know that I would give you my hand
It made me learn to hate you
All these tears that I cried
Speaking words of wisdom, I want you to let it be
Together we always pull through always pull through
As they steal your best memories away
Whose shadow paces the floor
It takes strength to live this way
I keep my window open
I'll think of days when there was something to believe
That I clutched you in my arms
I think
Want you by my side
Suitcase for way too long
Under a lilac tree
And I guess that's what it takes
There's people making lonely
Sing me that song
Meet me on the other side
China white, my bride tonight
Some might laugh
No one's laughing at God when they've lost all they've got and they don't know what for
But time doesn't matter to them yet
These are the words I can't erase
I'm never alone; I'm alone all the time
Never feeling love like that
I'm not sure, and never was if this will
And it feels so real
Will you take what's left
I'm begging you to fly this for me
She's all I need
The wheels of a car
And keep trying to find your way out of that maze of memories
Leavin' home ain't necessarily the only way
And I can't stop this ache
I would fall down, down on my knees,
As you're walking away
Pick up all the pieces, fight to hold on
That you're not dead, you're sleeping
But we're done if we're undone 
I wish that without me your heart would break
Or how I am worn to the bone
I wanna see you put your hands hand together
Still with eyes meeting
Well, I'm tired of being down, I got no fight
Or break down the door to your heart
And it's cold in my apartment
Tell the whole world I've gone insane
Why can't I dream, why can't I dream
But I am working, oh, so hard
Feeling him gnawing my heart away hungrily
Oh, he'll, he'll never return it When you come back, we'll have to make new love
Well then tell me 'bout everything
She was so sick of believing the lies and trying to hide
These things can be scary, not always what you want
I'm no brokenhearted girl
And now I sing
Something makes me brake
Another needy hole
Am I ever on your mind 
You'll follow me back with the sun in your eyes
Oh, God, please
My hand between your knees, you turn from me
Nothin' always comes to mind
I don't know what I've done
You make me think of someone wonderful
And I don't understand all the things you've seen 
Alone like I'm supposed to be
Where the sailors' sorry racket falls for maidenhead
This is goodbye
Joey has loved but never shown her tears
What do I do to make you love me
But you're in every song I know
And I watched my friends go off to war
In my happy home I barely breathe
I forgot the part
Stand here beside me baby in the crumbling walls
I will still hear you
But I need your hands on me now,
How can you know it when you don't even try
Before I can kiss you
We spend our days in heaven
Love goes cold in the shades of doubt
All young men must go
I've heard what they say, but I'm not here for trouble
I'll know that nothing
Blood flowers in the kitchen
Coffee black and egg white
All my life I've waited
Why, Why did you go, why did you go away
As I walked out on the ledge
I will never sleep again I, I, I'll never even close my
And I've been calling
And like the stars we burn away
And I will walk on water
Can return the love that was stolen
You must risk something that matters
I've been dying inside
Yes, My eyes are wet with clarity
It was January, 
I'm in heaven, I'm a god
I can't take it like the other girls
So let's not pretend like you're alone tonight
And they all think I'm crazy but to me it's perfect sense
Did we imagine half of it
Can we dance upon the tables again
We're counting backwards
I run as fast as I can run
But I'd let them in, I'd let them in
Even if you were a million miles away
Don't you let it pass you by it's so beautiful it makes you want to cry
And when it's done oning it's just on some more
And it's true I always wanted love to be
It was half a second in, I was halfway down
I got a ribbon of green on my guitar
You may tire of me as our December sun is setting
Days when I can still feel alive
Into soon the sky
And the eyes in his head
In a dark and distant, dark and distant place
But for tonight I'll stay here with you
And now I cry in the middle of the night for the same damn thing
Don't you remember me, babe
The choice was mine, I didn't think enough
My baby lives in shades of blue
And if they ever become too clear
Says she's here to waste time I said "That's fine"
The words that were spoken
Taking heartache with hard work
Ambition cuts us down
You're callin' me back, when the money is gone
I ain't the dish rag, to come clean up, all the shit that ya dish out
And I've been facing this alone
As you turned around to leave
When I look in her eyes
Just to hurt you once again
Hold every memory as you go
We're afraid of everyone
Spread your wings and I know
He's got the fire and he walks with fame
But my love, don't fade away
'Cause we lost it all, nothing lasts forever
Never ending kind of run around
She's fallen from grace, she's all over the place Yeah yeah
Pangs of silence
If words are dead
Wenn ich in deinen Armen liege
And we're out here in space
And have a dream I'm falling down
In the breath between the markers
This is me pretending
Sometimes everything is wrong
To face what I've done and do my time
In the night we fight, I fled you're right
You make me feel like I am clean again
You'll show them your progress
A new improved version of me
I know you're gone, you said you're gone, but I can still feel you here
I get that same old feeling
Mmm, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You needn't be, oh you needn't be
I wish that I had known in that first minute we met
The ones who couldn't take it
I'm half my mother's daughter
People keep pushing me though, no reception on the phone
Is she someone I don't know at all Is she someone I betrayed
Dance me through the curtains that our kisses have outworn
Nothing much happened all the same
'Cause I forgot you left me behind to remind me of you
Yes, I do believe I have found mine
When I was checking vitals I suggested a smile
Black eyed dog he called at my door
The boy that you loved
And cause each other pain
And dig up my bones from the clay
She was lying on the floor and counting stretch marks
I wish that I could cry
Mine, mine, you were always mine
Turn the land into waste
But with brand new broken fortunes
For trying hard to become whatever they are
I forget that I hate so many things
'Cause I'm not your princess, this ain't our fairytale
You may hate me,
And I feel you forget me
Lying here, lie
Hold me now,
You coup your love until we kiss
There's nothing, there's nothing, there's nothing
Now I gotta wash my mouth out with soap
The sky's cruel torch on aching autobahn
I come home
And part of me died
But children lived in Levittown
Hey Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka, you dare me to drive
So many tears I was wasting, oh, oh
Don't help me sleep
Back then I couldn't do the things that I can do now
Everything, everything, here is gone
And I now know that life's design moves around white lies, white lies, white lies, white lies
'Cause it was you that drove me to
What's the point when my dreams are infected 
Cette chanson, Les Feuilles mortes,
You have been the one for me
Back down to earth, back down to earth
Than a place we've been before
In fact, I am told that a lot
Your firm commitments tangible again
Blasting white noise in the convenience store parking lot
A snowflake falls in may
See more of your friends than you do your kids
My happiness depends on you
Down a manhole in that bad way
But now he lives inside someone he does not recognize 
I hardly recognized the girl you are today
Hey now, don't forget that change will save you
Tides will bring me back to you
Should I be feeling guilty or let the judges frown
I saw her face on the back of the door
Prepare a list for what you need
It�s old news, ah
Just watching the trees and the leaves as they fall
And everyone call it
And ur tryin' to come back home
When you start doubting me
There's no going back
And we'll pretend that it meant something so much more
And all that I could do was touch her long blonde hair 
Please don't blame me for trying,
Besides some comment on the weather
I can't mend
The smoke sank into my skin
I haven't had enough, it's probably because when you're young
If I have a daughter, guess what I'mma call her I'mma name her Bonnie
When I loved you so
Glad I'm not a girl in this place, they'll be here till dawn
Telling me hold on
But tonight you're on my mind so you'll never know
It's gonna set the sails, and send me back to you
How's the view there
Won't somebody come take me home
You'll get through, you'll be home, you'll be home
You touch me there because you know how much I like that
Maybe one day we'll wake up and this will all just be a dream
Well, let me show you how it affects our whole community
Does he let you tell him all your favorite parts
By the way my hands were shaking
It was just the other night
You break me gently
Ineffabilis totus desiderabilis
You love 'em 'til they can't recall
To make you feel you're with someone who deserves to be with you
To keep my head
And when it rains it fucking pours, but I think I like it
On a rusty side
I was listening to the radio and wondering what you're dreaming
Is it destruction that you require to feel
Let your backbone slide
And out of my mind
I saw you waiting by the roadside
Lives in a dream
He left a dollar under my sheet
And try to stay outta hell
And I thought hell if it's over
I wish I knew you were safely at home
Nobody cares
Oh, now, baby, don't cry
And now all your love is wasted
Gather up the lost and the sold Don't haunt me
And rejoice despite the fact this world will tear you to shreds
While looking through your old box of notes
So I'll check the weather wherever you are
The life of the party, you're showing off again
Without pain, without fear
I think I'd marry you
Regress into a dream
I'm running fast, as fast as I can, to get you back, just to get you back again
How can a loser ever win
Guess she gave you things I didn't give to you
I knew a lovely girl with such pretty pride,
I know things will get better
The year of , broke my bones and skull
It's getting to the point where I can be myself again
When you say that it's gonna be
But she didn't ever hold me
I loved you
And all the things that I wish I had not said
And never as bright
It's okay to be angry and never let go
Ev'ry morning brings a new day
'Cause she will love you more than I could
See you some time, ask me if I care
I still find pieces of your presence here
Wir haben irgendwann wieder jede Menge Zeit
Who fall behind
I wish I could tell you a lie
To know me as hardly golden
No, I don't think you do
And I carry the weight of the world on my shoulders
She will feed you tomatoes and radio wires
And the piano's this melancholy soundtrack to her smile
The pieces don't fit anymore
To soak up the hot piss that comes from your mouth
Sometimes when you're doing simple things around the house
It hurts and I can't remember sunlight
You never got there even though you say you will
It's just a mumbled sentence to a passing acquaintance
All the times we spilled our coffees
I remember the sound
I guess that's love I can't pretend
It scares you witless
So I could be your friend again
Goddamn, I am such a jerk, I can't do anything
That's if the choice were mine to make
For though they may be parted there is still a chance that they will see,
This man comes to me
I am falling
I feel better when I hear them say that
Ooh Laura, you're more than a superstar
But we shared a moment that will last till the end
A little but I'm hoping it might kick start
I miss those blue eyes
I'll sing along
My mother said just keep your head
Look cross the land, shake this land
Well sir, if you only knew, what the answer is worth
And that's the end and that's the start of it
You're sadly, crumbling
Come join us in a prayer
No one here to help to see me through
Goodbye, my hopeless dream
Stop breathing for me you said
You found your little game to play
I never trust my feelings
But we sure make it feel like we're together
But never meant to last, the clowns that passed
Forget this life
If you're scared and it shows 'cause you're watching them grow
"It's the atrocities of history
I'm proud to be the one you hold when the shakes begin
Free from the life that you knew
Tell me everything that happened
And the flowers fell out of her hand
With my mother and in her power
I remember you well in the Chelsea Hotel
'Cause she was touching her face
And I fell apart
My jealous eyes, saw all of it
And we hoped that we could be what we knew
You didn't phone when you said you would
I think I like it
I still try to find my place
So tonight to celebrate I will
I would do anything to bring him back to you
It's easier to believe in this sweet madness
Across your carpet of stars
Here I go, scream my lungs out, try to get to you
As you stand, under the bar lights
Where flowers grew and the sun shone still
I've been erased from the picture
Stop crying your heart out
While the angels sang a whiskey lullaby
You're the breath that blows these cool winds 'round
But he won't call
I'm alive but I'm losing all my drive
Better be right
Yeah, you were right about me
If you think you're gonna faint, go out in the hallway
Something about insurance policies
The receding part of his twenties
Though my skies are turning grey grey
And you can't say a word 'cause I leap down your throat
Every place I go, I'll think of you
I'll think of England this time
I'd rather breathe than drown in sorrow
But I was wrong
But I'm standing on my feet
The new day's begun
Stay another minute
He'll be back sometime
It will light our way forever
It's gonna be alright
Now you say you love me
Go on and hurt me then we'll let it drop
The scars inside have made you beautiful
Are you feeling, feeling okay baby
Whatever may come
Staying in my play pretend
I still see that look in your eyes
As your skin starts a scratching
I can't remember all the times I tried to tell myself
And its falling down,
Touching my heart, my soul
What have I done 
What if all the world you think you know
Everything is wonderful now
But she can't let it go
I don't think so
Beyond your wildest dreams
If I say shut your eyes
Did they follow you to town
The worst of starts, the mercy part, the phone
When she sits on your lap
Like the sick and the dying
Echo through the house
Wait for the crying
Center of the storm
Me and the dragon can chase all the pain away
Every touch is sacred when they leave the room
He wasn't fighting anybody when he was on a shelf
A family in crisis that only grows older
Love is good and love is kind
There must be an angel
And make sure you're alright
That is our life 
That is what I knew
Sometimes I feel so sad
I keep on trying, I should just let it go
First there was the one who challenged
I have been thinking, what, with my final brain cell
Your skull outside that wall 
I looked at the Rubens and Rembrandts
And if ever you come near 
I gave all I could, but it left me so sore 
Of all the things I've believed in
What's a game of chance to you to him is one of real skill
That things are reminding me of you
And do I try to change him
You gave me everything you had, oh you gave me light
To get back what was taken away
But it seems there's always somethin' right there to remind me
Again and again this feelin'
All you maggots
His father was a drinker
Well I guess I should've listened
Touch if you need to, but I can't stay to hold you
By sharing these things
There's a hole inside my boat But no one hears
That brought my heart to a stop
And the vibe is feeling strong
So when your new eyes meet mine
I don't need this, I can handle it
I'm fallin down
But you have your heart
Oh, my heart, it breaks
I really need a raincoat
And the soul underneath
Mum says me and you are the same from the start
'Cause we were all so young and foolish, now we are mature
But if you wanna show, then just let me know
But once that's done, man, there's nothing to do
Will you hold on to me
So save your breath I will not hear
But, you're chasin' the ghost of a good thing
And I brought home that flag
As soon as the storm is over 
So take me cross the river wide
I don't want to be old and feel afraid
I've got no claim on you now
They got refrigerators full of blood
To the four corners of the world
Until it all just falls apart
Love or not I've always got
Oh my friend, what time is this
The way I loved the way you moved
I think I have had my fill Don't hurt me
And you will be changed and everything
There is a view that reaches far 
It's the love that came undone between us
But fear's the only thing I saw
You don't even know the meaning of the words I'm sorry
But the way you taught me to just let it all go back
Everything happens today
Because you don't want to know,
Turned around squinting
Lord we married young and stayed where we came from
What is love but the strangest of feelings
'Cause I want you to stay with me
So sad it ends as it began
I love 'most everything that you bring to this offering
But Instead, I keep on having these dreams
That was then, now it's the end,
When the gusts came around to blow me down
Close my eyes
I thought I could live in your arms
It's funny how we feel so much but we cannot say a word
It's called Breakup
And you looked as sincere as a dog
Stop this pain tonight
I don't think it's happening, this is what I say
It's summertime and I can understand if you still feel sad
Last night something pretty bad happened
Ada, don't stay in the lake too long
For someone else to be called and called by
You handle your own when you become a man
Every kiss that you could ever mean
It's a feeling that you cannot miss 
Into dust
Wedded by the planet force
I've grown tired of holding this pose
Little bird, oh don't you know
Stiff, and pissed, and lost, and loose
I got a life to lead
I sometimes wish I'd stayed inside
We can turn this ditch into a well
I hope it has a heart attack
Drive until you lose the road
No one's left to stop you
Years go by and I'm here still waiting
As I read Rosemary's letter
That I left unspoken
She'd be white gold
I heard a whisper on my shoulder
I belong to here where noone cares and noone loves
I got a joke I've been dying to tell you
There's a heart I love
I will rise now, and go about the city in the streets, and in broad ways I will seek him whom my soul loveth
Pacing nervous 'cross the floor of her bedroom
I guess I had lost sight
To get it together to sing one song
He tossed some tatty compliment your way
Ooh yeah
As I walk on
Sit and listen, sit and listen
The garbage men were emptying the dumpsters,
But in time you see things clear and stark
I'll give you one underdog then you gotta swing by yourself
Should have been a rock star
Someone like you, someone like me
I lost your presents underneath the bridge
And in that deafening pleasure, I thought I heard someone say
Don't try to fight the storm; you'll tumble overboard
A collage behind my eyes
Some shattering find for this candor to die
And as I look around me
It's the worst kind of pain I've known
Running down corridors, through automatic doors
That as the sun rises on Mary, it sets on him
One more night, the end should be a good one
It was almost too bright to see 
There's a chance that I'll start to wonder if this was the thing to do
Oh grandmother 
I wanna get you back again
From all around the world
And love's a raven when it flies
I guess you know by now
Or maybe to the last, but I'm still not sure
Don't feel bad
I'm not bitter anyway
So mother, I thank you thank you
And I'm thinkin'
You are calm and reposed
I could never see tomorrow
So many men stronger than me have thrown their backs out trying to lift it, yeah
Yeah, yeah, ah
You're the only one that knows
Laughing loud on a carnival ride, yeah
A punch in the stomach makes sons into daughters
Because you were not there
It makes no difference, I'm glad that you came
This song has been brought to you by a falling bomb
oh how they hurt, my days without you
I met a girl on the square
I know I'm praying for much too much
You are always gonna be my love
I never knew 'til I met you
He's got the fire and he talks with fame
You're there through my wasted nights
And everything I held so dear
I'm here to stay
Someone's always comin' around here trailing some new kill
And I picture this corpse on the M hearse
What made us think that we were wise and we'd never compromise
A place that I can share with you
Goddamn
Over worlds, fly but won't tire
Before too long you'll be a memory
Gotta be honest
With honest conviction
And the hunger returns
So I'll drive so fucking far away that I never cross your mind
I'm tired, I'm tired
And you're scared to accept
To fill that hole
I go to school and I run and play
But now she feels no sorrow
Our hair is in the garden
We could be daytime drunks if we wanted
Hey Lucy, I remember your name
Did I drive you away
Only in dreams, we see what it means
So if you call
The one
And I went to my room
And as the nail sunk in the cloud
Your words to me just a whisper
Came to this world by caesarian section
We walk through the ash
And I don't know where you went when you left me but
Clay in my hands
All of the things we want each other to be
May no man's touch ever tame
Gotta keep myself calm but the truth is you're gone
We walk right into the strife 
That in time things must change
And I'm gonna try to hold it all in
Cause to trust is to depend
At the blasphemy in my old jangly walk
If I cross your mind, just know I'm yours,
To these lives that we are livin'
And I drove all night to find my child
And that's all I need
Let the whole world fall away
Even though she only has one or two
Winter blues, no love for you
There's a bluebird at my window 
If the chip off your shoulder should fall to your chest
To remove the stain of my love
And the ground below grew colder
Little soldier, little insect
Shoulda known you'd bring me heartache
Looking at you sleeping
How can I go forward when I don't know which way to turn
But our love can stretch farther than the eye can see
Bad skin
Here comes goodbye, here comes the last time
Only call all his wild works your own
While whispering those words
And it's also true that I lost the map
Let's spend the night in Jimmy Choo's
I felt people move around me
Was an empty sea, until a silver fox
'Cause she's got nowhere to go
And will when it gets compromised
I asked somebody what the time is
And we both of us knew how the end always is
I'll be a brand new day
But if you only knew me
If only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way
I've still got me to cross your bridge in this storm
You're on the other side
Tell me, help me mend my, my broken heart
And you see someone that you physically despise
Oh, come on oh, yea yea
Hear the goose cussing at me over her eggs
I remember when, it was 'together till the end'
And once again that rising sun is a droppin' on down
Keep yo' hands in the air, 'cause we gon' take you there
And all I wanna do is ride bikes with you and stay up late and maybe spoon
Be dead on the ground 
To hide these tears I hope you'll never see
Fluorescent lighting sets the scene
Just another soldier on the road to nowhere 
Most people were overjoyed
And that damage was done
But I, must carry on
I saw your life once
Brush the snow from your hair
In the window of the tallest tower call
Than let life go
But I won't be home again
They sing in the rain
What a mess I leave
My head is lead, I don't ever want to go to bed
It's gonna be alright I wish I could save you
Should have been a father
And I guess we're really over, so come over, I'm not over it
Baby, can't you see if there is such a thing
Into the haze of time recalled
Sleight of hand
I was wishing you could tell me your fears
And I fall, I fall, I falter
Electronic surgical words
But damn Sam I love a woman that rains
Someday burns down
With a desolated view
Is to hold her when I'm not around
They don't mean shit compared to all your drugs
You couldn't hate enough to love
Still it seems if you can't trust
Before life removed all the innocence
Knows he's gone
I'm gonna be your friend
Ooh This is the last dance, this is the last dance
And we knew what time we had
Just slipped through my fingers
I've got desperate desires and unadmirable plans
He put that bottle to his head and pulled the trigger
There's a little child
And I breath the air
It was long ago and far away but it never disappears
The screamin' tires, the bustin' glass
The seasons have changed 
We never get so close as when the sunward flight begins
And all of this and her dark hair, oh Lord
I'm fallin
And one for the dreamers
And the building collapsed, so we'll shop one, we'll shop one for something
I am out here looking for you
Her hair was pressed against her face
Love is all, from what I've heard, but my heart's learned to kill
For you to race me home when it was nearly getting dark
Valium and cherry wine
Didn't let anyone get in 
Go ahead and destroy this
Still and all it would be hours
The dog days are over
Stars in your eyes
You can stop the world, but you won't change me
She looks right at you and bolts
She's keeping count on her hand
So this is where you are, and this is where I've been
Who doesn't lie
I remember watching as you slowly loaded up the loom
So just give it one more try to a lullaby
When I first got here
In the car, do you remember
In silence
Talks about one day we having a place of our own
Just let them roll
And I get lonely, but I ain't that lonely yet
Group of kids, lines of cars
I wanted you, you didn't want me
With all of this I feel now
Ah Where you come from
Living a hell
And the sad act like lepers
Car is parked, bags are packed, but what kind of heart doesn't look back
From my eyes, tonight I wanna cry
Basically, I wish that you loved me
Can he tell that I can't breathe
What do I do when lightning strikes me
With your heart and your clothes when I find
Moonlight on the soft brown earth
Well, there's only one girl that I will ever love
When everything is lonely, I can be my own best friend
Watching you run
Is there only pain and hatred and misery
Lift my hands, my eyes are still
One love, NERD
One last time, I need to be the one who takes you home
I'll bet he gets the nerve to walk the floor
And it's been ten days without you in my reach,
It's a song to say goodbye
We don't need much of anything
But sometimes I still just can't
To the grave if I must
You're the yellow bird that I've been waiting for
Its empty and cold without you here, too many people to ache over
Now there's a hole in the head of this wounded liar
I've been waiting all this time,
No one laughs at God when the cops knock on their door
But you can pray
Our love could be so divine
That splashes on a stone 
And you don't hear a single floor board creak
But not for you, my love
They're in the wrong place, tryin' to make it right
Send it in a letter, make yourself feel better
But I'll wait
Well I have been happy the past couple days
It's been a long, long time, how are you
You turned to me and said,
Make a raft of our bodies
Or maybe you're in disguise
I will sleep another day 
Fall in between the crack of the bed and the wall
You were a friend of mine I let you spend the night 
A zombie hides my face
Hissing from the road
We should go into town and spend some money
No hope or love or glory
Since I gots to be here can't wait to begin
Between the iron gates of fate, the seeds of time were sown
You never sent me no letters
That the flame we had is burning out
And then I fell apart but got back up again
It's a damn cold night
You say you wanted a solution
It echoed though the park last night, he wasn't our son
I hung around there wasting my time
But if you don't change your situation
Gripping tight the phone in her hand
When I sneak to your bed
I was just calling to see how you were doing, you sounded really uptight last night, it made me a little nervous, and well it made me nervous that it sounded like you were nervous, too
All I need is a little love in the dark
Bad day, looking for the great escape
But sad songs and waltzes aren't selling this year
Rain on the brain
See her come down, through the clouds
What'sa matter with you
Don't you know she's got a baby
I have been here many times before
You're not worth a thing
And move to the back of my mind
Everybody's busy waiting for the goahead,
'Cause you wanna say hello to everybody
I need a good luck charm to give me good luck
As it promises me joy
She says she's tired of life
And warred with yourself
So many nights I cried myself to sleep
I promise not to blow the address again
It's nothing to you
Well I know I make you cry
Sometimes it seems like lately I just don't know
Do you ever get lonely
A band of them were in your apartment
The knocked up girls, well they've all got their share
Majestic and lonely, magnetic, raw;
I'm not gonna break down and call you up when my heart cries out for you
But up till now I've always been afraid
About myself, I'm sorry
Back where I'd love to be, oh yeah 
You know no one true, till it's over
So just close your eyes Close your eyes
I'm well aware of how it aches
My lover came to me and we'd lay
And he kissed me till the morning light
This sick, strange darkness
You let me down, I said it
And your mother loves your father
Just set out with no map and turn off your torch
Deliver me unto my fate
That season left the world and then returned
Nothing to lose
And finally drank away her memory
Well, in case you failed to notice
And that white dress she's wearing
And a couple of kids of course, they don't mean anything
The only failed experiments
Like I did before
I have no regrets for the past is behind me
You appear just like a dream to me
I give you my hand 
Throw me in a landfill
I don't wanna hold you
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead, yeah
And here I am softer than a shower
Come and take a walk on the wild side
People are people and sometimes we change our minds
And offer you my hand
It's so hard to go into the city
If I was to walk away
I think of all the friends I've known
But it was vile and it was cheap
Long ago, wrapped in sheets warm and wet
I'm not sticking 'round
And the ribbon was tied
So we run back, scrambling for cover
The storm is coming but I don't mind
the same song 
And the critics are severe
I'm thinking hard about all the things I've been dreaming
People digging through rubble for things they can resell
So we got nothing to lose
With you as something new
But standing there with all of my possessions piled higher than a house
Swing wide your crane and run me through
Will run through my fingers, tears,
It looks like some kaleidoscopic breathing exercise
Drop your seeds there, let them go
With words you used to say 
Why some stay, others go
As if there was trouble ahead and you knew it
For  hours
I'll use your light to guide the way
If I close my eyes
With clouds between their knees
Somewhere lost in emptiness 
Blue as seas, running to them
But I just can't sleep on this tonight
Return to me my love
Acoustic guitar, how lovely you are
For yourself, 'cause I can't always be around"
In each seething bacterium
But it's alright, why don't you tell me my friend
Now help me to carry the fire
Born and raised for the job, someone always does
Stay up all night with the stars
That I need you here now
And tell everyone you were a good wife
Sometimes, sometimes
Blowing smoke from my cigarette
Instrumental
You have made yours worth mine
My world was turned to blue so thin
Through troubled eyes
I'll sellotape them up
But I remember everything
I go down to the river filled with regret
Something ain't right
Often I sit down and think of you for a while
I was her cruelhearted man
And if I, oh if I'd only waited
I remember, I remember, I remember
Started making his way past two in the morning
Wait until my clothes cling to my frame
And the darkness has won
With a book in each hand
I've seen a man killed by his best friend
Oh, oh yeah
Still our hands match
He knows the price that he's paid
Never going by your door
Oh, I'm in pieces, it's tearing me up, but I know
And watered by the deeds of those who know and who are known
If you don't shoot it how am I supposed to hold it
I know I'm not deserving of your trust from you right now,
You'll never hear the message I give 
What is love and what is hate, the calculations error
Laughin' and kissin'
I heard you're coming back to life just for the fourth
All the times way me
I really need a raincoat,
Carefree along the shore
Oh, all of this and her dark hair
Through the cleansing fire
As your best friend
You told me that you wanted this
I'll run, run, run
Red wine and sleeping pills
I need you like a baby when I hold you,
But baby we're in Sweden, how did you get to Sweden
Outside my house on Daisy Lane
From a dimension torn free
And my mouth's to dry to rage
As far as I know you're still alive
Well something's lost but something's gained
Forget past indiscretions and stolen possessions 
It was all an illusion
Probably end up a stranger and crazy
Breadcrumbs lost under the snow
I'd give you all I got
Even if saving you sends me to heaven
The pieces of my heart are missing you
And time as it stands won't be held in my hands
That the ice was getting thinner 
Until I see the ground
And still I push my barrow all the day
And I'd say
If you're looking for love
In Detroit, on a Memphis train
I had a mind to try to stop you
I can think of younger days when living for my life
Reminds my heart what love can yield
Like a bird without a song
For they don't have trees to hang upon
Be at peace baby and be gone
And all of that jiving around
Haunt her life, the memories
I will look him in the eye
I pretend to try
And thousands upon thousands made an ocean
You're callin' me back, yeah, but that was no good
The whole damn thing makes no sense
As the cluttered streets greet me once again
Where I grew up and found my feet
Tomorrow's gonna come too soon, too soon
These flowers will never die
That's Slim Shady, yeah baby, Slim Shady's crazy
And I flew into a frenzy searching high and low
It's over and you're gone
Leaving me with nothing to disdain
And a place
Yeah, I was a postcard, I was a record
And you, you were the lonely one
I'll be waving, I'll be waving goodbye
Seems that my pockets were filled up with gold
So we bend the bracket
Without me there to hold you back, don't think, just do
To get a drink in this place
I could open up the sky
Crumpled and puffy faced
More like a clown
Those crazy messed up things that you do
Told her, "Wherever you go, little runaway bunny, I will find you"
Unfolded
And I'd be inclined to be yours for the taking
We're passing slow, passing slow Slow, Slow
Denied everything
And we'll rise and ride 
"There's plenty of ways to know you're not dying
But then you let me off
A monkey's built a house on your back;
Will I see you on the other side
Will you take a journey tonight, follow me past the walls of death
And when it comes, you'll feel the weight of it
The ghosts of graffiti they couldn't quite erase 
I hope it's not as long as these country miles
All alone in the dark
In the halfway house of ill repute
As well as the sun
I feel unsteady,
The bathroom stall
Well today is grey skies
I got some friends I barely see
When you turn your back, she pulls out a flask
I needed you more, we wanted us less
I've made my mistakes
Now you think you're so damn fine,
The trees are giving up To sight
Always waiting 
And fly away to someone new
I hold my own, but you with your hunger
The best parts of lonely
Conversation lost its weight anyway
Why'd you have to wait
Sleeping soundly the back of the car felt more like a home than I would have ever thought
I need it, I need this
No wind in our sails
I never thought it could happen
To this love aloud try, try
Like so many girls, Jenny Wren could sing
Everything that happens is supposed to be
All the hopes and the dreams
Maybe not with a look
Sometimes it makes me wonder where would I be Where would I be
I will try to understand
'Cause baby time has changed nothing at all 
All of these stars will guide us home
So please remember me mistakenly
Look at this, look at the boys dancing
So fall into my eyes and fall into my lies 
Life carries on, and on, and on
When I do something like you you'll be on my mind or through,
I laughed so loud inside myself, it all began to hurt
That no one knows the days of
I did, I did I've done
They were only scratching their heads
Tomorrow comes Sorrow becomes his soul mate
A black eyed dog he knew my name
The touch of mist felt soft, felt warm
And still you're in my heart
To look in your eyes,
Please say you didn't die
We will be right by your side
Why did she crawl down in the old deep ravine
I don't wanna love you in no kind of way, no no
Unfamiliar brand falls from an empty shelf,
Now the road is out before me
Looking out across my family members
I hid my soiled hands behind my back
I am the one who haunts your we are the resin
It's not 'cause of you
Who am I to need you now
But New York cares
On the street
As I walk away
It all sort of looks familiar
Dark skin of a summer shade
Every thread, every hair rearranged to resemble
Have you made up your mind
Read the part and return at , it's a hell of a role if you can keep it alive
An early winter for us
Believe me I, I try
And maybe finally split the rhyme
Catching teardrops in my hands
Reminds you of home
Louis was my dearest friend
I used to know the sound of a smile in your voice
That I was loved for who I am
It was all so different then
When he gets that call, he's too far gone
And part of me still believes when you say you're gonna stick around
That when God took you back he said, "Hallelujah
Again I waited for this to pull apart
Scraping through my head till I don't wanna sleep anymore
Can turn all your colours to white
In the dark
Atheists were praying full of sarcasm,
You've really got a hold on me
But I fall apart when you appear
Your famous blue raincoat was torn at the shoulder
And I was even having a good day when I'd found out we'd lost you
So I took what's mine by eternal right
This is suicide season
We may race and we may run
Or was that your shadow I saw on the wall
Through loves fields, so blindly
I search myself and everyone
And though this fun has past, those mythic dreams are meant to last
I'll drown my beliefs
I thought we'd be healing together
But I want you to sympathize, alright
Pay your money, baby
Just keeping the peace between the sheets
And in the early morning light
To call and be nice
This used to be my childhood dream
Does all the things
To be with somebody you knew
I waited half my life away
Nights of light so soon become
When I die, will I go
'Cause my bright is too slight to hold back all my dark
Come off course while you sleep
You can see her lying naked in your arms
So if you get a second to look down on me now
Tell yourself over and over you won't ever need her again
You stared into the sky 
But I am good, I am grounded
The day will come, when you'll get away from it
If you don't mind, why don't you mind
He doesn't play for the money he wins 
Silent wars  rumble somewhere below
Is an elaborate dream
As we burn down, as we are found
And I know a woman, became a wife
Keep on aching the same heartbreak
So damn pretentious
Yeah I'm just missing you now
Are taking hold
And I know right where I fit in
We all waste and consume, destroy and ruin everything we touch
Come here, oh my star is fading
And then the devil took your memory
Making islands where no islands should go
Just to see you mess around
Sometimes late at night while running from the rain
Why, why do I come here
For the days when we smiled
The woman on the bed
And I feel sorry for you
Why'd you have to phone 
You're gonna like it but not a lot
There's room inside for two
Just you wait and see when you turn, turn 
And I didn't know it at the time
I will settle in and dream
Or Charo or GWAR, I could sell you tomorrow
I can't find the joy within in my soul
The photograph on the dashboard taken years ago
By sharing these things,
With no one to reach to
"If you love something, give it away"
'Cause you burned them out
I'm sleeping so little these days
Maybe you'll leave the light on
I'm talking to you before
I own one
Until the end
There's no one left to finger
I really didn't see us singing through this
Breath that I breathe don't you know
And she's holding him tight in her bat arms
And I can't, I can't pick up the pieces
That this would come to an end
Sitting at the bed with the halo at your head
Oh and imminent
No one can stop you now
Or brake with the ones you've followed
Making the world look gray and alone
Some I remember, some I forget
Let me tell you something; this is the 's Alright
Somebody new 
And three and a half minutes
I'll hold on to your heart
But the words don't fit the mouth
What the day has lost
Ain't no cats gon' shed blood for me
When all the things she said
We built that house of his
Here in my hands now 
Beat out the bed bugs, 
I can't breathe with these words in my mouth
But I waste, more time than anyone
The office was a dungeon where you hid your fears of
You can't fix me, I'm torn apart
Goodnight, hope that things work out all right
What am I gonna do if you never come home
To shape to the comfort of us
I hope that womb's not too warm
"Thank you mother sea for letting him see the sea in me"
Thinking about poodles and puddles and mistakes
It all just goes to show how
That you'll be someone, who won't be forgotten
Ooh You gotta drive all night
Better call on evolution, better way to make a revolution
The distance from me to where you'd be
Wipe away your tear stains
But I think of him still
I know that kiss will be my last, 
And it sounds just like this
I wanna fly, never come down
With you as my quarterback
And the gifts stayed wrapped until you got home
The evil it spread like a fever ahead
I've got this light
I cry for less attention
Yes indeed I'm, alone again
So I came inside to be with you
'Cause the gentlemen are calling
These days I seem to think about
Sinking slowly, the waters higher
It was all about love
When I look and I find I still love you
Trying to hold it together
And I will say peace to the people I meet
And run
Look at me, I'm falling and I'm falling
Spitshined so bright
It's such a silly thing to do
Bring something to feed the birds
Hand in hand with someone else and they hope that they're mistaken
To sit not very far from here
And there's nothing left here to remind me
You won't need a real job because I would love to pay for you
Hello I'm your mind giving you
If you don't shoot it, how am I supposed to hold it
And they will know how I love them 
Until it falls all around like a cold steady rain
And nothing's alright
Of what it was you were trying to find
I had a brother once
Her elephant with the laughing call
In the shadows grey crusaders with tails
All throughout the morning, though I'm begging
Please don't confront me with my failures
I guess you didn't know
Feel so close to everything now
And somewhere a baby is crying
But I feel like an idiot, workin' my day around the call
You're not alone in trying to be
Now I can hardly remember her face
For all of this you're feeling
I am an asphalt flower breaking free but you keep stopping me
Can't stop can't stop loving you
Well now I guess I should've listened
All the things that you needed from me
The stupid bastard's gonna have his way with you 
Our heart are in the blossoms
Go fix my head
Don't write me no more letters, my mailbox is full of bombs
Now I'm done with my coffee break
That it's harder to be friends than lovers
your stomach's filled up but you're starved for conversation
Come all ye lost
So I'll notice some grave thing
Her caresses caressed by fingers
Calm my fears and soothe me
There's nothing here for me 
As they come
Turn it off forever
flies in the house 
I'll never lose this pain
And when the broken hearted people living in this world agree,
Take the pain out of love and then love won't exist
I like the peace in the backseat
The things that you wanted, I bought them for you
I wouldn't mind perhaps
And I'm standing on air
Losing, it comes in a cold wave 
Why do I always spill
Is the man that you fear
Made a promise not to clean the slate
You do not warrant long goodbyes
Run 'way from your grave
With all these left over feelings of you
Our wonderful memories
Oh, James, my love for you is stronger, don't you know
Just sitting here and trying to decipher
Everyone has their obsession
There's not one moment I'd erase
A woman now standing
And I didn't feel a thing, so baby don't feel no pain
Didn't realize you were so top of the shelf
One day she stiffened, took the other side
I could do with some fresh air
He will do one of two things
i never sleep before  
I bet you're wondering how I knew
Wonderful people everywhere
There's only tears
As a kid with my mom and my brothers
Static to the sound of you and I
I always knew I never wanted this
Spring and Thompson on the first of May
Oh, and they knew how to play
Gotta figure out how you stole my heart
And dreaming, pick up from
Counting my footsteps, praying the floor won't fall through, again
Just gotta let it go
Yes, too much love will kill you
Or think about the day she found you
Just talking shit about how we're all so upset about the disappearing ground
And the radio's singing down the hall
Because when I look in her eyes
And then leave me alone
Until you've loved a love you had to lose
So where are the strong
And yes there are times when I hate you
So I'm choosing what to wear
I lie to my heart 'cause I thought you felt it
They're waiting for something
Breaking your fingers 
It's the happiness inside that you're feeling
Just take it, take it take the box
We'll grow old together
Relying on my best memories,
I'm leaving this place
It's God shining through to me I guess
I won't let the shadows take their toll
I will roam lost but never alone, hide with me, hide
I die here as your friend or lover 
I knew it would 
And it's not the good kind
Whenever I run to you, lost one
The walls of my heart
I check the phone
This life's too good to last 
Well, I stopped picking up, and this song to let you know why
But I can't, I can't give you a reason
If you think you belong enough nice dream
I've been learning to drive my whole life
Don't let them pour all over me
Can it melt away all our mistakes
Come back to me
And everything feels wrong
Is that what you're talking about, Mickey
For I am the parasite of this town
I thought I could live in your arms
I'll find someone to help you
But still, when the moon is out, with his push cart
Just turn the music up
When busy streets amess with 
And throw a living past away
'Cause I've been with witches and I've been with the queen
Why do you show me those sad, sad eyes
Need a shoulder Well if that's the case
For we are in love
I wish you'd make up my bed
There's one thing I wanna know
Put your open lips on mine and slowly let them shut
We first met through a shared view
But you don't hear me askin' around
And we'll never miss a party collar weekend
Requires a strength I can't use
Looks just like a blood orange
Ooh, what a waste of all that
And you can't sleep
It hurts my soul
Couldn't wait for Saturday Saturday
Around you
We found our life's been changed 
You raise your sticks and cry and we fall
To catch my fall
Forgive my weakness
A weekend break that slept in late
Because we all need a little more room 
Jack it up Judy, set your heart alight
Here's the watch that my grandpa gave me, here's the key to my car
So we trade liquor for blood
Given you a reason to stay 
Tears form behind my eyes
The wheels of life they turn without me
Losing your mind for the sake of your heart
To that lonely song
The morning papers made the most
The times when we would play about
But you'll fight and you'll make it through
Maybe I oughta mention
Drink up one more time and I'll make you mine
If my stone face cracks again
So it seems you know me, I will wait
And I'll draw until I get one right
But now it's just a matter of grace
But someone has to sweep the floor
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Casting shadows on my screen
I can't love you in the dark
In a special place that I call my life
There's so many dreams I've yet to find
Every lonely night that I sit and pray
All those pretty years gone by
I'm already somebody's baby
And the feeling still remains
Off the port I see the lighthouse
'Cause your eyes told the tale
What could I say
What if everything around you
That they forgot to close down
I could never make him love me
And he, checking time, did punch me
I don't think I deserve it
On moving pictures
Quiet in the corner, numb and falling through
Like feral waves to your mind
And everything is turning blue now
I hope the fences we mended
The devil collects it, with a grin;
And you like to party and have fun
Someone else you'd rather phone 
And you're quiet, you never make a sound
Could not describe nightswimming
Those wasted moments won't return
No, you're not my fucking lover
She sees an old friend as she walks through the crowd
Could not kiss, just regress
She walks in the sun to me
I'm stayinabove the flat line
I would go out for a walk
I can do whatever pleases me
How could this love ever changing, never change the way I feel
And my heart caught fire
Open your parachute and grab your gun, falling down like an omen, a setting sun
Then she laid her eyes on mine
But I know it's just a reflection of the moon
And I guess it's worth your time
Stuck on the bridge between us
So I'll be holding my note and stomping and strumming
When I leave this world, I'll leave no regrets,
I could die for the words that you say
I'll say it loud here by your grave
But she don't come to see
I need you now it makes me want to cry
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday born I was Thursday's Child
You were the lonely one
And a dream that I was chasing and a battle with booze
As the free fall advances
He makes me tired, he makes me very tired
You'll never find your gold on a sandy beach
As soon as I find out how I can move from the back of a line
Thinking oh that, baby, I was wrong
I know, you lost your trust
Talk if you need to, but I can't stay to hear you
But your verse got trapped inside my head
Bring you back to the bar Get you out of the cold
I still feel like crying when I think of what you said to me 
You're fragile and you're cold, but that's alright
'Cause it's all shot to hell down here
No one's laughing at God when there's a famine, fire or flood
Maybe then I'll sleep well, maybe then I'll drown you out
Keep an eye on my back
Where is the dream for which I paid dearly
Have a new name and face
But tightly hold up silently
But I'm so hard to handle, I'm selfish and I'm sad
That you bought at the grocery store today,
And living down
It's hard to believe that I would let myself get so wrapped into you
Like I need you
My life is good, my love's a mess
I was on your porch
'Cause this is how things ought to have been
A hopeful look draped in despise
That you float in the air
A blink of an eye
I could stay here
People talking without speaking
Tell the papers
You would write back, see I'm just like you in a way
To the way that things are going
By a lady in black
And you're making that face that I like
Nananana, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
And that you miss me sometimes
Who took that look away
Oh sorta let her when I need it
Picks up the rice in the church where a wedding has been
'Cause I don't need a reason just to hold you
I'm tired of being
Would you say that one of your dreams
She said she won the world at a carnival
I still press your letters to my lips
I never thought that I would find myself in bed amongst the stones
Is he bold enough to take you on
They say that the captain
Wasn't air meant to last
It all becomes simple how
But though you're still with me
All I want in life's a little bit of love to take the pain away
My life's a circus, circus round in circles, selling out tonight
Selfhelp, selfpain
Even if only for one weekend
Maria says she's dying, through the door I hear her crying
Ya sabrás la situación, 
And promises are sweet
I guess I'll find out in seventeen days
The more you look forlorn, the more to you I warm
"There's nothing we cannot ever fix," I said
Not a sound to be heard
They echo me in circles
For they could not love you
How did it break
To breathe again
There's something that's invisible
Out of the lightning dream
We got big black cars
And every day I say 
In the light from the dashboard
Your sweet loving tenderness
Scattering flowers washed down by the rain
This could take all year, but
No longer empty and frantic
I know there's a big world out there
Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmooohoooohoohoohoooh
And her ghost leaned down to kiss me with a message from the sun
Of drum machines and landslides
With laughter still ringin' in my ears
There's no perfect endings
And be with youooh
To see your son on Saturdays, what way is that to live your life
So close your eyes
I think you lost what you loved
I'd kiss the ground that you walk on,
at the first showing
The hurt of going on
It feels like it swallows,
But then they were only kids
Casting shade
If sometimes you see that I'm mad
Fifteen years gone now, still a wastrel mésallied
Let's have a toast for the jerkoffs, that'll never take work off
Will I know when it's finally done
Sometimes I'll meet you out there
The cars and freeways implore me to stay away 
I keep asking why I keep asking why
Imagine us combined light up the room electrify
Like somebody wants you, someone that's more for real
But I just let love go to waste
While I wait all night, for you in California
It'll put that smile back on my face ya
Nothing left here for me
How I feel
I want to be the place you call home
Calm yourself, he says to me
You told me again you preferred handsome men
And at the funeral, the university
That I first saw your lovely face
She was playing a part that I could understand
Ice is starting to form 
Do you pray with him, too
Your coal black hair
I keep waving at the taxis, they keep turning their lights off
And thinking of long distance rates instead of kissing you
And we'd live our lives together
They laugh at tragedies
So why'd you have to lie
I've watched him while sleeping and seen him cry
And I know I was wrong
But oh, that's a thoughtmy own revelation
She tried to sell crack, but ended up gettin' robbed
I will poison myself
I guess you don't know what you got till it's gone
The needle tears a hole
No killing moths or putting boiling water on the ants
They were kids that I once knew
She was a very good friend
Hello helicopter, are you lost out there
I guess we always settle in, and we know
A dying man in a living room
And there's so many things that I want you to know
I be dreaming a dream in a thought
I find it hard to tell you, I find it hard to take
Tied to a railroad
When the sun is high
But now they only block the sun
As each descending peak on the LCD
Staring at my picture book
On the back of his head
And I think, I could make better time of my time on land
I wanna' bleed show the world all that I have inside
Inside today
And all I gave you was "Goodbye"
After twelve long slow years gone by
You still live in me
Look at all of them beg to stay
For it has halfruined me to be hanging around
I say
I can see us dying on the bonnet of a chevrolet
I miss the way we sleep
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin sized bed
You're still the only one
For sorrow, the only lover I've ever known
Recurring, a dream that can't come true
She's all on the floor while I drink whiskey
Who do you think that you are
I feel these four walls closing in
You left it, I sent it 
Oh we, we could hold each other tight
Dance, you fucker, dance, you fucker
You know the nearer your destination
The bridge is all crumbled
So blood is fire pulsing through our veins 
And why leave me hanging on a star
Don't leave me out in the rain
'Cos you gotta get high somehow
Don't leave me waiting here
Own my sears
I'm watching you breathing
And that's ok, she don't want the world
Oh my God, the shuffling and the floor
Wish I could press rewind
With my heart beside me
I'm so lonely 
He gathered up his loved ones and he brought them all around
Seeing you cry it makes feel like saying sorry
No one survives, no one survives
And rain upon the forehead where the mist's for hire if it's just too clear
Like snow, like gold
Somehow I knew you would leave me this way
Screw all my friends
What the hell do you want
Now let me die
Where I loved you so
tremors that warn us of ourselves
It's the work you saying you're doing
But daddy had to work, you and momma had to leave me
'Cause these nights I think maybe that I miss you in my living room 
And I will try to fix you
I hope you find the love that's true
I remember it well, the first time that I saw
I knew who she was
I don't know you, but I still want to
'Cause baby, ooh
I'll see you on the other side 
You left, I died, 
I'm preparing for the breakdown
Don't you care
Ran out of time, no kiss goodbye
Different people I've found
Beautiful people everywhere
He's gone, he's gone, he's gone, he's gone
The kingdom of men
In a house on the street where you live
Don't you wonder why we never talk about the future
The markings on your surface
I'm chasing old ideas
But I'm just a ghost
But you ain't leaving without a fight
I know you're lonely
As we sleep among the dead
I'll do my crying in the rain
And took all those little feelings all apart
Coffeelaced, intoxicating on her lips
Then live the rest of our life
But it all boils down to one quotable phrase
He waits for her to sympathize
Bis die Sonne scheint; Bis sie wieder scheint
I can't remember how 
And nobody's gonna tell me now
Take a glorious bite out of the whole world
I'm gonna clean these veins again
In your eyes again
You will look for me and I'll be gone
I won't shiver in the cold
So you lost your trust
To feel not good enough
He's all over primetime news
What did I find
Cause you lied, lied
Room where you've got nothing to hide
You told me this has always been worth living,
Tryna start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college
Making ooh's
When they talk at me like I'm just a child 
Be an end 
The Devil told me "No room for cheats"
That's right, dying
Close my eyes when I go to bed and I
Promises of payments were upon your shoulders constantly,
Stuck thinking 'bout it driving on the freeway
And you wanted not to cry
Shadows fading in the haze of what I couldn't say
Maybe it would be nicer if I search out
What would you recommend I do
The future was our skin and now we don't dream anymore
Where all my layers can become reeds
After the storm
But He took my shoulders and He shook my face
Of "tears of a clown"
And I'm standing on a bridge
When choosing sides for basketball
These arms will not be taught to need another's
Oh, sometimes love is intoxicating
Your back's not straight like before
I know that everything you wanted was yours
 years on that hill
Your friends that turn to liquid
So I ask if she remembers when
I said this has got to stop
Counter intuitive thunder ride
Cornered, wasted, blessed, and used me
Let me sit in the dark of the morning
I realize that music then
A sober straight face gets you out of your clothes
Questions I have answered, you are still asking yourself again
But right now but right now 
But one last time
But there's a girl waiting for me down in Mexico
Parading in a wake of sad relations as their shoes fill up with water
No more crying, wipe them tears, daddy's here, no more nightmares
But oh, I'm staring at the mess I made,
It's a half life
As he sits beneath the tree
They say I'm better off now
And still I don't understand
She could outrun the fastest slug
Or justify your lies
Those summer nights seem long ago
I never was there, was there when it counts
I see the sun disappear
I, I can't take things slowly
Kinda like you're startin' from the top
Life of chasin' butterfly
And say the last goodbye
That pretty face again
"And it's so cold, it's like the cold like you were dead"
And the young man's dream was almost seen so plain
Only sadness
All these things into position
I remember we could talk about anything
I never thought we'd have our last kiss
We small talk, work and the weather
This pain is just too real
The limousine pulled in
Hides my true shape, like Dorian Gray
Autumn's hue in those sad eyes
You can watch the sunset from the bed 
And it hurts like brandnew shoes
What is deeper than the grave
Betrays my head
And on any given day I'd rather ride a limousine
So we can do just one more thing
I could be right
Being what you are
Pray now baby, pray your life was just a dream
Baby goodbye
And it's hard to say how I feel today
Lady sing the blues so well
Since you been gone I can do whatever I want
Trains and sewing machines oh, you won't catch me around here
The hollow shoulder, across the waters
But if you hold me up to the light
Honey I was just a kid
Always packing all my stuff
Isn't quite as it seems
Just looking for shelter from the cold and the pain
I hope we didn't break yet, but I'm glad we broke the rules
And you're still safe and sound
I've been aching, aching for you, my love
Of spring
Everything that I've been missin'
Laugh about it someday
I asked for death but instead I'm awake
Everybody looking at you, here, take hold of my hand
Lights from the jungle to the sky
Calling out winter
Lilah you're my only home
To turning tables
'Cause you feel it when they take it away 
And buy whatever we can't seem to grow
And how I picked you up and everything changed
And pray they don't grow up to be
As you're folding up the shirts you hesitate,
For all my heart's mistakes,
'Cause I am lately lonely
Passing by with every departing flight
I just hope it's worth the fight
Don't want to think much I don' t want to reminisce
Of your story"
And my eyes see it all so clear
And your sandy colored skin
She put her veil down trying to hide the tears 
Life, life is a pigsty
Mess me around
What do I need you for
And slamming her eyes, locking the door
I'd like to celebrate you, dear
To hold eternally
I wish that you needed me
It took everything I got
The cold comfort of the inbetween
Do what you're gotta do
Saying goodbyes the hardest part
And he finally got there around midnight
If my father took his life
Drive my heart into the night
She says that long ago
What the fuck is your name
My mom, she cared for him
Don't start me tryin' now, uhhuh, uhhuh, uhhuh
I take a drive in my car
The world is just illusion trying to change you
Is that space that you call mine
When will it start to
I need to be alone to heal this bleeding stone
Unfold me and teach me how to be
In a failed attempt on blue
And to my mind
But you wouldn't let me take the fall
We'll waste some time
We'll skip the goodbyes
Upon my liar's chair
Five in the morning it all comes out pouring,
And rewrite every line
I guess that our being together was never meant to be
As the skyline splits in two
Ha ha ha show me what you got
I'm just a lonely, a lonely love sick boy with my rhyme
Then he turned around and headed home again
You won't cry for my absence I know
Tell me that you'll be the good one, good one
All the words that we have to say
To hold you
But in the long tresses of your hair
There's a train leaving nightly called, "When all is said and done"
Burn, burn
And he's mean talking beanstalking icey man
And the band plays some song
There's no need to argue, 
If words are dead 
Voices carried
And when he calls, he calls for me, and not for you
So halfblind we wrote these songs 
Right I'm on the plan, I wish the bouncers would go away,
Oh this is just a dream
Oh, she who dares to stand where I stood
Inside my heart
I don't understand your heart
There always is
Wrap me up in a dream with you
It's full of charts and facts and figures
And put me on a train 
You keep your wishes I'll keep my feelings
Now let them all fly off
You already know I love you and I sound like what'shisname
We're not going anywhere Sun is bright and standing still, it's alright
Lives within my heart
It's rush hour
You are a guest here now
Did I dream this belief
I walk on
She's leaving home
Look lovely look lovely
Where you should be, no one's around
The dust has only just begun to fall
That I gotta mend
Hide on the promenade, etch a postcard
It will greet you every morning
Ice in my eyes, and eyes like ice don't move
Ooh ooh, a little fistful
And I stood nervous next to you, in the dark room
When that hurt gets thrown
There's one minute of your day
Forever trusting who we are
Such a chill
We were fools to think that nothing would go wrong
With children, my time is so wastefully spent
The god of love preparing to depart
Take my body
Better run
I want him but we're not right
My body aches
Talk to the tears
Bear careless, turnip snare rampages
Confession arms awake
No longer moved to drink strong whiskey
Oh, I'm alone
Like can't you see the grass is greener where it rains 
They bury you when you go and die
There's music on Clinton Street all through the evening
What's that you're saying there oh well,
They're putting up reindeer and singing songs of joy and peace
Good morning bird
I don't want to play that part
Playing movies in my head, that make a porno feel like home
All beginnings and endings, 
Covered in warrior paint
I'm trying to figure out
His life was stole Stole, oh
When I let you go
And you thought you could change his mind 
'Cause we lost it all, and nothing lasts forever
What I was isn't what I am
Separate from the rest, where I like you the best
I'm crying icicles instead of tears
I'm gonna be the man who's lonely without you
But turned around softly
I will give you what you need
Hit the ground and run
Yes I cried, yes I cry, I cry, I die again 
I'll spend a day
To the point where I can take no more 
Overfired
Oh my God, we see it on the floor
The one and only heart
We are just a moment in time
I know that this rest in the deep is what you want
'Cause you wanna say hey I love you to everybody
You say my time here has been some sort of joke
And we sleep inside of this machine
She'd wanna kiss you all the time
Consoled a cup of coffee, but it didn't wanna talk
Could we stop and sleep for a spell
So why's my baby lying on the side of the motorway
How I could've been yours and you be mine
I guess somebody got somethin' they
We lost our way back home
When we walked in fields of gold
The words might come out better
And spend every moment I had with you
As the days turned to weeks
Please, please tell me what they looked like
To your worries Enjoy Central Park in spring
In beds in little rooms in buildings in the middle,
You broke me 'til the day that I die 
The problems lie within
But dear Lord she' s dying to dance with my father again
But Christmas falls late now
Is the only thing that's in my mind
Will you say to me when I'm gone
Like she loved me
Lie here on the floor
We've still got time
Full of broken thoughts I cannot repair
Losin' what I love today
You have been the one
It was all just a lie
And I'll turn the night into the skylight of day
All my limbs can become trees
It was magical,
Don't give away the end, the one thing that stays mine
You better shut your mouth
So now she's rolling down the window
To tell me she's sorry
'Cause I got three little words
You just see right through me
Your mother's dead
When they know that damn well
It goes like the clouds
Sometimes, when sailors are sailing
All I need to make it real is one more reason
And I hope you like your pictures facing down
Release to the sky, look him straight in the eye
Increase, delete, escape, defeat  it's all that matters to you
Shrinkwrapped out of air
All your life
It looks like darkness to me, oh
Said it's not your fault
You do not need me
Man I'm 'bout to get crazy, why can't she just, run away Look at ya
Oh I hate myself, and I feel crazy
Maybe somewhere else will not be half as cold as me
And no one's looking anyway
I was fighting, but I just feel too tired to be fighting
Walking tentative alone up the driveway
Ashamed of bein' broken in
Could I have eased your pain
Nobody sees when you are lying in your bed
Seeing the light in a station bar and traveling far in sin
Go on, lose the gamble That's the history of the trade
You were the only face I'd ever known
I can't pretend
And say, "it's all for love"
I know a ghost will walk through walls
How we gonna move together Just come closer
Crooked spin can't come to rest I'm damaged bad at best She'll decide what she wants
A cold war kid in McCarthy time
Tell me if you want me to lie
You won't try for me, not now
All those sorrys, we can't go back to the start
I'm always there with you
I'll gladly take her place if you'll let me, make this my last request
Maybe you'll leave the light
Stars at night turned deep to dust
Children, don't do what I have done
Last night they said the fire had spread and we said our prayers
All the flowers that you planted mama, in the back yard
Of the dark, dark water and the engine breaks
Hoping that you are missing me too
I called
Here's the army that you mowed to the ground
It's only fools they make these rules
This innocence is brilliant
Daddy please, don't take the girl
I will let you down
I rip my heart out
And you look at me and I understand, yeah it's the look I used to know
I can play you tonight
About the times I won't have to say
Nobody says it's wrong, so we don't ask why
I don't think I can live without you
And he's taking care of me
Think about all the foreign places we could be
I'll steer myself through choppy waves
So hard to move on
Something about those bright colors
'This sun always sets again
In the way I had planned
And I'd whisper that I love you
So love me now, hell is coming
The dog days are done
Is all that I'm asking for
Sees the sun going down
You are the river 
So I'll be someone who won't be forgotten
I break the yolks and make a smiley face
I'm not coming back forgive me
I don't need to be
And the sky breaks at dawn, shedding light upon this town, they'll all come 'round
Fighting back the rush of emotions
Without you here there is less to say
Do things I never should do
Well, I don't think that I ever loved you more
I sent the message on did you get it when I left it
To leave this earth, come on
I guess this is growing
I've been waiting night and day
That you'll run and never tire
I want to change the world
Its filled with older folks pleading "baby listen"
Your life is not your own
I wish I didn't know now what
I could never show it
To bat me back
The ghost slips away
We're throwing it all away at the end of the day
I think thoughts that I know are bad
And if you were with me tonight
And it's one more night in Hollywood
It doesn't help the hunger pain
But I guess I'll just bite my tongue,
if someone appears, 
Keeping the noise from breaking through
That cause my comatose to begin 
All I feel all I feel
Picked through the rubble and pulled out their hair
One more perfect rendezvous
So many people to love in my life
How my heart was blind
But I'm on the outside, and I'm looking in
I will never let you fall let you fall
'Cause I'm lonely for the big towns,
'Cause I don't feel that I deserve the sunshine's rays
No use in sitting
I guess that's what you want I could still fall in love with you
If I could make the world as pure
I miss the years that were erased
Whisper you mean it, say you'll stay
And she knows she's more than just a little misunderstood
What to believe
There's something wrong
In all I've done
Give the people something they'd understand
But I'm always alone
How can you mend this broken heart
While the whole wide world is fast asleep
Bedroom wounds  lovers like brigadiers
Oh just as long as you call me
Many many men
that i'm still alive, 
And I have walked these streets so long
Oh you silly stupid pastime of mine
But you never had to try
I know I promised
Calmly waiting to make you my lamb"
For the cute, cute, cute ones
And you're the only one who knows
Standin' on the edge of something much too deep
I woke up and you were saying
At numbers and figures
Day after day, alone on a hill
Reply to single M My name is Caroline
Things your body wasn't meant to
It's a human sign
I never asked for help, I take care of myself,
Shot an arrow in your head
But home is just a room full of my safest sounds
I know it's always been there
Truth shall be told one day 
It hurts my teeth
We walked the  blocks to the middle
So please understand
I know where I marked the signs
Goodnight, my love, to every hour in every day
Once in a while, when it's good
Better call the porter man, he's been caught leaving
For  years I've been trying to believe and confide in
It's a call
Brenda wants to run away, Mama say
I'm left alone
What are you gonna do
And they're scared that we know all the crimes they'll commit
It's no wonder you can't go to sleep, just take another pill
I know it wasn't always wrong
It's nice to be alive
Please don't drive me blind 
Thought you said you didn't feel pain
Now it gathers dust
Something drove you down 
I don't love you I'm just passing the time
Got no one to call your own
And then the day becomes the night
Things can be better, you could be happy, try
Seeing my past to let it go
And why do you look when you've already found me
On a decline
Every time I rise I see you falling
I just need something to believe in
At the end of my life
Better stop now before I start crying
I'll be right beside you, dear
Maybe not in words
Without a reason, what is this fire
There's times that I was broke
It is not a habit, it is cool I feel alive, I feel
There might be some good ones
But I cry instead
I'd tune into some friendly voices
The beauty that she brings, illumination
Vaan niin että tunnen sinut  But so that I feel you
If you don't mind catching up
I'm a word that no one ever wants to say
Oh where the heart beats slower and slower
To pass the time in my room alone
I can stop and catch my breath
But both my hands are tied
Maybe I played my cards wrong
If you were here, I'd sing to you
You never talk, we never smile, I scream "You're nothing"
Even if it's alone
Ending with letting go
Never dreamed that he would be gone from me
You're always crazy like that
I threw the day old tea from the cup
Is one that smells so pure
And everything good is happenin' somewhere else
Don't say that it's not fair
Daddy watch me sleeping
What the hell is going on
In the corner of your eye
Will he love you like I loved you
Would you find it in your heart
Lonely, lonely that is you
Is it true what they've been saying about you
On rumors of summer
Hold in your breath,
Maybe there is something that you know that I don't
The bright tide forever drawn
They stole his phone, he never got home
Maybe someday
'Cause the comet can take us
And I can picture her standing right in front of me
Keep your head on high, keep your head on high
'Cause I'm feeling my way through the dark
Another day of life without you
She'd walked away
Fifteen years gone now, I still wail from these catacombs
And then there was light, was sound, was matter
There are moments when,
Content to be alone
But each time you turn a corner,
Knew it all along
Felt things were going wrong
If you think you've had too much
I'm writing the folks back home to tell them
Till my hand shook
Like the one that just passed
For the fear that I find in these chords
In my big dreams 
Shaking its fists in the air
Shouting back to the oldest people
And it's hard
Let the wind blow through your heart
Because your candle burns too bright
Fresh on the pavement, I ran off the plane
Oh, come on, you know me too well
And somehow growing old feels fine
Underneath my breath
Tell me we both matter, don't we
Crazy, all the lovers have been tagged
We are
That never left the ground
Then she looks up at the building
Happy ending's gone forever more
It ain't nothin' but a house
I just wanna go back to being the same I wanna go back, I wanna go back, baby
You know the song by Phil Collins, "In the Air Tonight"
She looks impressive
Kiss my hand and wave
Pretty soon, you'll have kids to feed 
Through the roof of your mouth
I found the card where you wrote it out
And now it's only fair that I should let you know
None of us are strangers anymore
Too late to turn back now, I'm running out of sound
See how well you fare
The ones where we all laugh so lame
For when I really come around
Alright
And with a sad heart I say bye to you and wave
Guilty roads to an endless love Endless love
We don't have to sit here in silence
my days without you, 
I'm only a man looking for a dream
As she walks out the door
She says, I'm free
I know you care, I know you care
You are a funny bear
Good morning, son
And in my eyes, your smile
Ain't nobody looking now
But a song about love's not enough
Can't say I blame you one bit when you kept it all inside
Speak in the garden
You should look through some old photos
And I'll do anything to keep her here tonight
It's the wrong kind of place to be thinking of you
Either one of them things will do
como duelen los dias sin ti
Baby, you're lost
I'm not afraid to cry every once in a while
And from the sidelines you see me run
And I don't want to die without shaking up a leg or two
Hang my head, break my heart built from all I have torn apart
"Independent Independent"
"You'll renegotiate"
I call up my friend, the good angel
The singer finished singing
When your lonely heart has learned its lesson
Was bulletproof
Stephanie says Stephanie says that she wants to know She wants to know
All your summer sheets
Come on, come out, come here, come here
Because it brings me back you
What might have been lost
Can't close myyou close your eyes
I've forgotten how it felt
That I won't let you down, oh no
You've been thinking about the time, you've been dreading it
Spring flowers sproutin'
Oh leavin' home ain't easy
Are becoming clearer
How does it feel 
And only love was learned
Now what will it take to feel right
And I was drinking you goodbye
I'd not be stuck here in this hole
Let me love you
But you still hurt me
And looking at you, all I see is
It looks as though you're letting go
That's okay, you don't need to win anyways
Time is so unkind
Not today, today, today, today, today
Here we are again with handguns for hearts
If the right thing is revealed
C'mon, let's go
I've got your wedding bells in my ear
Went to school and I was very nervous
It's round about, it's somewhere here
For those of whom still are not found
A broken heart and twisted minds
As they take me to my local down the street
Tried letting go but you're still the only one
And my arms are tough
And though I know I'll never get her out of my heart
And we're trying to be faithful, but we're cheating, cheating, cheating
I think about the little things that make life great
How can it feel, this wrong
It's just the end of the world
'Cause I've been afraid that you would walk away
While I do my thing in the background
I think I'm turned around
And someone's burning out, out on condor avenue
You can stop the world, try to change my mind
But what was normal in the evening by the morning seems insane
"You're making mommy cry, why Why is mommy crying"
Und die Vögel singen nicht mehr
Goodbye my friends
Tell me everything is wonderful now
It was so simple in the moonlight, now it's so complicated
I cannot keep what isn't mine
Can you see me when I'm running
Just let go of me
For one more plane ride out
He opens a window just to feel the chill
And just as I'm breaking free
You leave my life, I'm better off dead
We're like fire and gasoline
I think about this place I call home
When the water filled every hole
Though it's been so many years
I had the notion that you'd make me forget the world 
Until you get out of this mess
You are fighting us all
Maybe you're a joker, maybe you deserve to die
They shake their heads, they say I've changed
And I've still got me to keep you warm
Now I need a place to hide away
But you can have all that's left, yeah yeah yeah
Show me the meaning of being lonely Being lonely
"I don't need you anymore, you're nothing"
Don't hold yourself like that
I feel like writing you a letter but that's not me, you know me
By pushin' my hand away to my chest, from hers
I can not hide how low I feel
'Cause you are unfixable
My love is strong now
The one who can't afford to face her image is restored to grace
The night has fallen down the staircase
Of God's good ocean gone wrong
Till the time you start changing the rules
But she's not afraid to die
I'll leave before the dawn
A moment of bliss that we hold
Something you're afraid to show 
Lead different lives
I will lay down my heart and I'll feel the power
And I remember all the things we once shared, 
And one day passed away in his sleep
So you invade my sleep and confuse my dreams
The sidewalks are watching me think about you
All my children can become me
I have to block out thoughts of you, so I don't lose my head
But now he's gone
I wanna run too
Pose with your brother, won't you be a good sister
Sorrow, sank deep inside my blood
Flies dip tongues into tear ducts
And I love your women and all of your heroin
That we never did
A name in your recollection
Bullying him round round
Don't wanna take a breath without my baby
Told me that my hair was red
Our life, is always on the line
They're screaming so loud, I take one last look at the crowd
It felt just like the old days
Tonight's the last to say goodbye
Sharpen my bones and stab you once for each time I thought of you 
Wide open spaces far away
Who just crumbles and burns
Her only son has died
With two tickets torn in half and a lot of nothin' to do
God knows I try to feel
The scars run deep inside this tattooed body
To the person that you were, and I will do the same
I need someone to ease my mind
But it's not as bleak as it seems
But I won't let this build up inside of me
Sometimes I wonder what might
Nothing could bring me further from my old friend time
The he falls to the floor
Will you be mine
But that was a million years ago
Do you see the world
Crawl into the dark
And when brotherhood come first
And I simply needed space, space for me to be
To let you know that you're not alone
I lost myself, I lost the
You forget where the heart is
And what will it hold for me
For the national plan, I don't care
And all the stupid lies they hide behind
And know all that has spoiled in your heart
To pass time; let us go and rob the blind
To mold like clay, to break like dirt
I'm in too deep and the wheels keep spinnin' 'round
Laid our blessings on the ground,
You'd better bring me back my girl
I loved the footsteps that she made
I'll follow you into the dark
And they shall enter from the back
But I still get lonely
I was going round and round the hotel garage
Smell you on my hand for days
I don't want you to hate for all the hurt that you feel
Never thought that I could be affected
Turned me away so many times
We stayed for the winter
But the truth is that I've never fallen so hard 
First night of your life, curled up on your own
Viva forever, I'll be waiting Melanie C Viva forever, I'll be waiting
I can't understand why I feel this way
He said "Of course it's your decision,
Can't erase this, can't delete this
Felt like a lifetime
I'm throwing away pictures
The other half is wise
If he burns you let him go
I've been told only fools rush in
A sadness I can't erase
And our bodies crumbling
This world ain't exactly what my heart expected
You were looking for the great escape
I'm scared
No more words
You could've been here right by my side
Disappointment you shouldn't have done
I'm ready for my sun to set
But the crowd kept pushing forward
You're gonna wonder who you are
But there ain't no Coupe de Ville hiding at the bottom of a Cracker Jack box
Yesterday's a million miles away
It seems the only blessing I have left to my name
And I'm letting myself down
The minutes pass away
I've worn the faces off
"Baby please don't don't do this"
It's a good thing tears never show in the pouring rain
That we all go away to a better place, I'm told
He says his body's too old for working
So we just hurry up only to wait
Counting the clicks with the living dead
'Cause it's not going to stop
We're backdriftin'
Turn out the light
Good things will pass
Through the lights of Beacon Street
Won't you do this for me, dearest darkness
The man of a thousand voices
We're all gonna die
See the children run as the sun goes down
To please come save me from myself
As your name is carved in stone
The light will fill our eyes like cats
Looks like it always did
Words from your younger years
Well I, I just see the sky
Blankettes who can't find their their thread and their bare
By blood and by me, and I fall when you leave
But honey I ain't goin' nowhere
Because if you throw a light
Sell me a car that goes
I kiss her still,
Even though soon can sleep
Look lovely today
A hand to hold, a song that clings with mine
I did what I had to
Cool as the deep blue ocean
So poor and cold in their Midwest
But I am not afraid of anything 
Until I fall asleep
The things that you tell yourself
A house where nobody lives
And I remember quiet evenings trembling close to you
I can't hear the songs he sings
And I look into your eyes
I'm sitting alone in the café front way
But if you're tired of looking at my face, I guess I already am
Though we stayed by its side 
I refuse to believe you could
I can't wait till I get home
I wish I could just stop
Whenever you come around me
My most is nothing more
Well as for now I'm gonna hear the saddest songs
Holding back the fool pretends
This is not my life
My love My friend
In the service of the heart alone
One touch and I'm crying
Tell you I need you
My sun is your sun,
The thoughts you once gave me,
From the eyes of a child
On a redeye flight to another world
And the rumours of his parties and the orgies on his yacht
Of falling down laughing
'Til I find somebody new
My heart screams out
Reflect in Vincent's eyes of china blue
When I get back let's disappear without a trace
No, no, no brokenhearted girl
O, Katrina Why you gotta be mean
It's a good thing that I'm not a star
I know everything will be all right
Of loving someone so much that you need
Are you afraid of leaving tonight
What does he care
Your heart is unbreakable
Get out of my head
The one thing that I tried to hold on to
But I was sadly mistaken
It wars with my tears,
Total control
Little and hardly here
It's hard to move on
And maybe rely on me
And I don't want to speak these words
I just want to love you when the goings tough
Like I'm made of glass
Honey, you please me
And what do I say
Sadly, or in the depths of winter
Do you remember
Metal heart, you're not worth a thing
But I know you are here with me now
And when you dream, I hope you can't sleep and you scream about it
Keeping ahold of what you just let go
I hear them scream, I hear them fight
Knowing you don't care
Reads like a polygraph I'm told
I hope I ain't calling you too late
These are the parts of your body 
There was no way to compromise
What if I got it wrong
It's easy let it go
Lie cold in the ground like you
If I could just come in I swear I'll leave
The ship is sailing
I take the blue ones every time 
We could be a beautiful miracle, unbelievable
When the storm broke our second anchor line
Those words he never spoke
But it's too late to think of the value of my life
I really don't know love, at all
And missed the most important thing
As you turn,
Ever returning you
Without your love
Nothing compares to you
I still see you inside of this Godawful house
My hands don't work like before
Honestly over you
Passing slowly though a vector
As to want someone like me
Then close your eyes and I'll be on my way
I guess it's time to build a boat
She said please stay
Who was to know
Give us life again 'cause we just wanna be whole
I'm not the fuckin' needle in the haystack, that you finally found
Baby thinks he's dying
And my brother has fit in the snow
We only bring each other tears and sorrow
You're hiding underneath the smoke in the room
But you keep my old scarf
Give me all of your prayers to sing
So easy you let go
I'd feel rather alone and ill at ease
Nobody came
Where you've had me for hours 'til I'm sure what I want
But I guess I got no valentine
Careful who you're talking to
We're happy, Ma, we're having fun
A carefully laid plan
Now that I have found someone
If it makes you less sad
I'm in love with your daughter
Slow down on us, wind
Just about got it right
Do you remember the way
I've tried cutting the ropes and
Policeman are walking, walking in lines
Now I'm back on my own
And Rob says
Drowning out the sound of the rain as it knocks on the windowsill
I'm going out with someone too
I shared my body and my mind with you
And when we got to New York everything felt right
As I disappear tonight
Reach out our hands, hold on to hers
Of the arms you said you'd never leave
Split screen sadness
About a place to hide
To have Busby Berkeley dreams
I'll bail you out, show you what you should see
Oh I never had just whatever it is you want, baby 
And just as love's silhouette appears 
There's no one in sight
I've been waiting far too long
Got bitten fingernails and a head full of the past
You'll find work and I'll get promoted
'Cause you're the best paint life ever made
Open my window, sing me a song
Leave it all the fights and all 
This dancing lights across a crowd remind us of another town
It burned me down to the wires
Of what I heard was wrong
I don't even try
I'm going to go down in the water
Racing thoughts and wasted time 
All I want, only one, streetlevel miracle
He took his anger out on her face
Inside my mother's clothing store
Two ravens in the old oak tree and
On the roof above the streets
Or are we ashes
When you're young you have this image of your life
Bad day, looking for a way home,
Stay here, lie with me here, oh lofi, lonely sighs
To believe in
Another world outside my door
"It's the atrocities of your story
I wanna live life, never be cruel
Ash and urn and silence
The first time in my life and now it's so clear
Long nights, strange men
We left before the dust had time to settle
And I'm breaking at the britches
You and me in the dressing room
Hold of your time
Cold
All the wild horses
But you can't stop me, I want you to know
Are you getting tired
All the trembling sweetness
You can't find one good thing to say
When you've seen it a million times
We're closed to the earth 'til further notice
He's been in my dreams
Always trying to pave the way for women in a man's world
She'd been there with a fixed stare
He said, "The truth is you'll be okay, anyway"
I'm goin' to a place that has already been disgraced
Better things to do without
You weren't my everything till we were nothing, and it's taken me a lot to say;
No earthly ships will ever bring him home again, 
But I was thinkin' 'bout you
You're a part of me
Out of nothing at all
Don't you know she's got a yes, she is
But it's ok, she don't want the world
My love GLORIA is love ooh
Slipping into mine
And I miss you since you went out for that walk
I've made a commitment
But it's bruising your karma
I see the beauty above
The routine daydream starts to sock it off
I' m showing you all the cards
And I say thank you
Is there any way that I can stay in your arms
And keeping lines blurry
Come along if you dare
I remember you said
Since you're gone there is an empty space
That kept us apart
Lonely and frightened
Or do I make you mine,
And my heart is like ice
Everything I wanted to be
It was the hope of all we might have been
A little girl lost in the woods
We'd fall asleep by the big blue sea
I feel the pain and I cry out
Now the part is through
Feelin' yourself disintegrate
I was dressed in wine
'Cause come the morning, I'll be gone
I thought we'd be precious together
I'm just tired of counting bodies
Sat on their park bench like bookends
With every word he'll say
And don't tell me you need me
If things start splitting at the seams
Counting stars again x
About people who are "nice"
Is this the life for me
I'm gonna miss the trees
Downtown
I'm lost in the light
Heaven is on earth
A bitter aftertaste and a fantasy
Looking out the window
I shiver and I scrape at your door
There may be smiles but a few
They took off his clothes
Where are we fucking going
Our love can save us now
You see, the cage, it called I said, "Come on in"
Come and sit with me
Some words are best unspoken
There's no one left to hear you scream
Would it all subside
And I know that the lift can be painfully slow
It's never over, she is the tear that hangs inside my soul forever
I just get a bit scared,
You say I choose sadness
They would not listen, they're not listening still
I wonder if you'd miss me when I'm gone
And this is all I ever dream
Until you've learned the meaning of the blues
And you know your reasons
But some things remain
Wild is the wind, wild is the wind
We're just living people
It's like the finish line where everything just ends
At night, I pray 
Ever falling down
I got my knuckles bruised
And a dark way that leads to my house
Yeah love I hope you know
I really believe that this time it's forever
Laney I'm talkin' to you too, daddy's still here
Everything as cold as life, can no one save you
It wasn't fake it
But this carriageway can't take me there
Whoa, I've seen fire and I've seen rain
All I want is to give my life only to you
Of distant dark places
You're just waiting for her to come apart
That's curdling the blood they found on you
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
I think I'll save suicide for another year
If we don't move together, just come closer
When you're drinking by candlelight 
But there was once you,
I miss you, I guess that I should,
It's on that he needs to focus 
From the spell of some old holy song
Not feel scared
"There's someone new
From a bridge on Washington Avenue
Even if no one understands
It's never over, all my blood for the sweetness of her laughter
Can't bear the stare of your teary eyes
"There's plenty of things to wear when you come to me
We can never go home
Pulls us from out dreams
I hate you
High, high, neglectful lover
You want me to lie not break your heart
All the ones who hate
On a tight ship
My one
I can't be there, that's all you had to say to me was
Is it fast enough so we can fly away
Solid gold now, solid, solid gold
Baby, sometimes
I love you, anyway I love you I love you, anyway I love you
Send me your position 
All before the drama begun
The whole collection
Nobody's lost
'Cause it's gonna be alright, why don't you tell me again
For reasons unknown to me
She waits all night to feel his kiss
And maybe I just set aside the fact that you were brokenhearted
It's so sad to watch a sweet thing die
With my dead imagination while you're with some other man
It's not somebody who's seen the light
Hard to believe my heart stopped pounding
Feel no shame
Don't say you need me when
Folding John Wayne's Tshirts
Hiding, in the shade
Look out young son
Chooses his clothes to match his pallid complexion
Spin this flammable paper on the film's that my life
Sometimes
When we were children we'd say
Lady, all the troubles are my fright, I disgust you
Forgot yourself,
And God only knows, God makes his plan
But it all boils down to what you did there
And hide my cuckold eyes
But I know I'll see your face again
Angel's calling,
Cry alone, I've gone away
Why can't we talk it over
It illuminates your sleeping skin
My Cheshire cat doorstop with fear in your smile,
No matter where life takes me to
All the hard things we've all gotta do
My mother's always tried to change herself
Every night, every night alone with you
Pull your mouth
This is a song about the girl next door
Sorry I never told you
Solid gold now, nothing's gonna stop us
See the changes, people's faces blurred out
To navigate adulterous waters
With nothing holding me
This could be the end
That night that you planned to go clear
'Cause I'm a begging kind of man
There are places I'll remember
There's nothing to do 
As if we are pure in the reign of our contentment
Another war to fight
Don't let me get away
Never washing spiders down the plughole
Takes me wandering through the street
And all the stupid lies I hide behind
We writhed under a red light
And you're gonna let our things simply crash and fall down
I see stars and go weak
The boys you left are men you didn't raise 
I see them snakes come through the ground
As we said all our goodbyes
Maybe I misunderstood
We'll be a perfect family
Trials in life, questions of us existing here
Be a world child, form a circle
tremors that warn us
All of the things you've always run from
I remember moments of happiness
I can't stand another fight
It was the loneliest day of my life
We were married under cherry trees
Even, even after all these years
Oh you needn't be
That the rain washed away
Although we need each other, things have changed  it's not the same
I know what you're saying
And your truck broke down out in San Antone
'Don't end my life your all I need and darlin' I will never leave never leave'
The only way to catch a butterfly,
Of father can't you see the pieces that have fallen on the ground
The walk has all been cleared by now
Just give me a sign, there's an end with a beginning
Every hour we spent together
Ultraviolence Riviera girls
Sunrise and set are the same to me
Babe, you lost me 
If your horses could talk, I wonder if they would complain
The city of death
Sing the anthem of the angels
Holding tight and try not to hide how I feel
And I've been waiting on my own too long
If you're honest and you say that you did
You're calling too late
So hard to believe
Ans the soil lies awake
The car is on fire, and there's no driver at the wheel
Old friends, memory brushes the same years
Pinch the head off
It's gonna be that you're scared
Oh, in these  hours
I'm working on my faults and cracks
Lying here, lie, lie, lie,
Watching the sun go down
We still have time
Tender nights before they fly
And even though you're gone
Ooh ooh
No one will know
When they're holding you
No stone unturned
Far from all the things that we are
And don't misunderstand me
I need a place where I can make my bed
It's a shame we're all dying
Only particles, some fast, some slow,
And I'm still alive
When our mouths are filled with uninvited tongues of others
And there's nothing that I wanna do for you
It's sad
Live forever, for the moment Melanie CLive forever
Next time I'll keep my hands to myself instead
You must be tired of taking care of me
They're gonna break your heart, yeah
Imagining you there thinking of your future
How to feel
The more you turn away, the more I want you to stay 
Say it's not as it seems
Ada, hold onto yourself by the sleeves
How to fight loneliness
A navy knot with arms at night
And that's when goodbye should be farewell
And the worst part is there's no one else to blame
With your eyes shut you cry in your bed
Well, I won't look back, I won't look back
Means for every point you make your level drops
Right there, right next to you
And she can hardly breathe without you
I don't know what to believe in; you don't know who I am
Take some time and warm it with your hands
Wait until the snow covers me up
The only one
I don't know your face no more
I'll keep on driving these dark highway lines
Dreams of a place with a better selection
And the ticking of the clocks too slow
I know deep inside
Me, I don't show much
But I think I kept your ring
I wake up every morning 
There were times you really made me smile and
Measured in miles
I heard that you were feeling sorry
And I close the door
Now the music divides us into tribes
Then everything falls apart
You left me standing here
In this shape I'm in
Misguided ghosts
The skyline is swinging
Hell is asking to be loved
I don't mean to suggest that I loved you the best
When your eyes are all painted Sinatra blue
But there's someone that I've been missin'
When I dream I dream of your lips
Now all I'm feeling
But for these past few days
Or maybe you just need to treat her better
Moody It's got me x 
And I curse my poverty
And I always find, yeah I always find, yeah I always find somethin' wrong
Together we cry, together we cry
You were not honest
Yeahyeahyeahyeahyeah
Says she's thinking of jumping
And I've tried cutting the ropes,
The papers print his pictures almost everywhere he goes
They remember the people they loved
Even if no one believes us
Never wanted this, never want to see you hurt
Oh I need you to turn me over
Am I bleeding from the storm
Or did I believe this dream
What you need
Listening to the song we used to sing
And I'm wastin' everyday, hey, hey, hey
I love you
Yeah, every time the sun comes up I'm in trouble
I saw you crawling on the floor
If I don't need you then why does your name resound in my head
We lift our hands and pray over your body
When I hear our song
Nothing so ridiculously teenage and desperate, nothing so childish
This empty place
I need your car and I need your love
It's not the kind of ending you'd want to see now
Oh, I'll ride farther than I should
Don't be cross, it's sick I want
And got lost in the sea
Someone's deciding whether or not to steal
The only dad I'd ever know, but pretty soon he'd be gone too
Then her eyes must have closed for what seems an eternity
I am not complete
I start to forget
Come on pigtails, girls and all those sailors
Watching the fox pick off my goldfish from their sorry golden state
Getting your hair from under your bed 
That you are in my life
Then just when we believe we could be great
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him back home again
There's clothes all over my floor
Or maybe were the same
She says, it's only in my head
No one around for miles
He comes dividing man from brothers 
I never once in my sweet short life was waiting for desire
Believe in you
I want to hear the children sing
She was heartache from the day that I first met her
That I would be good, even if I did nothing
Do you miss the blend
There's no justice in the world
A lump in the snow 
And your friends they sing along and they love you
The angel sweet
Though all the world is broken
A net to my hand
His boots no longer by my door, 
So sweetheart, tell me what's up, I won't stop
It's just, your love is like a drug
We were dumb but you were fun, boy
But I need you
I was waiting, waiting to be found oh, no
Thunder and lightning won't change what I'm feelin'
In this vicious world
Payne county line
I wish I had a river I could skate away on
I'm not a fool
And call it true, call it true love
And you said that I was liar and I'm lost somewhere on the inside, forever alone
She was an angel
She will measure and break like a habit
One hundred foot faces
And it's hard, the days just seem so dark
We'd never get anything done that way, baby
And I can still smell summer on your skin,
Walking on air
'Cause when the sun goes down
Guess it's hard as you were meant for me
Keep my love as light as a feather
All the words you write
Just like a child again
The brightest kid in school
'Cause the time I've got's running out
You're home"
I was doing the best that I could
All you have to do is cry
In everlasting peace
I want blood, guts, and angel cake
So walk with me
My life's a circus, circus round in circles, I'm selling out tonight
I don't know how to be something you miss
To wash you off my skin
Told through jealous eyes
Shining 'cross this dark highway where our sins lie unatoned
You know it don't mean shit 
The needle and the thread Won't stitch, won't stitch us
Steel toe caps, takes all your credit cards
I'll stick it out, skin pierced for nothing
Stay with me, baby stay, stay
That it takes to make a perfect love
Barely breathing
You've got me tethered and chained
He lives for love, for women, too
With the windows all closed
Never took no advice
Well they found you and they shipped you up the river the same way
But I know what I have done
Or dashed to bits on the reef
Her weary heavy head in
And violins would play here comes the bride
Take the pain out of love and then love won't exist, oh
From knowing the truth
I'm gonna miss the sound
Do I imagine it, or catch these moments
You held your stopwatch in your left hand
I guess that I miss you
And things we're all too young to know
And where was I before the day
And ice will break
Just countless mistakes
I've seen you a couple of times
The signals grow on radios
Something has left my life
To break my time in two
This is the countdown; they say our time is running out
I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand
You best prepare a speech
U tellin' me that you really need me crying beggin both knees are on the floor
That I left behind
When you're with me, oh, won't you please forgive me
To wait too long, wait too long
For you to be mine
But I fear tomorrow I'll be crying
I'll be waving, I'll be waving goodbye
This is the moment that you know
She said it was in the singing and the strumming
So take me and break me
Like the ones we've wished on
And an open invitation to the blues
And I keep drinking the ink from my pen
Sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground
You'll try and try and one day you'll fly
He just left me low in myself
Well, it's just an invitation to the blues
I know I'm alone now
You can say I've been most all around
So if I seem a little out of it, sorry
And all I ever learned from love
And if I sold my soul 
When not too many people
The way you've done it
Makes you want to cry
'Cause I'm leaving on a jet plane
And it was then I realized that conscience never fades
I thought you could read my mind
And two strangers
It's in the pants you borrowed in the driveway
I let my faith fill the air
To live a lie, it really got me all excited
You got a playboy mommy come home
choppy waves
Would you put on the fire for me,
Given time she may find something better
And we'll never have to listen New haircut
Smacks you in the head
She We never thought of ourselves
All around me is fast moving 
What you've done
The window closes, shock rolls over in a tidal wave
Well a person can work up a mean mean thirst
The sound of failure calls her name, she's decided to hear it out
It's got a hold & really making me wonder
Up to your place
Since the operation I heard you're breathing just for one
We had love but we still said goodbye
Bringing the past with the postcards you sent for me
Danny is not eating, he's drinking and sleeping in;
I've got what it takes
Nobody's fault but my own
Keep my faith even through the darkness, yeah I still believe in love
Remember how we used to dream
Hardened It never was the time for us
I made my baby say goodbye
Where we're living in this town
I'm not calling, I'm not calling
Or if I like what I've begun
We tried to wash our hands of all of this
So let's make this night
And time stopped moving
I'll try to keep my skeletons in
Bye, bye
That strangle the heart 
Or for the sadness
But I will have to say
Spring forward, fall back down
And I'm hearin' what you say but I just can't make a sound
I've been waiting for you so long
She left all her things, well, her books and her letters from him;
I got something to say you know but nothing comes
Oh my love don't fade away
Your envelope and fall to little pieces every time
And he loves her as a girl
I don't need
I can get to my sleep, I can think that we just carried on
With the sidewalk and the pigeons and my window reflection
Motherfucker turned white as a ghost
When I hear beautiful music it's always from another time
Somewhere in London, living with someone
Maybe you're the rainbow
Leaking rain on the phone
Don't you know she's got a I know
Don't come any closer
Gonna make you like the way they talk
She knew the crumpled up promise of this broken down man
And no one ever thinks about you
I chase you just to hear you say
With your charm and in your pride
Though I'm sure you'd remind me if you had to
'Cause this is torturous electricity
She put her fingers in the imprints Ooh
And the moment's magic swept us away
As the smoke clears, I awaken
A loved one laid his head on her lap
So you're gone and I'm haunted
Oh God, I'm gonna die alone
Stray my love what's wrong my love
Bereft the weight of our summer clothes
Everybody knows it 
If I'm going away your hearts coming too
This woman's world
Trouble oh, trouble set me free
When the rain came down and we took cover
Come on and laugh with me
Keep making me laugh, let's go get high
But I know that it's fun to pretend
I know you're looking down from heaven
Because no matter where they take me
You love me for who I am
I cherish you, my dear country
Two can be as bad as one
Sad songs and waltzes aren't selling this year
And a place to stay
The waitress
Love can last forever
But no one
I wanna live life, be good to you
Who died with me
Wholesome
Our unsleepable friend gets the message on an illwind
But you're still fucking peasants as far as I can see
I will breathe in a moment 
By the mountain 
So I keep sleeping
But it's just a roller coaster anyway, yeah
Pretty soon you'll all be singing along
Such a pretty house and
But I work in his factory
You were born inside of a raindrop
Even if I died
Will you leave this empty world
If there's a soulmate for everyone
In a little while I'll be gone
Or have something more to gain
Poison me against the moon
Because she was making it with sisters and brothers
We may be dead and we may be gone
I leave you with photographs, pictures of trickery
Hello, goodbye, you know you made us cry
But some times you lose sight
But the truth is I'm only guessin'
There's nothin' but the rain
This'll be the last package I ever send your ass
The one that keeps the curtains closed
It will all go back 
In the flies and rats
See no use perfecting love with strangers
And it's driving me crazy, it seems
Are we in love Do we deserve
Wash yourself in your tears and build your church
However long you stay, is all that I am
If you once knew
I don't wanna be here alone
Don't you know I tried so hard
Your skin makes me cry
Sadness is a blessing
The window is broken out and the interstate is far
Yes, I know I'll suit you someday
As I wander through this night all alone
And now it's just another lonely day
Oh, to feel for even a second without it
I will die by your hand
On an allnight drive to another world
Wrap around me
All the lovers I've burned through
Your knife will fall out of its sheath 
The neighbors were trying to keep it quiet,
You know it cuts me to the bone
These empty metaphors 
Dear Lord you've took so many of my people, 
Oh, hidyhidyhiding, whatcha trying to prove
In a pipe, fly to the motherland
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
Keep in contact with old friends
Somehow I knew you could never, never stay
Burning through the rainbow
And the dust just settles right there on the feed
And I need you like a heart needs a beat
my days without, 
I'll holla tomorrow
She killed it with kisses and from it she fled
As your mouth moves in mine, soft and sweet
Lord knows when the cold wind blows, it'll turn your head around
Frost killing hour
Child, nothing's right, if you ain't here
I am from the moon, I am from the moon, I am from the moon,
I swore I'd never feel like this again
Like a bad tempered prom queen at a homecoming dance
This is the part of me that thinks that ants are cavemen
I am not your friend
The world's a funeral, I run with ghosts
Favours for favours, fond but not in love
He said Is this the return to Oz
Came to this world by ceasarian section
I don't want pity, just a safe place to hide
When the stars would fill the sky
And if we all believe in heaven
But I can't get my head around it
I'm not weeping because you won't be here to hold my hand
That I love you
I gave you everything to die with a smile
You could see me breathing
I feel like I am watching everything from space
But that's life, so social
And would he be stronger than his father
Just miles and miles of endless road
And I am staying right beside you
It's harder everyday
He asked us what our favorite work of art was
But I don't care for myself
I've looked in the chest where I thought it should be
It was rare, I was there
You are the blood of me 
I'm working on my backwards walk
I didn't feel angry or depressed, I didn't feel anything at all
Were always done in such a hurry
It takes guts to be gentle and kind
Stupid shit you just play
I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick
In the darkness of the storm
A broken promise
The tune upon his lips has passed 
O children
After all these years wrestling gators 
Go ahead tell me you'll leave again, you'll just come back runnin'
Oh, maybe I came on too strong
I've fallen down
And when she left me for you, I was the last to know
Hoping you're someone I used to know
Not pushing you down and all around
And how can you mend this broken man, yeah
How can I try to love someone new
He left with my heart
When there's fuckin' change in my pocket
So search for an excuse
Sometimes a man must awake to find that, really,
Won't let me be 
My love GLORIA is love
It'd fly and leaped like a black spider between your legs
Take my hand and my
Try to hold back my tears
And you got to be so strong
Now that the dreams have given all they had to lend
London, did you have to take my child away
It's not over till it starts again
I never meant to let you go
I feel unhappy, I feel so sad
I'm talking and talking
Afraid to love
By blood and by me, and I'll fall when you leave
Are all my old friends gonna leave me and die
One just escapes, one's left inside the well
The wicked are vultures
My brother's first child
Rise to the top
So far This face in front of me
I won't walk out until you know
With a different house and a different name
You firefly, you tiny boat, with oars
Now the game's been fought
Never knew love like this
Listen to me, don't walk that street
Throw me tomorrow oh, oh
To see the damage I've done
I'm not the cheap one, lookin' at me son, you ain't lookin' at free
'Cause I love you, whether it's wrong or right
Photographs and brightly colored paper 
Once my life was plain and clear
And your hair smells of smoke
And bulletproof
Heart and soul, I will
As heard on  Baron Von Bullshit Rides Again
I'm exhausted
I hope you're finally gone
He left at dawn, 
Than I ever was with her
From up and down and still somehow
I'm goin' to a town
Oh yeah, said I felt so happy, my my my
And I may seem unashamed
Brokenhearted girl, no, no
Everything that I owned starts to pile up
But the day after is darker
And you'll look me in my eyes and call me your friend
Darning his socks in the night when there's nobody there
And it's all because she don't want things to change
That's what I was tryin' to do
Ah, it was sweet
You see your breath in the air
Museums mark their bodies down
Oohoohoohooh
You draw lightning from the sky"
Dreamt of marimbas made from the bones of our relatives,
And high school girls with clear skinned smiles
And 'neath her window have I stayed
Stars shined on my back as I slept and knew you
Cannonball off the porch side
Where is someone
I only read one page and then put it away
Know there was something that meant something that I left behind
In case it is the last time
Would you believe that no one, no one ever told us about the sorrow
But this you, you surely knew
Two heavenly spirits
If there's any other way, I'll do anything for you
So deliberate so determined
When in the garden and 
I suffer the dreams of a world gone mad
They can come and tear my house down
Forever you'll be right here with me
Plump bodies blotting out the sky
Kills you when you are young
Ten guys on whom I can depend Thought you were my boyfriend
So, I wanna live in a wooden house
I try to pay attention
A face that dances and it haunts me
You're just somebody that I used to know
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
That you're no fun
Hunting by the rivers through the streets
Leave all your love and your longing behind
You say it is much more than just my last mistake
There's enough for everyone
Such a lonely day should be banned
But everything's the same this town is pitiful
But the thing is I love you now
Conceived on an island in the sun
In the classroom, you were teachin'
Waking up, it's rarely worth it
This is because I can spell confusion with a K 
Since you took your love away
I've got a hurricane inside my veins and I want to stay forever
From all of the tears you have shed all of the tears you have shed
I'm two cups into my coffee break
I am crying, a part of me is dying and
Just to show life's not made of gold
I've seen that road before
I'll do a dance to make the rain come
I'm under the gun again
It's not his fault he doesn't know your face,
Difficult not to feel a little bit
Saying goodbye this time, the same old story
He'll know all that has spoiled in your heart
Every second of my life I only live for you
I need to be alone
You've still got some loyal disciples
In those basements made of music
Why love gets up and goes
Trains derail
Of the high shoes of the old friends
Let's see how fast this thing can go 
Threw my smoke down on the ground
Some still believe he was freed from her
You'll always be special to me, 
It's been such a long time coming, but I feel good
Place the blame into my arms
Every line,
With the backup, makeshift life in waiting
I never knew my father neither
With a little bit more of innocence
Oh mother, oh mother, oh mother
I go to the window and put down the shade
And I brought home fresh meat for you
Its empty, empty cage
I didn't go to work for a month, I didn't leave my bed for eight days straight
The confessions of a broken heart
I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited  
The windows rattling in the gales
Like you'll never let me go
'Til you come back up in full
The way the light hits your eyes
Return, return, return, return
And those were days of roses, poetry and prose
Steal my love, steal my kisses
I am done, smoking gun 
People from a time when he was everything he's supposed to be
And I'm outside your house
But I don't think I'm ready yet
Spends her light on the Bayou
Every night I hear you calling
But my selective memory won't let me
Then we'll spend our days catching up on life
My worst nightmares became real
In my tangled state of mind
Then they expect you to pick a career
Say yes before I change my mind
That I'd be standing right here talking to you
That's what you said, when you left me
I will leave my mark so everyone will know
Flush my worries down the drain
Cannot pretend to change the fact
But once I hold on once I hold on
I'm tired of calling you, missing you, dreaming I've slept with you
Our love is dead but without limit
Friends we've been for so long
Lately, I've been tryin' to fight whatever's pulling us under
By the way my words were fading 
No I will not leave you crying
Hey, are you awake, yeah, I'm right here
Did he come to save, did he come at all
It's not like the movies
Rather waste some time with you
It makes me very lonely
A true song as real as my tears
With my shirt tucked in and my shoes untied
Stay up for the fight
For a break that would make it okay
Ohoho, I'm sorry for blaming you
And all of your thoughts on God
And there you are on your knees
I walked away and grew old
It dwells and grows and grunts
Don't you know that it's only fear
I thought it was strange when your, car was found
Was really just a song inside my head
You look rather tired, are you pretending to love
Believe me, Adia, we are still innocent
You've long since faded from their eyes
This is a song about Susan
You know I love ya
Dad always told me, "Don't you cry when you're down"
Caught a bolt of lightning
To give my love and repay debts
Just hold me close, don't patronize
I thought we'd leave this for ourselves a hundred times before
Cupped hands whispering into ears
Let's bow our heads
Much too blind to see the damage he's done
I said I hate me, myself and I
I was taught to fight, taught to win
Probably end up a drifter and lonely
I've never been a fan of long goodbyes
I love you so
Love is drunk and love is blind
Sounding only at night as you sleep
This gnarled, weird face
You know they stay on my mind, on my mind
I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I musta missed you
Will you remember me
Oh my, where is my mind
Losing my mind from this hollow in my heart
Only had one call
They're in my skin and my bones
We're talking about our lives,
Hate is spitting out each others mouths
Children waiting for the day they feel good
Then you find you jumped the gun
All that you've loved
And she's always gone too long
Sometimes everything is easy
Turned my head and I heard the sound, that reminded me
I'll meet you on the other side
Mephistopheles is just beneath
For making circles and telling lies
I know that you are not mine
Ahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeah everything changing
I know why you cry out
There isn't anything you can do
I cried so many, many nights
When we cheat and we lie
And we'd still be ruled by our dueling perspectives
And I don't think I'll make it through
One is the loneliest number that you'll ever know
But never is a promise and I'll never need a lie
You didn't leave it all
And everybody's gone at last
Don't sacrifice your plan
If they find me racing white horses
When told he'll give you money if you just pray the right way
But I don't see, either 'cause I live across the street
As this tiny voice in
And freer and broil and toil and foil die
I don't know why I trusted you but I knew that I could
I know it sounds lame but it's so true
That I've been messing around
You never thought of anyone else, you just saw your pain
Here, take these before we run away
I'm gonna run to the river
Yea when my world is falling apart
I loved you
Ahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeah everything changed me
I buried nails and string and hair
Oh I love you Amy
Under my skin sodium pentathol
It's coming apart again
I thought we'd be flying together
We were strangers many hours and I missed you for so long
I'm a friend
For the glory boys at your bedside will love you
Do you wish I was there
Two feet standing on a principle
Everything I want is free
It feels empty and alone
And though I've tried to lay her ghost down
Don't let the forest grow over that path you came there by
"Sorry" like the angel heaven let me think was you
Beautiful round face, so ashamed
I hope, I love you all my life
In silence row him, row him
And I miss the love we shared
I wish I was special
To keep the world at an arm's length
Remember the good times that we had
That you're gone away
Oh and I don't have a show to say, yes, and I sin every single day
A little blubber in my igloo, yeah
It all becomes clearer now
I can't say anymore than "I love you"
"All By Myself" would sure hit me hard now that you're gone
But I'm the one that's drowning now
Don't throw your hand
Will you wait for me
I look at that open road
Why don't you hold me
And the melody's gonna make me fly
To find the house where we used to stay
I'll be right there 
I say burn all of your bridges
'Cause I need you back by my side
I hold my breath
It's gonna hurt
Seems I'll never wake from this nightmare,
I lost myself in pain
And I'm still waiting for the rain to fall
Binding promises were made
You'll say I'll need appeasing when I start to cry
She usually comes right in, now I can tell
Will you walk into the grave with me
I hate my life, hold on to me
Will you still love me when I shine
And I found myself attached to this railroad track
Hear the nighthawk call
Watching the waves dragging out of our reach
You don't even know the topic
Where are you when I need you
But darling you hold me prisoner prisoner
I wanna come in from the cold
So take your fast car and keep on driving
So take me to the heavens now
Good good bye, lovely time
Wondering if I really tried everything I could
I'm all alone
In these last days
You're gonna lose what you love the most
City of strangers
It's hard to make that change
He tried hard to help me, you know, he put me at ease
I just might die with a smile on my face, after all
God is wearing black
When they saw that the explosives in the cargo hold
That it may seem unkind
Safe to say from here, you're getting closer now 
One more time  I promise after that, I'll let you go I promise that let you go
So kiss me and smile for me
Cold wind
While I go to sleep and I dream all night
What a shame, what a shame
You are pulled from the wreckage
And you'll grab that piece of gold
There's something here
On the bleakest of morns he'll break at your rocks
Our social graces have been displaced
Together we cry, cry, yeah, yeah
I'm like the desert tonight
You told me you loved me
Phone's off the hook
My Cheshire cat doorstop with tears in your eyes
Am I the girl that you dream of
I'm a fool for you
Hindley wakes and says
Her boyfriend was her cousin, now let's watch the joy end
I was here;
The bombs go off, she doesn't notice
Your death creates success
The tour was over, we'd survived
To the lighthouse my friend
She makes me bad
No tears in my eyes
Ohooh
That I would be good if I lost my hair and my youth
She didn't say a word, just walked away
She comes around you and me
But I can remember
'Cause I knew he'd never love me back
We'll not undo what has been done
They steal the gravity, yeah
When things go wrong I sing along
Remember how it was
The clocks chime
For the reason to see the pain through
It passes by my window
I can't take it anymore, I'll die
Without granting innocence
So please hit me
I was sticking up for my friend
Where all you can do is grit your teeth
Although my clothes are all wet, tell me
No, I'm not sorry if I do insult you 
So take a look at me
I never did find my way back
And the cool guys that you spent them with
Rejoice because you're trying your best
Isn't it a pity, isn't it a shame
Every time I try to fly, I fall 
Cause the only thing I can see is her elegance
I still believe
Still life
Friends who don't have a clue
All the people you knew were the actors
Someday you will die
Is lost and numb
You don't know how lucky you are
I don't want nobody else
A week in the forest
That there's anything worth trying to save
Out of the air
Oh I love you oh
'Cause every night I'm talking to the moon
What you thought this song meant 
A walk across the water with pretty Mary K
That leads to your door
The sky is your blue kingdom
My brother had a daughter
And we drive
Say a word or two to brighten my day
Well I have learned to let you go
I need you, I don't need you
It's been ages since I necked it, and smoked six tabs to the nub
I won't settle on  hours
You don't wanna stay in
It made me miss you oh so bad 'cause
So sad but it's true
Never knew pain like this
Oh I wish I could have told him
I did, I've done
I'm still remembering the pain
Baby let's stop and sleep for a spell
All shall fade to black 
Just like in a storybook
Just make her smile come back and shine, just like it used to be
Go back to your chamber, your eyes upon the wall
Trapped in the eyes of a stranger
No love to set us free
I feel I'm knockin' on Heaven's door
Never let it go, oh yeah
Hey, let me in
When the TV has gone out
Turning out your lights 
missing you so much, 
You can't turn back the tide, ain't that a shame
You're a cause of sorrow
Break my heart
Try it for sleeping instead
Let's be alone together
How the end always is
I would fall asleep
To be my sunshine after the rain
Who'll hover over you beneath the sun
You're asleep when I get home
All the words I need to hear
Warm canals and pools clear blue
I don't expect anything
Take your psycho little dogs
Our world under command
Mmm that it's all for the best Of course it is
Picks up the letter that's lying there
And I will be right next you
But you can't say I'm not trying
Now she's feeling more alone
Reduced to ashes and wine
Who said that I wasn't right
My fingers sting 
Ten different ways to enjoy this night 
I will give my life
Between the lines of fear and blame
I'll be waiting
Oh what a beautiful world
To everything you are 
You thought we'd be fine
The dog days are done
All I pare off to a road
Try not to pretend
To the point It never was the time to let me in
Will you ever slow down Will I ever come first
And find out they're empty
I left in the top drawer
But Julie knows a party at some actor's westside loft
Now I'm bound by the life you left behind
here everything is worse 
Where justice he delays is always justice he denies
Pace mine for you, hold my horses, patience
Hello, world, hope you're listening
See the wind come to my eyes
Where I'm tossing and tortured till dawn
Leave me alone a little while
Best friends can become strangers
Everybody cries
Cause love is a mystery
Looking ahead
The wind was slowly melting
Where I used to sit
When they say you're not that strong
She went down down down there into the sea
Smoking too much and drinking
Honey won't you hold me tight Honey won't you hold me tight
To make sense of the signs
The telephone number I got from you says nobody's home 
I can't sleep next to a stranger when I'm coming down
And the streets are jammed with cars
It was in the march of the winter I turned seventeen
And how broken my heart is
When you lose something you can't replace
I try to keep you sheltered from it, but somehow it seems
Watching terrible TV, it kills all thought
There's no end to the love you can give 
The hidden law of a probable outcome 
And I smiled cause I'd known it all along
What have I become My sweetest friend
That you feel while listening to every word that I sing
Lost, lost, lost my mind
Trying to change the whole wide world
And I'm too young to care 
For wild is the wind, wild is the wind
There's not much left to believe in
And all of these things remember these
By the time you realized I was dying
All the things that you wanted for me
He says, "When you gonna make up your mind
To shine a light on your life
My mother's glamour lives on and on
No use sayin' nothin'
Push a blade into my hands
Holdin' on, the days drag on
Like a bird on a wire
About your Jesus, and how not to look back
Now you live in the trees and salty seas tripping out in the blue skies
Why wasn't God there for
I remember the times we spent together
Your body's warm but you are not
Oh you bloody mother fucking asshole
It hurts to hear
No, I couldn't help but fall in love again
It's like a car crash happening on my street
Promises made, every memory saved as reflections in my mind
Look lovely
Will you be my love
I'm not made of successful things
'Cause every place I go I take another place with me
You got tears making tracks
It must be your skin I'm sinkin' in
Wir haben die Wahrheit
And sitting by the stream
And all those things you said that night
That cuts me with every couldhavebeen
Painted portraits of minions and slaves, crotch mavens and onenight plays
What you wait for never shows
And I confess that I'm only holding on by a thin thin thread
A midnight blue, day and night
Don't stop talkin' to me please
No one really cares where I go
We've got a light here that's not going away
And she locked the car and slipped past
He doesn't think is funny 
Kill anyone for you
Which many others struggled to believe
And you should have seen the look on your face
"Mom, please wake up, dad's with a slut
Like two strangers
And nothing like I thought you could've been
You used to shine so bright
I wasn't good at being a thief
Mom, Dad I'm just missing you now
But the thought of you
Final call,
But late one night you threw them down
We might take it home
And I may find in time that you were always right
rain fall 
Old long since gone
But it's a long walk and the music is loud
Laying in this cold field
Smiling faces I can see
Some nights, I just never go to sleep at all and I stand
All alone
Bend this way
Snuck up behind me and jumped on my shopping cart
Never dream of you again
Well, I only wanna make things right, baby,
I know I can't change the way you feel
You had changed your mind
Echoing your voice just like the ringing in my ears
Inside this weary head I just want us to love instead
No never have I turned to any other man
Almost as if to say
Somethin' warm, flowin' through my eyes
Yeah, this is a song about the way things are
Fireworks and hurricanes
In the body of a violin
Sunday night, when I cleaned the house
Do you even wonder if we're alright
It's turning around, it's up to me
Like clouds in the sky
'Cause we are born innocent
Take me home
If you're needing something I can give
I stand outside this woman's work
And I should have given you a reason to stay
I never needed you for judgement
Held their face for eternity
Standing there in the graveyard while the moon sprays it's fireworks in your hair
Down in the sleep at the airplane races
I'm at the finish line and you're just way too far behind
For all of the loved ones gone
He was young just like me,
Won't you be the new one Burn to shine 
Your tears are only alibis 
And please don't drive me blind 
Where are you tonight
And it's not a cry that you hear at night
Last seen with friends wishing them well
We cried we lied
Where whitey bastard made a bomb
The longer we ignore it all the more that we will fight
Ik wees was Sie jetz denken  dat denken viele Aber ik bins nich
And baby, only then do I let myself recline
It's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me
You'll always be my Konstantine 
I thought we'd be happy together
But tonight we'll set you free
Will you try to live the way in which you speak
See who am I to say this situation isn't great 
Maybe on the rainbow
This clock is opening another door
No chance of escape, now selfemployed
Or mistakes
My heart is in my shoes, yeah
I regret my past
And as you are you'll be again
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride
It's not the storm before the calm
So I remember when we were driving, driving in your car
I wish you thought I was the reason you are in the world
By your resonating light
Than a mirror
A thousand faces we'll choose to ignore
And if it makes you cry, look ahead, dry your eyes
Came to my mind I should paint it with a pen
I walked a thousand miles just to slip this skin
It's cold as you face into the wind
I feel like the breeze will pick me up and carry me away 
For something real
Don't say you need me if
It's no cause for concern
For this love game's expensive
Ah, look at all the lonely people
Oh heart of steel, I can't let you win
And it's the only thing worth knowing
It's every players favourite crime, to make you feel
I can't keep my eyes open
Standing over your head
But all I've ever learned from love
Musky tear, suitcase
We'll work it out
When the night comes, when the night comes loose
I told him don't curse me
Twistin' and turnin', we're all intertwined
You catch me 'cause I'm falling down on you
Told me not to worry, "you were just a shooting star"
I dreamed about you, baby
These wasted Blues
'Cause my days were rough
Strung out again
My dear Johnny, my dear friend
But the simple word "love" itself
Or paralyze in light
I've got tears that are scared of the facts
And take you home into the night
Padraic my prince, I have all but died
Wipe my nose, get my new boots on
To spend my life in spitting distance of the love that I have known
It's been six months and still no word, I don't deserve it
Under your fate
We fell through the ice when we tried not to slip, we'd say
Many times 
Shshshshshshame
Like to say I've got no past
That I would be grand if I was not all knowing
Are we just going to wait it out
Like the sky on summer days
He says "I'd rather switch with you
I watched the whole thing fall
Spin me around till I fell asleep
Your mama's got a new man, your daddy always fails
Say goodbye to Alexandra leaving
So much stuff you got to understand
To find a way to say that life has just begun
Don't want to hear you say
Before this same awakening world
Everything's plastic, nothing's real push people
How could you send us so far away from home
My body lies inside its grave
And I see stars and I reel again
I couldn't ever love you more
Under what spell the guiding light
And there is a barber, who's cutting and cutting away at my only joy
Who's gonna be the one
Apologize for all my sins
Rejoice despite the fact this world will hurt you
I said sometimes I hear my voice and it's been
What a wicked thing to do
Then back in the car
To leave, believe it
But I still hope
I hang on every word
It comes to me in fragments, even those still split in two
But it's crossed my mind
The test results tell you nothing at all,
A prayer gone blind
You're like my fire
I thought we'd walk these streets together
Dear God the only thing I ask of you
'Cause we have nothing left to weather
What hurts the most
I got to live with the choices I've made,
I was alone for the last time
I wish I could mean this but here's my goodbye
Down the stairs, you were there
I know I'm not always all that strong
And in that woman
Into eternal space
No alarms and no surprises
A white light glowing below
Well, I remember how she left me on a stormy night
Your ilk is funny to the turnstyle touch bunny
If you don't wanna tell me you love me babe
Your sorrow's your goldmine 
With what I wanna say but
In fact that's where music comes from
A picture of you holding a picture of me
Oh, you had me, honey and me, oh, sun and the moon
Sorry now that you've fallen from my eyes
Because this veil is has been lifted
He took a suite of rooms
Well today is grey skies,
Forget all the things I should have said
Days grow longer and nights grow shorter
Goodnight to every little hour that you sleep tight
From the corner of First and Amistad
I live in a trailer home with a snowmobile, my car
If I wait for you longer my affection is stronger I,
I don't feel alright in spite of these comforting sounds you make
Now there's no time to start anew
I can't let go
And the seas open up to me
Crawl back into bed to dream of a time
I can just look up
Handcuffed hard to the wheel
There's nothing left for me
Hey child, things are looking down
There's no one laughing at your back now
He will admit to everything
Your picture out of time
Break my wings and fall
And don't you mention all the good there would be
In the pain there is healing
If I can call you and tell you I care
And that's all right aww baby
But no one's in your head
Oh, does she love you
It's true I always wanted love to be
I know the world is black and white
I need your money, it'll help me
But I always come around
Well death may come invisible
How did it come to be
And I hear the others all whispering, "Come home"
People have the right to fly
And I'm thinking about those days
I'll break off my own arms and
The shadowlands 
Nothing to ruffle your ends
Believe you're gone
Paperback scrawl your hidden poems
There's a shadow hanging over me
Wash the blood off your hands
All these years gone by
When I'm kneeling at your feet
She says, love's not a hostile condition
What you have shown to other eyes
Eyes are red and tears are shed
I don't want to feel anymore for you
And there are melodies in the air
Won't have to fight for long
'Cuz nothing else matters, oh
I take it on the road
If only I would wait
I closed the ranks, and I doubled back
You are the one You are the one You are the one You are the one
But there is trouble ahead, I can feel it
Suckled on the hope in light brassiere
So plant the thought and watch it grow
Goodnight, sleep light, stranger
The rain was warm and soaked the crowd
You know I need some understanding 
Turn my head, turn my head
Nobody's seeing red
And I'm thinking about a brand new hope, the one I've never known
And telling me how sorry you were
It's far too bright for you
Oh cause you got inside my head
'Cause you just don't love me no more
And the license said you had to stick around until I was dead
Trying to beat up the faults in my head
And it may take some time to patch me up inside
The only thing I want to believe
Then I could hurt you in the end
When the road is full of nails
And I'm sorry, there's nothing more that I can do
It's only tears that I'm crying
I don't care about what they say
So many words for the broken heart
It falls apart
Crying in the peaceful night
When I showed up and he was there
At the turn of the tide, is withering thee
Those angels can't ever take my place
The house, the house where
When I see them try to fly
The ticking, and the western man's need to cry
The scenario is grave but I'll be braver when you save me
Together we cry, we cry, we cry
To kill the sound
Nice to hold when I'm tired
Mother made In the shadows will to become their pride
And you're not happy, but you're funny
Red roses fell to the floor
Falling away from you, no chance to get back home
Oh, all our love fell down to Earth
The battle becomes blinding
Can't breathe too well
When I was lost I even found myself
You were the one I loved
I was a river, I was a tall tree, I was a volcano
When the woman was only a girl
You making me lose pay, a social worker's here everyday
He came back the other day
It was exactly there
I will leave this town just to sleep underneath your bed
And hold me now,
The test results tell you nothing at all
All things have a place
Than the bells of new love
Walking up the hill tonight
You told me you would never, never forget
Worse than the fear it's the lie you told a thousand times before
Decided to end it all
I was afraid to be alone,
All my time I've waited
Where are you dad
And I, well if I ever caused you trouble
We'll just sit around like broke down cars in the lot waiting for repairs
It might be my only right
And ice cream castles in the air
'Cause feelings mean nothing
Is to be home
One thing I would never
You're well out of order now, this is well out of town
And what are you left with
I know the way you feel
That once we said goodbye
I'll say, "You haven't met me, I am the only son"
Now I see your face in the strangest places
On his frozen face
You haven't changed
To keep her sorry tongue from any speaking
We all need the person
Everyone says you just gotta let it go
And negativity lands
Sons are like birds, flying always over the mountain
Only one of you
The moon is low tonight
But still, you've not passed by door
And in the arms of endless anger
The hospital asked should the body be cast
The world is sleeping, I am numb
Now I'm breaking down your door
Love the way you're waiting
When we break, we'll wait for our miracle
Carried cheap perfume onto your dresser
For ye and me it turned
Please lead her to the mountain 
I haven't talked to him, in  years
And in that town there's
'Cause you broke all your promises
I'll walk you till your fears are numb
Overcome and completely silent now
And I want to keep burning
You kill me, you've got some nerve but can't face your mistakes hey hey, hey hey
I could stay or leave
As your solitude subsides
I don't want you back
All I can see is low, it's glow seems so far
And left me all alone
Minä kaipaan eskimoystävääni  I miss my eskimo friend
Just make me fall apart
If you turn the bad in me into good again
Hear water ebbing with her breath
But when I dial the telephone
If you dress me up in pink and white
I open my eyes 
Are you feeling lost and lonely
Goodbye, my almost lover
Somebody leave the light on
My mother
And I will love this love forever
All my lovers were there with me
I got too possessive but souls ain't for stealing
I loved you all so
For sure it's the valley of death
I rush to intensive care
It's bold and dark, girl, can't you see
But please remember me, my misery
He's in pain and misery
I walk in a trance
It was peeled off of the wood
Tell me when did the light die
Their voices dry and hollow
'Cause the good thing is coming
'Cause we were in love
Too many bitter tears are raining down on me
I dreamt a hydrant
Lost much sooner than you would have thought
To your house
You can take everything I have
For my love is like the wind
Slipped my mind that I could use my brain
There's something I've learned 
'Cause you're waiting for me
Under whose gaze did fall such evil blunder
I guess that's love
Over one last time
'Cause I'm all alone again
I don't need much of anything 
Sail us to the moon
Wanting me to come over and keep you busy
Since the day that I left her
Oh help me please is there someone who can make me
Come on skinny love, what happened here
The world was wide, too late to try
The first tree will not blossom 
And you'll realize that you love me, yeah
Ooh, the people I've met
He could not choose one
Stephanie says that she wants to know
It's the thought of him undressing you or you undressing
Promise you our love will carry on
It was so simple in the moonlight
Did they get you trade your heroes for ghosts
At attention, looking backward in a pool of water
From the passenger seat as
I've seen sunny days that I thought they would never end
I just don't get enough to believe that we've both changed 
To pull you up on to dry land
It is a foreground
I don't need words
I just don't think I'll ever get over you
Viktor was born in the spring of '
Love you so it hurts my soul
Hey would you say, "Whatever, we're blanket friends"
And prays to hear him say "No more
Oh well now what's the point in doing all of that
I got all my fives
Some of them got closer than others
To let me dream of you
Don't wanna try don't wanna try don't wanna try no more
I'm not the new kid, on the block
Or keeps them safe behind your teeth
Clouding the truth, both of us knew
Every mess that I made
Has summer gone so slowly
And life is so cruel without you here beside me
Losing a limb, his better half 
So sleep alone tonight
And in my hour of darkness she is standing right in front of me,
Well you held me like a lover
All full of wine the world before her
You put in my hand a loaded gun
Sacrifice, sacrifice
Daddy's writing this song, this song ain't gonna write itself
So receive me, brother, with your faithless kiss
That the end of the century 
And I can't live with myself today
And I hold you and I kiss you
'Cause now she's left me crying on the shoulder of the motorway
I am a man whose dreams have all deserted
Lights flash before our eyes
Like a drunk in a midnight choir
My twitching muscles tease my flippent thoughts
The lie will unfurl
You knock on her door
As I take my last breath
They said they'd be here they said, they said in the corner,
Call it predictable, yesterday my dream was of you
People would stop to hold 
Here comes the rain again, falling from the stars
If you want money in your pocket
You wanna see the other side
And make him feel this pretty burn
Sing to me, sing to me
This is me all alone
Just to stay in the corner of you heart
To the story of me and you
Give it all away, to have someone to come home to
My muscles feel like a melee, my body's curled in a "U" shape
I will see you in the next life
And as for the clouds
The lady at the counter said There ain't no flights
I did him wrong
Wasn't it written all over my face, yeah
Thinking nothing, thinking nothing at all
Your hair, it's everywhere
There ain't no ifs, buts, or maybes,
Even though I'm the sacrifice,
So many things remind me of you
But he looked a bit like me
Finished if who we are incomplete 
I need a plane ride,
Everybody's gone
I'm sad not sorry 'bout the way that things went
Who they are again
Many times I've been alone
I, I, I, I did it, all right, alright, I admit it
It's the last goodbye I swear
Like a knight from some oldfashioned book
'Til her eyes became sore
The thought of all the stupid things I'd said
I promise one day I'll come back for you
Remember today
So is it wrong to toss this line
Is just a habit Save Me from myself
I feel the beating of your heart
Thanks for all you've done
I think I kinda like it but I might have had too much
Share with me
throwin' rocks in front of us
You see, the moon is bright in that treetop night
All that is left is an empty shell
Before the world fell at our feet
I've been waiting but oh tonight,
Better off as the fool
Well now she's gone, even though I hold her tight
Leave your fear in the fray
Phone ringin' off the shelf
Living your ghost
Chase his fears away
I'm holdin' on I'm still holdin'
Bring my baby back home
People all grow up to die
Hope so much your race will be all run
Yeah, I've made that mistake before
Come back and haunt me
Been three whole days since I've had sleep
Standing in your shoes I turn
I roll the window down
And I won't be far from where you are if ever you should call
The way things go
Are played in loops 'til it's madness in my head
Good good bye, I'll be fine
Try to forget how you've been touched
Believe me there was truth in all those stories that I told
And your dad set his jaw
Lying here in your warm embrace
Ship it out and turn it into fuel
That we'd already lost each other, we both knew that the end was near
I thought that I found myself under something new
I had a really bad dream
The crack of radios seems close enough to touch
Party in the sky
Sorry, my headphones fell off
Won't cry these tears anymore
And I can't stay this mad for long
For all that you've done and still do together we always move on
Yeah, they're talking back
When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears
When you stole the car and drove towards Mexico
We're all of us stars, we're fading away
And we all end together
But it will be a different "kind"
Returned with that drama and stress
Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds
When you've got to go on waiting
To anyone about anything 'cause it's all been done remember
In circles 'round the well and where it spells
Stop start, what's our mission
"I'll be going through withdrawal of you for this one night we have spent"
There are no signs and there are no stars aligned
I love you madly
Yeah, we all got wood and nails
I guess there is nothing to do, oh well
And I know it ain't fair, but we just don't care
And quickly replaced
You said you weren't afraid to die
You've got to understand it's a hard life
They just want me gone
When in fact we're slip slidin' away
And rejoice despite the fact this world will kill you
So far from home
If there's one memory I don't want to lose
Call it mystery or anything
Wow, guess you pretty much are and daddy's still here
I hitched a ride with my soul by the side of the road
The wrong incline 
Dear Isobel, I hope you're well, and what you've done is right,
On the Chalmers in the flat one bedroom apartment
I never thought I could fail
With the strobe of the sun and the life I've led
When there was two 
Watch you disappear, yeah oh
Let me put on a show for you, daddy,
In several more years no one will care
We should all wear two lifesaving layers
Go or go ahead and surprise me
Of my heart that is crushed
That you fight and you stay crying every night Oh baby
Désolé, if someone is prayin' then I might break out
Hard luck, you've been trying to tame
I've always been in love with
But freedom is just another word
Like a baby stillborn
Now that the cuffs are off
A vision too removed to mention
This used to be my playground used to be
And their tongues are full of heartless tales that drain on you
She finally drank her pain away a little at a time
Will you put my hands away
And I will return
When you walk without ease on these
You'll find another soldier
Tiring of trying 
never take a bath on sundays 
Since you're gone, I sat at home
I'm not answering the phone, let it ring
I saw you outside
No, it's the course of history your position in line
And in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to
I tried to show you just how much I care
Here comes the pain, Here comes me wishing things had never change
And this ship went down in sight of land
Illuminate the "No"s on their vacancy signs
But always know, always know, always know
Upon my face we leave no trace
I thought I had designed for me
Please don't die
Mutta sielussasi  But within your soul
I promise to be good
Under the moon
Maybe I'd be back around
You listen for the truth
And I was green, greener than the hill
She's in your bones
And love dies in your eyes,
I will not take my love away
She wore blue velvet
And my traitors of kind
Blood suckers hide beneath my bed
High above the mountain 
But I'm still trying, to breakout
I'll wait patiently to see you in heaven
And I can't sleep alone at night
'Cause the tempest is out to wrestle a while
Is that alright with you
My belly released the stars and tears between the scars
But he never meant to hurt me
The lone neon lights and the warmth of the ocean
I wait my turn
I wish I was
I say, where are you now
I see your face, it's haunting me 
Baby I got a plan, run away as fast as you can
There's nothing you want me to do
But nothing, I said nothing can take away these blues
It was the moment she took on his name
To die and to keep silent
And you're gonna think of me
I always wait to hear you
I go back to December all the time
Haven't laughed this hard in a long time
It's out of love, ooh
Nothing shines quite as bright
To be so condescending, it's as much as I can take
Our voices in our toeses
Oh rejoice, his eyes are big X's
I've got a sad song in my sweet heart
Where was I
Slipping through our fingers, like the sands of time
She was all right 'cause the sea was so airtight, she broke away
Ain't a love as perfect 
So you tossed me out to the wind
Will you sleep tonight, will you think of me
I hope you're up there with God saying "That's my kid"
Oogie waits for just another day
I was breaking in a case of suds at the Brass Rail
Then you at his house
Sophie only wants to listen to radio BBC
Keep dodging lights
You tell them my name, I got a few friends
As your skin starts a scratching 
Keep me safe inside your arms like towers, tower over me
I'm gonna be gone for good again
Like wildflowers
She says you're not there and I should take care
And sometimes I forgive,
A few more hours
Easing my pride
"No" is the saddest experience you'll ever know
They stood on the stairs
I see signs now all the time
Before you go turn around, let me hold you
Is all that we could ever share if only we could see it
It all sounds well and fine
Remember those who win the game
I feel good enough
That took you farther than you thought
Hold onto my hands
How I wish I could surrender my soul
Your very own lullaby
Telling all the things you hide
I guess it's high time you found out
The birth of a child in the form of a man 
Like you've lost all hope and your sanity
To get closer to Heaven than ever feel whole again
Dear Slim, you still ain't called or wrote, I hope you have a chance
Wake me up when September ends
When all these nightmares become real
If forever is out the door
They can't look me in the eye
That blows out the knots I've got in my long brown hair
We'll get some lighter heads for our heavy hearts 
I still dream, dream
And it's your song
Oh I wish my arms were wider
I'll die in the clouds above and you that I defend I do not love
He bore the mark of pride
Oh Where Where has my heart gone
Almost had a thousand dollars till someone broke in and stole it
Do I have to fall asleep with roses in my hand
Don't think about the choices that you make
Anyone could ignore
She hides in no place
For today is on my mind
I would never say to you
Am I still in your head
Blackbird fly, Blackbird fly
About me and all my dreams lost at sea
It should have been me instead of him in the dark
Whisper words of wisdom let it be
Take care, honey, I know you're under a lot of pressure
Will you stay with me in my time of need
The days I spent so cold, so hungry,
With white elephants, sitting ducks
At any given moment,
Collecting your jar of hearts, tearing love apart
It sounds pretentious but it's true
If I curse
Even though she's only giving me pain
As I look the other way
Swimming through the garbage dump that fills the air
It's time to say goodbye to turning tables
And I know that in the morning
When I think of all my sorrow
I know you want to make her see how much this pain hurts
But what would you change if you could
Returns no more, 
Got his hat tipped bottle back in between his teeth
The clouds shift
Since you're gone there is a lonely heart
Below this same remembering sky
Nothing's gonna change the things that you said
In full command of every plan you wrecked 
With a smile on your face
Wish I were with you, but I couldn't stay
While the world waits for an explosion
We've been around when he gets high
I wanna' make you feel the same
I remember throwing out all of your things
We lost a friend we lost a friend
The seas have gone dry and the rain stopped falling
I remember someone old once said to me
I can't keep pretending that I don't even know you
Yeah, your eyes closed, your head hurts
This anniversary may never be the same
And they are fine and they are good
I swear I have nothing to prove
It must be for real, 'cause now I can feel
He drowns in his dreams
And sometimes when you're on, you're really fucking on
A boy and dog with a clubbed foot
But in my heart I'm always somewhere with you
I can't face your breaking heart
It's better that we break, baby
Dreams of mountains sunk
You are too kind, much too kind
No regrets, they only hurt
'Cause what we got is worth fighting for, 'cause you are
I could wrap you in your favourite clothes
In the way you're walking
Long nights without you have taught me to be strong
Me your love Me your love
Well, I know how much you care
Live forever, for the moment Melanie C Live forever
Where you can always find me
Farewell my black balloon
And tomorrow, I'm gonna listen
Call up an ex to rescue me, climb in their bed
It's like forgetting the words to your favorite song
Pitch burning on a shining sheet
With lovers and friends, I still can recall
I would say it was your best line ever
With no need to be strong
It's the end of a broken heart x
And now there's a robot that lives in my brain and he tells me what to do
If I do recall now, the smell of the rain
And moonlight would provide the spark
Even though going on with you gone still upsets me
Things start splitting at the seams and now
Mr False Pretense, you don't make sense, I just don't know you
Oohoohoohooh, believe me, momma
Shining like stars and screaming
Shakin' dust from my shoes
Can you help me Hold me
I I can't see nothing, nothing, round here
No one laughing at God in a hospital
I keep the wolf from the door
Please, please come and save me
And you have closed your eyes
At who I've become
But now I feel changed around, and instead of falling down I'm standing up the morning after
And there'll be no crying soon
My eyes are soaked all way through
With a knife in her hand
You'll be sad to hear that
So the house might dissolve,
Ice water for blood
She's been running through my dreams
And he never seems to notice
When you're sad when you're lonely and it all turns out wrong
The stumbles and falls brought me here
And when we pray we keep it short
The brightest flame burns quickest"
Don't be scared it's over now, I swear
Why did you try at the choice
And prays to hear him say "I love you"
Take another face, you will be kissed again
You won't feel any
I look to my Eskimo friend
If you ever get back to Hackensack
And the God of Wine is crouched down in my room
Dropping her petals in pain unknown
Mind, the war child
"Live and love"
I'm staring at the mess I made,
'Cause I don't want to leave home
Sayin' let me walk away, please
She kills me with rose garden thorns
So come on, come on
Rain clouds come to play again
And my old friends, I can remember when
'Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud
And this is more than love
No one laughs at God when their airplane starts to uncontrollably shake
You put my shine to shame
But now that it's come
Spirit falls from grace
You're falling, you're screaming
I'm about to break
Lady lights a cigarette, puffs away, no regret
A melody, a memory, or just one picture
Warm and steady as she rests
They're just paper cuts
My leather glove gripped the wheel
You're spring to me, all things to me
Get your bags and hold down
I've got to live with them rest of my life
And just watch your face
Don't want to be alone
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya
But what I do is always come back to you
Maybe someday you'll look up
I buried nails and strings and hair
City lights lay out before us
And no one
How can our love be true
No one cares if you live or die
It's time that I got moving on
Tonight's for fighting
My life is changing in so many ways
I was drunk in a phone booth
I didn't mean to waste your time
Dust and water, water and dust
No one ever listens, this wallpaper glistens
And we both of us knew how the ending would be
In your head
But that'll never change the way that I feel
That can mesmerize the soul
We were too dumb to run, too dead to die
And I'm sailing downstairs to the northern line, watching the shine of the shoes
I know you said you don't believe
But now it's time to get out of the desert and into the sun
The time will never come to slip away
In the morning, I'll call you
It isn't all it seems
And you who had the honor of her evening,
They left me dizzy, oh, won't you please forgive me
Hold on, hold on no, no, no, no, no
If I say look away
On their shoulder
You think she needs you
But I came home early
And while we're sleeping all the streets get rearranged
I break in two over you,
And say I love you too
A fight that never ends
So you've got a playboy mommy
Blame it on apartheid
Like the one that I saw on the screen
Noone who wants you could want you more
I could smile for a while
Now I'm waiting for a hand
It's Spring and Hailie's outside swinging, I walk right up to Kim and kiss her
They both walked through that door without me
And I told you to be fine
Will be of service to keeping you away
I'm waiting for you
Ain't the roof or the doors
'Cause those fire birds are
It's more than just words, it's just tears and rain
Would you feel the same
Let's talk it out
I'm stumbling off drunk, getting myself lost
And so he called her on the telephone
And put nightmares in your hands
Beats the hell out of mine here
Only now it seems so silly
Now I've gone and lost the best baby that I ever had
Leaving on a jet plane 
In death I will survive
Looked in on my fairy pet
So if someone could help me now
That I leave early in the morning 
Can you make it feel like home
Been around the world, in many situations
Round and round and round and round and
Shot through with starlight
For a child cries
Now I guess I should've listened
Something is glowing
And walk away,
She wonders if he'll even remember
The chance to
I swear I didn't mean
Was making Russian children glad
I'm thinking no yeah
I had a dream
When fools are mistaken for men
As long as I keep my distance 
And I've thrown my words all around
Give me something
So I turned to run
Somebody tell me, how can a loser ever win
Would you dare to let it go
Baby, I'll try again, try again
And the billboards are all leering
As the curtain comes down I feel that this is just goodbye for now
I am a dreamer and when I wake
The shadow in the background of the morgue
To find some beautiful place to get lost
To believe in all the meaning of all the bad dreaming
If spring can take the snow away
Last night I dreamt
Would you pray for me
Nothing real love can't undo
And we danced, and we drank
Our girl is gone
We'll welcome the New Age
She hangs herself in front of me
I rip my heart out
The best friend that eluded you lost in time
Why did you think I did not on this rely
And told you
No matter what they told you, you're not alone
Goodbye to you
In the ballroom of my mind
And part of me still believes we can find a way to work it out
And pain was the price you paid
But I'm not too good at that shit
I'll take the fall, fall for you
I've been here waiting patiently
Lay down your arms and I will lay down mine
But I gotta find more than what's happening with you
Baby, what about the ending
I'm looking for a sign
Parading in a wake of sad relations
Creo que alguna vez fui infiel, 
The columns are all men begging to crush me No shapes sail on the dark deep lakes
Walking circles around me
You're a big boy now, so let's not talk about growth
You took care of the cat already
When I kissed you on the mouth
Shine like stars, shine like stars
So let somebody else devise a cure for it 
That was Wisconsin, that was yesterday
Release my whole desire
'This feeling always goes
When she gets that call, Hope's too far gone
Don't just let it pass on through ya
Withering where some snowman was
And that'll be me someday
Set things right between us
We woke up one morning and fell a little further down
It's time that we got this flaunting down
Every moment we had to make the other one feel bad
All the lonely people
I swear I've got three lives
Who hurled themselves into the ocean
And you will not be alone
Nothing will stand
'Cause I dream of his lips on your cheek
I called my momma, she was out for a walk
So poor Edward was doomed
One day I thought I'd see her with her daddy by her side
I hope you're not intending
All because of you, Jenny Wren
The ragged men in ragged clothes
Paper paper obsolete
Ripped apart by the crows and the vultures
And the problems lie within
And I know it's long gone and there was nothing else I could do
It's too cold outside for angels to fly
I was a rolling stone
Yeah yeah yeah, oh oh
It was a straightfaced lie
How I loved you
The stars are dimmed by clouds and tears
And legs of stone
Is answered with one touch
Probably watching porn of you from the fall 
All I have in life
Sometimes I wish we could just pretend
So hello from the other side
I got to fight for you, yes I do
The dog days are over, oh
You must be a miracle worker
And on your machine I slur a plea for you to come home
Gonna run to the river
Makes me wanna cry oh yes it does
'Cause when a lover aches
They won't see no lies
O, I need this 
Mother, the car is here, here
You had kids to feed 
You snuff the blaze, turn to vapor then you float away
All these faces run the same,
I had the feeling that those looks you gave me were real 
Where in the world have you gone now
The only one left
You fell into our arms
You'll sit alone forever if you wait for the right time
For my man to come
You can't replace me, you can't
And all of those birds
Beyond that man, he brings a world of pain 
Scraping for pearls on the roadside
When there won't be a moon and there won't be a sun 
Waiting by your side
So long, this is goodbye
Oh I wish, I wish, I wish I was born a man
The decades flying by
Invisibly set, the Rolex is faceless
But I'll be okay Is that what you want me to say
I'm gonna dream about the time when I'm with you
I loved you with a fire red
The reflection in the water showed an iron man still trying to salute
Aprender a dar foi o que ganhei
If I treated you bad, you'd bruise my face
The morning rain clouds up my window
When the sun would fill the sky
Maybe tomorrow
I'm not the type to get my heart broken
But I promise mama's gon' be alright
I was a camera until I went blind
Adia, I know I've let you down
There's nowhere to run, I have no place to go
Cause homeboy just got you crushed
What are you doing hanging out with me
Makes the morning sun
"You're safe, child, you are safe"
I can't believe you didn't call
And hold them up to the light
All I wish is gone away
Cut your hands
My body's achin' and my time is at hand
We'll dig a great big hole
It's a shame that it had to be this way
I see one pair that I recognize
Saying goodbye this time the same old story
You're my sweetheart
On my face, I scrape my knees
Another year ago tonight
We stumble into our lives
That I will try but
Let me be weak
This is to a girl who got into my head 
Just like a stone
Greg was always getting net from  feet away  feet away
And we're all under the upper hand
Unlock your heart
I'm one of many, one is blue
I am always here
I don't care if you can take it
Because I'm gone again
Holds a truth I can't erase
You could feel me seething
Now the pigeons gather 'round my feeding hand
I wanna see looking right at me
Little bit of love, little bit of love, little bit of love, little bit of love
Even sat me down and warned me just how they'd fall
But I won't let you down
All but one and don't you even try
Up in the air
I can give you everything
Did it all get real, I guess it's real enough
To fly, fly
Because you'll have to kill me first
What my night was coming to 
"I'm down at Denny's on route one 
It must make you sad to know that nobody cares at all
She takes you in with her crying eyes
Am I correct to defend the fist that holds this pen
mis dias sin ti son solo un eco
That is, dear, everyone but you
This is a place where I feel at home
If there's love in a house
Oh and I'm gonna buy this place, is what I said
But the fool on the hill
And its killing inside
I'm gonna make you a star
You won't see me cry
In this day and age, a man has to have choices
I'll tell you stories bruised and blue
'Cause I need you now
Your eyes are crazy
still i keep looking in the faces of the old people, 
Darling hold me in your arms the way you did last night
Mom's looking sad
Hello I'm the lie living for you so you can hide
The final word in the final sentence you ever uttered to me was "love"
A man needs something he can hold onto
I thought once that I saw you, I thought that you saw me
When all is said and done
And I feel quite okay
In the shapes we want to see
It'll be all smiles 
You don't know what I fear
Outlet from my cold solitary kingdom
I did I've done everything that I wanted, and it was more than I thought it would be;
While the city sleeps 
'Cause I'm picking up the message, Lord
Such pain as this
Then I would survey all those open miles
I want to go someplace and find you there
Ooh I see you standing by the sea
Died in the church and was buried along with her name
I cannot sleep, I cannot dream tonight
These old bones are worn
Before we turn out the lights and close our eyes
Oh to the head
This thing that I'm saying
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost
I think I should give up the ghost Don't hurt me
Love, love, love
And under red lights, I'll show myself it wasn't forged
And do I have to do just one
The contracts are drawn up,
Out of breath, I am left hoping someday I'll breathe again
Oohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohooh, momma
The rd floor
Sticking to my pointy ribs
Here in my hands
And boxed it up and buried it in the ground
 minutes, to shoulder the blame
So many things I wanna know the answers to
It's hard to know what's comin'
She was tracing her years with her fingers on her skin
You are the lonely one
Because of the things that they heard she had done
Well, maybe I know somewhere deep in my soul that love never lasts
So simple in the moonlight
Just as the sky turned black
Stop me from crying
That in time things must grow
All the white horses have gone ahead
The phone slips from a loose grip
And side by side in silence
I am one
That you told her that you loved her, but you don't
Fuck your normal vase, let's steal push people
Dishes in the kitchen sink
The reasons all have run away, but the feeling never did
With a broken heart that's still beating
Just let me be here
Still have too many dreams
The mountain 
Take a breath, take it deep
With every waking breath
We told you all of our secrets
They're putting up reindeer, singing songs of joy and peace
Summoned from the sky
Some people think he's good looking
But ah, the days are long
I got lost in this whole world and forgot who I am
I cared for and most of all I loved
Dancing Rosemary, disappearing sister Ruth
I don't feel alright because you make promises that you break
Look through your fear, you're still blind to my way
Even though God knows you have mine
Take these sunken eyes and learn to see
What if all the world's inside of your head
Well, there's hours of time on the telephone line to talk about things to come
You changed yourself and I changed me
I see your blue eyes
And then I'll cry so hard to these sad songs,
That I'm sorry for the things I've done Uh
I thought it was funny when you, missed the train
To the town where I was born
And you always found a meaning
You poor little cousin, I don't want your dregs
And when you're no longer searching for beauty or love
Keeps you safe for the moment
We hold out our pans with our hands to catch them
But I wanna sleep next to you
Everyone will tell you there's no place to hide
Said and done
I can't take it if you see me cry
If you don't then lie
Like something pure and holy
I'm longing for love and the logical
Innocence left behind
I know it must have hurt you
I turn around, find a gun on the ground, cock it
I think I got them all
For an escape route of old routines
I need you to pencil in the rest
And clenching your fist for the ones like us
And I sleep with my shovel and my leather gloves
That could make her move her cute little bum
We adopt brand new language
I'm not the the trash can, not the last man at the finish line now
Oh my love
I'd fly you a flag, I'd bury this pen into my veins
Unlock the door
When she walks down the street
Oh, all my old friends, they don't know me now
I wonder what clothes you wear to school
Were spent on one more beautiful
Remember how we used to feel
Pretends she can't see me here
This barren land is alive tonight
I hurt myself today to see if I still feel
And then she prayed on her knees
Living alone
The scanners wait
Someday I might I might find myself looking in your eyes
So I just don't start, it's getting worse
Because the truth is that gossip's as good as gospel in this town
Black chariot for the redhead
I'll swallow poison until I grow immune
I've got loads of pictures
Where the lies we tell to the eyes that roll in doubt
Put my little red party dress on
And I carry on
And I wish, I wish it was a small world,
Remember that you're one of the lucky ones
My heart can't possibly break when it wasn't even whole to start with
And why do we lie here and whisper goodbyes
But I remembered
Like so many friends we've lost along the way
Saying, "I'd sell off my savior for a set of new rings
Remembering the girl leaves me down and lonely
I can breathe fresh air
Talking to the walls
Break your bones
Sometimes I feel so insecure
Tell me why I can't be there where you are Where you are
If you still care don't ever let me know
And, I want to speak these words
How you always haunt me
And in your soul
Cause it ain't like it was on back in those days
I wanted to believe in all the words that I was speaking
Your friend who won't betray
Like the winds outside
This ripe swollen shape
But right now the clouds don't appeal too much
'Cause you don't think I know what you've done
This is a song about the scary things you see from the corner of your eye
It'd be all right, it's all right 
Daddy's ghost behind you
And hours of making love inside 
And now you've decided to show me the same
'Cause he was right beside me
Try to burn your changing name
Can't lift a finger, can't hurt a fly
So when you ask, "Is something wrong"
But, I'll leave my window open
Someone to cover, safe from the rain
The fact that I can't deal
Burn your fire for no witness, it's the only way it's done
She never stays the same for long
My mother accused me of losing my mind, but I swore I was fine
But I do not cry
Mmm that you only meant well Well, of course you did
Only thing I need to do is walk away
They don't look the same to me 
'Cause when we need it most there's no rain at all
So pray for me child, just for a while
This is my snow covered home
Stop sign told me stay at home
I walk through the fire, I give love when it's equal
Promises mean everything
Because we're scared to see each other with somebody else
But yes, it's crossed my mind
Her hands filled up full
Passed out on the overpass, Sunday best and broken glass
If you don't mind
Since we both made up our minds
That you loved me all this time
'Til you thought it through,
And you can tell anybody
Excuses don't work
Waiting for the call
Holds my love in his hands, still I'm searching
Leaves us plastered to a bed of hairs
I'm over existing in limbo, I'm over the myths and placebos
Please remember me happily
I wouldn't cry for anything
I found one for you, kiss your cheek, say bye, and walk away
There'll be someone else to hold you
We are the same, oh
What I choose is my voice
I traced the cord back to the wall
I wanna watch cartoons with you  Josie and the Pussycats and ScoobyDoo
my days without you are so dark, 
I guess it wasn't meant to be
To lie here, under you, is all that I could ever do 
I could feel myself under your fate
As the clock ticks on
And you'd help me out of the dark
Drew a line between love and hate
You were crying out
It's way beyond control
Bury me upside down
We've got our hearts on safe
If you see mother, tell her I can sing
That instant of light that wipes the slate clean
To see if I can catch a dream
Will you see me in the end
What am I gonna do when I run out of lawn to mow
They'll never hurt you like I do 
I'll just sit and stare at my deep blue walls,
The street's wet, you can tell by the sound of the cars
What the hell is your name
Didn't care though anyway
Heart strung is your heart frayed and empty
I can take a few tears now and then and just let them out
Nobody's home
But no one asks the question why
You can take away all these words
Just take it, take the box, take the box
And I'll walk away
She waits for me
You stood in my doorway, with nothing to say
And you slither away like the snake that you are
Can't I think what I did with that ol' skill and dye
They've been looking for you
When you laugh about people
And I wish I wrote you one original note
Why do you sleep alone tonight
Our hearts may break
So make your way on down to the sea
Reaching out for your hand
How there's really no difference in who he was once
The Mexican princess is out of my life
Vomiting in the kitchen sink
You were in all my dreams
I've been crying on the inside over you
Remembering Sunday, he falls to his knees
You're my shooting star
The night has fallen and I'm lying awake
But I swear by this song
Lay some flowers
You steal things you ought to borrow
But all the broken promises I won't miss
And let me be, to go off on my own
But I'm not the one if we're honest, yeah
I think will we sink or swim 
Craving blood poured from the altar now
Every single day from the poker to the prize
And I can't see nothing, nothing, round here
You're the only angel in my life
Try to make you like the way they feel
Mama can't help him, but it hurts to hear him callin'
I've got this feeling inside me
You walked away, heard them say
What do you think I would do, baby
When people see me 
Oh, you say you hate me now, and you burn me with your words
I saw a rabbit as slick as a knife and as pale as a candlestick
Did he die for us, did he die at all
Incompatible, it don't matter though
So I shook hands with you freely
Now Brenda's belly's gettin' bigger
You created a stream and it flows forever
That you will cry in spite of you
I've got a roof over my head
And head for the door
She looks in distress
Get on a plane; it can't be wrong
On Saturday I was an angel shining fair
Oh my heart can't carry much more
Charlie's broken 
His name was Donovan
Come on in, I've got to tell you what a state I'm in
And right now there's a war between the vanities
I don't want this; remember that
What would it take for things to be quiet Find your way
And I had thought it'd be harder to do but I caught her, and skinned her quick
She been dreaming about it since she was a girl
Till the light comes pouring through
Between the lies and compliments
And never let go
Oh no, God damn
I'll stick it out, skin pierced with colly strings
And I can barely look at you
Don't call me, don't call me, don't call me
I've heard it takes some time to get it right
All this having been done
It's a hard thing faking a smile when I feel like I'm falling apart inside
I need this 
I can't believe you're gone
I'll be marching through the morning
Staying up, playing back myself leavin'
And I'm complicated, you won't get me I've trouble
