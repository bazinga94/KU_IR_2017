'Cause we're falling and I love you more and more
And it's morning
Everything you do now 
Paper dreams honey
It always works out the way it's meant to be
Disappearing acts make your whole team vanish
You've seen and heard all an old man can
It's so much fun out here
The rabbit was removed under the whole moon
For we spent the summer in your birthday
When I feel you start to go
"Maybe you should cut your own hair
Please, please cure me
Oh, well, we made love
I learn, I see the dreams are made so I'm cooler now
But still, you know, I'd long to get some
Except this is right
I'm a cool low Jane with a skip on my feet;
And you drag me to the fashion show
Don't you act like you ain't heard a thing
You've always been in my way
You fall in love for the first time
Everywhere I go people stop and they see
He was grateful for us all
My body's never been so light
Out into the gray streets
She took a bijou flat with the fraternity cat
Oh, the bitter winds are coming in
Wondering, I guess
If near is just as far away as far
And the sky is fallin' down
Mmm, I don't see you laughing anyway
Am I home or am I simply tumbling all alone
I'm on my way
But I tend to know exactly all the things you keep on moving
Nighttime, is mine to lie eyes awide and I
Gonna wash my bones in the Atlantic shore
If you don't love me to
I wanna hear you say oh oui 
Everybody, just hold hands
We drank our wine along the river
Uptown funk you up
I'm telling you, girl, there's no future for us
From the mountains of faith
Give me all your love now
'Cause there's no way that I'll sleep when you're near me
I've got shackles on, my words are tied
Hook her, book her, nook her
A hundred different ways to cause hysteria
Well, I just saw the sun rise over the hill
When you do I really hope it's all it seems
Already, we'll all float on alright
We put them right in our path
I'm sitting on my empty bed
This land was made for the good of itself
In your place
So, I'll drink you up my dear
And she has got a baby with brand new eyes
Know you'll get me through
But then we'd have to rush back
Don't take anything away
Oh yeah a big boat,
You might remember me as
So I can wrap myself up when I'm feeling cold
And your hands are tough but they are where mine belong
I threw away my candy bar and I ate the wrapper wink, wink
I can feel the salt of the sea on my skin
The party's crashing us now
When we know we're not happy here
But I'm always to shy to work the courage up
I waited so long
Finding replacement with a heart sedated, I'll forget you
And it doesn't seem to mean anything ooh
Shine on, my friend
I'll be up up and away
My words get lost in the moment of things
I know 'cause I've been 
What Brings The Mogul In His Own Mind
Set the clock back twice or once upon a time,
Touching you makes me wanna come right out
All European, once again with feeling
And to sleep under the stars
Bursts are where I find a fix
Psychosis, don't what you call it, oneness might be the closest
Foul ball deep in centerfield
From the low road
Who crippled birch mares now briars replace their old cotton limbs
I can't believe I'll be bright for another
I fooled ya in school, yeah
I have to face the truth 
And yell out in surprise
The only thing that he has left
I can only do it once, they'll call me lazy
Your mom cooked meatloaf even though I don't eat meat
Yeah, I left my body in a sea of people, and that's just what I believe in
I'm sleeping to dream about you and I'm so tired
Oh, wow, you better stay
My tears won't give in 
When Uncle C passed away, leaving us empty
But her eyes they tantalise
And we totally ripped off a man named Woody Guthrie
The chrysalis is breaking and the superego's waking
Oh, I'm sticking with you
Allt gleymist í smá smá stund og rætist það
We'll enter buildings we might touch, 
Still be my friend
Then it's bound to blow back around
I see you strutting down the street, you look important, huh
Shake shake it
And I wondering what to say but my eyes do the talking so well
Ooh let me be
Somebody cry why, why, why
Those days when you were happy
We take back everything we said about you
You know it's true, I wish you'd leave me here
Double D chicks huggin', I got racks on racks
Do your thing, do you
Now I am good to go good to go
And when they told me what I did I burst into laughter
I don't act right
With the eagle eye
Oregon girl I've been around the world 
I love you most of all
But our feet never missed a beat,
Do they not know you're about to fly high
Get out of the city and into the sunshine
And the sequined girls
Then live the rest of our life
Now it's getting hotter
I likened to a radio
Your body was warm when I laid by your side
I'm back in Liverpool
Did I tell you I need you
Problems at work
And when she wakes up and makes up her mind
Have a drink with me
I'm feeling blue, 'cause love is gone
Yeah, I don't wanna run away
Has it been a day or a week
That you'd be waiting there whenever
Why am I alive anyway
You cannot find a friend Friend
But we don't go down without a fight
Watch the fingers of my hands,
And the world is made of energy
Jump little girl down to find the undersea sun
Enough to bring the party down
People say Mr Pleasant is good
What's wrong with that
Sends you flyin', cryin'
And what you done with your time
Leave the death ledger under city hall
I know someday I'll find it
I need love 
oh arm in arm we are the harmless sociopaths 
This is getting out of hand
Days spent with the grass and sun
Everybody in the car, so come on let's ride
Ebony and ivory and dancin' in the street
'Cause when I skating with my friends
You say what you want to
And I was haunted by a demon in my sleep
The last time we talked, Mr Smith, you reduced me to tears I promise you it won't happen again
Lift up your hearts and sing me a song
The way you move your hips
What's up with my heart when it skips a beat skips a beat
Half way through the night can we talk and see 
We can't see quite right
Oohwayooh
Have you confused your power with might
Well if I lived in China, I'd have some Chinese children
If you could blow up the world with the flick of a switch 
Are you sad because you're on your own
But you're with him, now I'd do no good I should've fought him but instead I let him I let him take you
You like the feeling of Saturday
Because once we hit the top there's no stopping us, no
Of language
Honestly, you can try to wipe the memories aside
And as they as strolled along
That shows some great big teeth
Means that when we have parted
Good times around the corner, good times around the corner
I wish that there was more of you to touch
You and me Sunday driving
She wrote my name on a red telephone box
He'd better get out of my way
Can I get a little fading on Fade it, fade it Don't be long 
Singing byebye, goodbye I tried
She comes anow running through our gloomy town
With a frame like a skeleton
Fun, fun, fun now that daddy took the TBird away
Your company was so relaxing,
I'm gonna be the man who's havering to you
Though we didn't make a sound
At least start pacing
I see it clear, a shooting star I'm a really good singer ladidadada
Now where did I put it
Barcelona  La musica vibró
Oh love
So, shut your eyes
We would be warm
Still I'm the only one who seems to care 
My heart shrinking
Bring your bottle, wear your bright clothes 'cause it will soon be summertime
I could bring my little ghettoblaster
I've come for you
You can't take all those things they define you and me
Mirror mirror made no reply
Different window would the
Ooh woa, ooh woa
I'll never be the same without you
You didn't have to do it but you did it to say
Kill tonight
Use it tonight
Well she got her daddy's car
A pink flower on it
Under the sun, under the moon
Oohoohooh Hello hello
Something good happens
In a day or two
Walking barefoot along the sand,
I'll be shaking at the sight  of  you
So, come on over
You happened to look and see
I never tried to hold you tight until you left me now and
Let me love you tonight
Love will fall around my door and
You got your youth, you got a roof over your head
Who says those bastards don't deserve to pay 
We found the avenue of trees went up to the hill
Everyone back my hearts at war
Sometime you feel like Moses
Cradled in our dungarees
At the whispering stream, at the bubbling brook
So reach deep and release your inner child Yeah Yeah
Their parents all cackled at dirt on my hands
Back in the days of depression
You're taking me for a ride
What are we Who are they 
Said, "It ain't nobody's business"
And it's a little bit you too
Your business dress 
And why does she give a damn about me
And I know that sometimes oh I might feel alone, so broke, and cold
North of England way
It ain't nothing a soldier can't handle, ya know what I mean
See how they run
She's a star
Are coming around again
Shimmering travellin' light, echoing love at first sight
And every time you look that way
I roll the dye
Gone're the dark clouds that had me blind
In that sweet cool darkness
Take the sky
Keep an ear to the ground so to drown out the sound,
Well, I can see, I can see, I can see the story's starting to arc
Yeah, they bite
This fingerflipping mom and dad 
It seems that people stick like flies to you
Fling on an Adidas hoodie and just boogie woogie with me
Are you ready for a day that's comin'
The cashier was scared, she asked for my info
And I love, babe
Saying she's returning home to me
We are homeless, we are homeless
Leave those bad ideas in your troubled head today
Never wasn't weren't what it was
One fine day one fine day we'll run away
Just 'cause he can't hear what you say doesn't mean that he's not listening
I think I'm in love
Sukie was a kid, she liked to hang out in the graveyard
Don't get too excited 'cause that's all you get from me 
For everything that you give me
With anything I do
Promise with stamps
And I could jump out of my skin
I think that this might be the day to 
There's a lot of words to come out
These are the good times that you'll miss
A mystery lies in her
And I'll go wearing my naughties like a jewel
Caught a train to Poughkeepsie
My type hibernate
'Til we knew 'em mathematically
Before the sun would come 
Playing Hookey, Making Something
Custa o que correr, corre o que custar, ah
You've been pissed off for a week now
It could be a dream come true
I try to win without a fight
The smell of you in every single dream I dream
Mercy's eyes are blue
Kick it into gear when I see that face
I left the people that do
Drench yourself in words unspoken
Steel guitar and the mele sound
And there's every type of girl
And you've been the talk of my town
What the people may say about me
And recall my treasuresearching days
I thought relationships were nothing but a waste of time
Things fall apart, I don't know why we bother at all
I say hello
Until there's nothing left for you
I said we're out to prove the truth of
And the world is electricity
I dreamed of summer sex with you and you whispered in my ear
A house was built, a baby born
So sing your life
We will buy a ship and fly
I'm hardly getting thinner
And as the tanks roll into town, as the tanks roll into town
And we'll get chased by the moon
Bowl cuts was the craze, I was crazy
I'd let you know all along I was
Recite your lines and I'll quote scriptures
Waste my days Whoaoh
Happy, I'm happy
Invincible, lyrical, miracle man, huh
When I wasn't sure
And these are the days
I said everybody's gonna love today
The red and sweat and tears, the love you got Hey
On my way
Now I've got to ask you one more thing
It's all love, you know
But I wanted more, with the cuts and the bruises
Ain't gonna need any more advice
I am thanking you
You got me
You better believe that we're all getting down
Dear Dominique you have a bold imagination
stripped away by days of being hailed as "Your Highness" 
I don't believe in truth
So many dimes, got dollars signs
And I'm calling to you 
I tried to do handstands for you but every time I fell for you
Baby look what you've done, done
The place and the time where we knew that things would go wrong
Keep the beat up, lets drop the beat down
Safety dance
Outside a bed and breakfast
Everybody is dying for
"I wish I would have loved less"
We hope you have enjoyed the show
I know most definitely,
I'll give you my street address
I'll wake up in strawberry fields every day
Shout out to the friends back home
Can stop and smell the smoke
Far away, my welllit door
That with all the noise
You've changed my life
I just wonder Louie, have you got room for me Louie
Pulls my train
Sweet nothing I made it up
Gimme back what I lost
Before these blue shade days are gone
But he's old for his years
My head is a box filled with nothing
We caught another white snake tonight
And in the end, you'll know I've lied
Head colds in frozen weeks of summer holds
Something somebody stole
And sometimes I'd rise to the challenge
Because it's needing badly taken in
And nothing does me any good
Dug a hole in southern Carolina, took me straight to China safe and sound
Just wait for me to show you
And hides you from the world
I lay praying to a saint that nobody has heard of
Do you know who you are
My, my love like a voice
Far and wide, sweet and simple Jehovah knows that I've been sinful
For us to Get together and sing Sing
To the thoughts of my imagination
You go ahead, let your hair down
It's all I ever done, so give me a reason to stay
If you catch me with my hands in the till
I drank a cup of herbal brew
I can read the writing on the wall
And I will take some photographs
I was meaning to tell you
I told them, I said to them, Bernie, I said they'll never make their money back
Tazer mic fiend 
Triumphant in delight
Set the perfect stage
We are the leaders of the not coming back's
Some people will think I'm crazy
You turned the heads of every boy and girl alike
I started running but there's nowhere to run to
Well, he'd better get out of my way
I'm glad it's your birthday
Bought plenty of ice for them shinin' on your friends moments
You're no sweetheart baby
Waking up on the line of equator bathing in my own sweat
Oh, we celebrate our love
Caught up in the middle of a headache and a heartbreak
You keep me warm at night
We're all alone and there nobody else
To bike outta town tonight
Well, sometimes I almost regret it
Someone's taken my place
Yeah, premonitions smiling in the dark
I'm breathing Hawaiian air
Will we know better
And grass stains on my knees for you
With peace in my mind
And turn it up while the lights are out
And we're rolling up to sand
She said there's something about you 
So now I'm standing on the overpass screaming at the cars
You take your skinny girl
And you can't be close enough unless I'm feeling your heart beat
Just leave me alone up in the broad daylight
Don't say maybe 
In later hours when the packed
Come and rest your bones with me 
To her head
There's cutlery, a tablecloth, some Hennessy
I wanna be your man
Oh, Monday rowing
And the glory to the feeling of the only unseen
Never mind tomorrow
Happy, happy, happy, happy To bring me down, can't nothin'
Let the sun shine yeah eh ey yeah
Can you tell me who will still care
When I try to catch your eye
As a Pabst Blue Ribbon unravels woo hoo
The kid in the mall works at Hawt Dawg on a Stick
Leute fragen mich, ob soviel Swag eigentlich weh tut
I've got one week behind me,
It was a clever disguise
I gotta find my place
I could say
And I can't see the woods for the trees
'Cause all this time is wasted on
If you would stop treating me like I was just a child
I don't wanna fall face down in the flood
I laughed out loud, could they all see that it was sadness
Tuesday, Wednesday, stay in bed
We had it all and all was well 
Like it means nothing
Who You baby, you I'm talking about my baby yeah
About my soul
You know it could be better than that
Just, please, please,
With a radio and good batteries
'Cause nothing else can compare
The storm maker says it ain't so bad
They'll work you like a dog 'til you quit or you die
You don't relate to me, no girl
One stop to the rhythm that divides you
Because there's only so many places you're guaranteed of getting a hug when you leave
And eventually the sky did return
And a piece of paper in my pocket deep
On my last night on earth, I won't look to the sky
There's no use wasting time
Listen to my car
All the sights
Lie back and fast asleep, if you could see what I could see,
If you had to go away
This is love so we'll survive
As your lifelines wanes
You're such a pretty, pretty, pretty little girl
'Cause I'm gonna take it from Simon
Now I just can't get enough
'Cause I know that you did 'cause your friend told me that you liked it
I answer life's big questions
There is a line I crossed
She's perfect as she seems, lifts me right out the mezzanine
I never been to Brooklyn and I'd like to see what's good
There's a dog in the yard with a manner that rough
While we're playing indoors
Lo and behold; she's walking over to me
C'mon we gotta get that
Hey you, you're still the one
Do you feel like you're falling down
I knew the worthless dregs we are, the selfless, loving saints we are
She knew she could go crazy but didn't think that soon
You will forget about me when I'm on that plane
Can we put this to bed then
Oh my starry eyed surprise, sundown to sunrise
You get smaller as the world gets big
I saw you walking on the sidewalk
Please not to purse their faces grim
You can't have everything
What we are, what we see
To go ahead and change your life
But we're all happy cause the streets there are always there for us
This woman is my destiny
Don't give up; You've got a reason to live
I don't mind, I don't mind
That's the way to live
Standing in the back, looking around
But for fifteen minutes or so
And you walk all over me
Better get to the table, get to the table on time
If I'm a river, where will you escape away to
Sometimes I am overcome just thinking about it
She said get up off the floor
After all the things you put me through
From movin' on with an Oregon girl
I am going to make it through this year
Built well, you're a strong letter "I"
Alison
Henri Winterman Cigars
Tell tell them you know, tell them your great big poem
My friends in LA they don't know
So come on and take a chance
I could stay with you
No, we don't need anyone
'Cause I'm on my way now
You'll always be as handsome
I keep my life on a heavy rotation
Of Gorillaz in a happy mood
I've just got to get you back
For setting fire to bridges boats
If there's no quiet corner to get to know each other
At least that's what we say we are doing
Like nothing's gonna happen
You have been identified as a hustler
A wish to be a big cactus with 
Told you on the phone across the sea
It's like a hundred thousand voices that just can't sing
What's wrong with it
And your shape on the dance floor
I said hey call me Mister Fahrenheit
The lights go off
And please don't let me escape
Chelsea didn't feel like following the rules
I just wanna feel alive 
I break tradition
Oh, yeah in your bag
There's a light
Come and get it now
And yes, your mind was wound so tightly
Don't look at me, man, I only have ten children Hoo
I won't be a fool for you no more my dear
Ah, it was not me
So we tell some lies 
I've been here for days
She took her things and left 
That I'm unstoppable and that no one can bring me down
You could make grown men gasp when you'd go walking past
Out on the streets, where I grew up 
My life
Oh sing your life
Said you hate the sound
And we save our money in good faith
Dreaming of the Osaka sun
My senses say that I should tell
I'm makin' money off of verses when I spit 'em on tracks
You run
But we are okay, we are alright
Supporting Volbeat with love and hell fire
Cigarettes and songs with a winter's chafe
We're undeveloped, we're ignorant, we're stupid, but we're happy
You're a deadweight, right straight on your way
Out the windows of our traveling car
In the magazines they talk about weight loss
We was all on the cover of Newsweek
Souls are feeling heavy
Now I've got nothing to lose
Now painting rainbows on my ugly face
All right baby come on
All talk, no action
Let's see how far we've come right now
Butterfly, 'cause I can't find nothing bad about you and
I remember watchin'
Ooh wee ooh, I look just like Buddy Holly
That's OK, that's the way I like to be
The world is spinning too fast
Carry ooheehooheehooheehooheehooh
I hate Jon Bon Jovi but I hate his music more
I feel the warmth in the cigarette
We're going right back to the borderline
Just scared of being alone
Don't shed no useless tears
It seemed like rainbows would appear,
En Descontroool ooh ooh
Safe for the winking of a Venus or Mars
We fail at everything we ever even try to attempt
I couldn't tell the truth
That I know wrong from right
Nothing ever happened
From all the shit the one I gotta buy is music
I should have known
And Warren Campbell on the keys right now
This moment with you in my arms
You don't even know girl
She met another blind kid at a fancy dress
Around us, and stick to what we know
When it's a straight line baby, a straight line down
To make me come alive
Bonjour mon petit bureau de change
A lopsided grin
You know I'd like to keep my cheeks dry today
And let my love grow good for you
Forget the things you've left behind
That I'm tired of hanging around
Show up in the crowd, take a look around
I'd fall to the bottom and I'd chase all my dreams away
Recommended
I can't get enough of you, baby
In a van with my friend
And I know that ev'rybody be happy
We would be so happy, you and me
I told you that, I told you that I loved ya
And I can't see you or breathe you, 'cause there's trouble right beneath you, it's all in the night,
Take depositions from a stranger's face
The sloppy guitar, it was shooting out stars
'Cause I've been looking at you
She said maybe there's a bit of me
Dare to be one of us, girl
And I'll say I no longer feel I have to be James Dean
You know me number
I can't run and I can't kick
Cut his teeth on turquoise harmonicas
I know you think that it ain't too far
Am I wrong for saying that I choose another way
Whoever you are in the light
My hopes and dreams and memories
And I wondered if the leaves could grow back
He's far too innocent to be a part of
'Cause in the daylight anywhere feels like home
Don't get your dribble on my
Be walking along that lonely mile
When I see you at the finish line
Do ya love me 'cause I wanna know
They either lost my math or I miss they call
Honey pie, come back to me
And what's with all that shit you're saying; No, you're not interested in this
You mined what you died for 
Wish I knew how you do it to me, 
Another decade getting high until you're free
No one's around
When you kiss my nose, the feelin' shows
She didn't have money, she didn't have cash
She spied the ring on His Honor's finger
I want the sea to break through
And I can hate your girl
But somehow ended all washed up
Yet you're going to look at me that way
I spent the winter with my nose buried in a book
All I've got to say is there ain't no fucking way
Don't think that I'll forget
Go baby, go baby, oh we're right behind you
I really like you, but I'm so scared
Jag minns varenda scen ifrån vår film
Man shot to the moon
Oh I wanna celebrate the whole world
Oh baby you're too pure
And we'll both be on our way
I believe a light that shines on you will shine on you forever
Had all of my history
To my friends in New York I say hello
Let the orange embers in the fireplace remain
I got a little breath left let's suffocate it
And we be chillin' like a bottle sittin' on the rocks
Head is swirling with the scene of you and him embraced in rapture
The song is for all the ones who's singing out loud
Stephen A Douglas was a great debater
You'd loved me all your days
Hey get out of my way
Roam through the streets
Or you may be daydreamin' for a thousand years
Everytime I stand up I fall flat on my face
Sugar, shake it, shshake it Oh
Stop it watch us all get lost
When I don't cross myself with you
After changing everything
And I'll wipe them out of mine, too
Running into the dark underground
I would tell you, we'd be jailbirds, I'd be winking twice for free
Moved out of the house, so you moved next door
He said "Where you from" we told him our lot
But we know who we are and more
All my loving, I will send to you
My car keys are jingling in my hand
I can swear I feel the beating of a cold cold heart
I don't want to miss even one song
Perched on a lawn chair and staring into the sky
Girls are my girls when it comes to the fellas then
I couldn't tell us apart
Give love, give love
Baby you'd be saving mine,
I'm happy again
Whoa yeah, well, well, well you Ooh, ooh, ooh ooh ooh
But I'm holding back, that's the strength that I lack
And speak my point of view, but it's not sane
Well something on the surface it stinks
You were dressed like a punk, but you were too young to remember
Neon black branches hanging from the trees
If it's me that was going to take it
Please know that I'm learning
You hold your head up, your head up high, like you think I do
Oh, Billy Brown you are a victim of the times
Some folks are on blankets, slowly daydreaming and reaching for their food
Here comes success hooray success
And then I bumped up, I took the hit that I was given
It's the flip of her hair
I'm seein' stars
Voy sonriendo junto a ti somos dos 
Listen to the music of the moment, people dance and sing
It seems the cost of dreaming's left me in the red
That's if you crash and spend the night
You never know what might be coming your way
In storm we scream against the stream, our eyes watering
When I see you every day
Let me know
Bound to be together
From making up again hey hey
Upon a viewpoint in our town
What the scarecrows think would turn your eyeballs pink
Oh man I feel it in the streets
So don't you stop trying
Now they're drilling my teeth while I'm soiling sheets
Oh yeah but don't forget the things you have
You got everybody going
Now you've come to the conclusion that she never did
I been bummin' around this old town for way too long
I should've know better
Nobody's business Nobody's business
Porcelain in a paper cup world
On the underground
Just get you off of my back for a little while
We are falling straight down, so turn us up
All over La Jolla Inside, outside, USA
To the meadow in the mountain where we counted every falling star
Without you standing by my side
I don't need a God to make me feel all right
Ooh, woo, ooh I gotta get my feet back on the ground
That she wants to know
Like twisted souls
I got my finger on tha trigga, stayin' on tha grind
Bring your congregation someday
I can't stay, much longer
About a boy and a girl
You know that us feral kids love straying about
That we're dangerously surrounded
To the brujo's door
How does it feel to be
We'll agree to call it The Compromise 
In an octopus's garden with you
I ain't no fireman 
Don't you worry baby I'll be right here
Millions of sunsets but the one I'll remember
Just when I thought I was clear of the mistakes,
So baby whatcha waiting,
La la la la, friends 
We can build a little home
Could this be true, it all comes down to you
Makes me forget how to think
Trippin' trip trip it now
Before the last ten years have passed
It's the morning now, it's the evening
And we walked out of the castle
Keep ya hungry for more like Bangladesh
Born to gaze into night skies
But girl I'm not your savior
Girl I been waiting all night to see you Dance like me
'Cause I'm better off without you
I'm gonna sleep all day till the sun sets
Got lucky, beautiful shot
How can you hate something that you ain't have tried
Oh guillotine
And I will soon be put to rest now Ooh ooh
Well I believe it all is coming to an end
Or love's gonna get you down
Listen to reason, reason is calling
Well, they're are no friends of mine
You've got to prove that you're no liar
Who knew that my luck would change
Your love is like a city that burnt me good
All my friends are on their holidays
You gambled your soul away
Who is a girl and
And do what you've got to do
It's that I love you girl
When I stand
And two chicks in the parking lot
But don't ever go away
The world we loved forever gone
With everything considered they forget my name
We all feel ashamed sometimes every day
And when you notice that your heart is bleeding
And I don't even know what
The steal that kept the courts at arm's length
I said please stay
Aw, some day I'll understand
So excited baby
Red sky creepin'
From coast to coast I got them things
But did I ask too much
Now if I lived in Russia, I'd have some Chinese children
Just don't stop lets keep the beat pumpin'
And I remember saying to her
Saying, I'm looking now at pictures of us
And let the sunlight in my lap
comme si il lui appartenait un peu dans sa tête
Who's one of my kind
Oh, Billy Brown had lived an ordinary life
Medicating in the sun, pinched doses of laudanum
You see my shit speak Spanish
Face to face and cheek to cheek
He found a good reason
And if you should know girl, let's get a bit lower now
Überdosis überheblich, überroll dich wie ein DZug
I'll be the girl of his dreams maybe
I left my heart in San Fransisco 
They don't make stationery like this where I'm from so fragile, so refined
Feel mighty fine, girl
Me used to be angry young man
Hey, yeah now
All the things I do
And lose myself in waves 
'Cause we're all, we're part
We want you to party with us
Now in the sticky love nest sits a widow
What did you expect
You talk about me and talk about you
I'll get that car to start
'Cause honey I can see him
Is a little more elevation, take me back to where I can breathe
Yeah, my heart is numb
Pull myself back together just to fall once more
Candy lips that taste too sweet 
Well, hot and heavy pumpkin pie
'Cause it's hard to make out running away
Maybe you're the one that don't just stare
Though London girls aren't snobs at all
And it's me and you and were shakin' the ground
Shake it, shake it, shake it, like your booty got a seizure
I gotta know, till then,
I want to feel
We major C'mon homie we major
Ooh, but that girl don't pay no mind
Your cup is overflowing, overflowing
And though the breeze is through the trees
Come downdowndown, my love is calling
On a life boat sailin' home
Those raindrops are falling on my head, they keep falling
They tell themselves that each word from your lips
And if we try to hold on
Icein' mesmerizin' the minds are sick ones
Open your heart
People in love get scared and stupid
You're such a mystery
I don't know how it happened
She said I'm gonna use my teeth and my claws
And nowhere is the place to be
You've got them all fooled
Kiss up and rub up and feel up
And I heard the sound of acapella grooves, yeah
Ever dreamed you could own at one time
Oh and our good time starts and end without dollar one to spend
My life is my own
A backless dress and some beat up sneaks
Along the sidewalk
Holy Moley you're so funnny
You didn't have to be so nice
Stand up and thank her, it's the great I Am
She thinks he does not love her
Yeah, there's blood on the wall but I'm happy
It's a spectacular show, 'cause my heart pumps diesel
Here's a little heart for you
Lot of bottles and a lot of booty cocktails
And you'll be thinking, how did I get here
Ooh my mind
So she dressed me up as the man she loved
You're a bitch
Well you landed on my mind
Ooh Who cares about tomorrow
But that doesn't mean that your dreams are gonna come true
Struck another shot up to  hours in June
I was moving forward
If my tips helped send a pretty girl through school
Strike up the band and make the fireflies dance
Replaced her uniform with dresses, silk and green
Love comes inside you, gets behind you
Treblinka alive with glory of love yeah
If you play the painted lady
You have always been my inspiration, please
Lick my lips and twist my hips
It was romantic
Hear it out, push it out, watch it how she work it out
Can't forget; We only get what we give
If not for you, my sky would fall
In our little hideaway beneath the waves
An easy girl to hold
Girl, you remind me of summertime
And if it no work we do a stickup and whipup a concoction
But I can't stand with these jellybones
And the bright light turns to night
But I can't sleep with you there by my side
Ooh I'm giving it all tonight
That you on your back
And every part of me you change
Touch my face, a hopeless embrace
Can I keep up with her pace
'Cause you're a friend,
Argo Records forty five
I only want the time to do one thing that I like
It kills like poison
Ey, wieso sollte ich mich jemand anpassen
I just wonder Louie  have you got room for me
There's a shake with the shock and a gift off with them
And in your hotpants and highheels,
So put your arms around me 
I feel like the piñata
Close your eyes, so afraid
This is an alarmcall so wakeup wakeup now
Thought about it so many times
Sing it to the world World, babe
And I'm not ashamed to admit I've been uncool, I've looked a fool
But you're just so cool, run your hands through your hair
It's like a thousand decibel punch in the face
Make your heart drop and come alive
Can you feel my heartbeat Can you feel my heartbeat
And it kicks, and it kicks like a pony
Some people say such awful things
You know the night life is just not for me
It's not my fault, I'm happy 
I know everything
Sometimes a gift like this you can't deny
But I know that I just wanna live some more
You are bankrupted because
First thing I remember, I was lying in my bed
Rarely removed
Girl I like your body Body
When we kiss it feels
No one gets by on themselves
God made good
That things are better when you're with me
The st way to leave your lover, 
And so I won't play the part I played before, oh no
I know, I know, I know, I know
These silly days, but we got it made
It's all in my mind
And though she feels as if she's in a play
They'll hold a double funeral
And there'll be no time for any lies
 Je te desire 
Eighteen academy chairs
Until you're fully grown, you've got a real good shot
A face to face you will lead them by the fall
I'll find another skin to wear, I'll find another skin to wear
I gave you my ring
I've a heart of gold in the smallest size
Before they open their mouth
And it's frayed at both the ends
Squinched up your face and did a dance
And if you will stay here with me
Get some fish and chips
I know I can't avoid her she's in the air
And all the children I have fathered
You are the only thing
So shave their legs, and make them look like movie stars
Still, the fire of love is true
Maxwell plays the fool again
Am I shrinking, am I shrinking
Baby your love
Her boyfriend's a dick, he brings a gun to school
Sitting in a car and driving down the road
You're making it harder than it has to be oh oh
And everything around her is a silver pool of light
I fall asleep in hospital parking lots
I'd go the whole wide world
You don't gotta keep no other man down
All my time is in half life
And all the things you need to know,
When there's noone else in sight
It's always more than a slight reminder 
Don't talk about it, don't let it get you down
When clouds up above
My lady on the water, lead me from the wilderness
All the girls turn green
I remember when I'd run to you
I've become what a mother wouldn't want in a son
The little children laugh at him behind his back
When I wake up, well, I know I'm gonna be
Taking your order, he will look away
Someone I've needed so long
Did I know it then
When the moon was out instead
You run, you're free, you climb endless trees, you reignite
Do you believe in magic in a young girl's heart
I have been poisoned from all the things I take
I gonna tell you what I need
Infect the whole human race
Rolling right along 
This phenomenon
I can go where life leads me
Oh how the sun shines inside you, just like I do these days are gold
Getting into the swing, getting into the swing 
And you know that ain't bad, oh yeah
You showed me a sunset overflowing
Is everybody ready for the single and it goes
Keep them coming 'cause we're not done yet
If I was a flower growing wild and free
I watched you through your window
But you're still mine
Yeah, okay, cool, so we're not that far off So that'ssee, butyeah, we're done there
You know that I mean well,
Hurricanes and floods, I still want you
Because there ain't no party
Like swimmers do, I'll call on you
Woo If you wanna have a good time
Well I was never meant to be the good boy
I'm dancing with myself
You'll be a fighter of fires 
But one day out of nowhere, she sits down and looks over my shoulder
On the bright side of the road
The old bastard left his ties and a suit
Can you crease the wrinkles back into the cracked and open brain
Just wait and see
I'm better off with artificial intelligence
And forget my English
Using words I never say
While my friends were getting high and chasing girls
I'd write the ending without any sorrow
Come jump in, bimbo friend, let us do it again
Set aside a moment to forget
On such a lovely Sunday
Oh no we were waving like the trees
Put a smile on your face
I�m doing okay
Who knows what's around the bend
Owl eyes her sun will rise and light the land
I played video games in a drunken haze
Who knew Mind you I never had to stand in line
I shoulda known that when things were going good
To be mine
Leave the homeless man out in that cardboard cell
Smiled at me from the window pane
I choose to sit here next to you and wave
But all these days
With a song of pure romance
But to have your love is such a thrill
Our love was stronger than your pride
And sometimes I wonder
Little brother
Speck of white, so fair and pale
I'm twenty stories up, yea up at the top
Let's take this back two thousand five
Oh for once there was beauty here for me
Try with a giggle it will make you look so nice
It was like there was nothing left on my mind
Keep jumping, reaching higher
In sunny Southend
But then you dance dance dance with the woman that lets you
Wonderful knowitall
Yesterday I tied two rocks together
Winter in springtime
I sing along when I hear it on the radio now
Get they first car and then IRS show up
 degrees, that's why they call me Mister Fahrenheit
Outside of the bureau de change in Shanghai
One thing that I could never confess
Midday Past The Three
There's love
Invisible people doing the wave
Something I couldn't over look
Come on, come on, turn a little faster
The road is pulling me into her open where
It's such a shame to ruin this bright
Is all I have to show for
I believe in your purpose, baby
But when they're parking their cars on your chest 
Praying for the light of day
Believe in the magic ofa rock and roll
I know what I'm here for
I'm comin' home, baby
You're the kind of friend
Time has fooled me into thinking it's a part of me
Barefoot and game
Because there's a few more things beautiful than Spring 
We'll run away together
Known as the female mind
A schoolgirl is denied
Care to see my reason
We are born forgiven and forgotten of our sins
Yeah, one more time, I can never get enough of everybody
We'll leave it by the phone, 
Solidstate radio forty five
Run fast for your mother, run fast for your father
If there's a reason
A small key's gonna open the door,
And feel united oh oh oh x
To see where it gets
That caravan girl
You know they started something I can't stand
We don't say a word
'Cause this  Side Where they say Shorty rhyme
To give a little way, oh please stop holding sway
I broke my promise on a very sharp rock
You were there up in my room
I'd have Al Jolson sing I'm sitting on top of the world
I'm retracing every step in my head
Sneaking looks at you sleeping around, 
Well, ISharon I love you
Outta control
Didn't wanna believe it, but now you are all I see
In this life it's hit or miss
And only when the sun comes out
Suddenly I see Yeah, yeah
Picked from a hot grove
I knew there come a day when our paths would cross
And when the last note rings
Watching the fire as we grow Mushaboom, mushaboom
The way it glows, the way it always knows
I've been a real bad family man
You've been my best friend
Marie is delectable, just turned bisexual, I heard she's into me
Lets burn the house and run away
I just can't seem to remember, yeah
It can't all be boiled away
Dreaming of when the morning comes 
Even if he didn't I wouldn't be offended
My My Time Flies One step and we're on the Moon
Talk about me, and we'll talk about me
But I don't even know if we're still friends 
But if the world could remain within a frame
I go out walkin',
I want you To fill my little world,
It sang of being nobody's baby
And I'd just look on through my love
Real sugar, gimme gimme real sugar
You make me feel like dirt
Gonna take on the world, one kiss at a time
This moment will be gone
Did you know the seasons in your mind
So you say, "Yeah I'm all right"
Hey girl, you've got a fine laugh
So much wasted in the afternoon
When the days come and gone
In school yeah, I fooled ya
It's been beautiful to find this point, I'm sure it will when it ends
I see the road is rough
I wrote my first verse, I was about nine
Skates around and floats on air
Are the only signal
And now that we're walking around the world 
Mon corps ne bouge plus quand j�entends ta voix
So come one, come all, and see the show tonight
"Sorry, boy, to leave you high and dry,
I used to ride around
Kids in the streets yeah they're all getting high
I can't stop my breathing in
Down, type of tears that money couldn't buy
Some of us have to got live as well, you know
All you need is love Everybody
Move a little closer, hold me tighter
Yeah, I left my body in a sea of people, and that's just how I'll leave it
They never know that you're a threat and they don't sweat you
Throw off your fears let your heart beat freely at the sign that a new time is born
She sits around like a vintage queen,
I see your sun is shining
And I look at their babies
Come on there's a big day such a big day
Seek me with your spies
But windows open and close
And honestly leave when I know that it's time
Come on, come on, turn the radio on
Shine shattered shine 
Cause there's someone younger and you're feeling older
In my mind, I'm running round a cold and empty space
No doubt you'll hurt my feelings,
I'm gonna be the man who's growing old with you
Can you feel it overloading
People, what you got for me
And I'm never gonna get it just 'cause of my bad credit
'Cause you've got all my love, love, love
And you sat in a chair thinkin' "Boy I'm such a prince"
She said your friend's on the phone
Make your lifelong sweetheart your ball and chain
Anyway you can
I said from the start that you could take it or leave it
Its gotta be at least a thousand degrees
There's something you've forgotten
You did for the ballad of a comeback kid
Into the fires unknown
Don't you know your heart's in danger
You don't need tricks
So much sacred in the month of June
Clark Kent just signed Das, he didn't want us
You're all our brothers and sisters and our babies
In the land of summer sun we have just begun
The angels go "How long till you can see her"
When your best friend's all strung out
Don't speak, no use for words
Well he said one thing, before I graduate
Drinkin' in sunshine
It's starring me and my sweet thing
from its work making light from the night
All these colours
So let's lose ourselves
But we are hidin' in a safer place
Something going on around here 
Everything will go on it's own way
The neighbors are dead as wood
There's no need to worry
I know I'll always be here
Because you know you will never leave my side
I guess I'm not coming back
What a wonderful world, world
You're coming home with me tonight
But I was looking
More than  he's my friend, it's nothing
The swallowed flames
The dirty face of gold
I see the walls, then see them fall
That I shoulda been sleepin', been sleepin', been sleepin'
If he is up for what you have in mind
Just to be told that the girl I'm missing has been in London for a while
And we all needed something real we all need proof
I'm not gonna change till I want to
You realize this is not the way
Now looking back on all the days gone by
I wasn't trying to impress those girls anyway
My friend left college 'cause it felt like a job
That were ripped around the seams
"Sir, do you got a light"
From the sky you looked small, but I loved you the same
In a man
I'd rather talk to you
Nothing really holds a candle to
Inside every man lives the seed of a flower
You've got so much to live for
Strangest thing I saw
Strung up, hanging 'round
The nights are silver, they make you shiver
Millions of sunsets, but the one I'll remember
You can't spend the night
With a starry brush
Try to look in her eyes
She's happy as can be, you know
Nothing you can say, but you can learn how to play the game
I never was lying when we talked in bed
It's the happiest that I've ever been
A clear ground division
I said, Hey, I put some new shoes on and everybody's smiling
I feel alihahahive and the world's turning inside out,
Said don't worry about a thing ya know your path is true
Before you even know
Pulling you back into my arms so selfishly
Strive to be happy
Ain't a story without it
Let it all go by Looking at the sky
It's, oh, so still
All the winds are changing without fail
The sky's blue so what should we do
When there's nothing in her bed at night
They have built a home sweet home
Play it through okay
Oh, I'm always in decline, always changing my lines
I tried to chase things I couldn't get
It's this one thing, I want to admit it
And I'm staring out at endless rows of green
Sometimes I'd like to stand
This ground of mine keeps shaking
We'll be holding hands once again
And sleep on the wind with the fires right behind
I'm your desire, my intentions are true
I'm in the mood for chancing
You'll hear the music, fill the air
Your restless mind was born in a flash
I kissed your throat every time they said it wouldn't last
Say the word now fascination
I'm down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, yeah down, down
They'll never know, pop off a cork for a
I'll safety pin these clothes all cool
Yeah, alright
I am the wizard of ooh's and ah's and falala's and
Oh when the sunshine beckons to you
I'll be down where the waters flow
My mind is set, I walk the line
All right now
Great mountain remember me
And I ain't need nothing else, no one else but you and I
Hit the ground look around but you're nowhere to be found
Yeah get away and bring it all back
It won't be long 'till happiness steps up to greet me
Maureen Johnson, back from her spectacular
And I will never need umbrellas in the rain
Imminent, you seem you seem to be
And II, I wanna open your door
I know you'd never give me a second glance
Oh, we were bound to get together
My first one, man did indicted, how I write it, sister can't stand it
It's gonna come, one thing is certain
And I think it's time for shining that light
I don't wanna wait in line,
A dream that has come true
You got no time for the messenger,
I think you know, I'll be okay
With a girl who lives
Well they called me once, and they called me twice
Spread out boy, I'm a mile wide, and I
But now that I've been through that hell I got a story to tell
Her skirt ascends for a watching eye
Redirected some of my anger towards the mother ship
I'm just glad to be here, happy to be alive At the end of the line
And the clouds came tumbling down Aaah
What can I say
And the star of it is Photo Jenny
When you are holding me
He don't understand
Well I've been making some cold calculations regarding our body heat
I'm froze by desire
Who opens the gates to this now gloomy garden
'Cause I'm obsessed with what would happen
And I had friends oh, but not today
And yeah, I'll be in a whole new tax bracket
For what it's worth, you're stringing me along
On a highway, unpaved, going my way 
I'm gonna live till I die, I'm gonna live to get high
I know we suffer for fashion or whatever
Calling Doctor Jones
But tears won't make any room for more
Boy, you don't know how much I like it
She waves for everybody down on the floor
Yeah holy as our father
And in a way
But then the sun resets your mind
Tell me if I'm bringing you down
Heart stopped beating,
From indigo to crystalline
Even when I'm miles at sea
When you and I are alone, I've never felt so at home
Do it for the money
It would be a spitting image
Bring your friends and we'll all go into town
Opens up my eyes so I can see
"You need to let go, you've got no control No"
At the end of the day
But when you are, that's when a
Turn that sorrow into something that feels right
This song drives me, Bananas
And I know he's no stranger
And every time I hit, she say it's a home run
Bring you all along with me
And still be friends, still be friends
But give away love GIVE IT
But the drinks are flat and the price is a crime
Look over look fast again look past
I'm permanently black and blue, permanently blue
Making love in my bed
Leave go, my golden arm
Wishing, wanting, yours for the taking
Jelly, jellybones
You never give me a chance
You're feeling sociable
Armed with every precious failure and amateur cartography
I'm gonna be who you need
Gettin' lewd with his food
I love you Sunday sun
I hear the warning sign
I'm letting myself off the hook for things I've done
Drawing tiny little pictures of skeletons
I'm gonna break down at fifty
You know, you know, me name you know my name 
But I thought it'd make a good song
But love's a lot more
The river looks so good tonight
'Cause Ievery time I think I'm fine
When the world seems to get too tough
Dancin' in the moonlight
Loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah
I take my time, there's no need to hurry 
Person 
I want a woman with the same brown eyes
And quoting lines from all those movies that we love
Or will I see you, dear, and wish I could come back
I got a nice guitar and tyres on my car
But I went to see my mom in Ensenada,
And Baby please don't break my heart
Oh Great Illinois It can only start with you
I'll give you my heart, give you all my soul
I'm going to cure your mourning soul 
The actors seemed so happy
Walking on the big stuff
You can bathe me in your finest wine but I'll never give you mine
Please ooh ooh
To end
Out of car, I don't know how I'm gonna go
It's time to bring out the big balloons
I want to be happy
The spotlight's on
If her daddy's poor, just do what you feel
No one else has ever known
We are the stars of your real teen dream
You make me wanna say I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do
Ghost in the world, ghost with no home
Hey lady
Go in your pocket pull out your wallet, put it in the air and sing
He's had many of those
And I was so in love I thought I knew what love was all about
Six months of our lives are at a red light
Taciturn and gentle
Still we can make it better, throwin' all your cares away We want you to get used to this
The lantern, the lotion Run for your life, for your friends
In fact there's nothing at all
Models will smile then tilt their heads back
Hey, wait a minute
When you're young you get sad
There's sweet fluorescent enemies that live inside of me
Be certain that I know my praise
Can I still kick a ball a hundred yards
Dis moi qu'il n'y a personne, d'autres que c'est de ma faute
In love with you suddenly
A disco ball is just hanging by a thread
I thought it was my fault
You've got knives in your eyes
The only thing that matters is just following your heart
You can go there fishing for the moon
But you still read
But every diamond has imperfections
Send me an IM, I'll be your friend
I work all night, keep on walking, alright
When you're tossing, when you turn in your sleep
I never had a love of my own
He did not admire
I'm trying to hide behind tired eyes, I sigh
I want to fall in love tonight Here tonight
That you can feel me
I don't do that kind of thing
Onenight engagement at the eleventh street
On a mountain top
I heard you sell the truth but I don't buy it
A back up plan to find you
Took a long walk into the woods
But you can come along with me
How I missed you, my love
Another lesson has been learned,
These sidewalks liquid then stone
I can put all that to bed
We love each other
I remember the stupid things
Do you wanna dance and hold my hand
I don't give a damn what the people say
Just sing, little darling, sing with me
Right now somebody's counting my money
The summer's day is hovering
Please, Mr Postman
Takes it back to Molly waiting at the door
As he drifts to sleep with a moan and a weep
We can't help but follow, she's Buddha, just watch her
Would you say you're mine We'll be just fine
A whole lot of precious time
And it blows my mind
Never could be sweeter than with you
Wake up in the morning
Switch up the batteries
Is this the way to get us back
C'mon c'mon c'mon c'mon, ahy
What I'm looking for
You're so ooh You're so, so ah You're so, so cool Baby, baby, you're so
If I could change your mind change your mind
With a woman who lets you
Things replace things
Fly around my pretty little miss
We'll forget all of your sins
Hello, hello, I know it's been a while but baby
Indeed inside me deep inside will always hope for worst
Make believe is much too fun
And we're flying
Maybe you should kiss someone nice
We got gas to get that straight, we movin at a fast rate
Uh, come on, come on, Come on jump a little higher
They give us the greens of summers
My love, my love, my love it is
If I live for a million years
You've got that old map out now and you found the farthest town
Tout bas car il est tard
You never should worry, your hours will now be as long
Tryin' to fit the world inside a picture frame
Your back on each other
They will always hold in the sea
How's your sister, how's your brother 
We drink to ourselves,
Get your game on, go play
And I'm staring at you now 
Is this the kind of fate you could contemplate, a breakdown at my very sight 
And we were back in '
Yeah, never ends
Friends are the ones, on who you can depend
He washed my sins away
If Jesus comes to take your hand I won't let go, I won't let go
He is a foreign man
And I love myself
I'll make it like your birthday every day
Now, right now
'Cause I say one word and then you're gone
The more I know it's you
We're talking kinda funny from helium 
Maybe we could even get together
And when I look to the shape of the sky
It feels so right to kiss your lips 
But I can safely say
 Un pochettino un pochettino 'causeí 'causeí dai
Finding it hard to relate to those of whom she was related
And when I touch you
I never bought a suit before in my life
They stand on the block
We beat 'em up
Always look on the right side of life
Bout everything he's seen and done
Thought could be fun
Well out of my toes my little black baby grows
If you sit still or if you run, well, here it comes
Don't you know it's good to see you too
And since there's no love, just love for the game
One day, the sun will come out
When I'm making up my mind
And let you know
To face your mother
Forgot to shine on you you'll see,
I'll write home everyday
I just wanna be happy
You did This one thing and I was so with it
For once in my life
We gotta stay positive
Seems like forever and a day, thought I could never feel this way
I dug you so much, I took some for the team
Home with me
Where's the love It's not enough
Time ticks by, where did you go
Throw this book away
Should I say return to sender is just a well be done
For the Mister AZ, they say
And he knows what he can do
And I'll live on in your grieving heart
Because she loves me so
Stay mine shut, I don't mind
I had a golden dream
Please God, tell me we're dreaming
Just come and open up your folding chair next to me
Suddenly I feel as light as a butterfly
I don't believe everything I see
And honestly I'm way too tired to fight
No way to build it up again
How come that I could feel so free
Maybe we're diving in over our heads
If she isn't screaming, she doesn't belong inside
Bring me what I need so
Plenty of girls and boys in love
Yeah if I lived in Ireland, I'd have some Chinese children
Oh man
They've got violence, wars and killing too
Take me down to some place below
So pull me under your weather patterns
La la la, whatever, la la la, it doesn't matter, la la la, oh well, la la la
Touch the fingers of my hand
I don't think I understand, 'cause I don't really know myself
It's gonna be good to have you back again with me,
Carry me through the night In the hills and highlands
Sing in praise of Jackson Crowter
Everything'll work out right
Below, the country rolls like a mighty boiling sea
And in the streets we're running free
That is, unless they look right in, and
The sounds that the bands made, and the melodies is all I need to make me feel free
But my baby, you have grown
I see my friends play the fool
Knocked a stranger's door
Cause some things have changed
My sweetie, my lovely
And then say bread and butter
While we were laughing and drinking and smoking and singing
We fall for the same lies, we all have the same shoes to fill
To let you know you're more to me than what I know how to say
But it's not taking me
Why I thought I was sane
You can't cry 'cause you're laughing at me
To the mid day light
Sunday morning and it's time to go 
I fall asleep in hospital parking lots
I wish you were here today dear Yoko
Be it true, you ain't got nothin' to do
Proud that you are my, dad
You know, you look so good look so good
Hey Hey don't pay no mind
And everybody's coming to say
When I'm hated, damn, wish me well
Mm gonna try with a little help from my friends
And those are the times you need love
When you hit me baby
When both boy and girl start suddenly shaking inside
You're oh oh oh like air
But she came home today with a ring on her hand
And the dreams of my delight
About you, girl
You'd better stop
You dance all wack
But tonight I made sure that I sharpened it twice
happy and they're safe
Baby, it's like we're walking on a wire through the fear
Not doing anything here
Never ahead of, never behind it
And you looked
Why hello, hello, HELLO
From now on with the sky as my roof
Carmina Burana
Her face so close I could taste the distant shores
And I felt the green was blacker and the blue was darker still
You could lose your faith in breathing,
Tragedy he used to come through all the time
Wake up by myself inside an empty room
Just 'cause she dances go go
On silver stars I wish and wish and wish
Love is all you need
Have a good time
I ain't never had nobody like you
Some stories are magical, meant to be sung
Thinking you're so hardcore
You didn't run, you didn't lie
From now on trust my feeling is true
You never know what people have up their sleeves
They're trying to keep us apart
Sing hallelujah, you know they blew ya'
To all the bitch ass hoes that hate me the most
When she places them in front of you
Time is passing by, I still want you
I've got a lot of homework
We've got all your life and mine
Go go yeah yeah huh what
All together now
We used to laugh a lot 
But the hour is so late
You know I can't afford to buy her pearls
So Daddy throws clothes, throws on an old stove
Oh, my heart ached, but I know fate
Oh yeah, 'cause there's a cloud
I look up to my right, and there you are
By the boat that swept and swayed
I'll tell you about the magic, and it'll free your soul
Take parts of Salford in Manchester, dying on its feet
Make a move, you'll get that mac
And I would walk five hundred more
I could never touch you, I think it would be wrong
The view from here is getting better with you by my side
Never will be good enough for her
With a five year reunion hanging over my head
I'll try, I'll try to build it all around you
Was just to hold you close
Why don't you just go away
With everybody watching you
We sang along into the start of forever
Oh yeah, oh yeah
There's a Jenny, there's a Karen
Constructed to keep one's goods on one's own shelf
For a few into the city
And the only film I saw, I didn't like it at all 
Take me away to be closer
From all the ladies the one I kiss is music
You shine a light on head and heart
Shake it, sh shake shake it now
Happy boys and happy girls, we'll be
It's only right
Remind me once more where this is going
Only in your mind, ah, forget your mind
Oh, no one knows
Christmas break of ninety eight just flipped me upside down
And if I haver, hey, I know I'm gonna be
Fix your mask girl
Don't understand they're so hateful
Love love
When I felt the way that I do right now, right now
Oh, who the fuck's your president
And this this could be the summer when I grow up
Yes, Honestly
He's everybody's girl"
Yeah, one more time, I can never get enough, oh everybody
Everybody's feeling warm and bright
Turn off the lights
He left you out, now I'll take you home
I finally know what I'm going after
Silver lining and golden seams
In a storm in my best dress, fearless
You stood up and tried your damnedest not to listen
Oh yeah, they're gone so fast, yeah
My lips are unhappy without you
I did not mean to keep you waiting
I'm running out of things to say, will you please start talking
And I have left a million stars
Then go out with a fight
So let me be your star for one night that's right
Please come to save me from myself again
I ain't good enough
Pour a little sugar on it, baby
Neither of us knows what's in store
She's been living in her uptown world
And now I've too much to hold
We've been singing Billie Jean
Well there's nothing to lose
From the days in the waves
Yeah yeah Such angelic motion
We thank you people for being around
Don't like his baggy jeans, but I'ma like what's underneath them
Young gal, you done me bad so I went and did ya wrong 
Struck from a great height by someone who should've known better than that
Hold you tight, say goodnight
Down by the bur oak tree, I had lost your locket in the loam
And we'll laugh, yeah we'll laugh
But that's enough, the love is over
All I'm saying
Love you more than you know
His red head and his red eyes
This this could be the summer, the summer of love
Never let go, gotta hold on in
But there is always so much distance can't but feel it somehow,
But I remember counting days down till the year could be done
A grandpa phone and a gramophone too Oh Yeah
I just hope I'm not alone
I'm gonna ask you so ya understand
Ever since it's been hard
I got a fair bit of chat but better than that
So, I've made up my mind
Who cares that it makes breezes
Well they are time bombs and they are ticking
About you that makes me wish that I was smart enough for you
We tripped on the urge to feel alive
Don't care what you do now
We all have teeth that can bite underneath
And around my neck is superstition
Quiet till it fall, fall, falls
Some things in life are unforgettable
Are you writing from the heart, are you writing from the heart
I see the road begin to climb
Wild cards, men from Mars, dressed in stars and stripes
Now we cling to bottles
While nothing ever happens and I wonder
And there she goes right on the spot
I think dreamy things as I'm waving goodbye
Singing, screaming, kissing, tugging
Waterfalls
 years asleep before we sleep forever
So as we lay upon this ground, I swear you look like Lucifer
Sweetheart
And sing that old song, how does it go
Don't end up in the gutter
Let's have bizarre celebrations let's forget when, forget what, forget how
You can never get enough, enough of this stuff
Aged and lifeless is what Yes you'll become Yeah Yeah
It's a little bit me, a little bit me
Lucky we're in love every way
Just the way you are
Though we have missed all the minutes, we know what we've won
I mean the world to a pottymouthed girl
The great sense of passing through
When the breaking waves arrive
You'll come down, come down
Twist and shout twist and shout
I love you more
Pulled them out they weren't beating
Another day
Friends until the end
If you're a storyteller you might think you're without responsibility
You glide through my head blind to fear
And then boom
And we don't go near the ghetto 'cause they'd shoot our ass
Everyday is your birthday
Ever wonder why they kill the weak ones, baby
Wonderful surprise
Sing, sing along along any song you want to
I shouldn't have wasted those days
Things happen for a reason
As I turn to you and I say
And goodbye
I had some nightmares
Since I heard from that girl of mine
Oh and I wished we could be dancing in the dark
The world may be ending
And the end wasn't funny though we'd all had fun
It's everything I wished
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I always wished the night was twice as long
Then I stopped dreaming now
In your kingdom by the sea
Everyone is leaving, I'm still with you
As happy as you and me
I got Bridge Club on Wednesday
We're havin' fun
When out of the orange colored sky
Kakua on the ball and soda pop well 
The things that you love
And I make you shout
You only need to know
Friends are the ones who are there at the end
Hey, I hear the voice of a preacher from the back room
Trying to keep my head on straight
When the days are long
So to hell with all that rubbish
All my life I've been on my own
Gives a feeling from your bottled little part
You don't know you're the real deal
When I found you dear, what it meant to me
I'll dream about you, I will not doubt you with the passing of time, oh yeah
Yeah, kiss me when my lips are thin
I don't know what happened to those resolutions
We do as we please, yeah 
To stay on a holiday
You can walk my path
Just don't stop, let's keep the beat pumpin'
Wallets empty and we're back at start
Up in a tree
'Cause this is all in my head
You're like a shot of pure gold
All you get is pain
Just like a rocket baby
She feels good she does
Some people
Bungee jumping, I don't care
And no, she don't know what we do in our spare time
Behind movie scenes
Now you know how happy I can be
Ever what you got, I don't need it
That I no longer feel
Seven days a week, every minute of the day
But everything it fits so well
You're right, strangers are easy to like
Everyday, I'm so happy, baby x
Don't wanna go to work again ever no more, boy
I don't understand
Tune on my lips and my quest in reach
To follow through your days
Sunshine
And you know that I will always do the best I can I can
Tag your face just to rub it in
We dive so deep we keep in touch with your buried bones 
Do you love, what you like
It will turn around
Secret lives we have lived inside
Hey you, do you remember me
And we will run, we will, we will crawl, we will
Look at all the people like cows in a herd
Things will change, I'm not saying overnight
No, I'd never let you fall
My friend the communist 
Like white needs black, if you leave I hope you need to come back
Quand tu me prends dans tes bras
But look, I'm only human
I like the way he's speaking, his confidence is peaking
From the roof to the floor I'll crawl around some more 
And I'm losing all those stupid games
We can bring it on the floor
Well I don't know what I am looking for
You're such a rush, the rush is never ending
My surprise, I woke up one morn
Are loaded guns to our heads
Don't let your friends say you have no taste
She don't love me like you
I can't remember if I like what I said
If I wasn't so happy,
All our broken plans will have been
And everything looks so complete
You've put a seed inside me
Focus calling
Well I saw you with your hands above your head 
But you should know that I go both ways
Because everybody else's mind is grey
You can get it any time so yes but unless
Stop the rain from falling
Just trying to play my role
Well you can come on to my place if you want to
'Cause baby you start and then you stop
Are getting rich with their mail order scheme
'Cause they gonna wash away
And in your lovin' arms
There's no one on the corner and there's no one at home
You know that you soothe the aches
I sent a message out into the dark
Well, let me introduce you to my style
But when the sun comes out 
Says he's got a big boat
Old habits, young ways
You got a gnome in the backyard
Adventurous smile shifting to frown
Big dreams we're all about 'em
We'll never be ready if we keep waiting
I've got a wild heart
You know if it is broken they'll try to fix it
Boom shak the greedy men running
But that clock up on the wall was tickin'
I started to realize 
Our carpet falls on a dewfresh daffil plain
Like chairmen Mao's
Now, take me to where your sister lives
Talking our way through March
What if all I want in this world
Seeing butterflies melting on the wall
You're the one that's making me crazy
Friends of P
She said I'm gonna use my teeth and my breasts
For better or for worse I will always put you first
Mymy looking for a guyguy
Goat's head in the deli case
II, I wanna be the pear tree
Sometimes I'd like to slow things down
Feels like the world's at stake yeaaa
And this world seems a better place
There's Judy Garland taking Buddha by the hand
What this verse sound like, should I freestyle or write
The walls are closin' in but that's okay
Everyday, it's agettin' closer
Recount the night that I first met your mother
Driven outside
What more can I get myself into
And I don't talk much, shoot straight
That I would be the one to fall
Oh, whatcha want, whatcha need, whatcha come here for
And put on the weather
I've been in the tall grass all my life
And any excuse to stay awake with you
Your mom she caught you all on TV
So I was up in this trendy bar mingling
But we've got our love to pay the bills 
Embraces my insides inside
Lovin' is what I got, I got, I got, I got
'Cause I'm havin' a good time
Stacy can I come over after school, oohhoo oohhoo after school
Generation to generation it gets passed on
There's no getting it by us now
A daydream, I'm caught up in limbo
These are the days we'll never forget
I've been waiting to smile, 'ay
Let's get lost
I've got a cure
You're bringing out all the colours,
Wenn die Blumen und die Bienen in Berlin nichts tun als grienen
I wonder how you decorate your room
Your savin' time but your miles away
I never wanted to be better than my friends
Heavied by the early morning dew
Waiting for travellin' light
Hey you with the pretty face
And drank a bottle of vinegar
That crazy avenue of trees, I'm living there still
Does the sum of the slights hurt 
You like cartoons I'll make your heart melt
With your wine down my feathers as the cock crows given time
Everything will be fine
And I give love to a lover quite deserving of it
Not just my home girl
I've traveled all this way for something
Our whole lives waking up
There is joy to be claimed in this world 
A game show love connection we can't deny 
'Cause somebody once said when I was young
I want to fall in love tonight
Little kids can't play with things that have died
My lover, I've been donating time to review
Seven different reasons for satellites,
In the darkest part of you that you have ever seen
A little sunshine
Dawn is breaking everywhere 
Come on, come on, if you feel a little lighter
The sun's going down for you 
Bandages on my legs and my arms from you
Lift up your head and keep moving Keep moving
Please, please stay with me tonight
Woo hoo, and I know you're mine
And I'm sure gonna ring your bell
See the stars, won't break the bones
There is nothing like their mattresses
Make a little birdhouse in your soul
Make room we're taking over here
I like you real silverlike
No you will never stop me
I look into your eyes, 
Just bring a pair of your dancing shoes and get down to this beat
There's nothing wrong with you
That never seems to care
And if I was a word could my letters number a hundred
I'll know my purpose, this war was worth this, I won't let you down
Send me a postcard, drop me a line
Now your magic is working
How are you today
So scratch my name on your arm with a fountain pen
Ah, la, la, la, life is wonderful
I'm right behind
And I'm racking my brain for a new improved way
Now I'm a free agent and I'm thinkin' it's time
Why don't we, sleep all, sleep all day, we sleep all day, we sleep all day over and over and over and over again
So let me know before I wave goodbye
If you get deep, you'll touch my mind
Yeah, we're alright though We're gonna be OK
He'll lift you up and turn you around
I did not mean to frustrate you
These are the days you might fill with laughter until you break
'Cause it was sink or swim
Happy ever after in the market place
And I'm lost in a daydream
Built to scan the deeps of outer space
Pulling you back to me
Anywhere, anytime or place
Of livin' in the hood where the shots are fired 
Hello, hello, I'm really hoping you'll forgive me
I was looking at your window
LA parties in the phony lands
It left my bed in a mess
Single Mom I wanna get that number;
And the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do
Let's sully every stage
Anything you know you mean 
And start a riot, a riot be rebel
Yes and no, there's no right, but we have no better light
Brimful of Asha on the forty five
It's got me running around in circles 
And it was fun fun fun when we were laughing
Having headaches in my brain
The only thing you'll get is this curse on your lips
And you tell me what you need
Woahohoh, let me hear you now, ohohoh
Tabletop pleaser
You had a chance and you took it on me
Oh my homie got the booze, I like it like that
Oh the love that I love
And without the day
Recently I've been
You gotta wait a minute, wait a minute, Aaaaaah
You don't know cause it just passes right through you
Are you gonna live your life wondering
I've been spending my money in the old town
Sending the message through telepathy
I'm folding it all tonight
I don't want to be your rock in hard times
Sweet chocolate Chocolate walnut candy
Momma still wants you home for supper
Don't let it get the better of you
Your eyes, they never looked so good at me
Let me just say
Sleep away the day if you want to
In my mind I try to let go, it's so hard 'cause you're all I know
Never ever ender all this love
We, we are alone 
I can't stop this feel oh no
I keep talking, begging, tell me what I want to hear
Uh did you see me falling
Someday we'll meet beyond the stars and it'll be
Not a lot left to say
Yes, tonight I have to leave it
Well, an eye for an eye, and an 'F' for fight
If half of what you said is true
There's some things you gotta know
I know I'm always drunk as drunk as can be
In this dangerous world
If you believe in magic, come along with me
We're living the life
Away from this scene 
Just one look at you
All these people talkin' 'bout you now,
Nobody ain't a problem, girl
You better believe I'll be down by your shoes
I love you more each day
I loved you in the morning
And don't you ever give away our underground location,
My fans stuck with me, my shit still went gold
Oh, and you're right
But not you, you still wear boots and your hair is too long
'Cause, I'm never gonna stop the rain by complaining
I want the sea all lined up into me
The wonderful thing it does
I was cruel, I was truly mad
I hope it's me and love, love, love
Man, I love
These people overwork me
I I am just a number
Everybody here is out of sight
Oh Jane Addams, spirit send thee
It's stopped rainin'
Give me a moment
Shout out to the hearts you'll break
I forget but I won't feel bad about it
Through silver clouds,
To the days I've tried to lose
Dressed up to the eyes, it's a wonderful surprise
Wide awake, waiting like a target
In the wide world
Every single one of us is twisted by design
Whenever you touch me baby
There's never been protection
Who is the fairest of them all
You'd leave without a trace
Dusty brown boots in the corner by the ironing board 
I wanna break these walls,
So I'll sleep out in the gutter
And the boy, that ordinary boy
Our cells divide at an alarming rate
Daydreaming, daydreaming all the time A dream is all I have
And afternoons and mornings
You'll have to shout out loud
The sound of the city baby
We would be friends if we tried again
I'll always be there when you wake, and ayeahhea
I've got life,
The things that we don't see
Makes you think all the world's a sunny day, oh yeah
Good day
Riding swiftly through the night, almost missed the light, if ya feel me feel me
Or you'll never get another fix
Oh, here I go, dripdrop it way down low
He spoke of women's ways
The way you shift your eyes
Little bit of love, little bit of love, little bit of love, little bit of love
I don't want to get much older
You don't like my point of view, you think that I'm insane
But someone picked you from the bunch
And it makes me feel so fine
I wanna hold your hand
And let your love shine and you'll know what I mean
I'd rather stay here all the night with happy boys who sings
I'll give it back
Are we runnin' out of time out here
If your friends like a certain you, that's who you have to be
Easy girl
Searching I, for dreams in sleep
For the tree of life is growing
I get lost inside the sound
I know how sweet a kiss could be
By leaving me a card or a letter
I'm soft, but I'll be all right
He does And I do, baby I do
Chairs to sit and sidewalks to walk on
I can see, I can see, I can see the beauty in the mess
Nothing plays out like it should
We can take a ride go tell everyone
Come with me to a place no eyes have ever seen
When you want her lips, you get her cheek
Oh Recalling of the while we used to drive and drive here and there
Following the girl
Made sure that she was dead 
And I never wanted anything from you
We're gonna have a good time
Oh, they were apart
I can feel my heart
I gotta feel like it don't make, like it don't make
And my ears are wearing head phones
How the moonlight will lead me
With a pretty girl that I met at the pharmacy
When your nom de guerre was codename Caroline
Two of a kind, baby
Now the heart you hold is somebody else's, baby
You know he's been around the world
Sometimes
You make me runaway baby,
I say what's, what's cooler than being cool Ice cold
You tell me that you've got that type of lovn' here to stay
Keep on your love keeps lifting me
But I wonder, Louie, have you got room for me
And I showed you the things that I'd made
You might have to close your eyes
To prove they loved each other
Woahohoh, all you singletons, ohohoh, even the white kids
The lights go out and everybody screamed  team 
Neon black lemonade drip drips from his grin crammed with cool charm,
Let's do loneliness in style
Let's pick a fight on whomever we like
Some kind of happiness is measured out in miles
You in my arms
For misguiding our youth, they're the ones to blame
These are strange, strange vain days of living
What's gonna rock
Stepping to the beat
Tell me 'cause I'd like to know
When you do things like that 
No I get by with a little help from my friends
Leave the ocean's roar in the turquoise shell
To think of life without you, my world would stop
I ain't goin' to school
The biggest group of friends the world has ever seen
And I have sins Lord, but not today
When I am wearing it
That was my first crush; I bought my first mic
I'm still wondering why
Becoming a habit
So let the beat control your body baby
And asked what the damage was
Oh, honey pie
You just try to stop me now 
Shed your love, shed your love
I'm looking forward to this life I live
Why in the world are we here
And she doesn't give a damn about me
Bones bones brittle little bones
Extend contractual period
Unplugged the phone
A long time coming home
What does it matter if I lie to you
I recall only nights that we built
She sat right down on the sofa
Don't you worry, it could be so sweet
When I'm with you I feel like I could die
Oh now look to the east
The sun blinded them
That my life ain't living hell
If you think you need inspiration 
Open your eyes
I fell in love
Somebody remind me where I am
Young kids stealing cars and having switchblade fights
And this is my mind
Rid my head of this pretense
To the only place I know
Now I'm breathing like I'm running, 'cause you're taking me there
All those stupid little cigarettes and drink stupid wine
Cause the woman, She knows a place
I feel that ice is slowly melting
No sense, slipping away, can you wait for me, love, I want you to stay
Exactly where it was,
I'm covered in rain but it feels just like it's the sun
Collapse onto your side
To show myself to you
And I'll be gentle with you
I think he's tasted
When the half light makes for a clearer view 
I work all day, keep the rhythm through the night
Say you can but you don't know
DesscoontroooooLL Oh oh ooh
When I kissed you, girl, I knew how sweet a kiss could be
Baby look what you've done now
Everywhere and every time I am yours and you are mine
But don't tell me he could look good if he tried
You try to drag me into your bohemian dancing
Damn, sun's so hot, make the girls take it all off
Try to help the human race
'Cause I'm a better man
Good thing there's no mercy rule in love 'cause I would long be beat
Different voices different tones all sayin' "yeah, we're not alone"
To the water's edge and watch you drown
I know the world's been mean to you
Lord of the earthquake
In the diary of a priest, in the sheets that lie upon his bed
As I hear your voice 
Let's stay up all night
Hygiene boy, oh what am I to do
Dirty, trying to come clean, but every thought I have is obscene
We won't need them where we're goin'
We will escape from the south to the west side
Happy without you oh x
It's a perfect day for letting go
And to your favorite song
Is that how you shall be adressed Oh her highness
Lots of lying and some faking
His girlfriend keeps him living in
We'll have drinks and talk about things
To think about the girl you love, and hold her tight
You can shake it all around
I'm a legionnaire, camel in disrepair
I wanna live for today
Just tell me when it's coming around, coming around
But each time she walks past
We're gonna be alright Hey
"The Whiz Man" never fit him like "The Whiz Kid" did
Inside was an antidote to the spell
I seen ya, I seen ya, I seen ya 'round for a long, long time
Do you remember when we first met I sure do
If we survive, are we free of the dumb luck
Righteous men of the earth
I've nothing left to say
Everybody will help you
Don't panic, panic, Mutya, just look ahead now
Sometimes all that you can do is say no
Harder you get
Dear pacific day, won't you take me away
And it's bigger than everything I have ever done before
I'll take off all my clothes to the thrift store
In the rock pools as a kid
These 's keep the attention of bitches
Everything you could need
Being under someone's thumb
I see the place that we belong together
Threw our shoes into the oceans
You'd come to the conclusion
Come on say the word now fascination
All those days gone forever
Never change the way you are
Not called for weeks now
And I can see them dancing up to you
Then I can't remember caring for an hour or so
Whenever you're around
Stand in the place where you are
Not with you, nor her, nor anyone
No you can't you can not know you can't
Say it slow to be sure we know
With you tight skin, making me jealous when you're asleep
I used to close the door when everything went wrong
If you leave me I will follow you and bring you back where you belong
I was only a kid
Oohoohhoohooooh hoohoooohoohoohoohooh
I never start my homework till its already too late
Let's do it right now
And if you say the word
And I won't ham it up or simmer down with it brethren
And I was on cloud nine
You put me in the magic position, darling so
Real sugar
It's ok if you don't know everything
Those pretty eyes that watch you sympathize
Who always bends when I'm broken
She's a rock 'n' roll survivor with pendulum hips
That's been around for centuries
Give it a rest, won't you
And beyond that is anybody's guess
"Well it's the numbers, it's the numbers;
You give me wings to fly
And abandon it
Well I'm not braggin' babe, so don't put me down
You can talk to me
Everyday that summer by your side
Listening to house of pain
Can you wait
I'm tired of looking up into those starry eyes
And I'll run naked through the streets without my mask on
 degrees, that's why they call me Mister Fahrenheit, hey
I got's to get them bigga, figga's, fuck what you talkin'
But I look at the lovers
Then what we've got is gold
About jumping ship before it sinks
I feel myself changing
The suns that rise
Baby, come on, yeah
In every single place that has ever, ever been
I love love you darling
I'm waiting for you
I wonder if you know that
And I'm pale as I ever was, baby face
Not withstanding provisions
Somebody wants to hear you say
Due to such trauma in my teeth
Now nothing is sacred
So I jumped into the back of and eighteenwheeler head north
Take all I have I've no secrets left to steal
Some phrases were shot, pretty roses got tossed
He has a tendency, a tendency to fall for shining eyes and baby fat
Baby, our love is true
Nobody knows it but me when I slip
I don't know what's with your friend
I found a place
We had a route, a walkabout,
To my left is a window, where did I go
Even in the afternoon
Ain't got no ticket, ain't got no token
I got it all on the back of my hand
Babe, I couldn't even find the door
If you find yourself out of love
I knew I'd find you in a day or two
That talk is even cheaper told in bulk
Since the day you've been gone I cannot keep from crying
A wolf from the steps,
I knew it'd work
We're tripping all over ourselves and pulling each other down
Going up in the fire
So I just bend their spoon
Dive straight in at the deep end
Lift your open hair
I think yore saying that you will make me mad,
We major, c'mon homie we major
I'm finally looking around
This is the head of the black death
From your cigarette
He can tell a fairy tale, it's happily ever after
A letter to sign, 
Copped mad cars, laying back in the driver's seat
Baby, put your name down on a piece of paper
So open up your eyes, 'cause seein' is believin
While we all ride on
Lie around all day have a drink to chase
Is there anything that I can do
Hey ah midnight cowboy
But not in love
Chalk it up to bad luck
Oh my days what have I done,
I turned away from all the others
When I turned 
You're two friends I can count on when I'm blue
Your alibis just don't sound right
I know sometimes we all wanna give in
The bottoms of barrels, let us be free
Shake it baby
Yeah but what you got, I don't need it
Something I could get used to
Playing dead was just no fun
For the brightest
And I can't help you until you start
I know more than I knew before
Just know I don't want to wander too far
It's a sight that I fear most
You're gonna need a heap of glue
But when the weather's nice all the other guys don't stand a chance 
You got me on a mission
Everybody come together
Got me feeling drunk and high
You keep stopping, should tell your girl more often
Ten in the morning
I'm halfway through a test
Done living like a runaway 
They know that I wanna kill them
It would come to this
Was If I could play deaf, dumb and blind
You can see that life's for us to talk about
We were asked at the attitudes, they reminded us of death
A time to even say
I'm all cried out 'cause I grew up cryin' 
That's all that really matters when you're living in hate
Love is within
I'll love you more and more, I'll love you more
Before I do something stupid
Saturday night and we in the spot
Won't you whisper your blues as heartfelt as you can
We can dance, we can dance, everybody's takin' the chance
You'll say it that's the way it is
Everybody gonna dance around
The breeze blowing softly on my face
Life's a piece of shit
Leave the horses hair on the slanted bow
And people are my religion, because I believe in them
Through fields of white flowers
Shut the door, count to four
Fifth time in your bedroom
I will never miss your phonecall
Pick it up and pack it up and put it in a bag
To the jungle, through the night forever
Still the memory of you
I was just singing in the rain
We're living at night trying to pull out the light
Though I'm dressed up out and all
Could we baby, honey try to put it right this time
Or an old ghost friend we don't believe in
Now it's your time to shine
Pulled out my insides with an old safety pin
Inhale, breathe steady, exhale
So where's the sun It shone no love on your face
I saw the wise woman sing
If you're with me let me hear you say
She says, "Let's go"
Cry your guts out till you got no more
Hits the bottle and goes right to the rock
Simple times now seem so far
To call up on the weekends with my cellular phone
Wait wait,
I'll be the lighter of fires 
You will come down soon too
But I'm gonna party tonight
And get away from it all
Closer, way up high
Up into a highrise block
Grab you expensive coat, and bury it inside
And go get us a loan
Money's all gone but you need some 
I'm going to turn into a lens and focus all my attention
Desde que estoy contigo la musica tiene 
When I heard your German accent, oh Silvia
I help you up to brush your teeth and then I kiss your stomach
My heart broke out in song
A book called Timbuktu
Fall into the wrong hands
Makes no difference where you are 
Shelltops is on
Where have your walls gone
The ghost of somebody at his side
Memory tells me that these times are worth working for
I want to see you rock to the piano, the piano
You're ok with the way this is going to be
I'm thinking baby you and I are undeniable
You did This one thing my soul may be feeling
Always worried 'bout what I'd lose
Mr Pleasant don't mind
The way you dip
And showed me Spain or somewhere
The more he knew he knew he didn't know shit
It's evidence of what he was like
I know happiness writes white,
I could show you what it is
But I made a promise to hold it in, hold it in
I just came to say hello 
Good day, sunshine
Dance all night, we gonna dance all night, dance all night to this DJ
You're lookin' at me
There's a lot words to come out
Oh yeah x
Through desire, desi sire, desire, through your desire
And soon I'll wake up and I'll forget it
And I'm sure you know its true 
The way you look like you do
You're drowned aways Drowned aways
You get that woo, you get that
And I got on with making myself
She's waiting for a soldier to come home
And we were back in ' 
'Cause you know you give me something
Okay I mean, don't get excited, man It's 'cause I'm short, I know
Now I wonder what my life is gonna mean if it's gone
They ain't getting too far
And we're walking and talking
I see that raincloud coming right for me
A glass of apple cider just waiting for you
Shiny, shiny pants and bleached blonde hair
Don't mistake for a party of jokes
There's no stopping me
So just what does tomorrow mean
Like some everlasting onion peeled by love
All I need is somewhere I feel the grass beneath my feet 
Down in Bronxy Bronx the kids go
I fell asleep on your cobweb
Ain't what you had in mind
A spaceship
I threw mine to the sky
And I say, rocking in the dance hall, moving with you
Take a look, take a look
Some place back there
Then won't you stay the night
Man, you got me burnin'
Riding out with my friends in a Mercedes Benz
Go surfin' the sun as it starts to rise
And we laughed at the beatitudes of a thousand lines
Erase what's on your mind
Someday he's gonna show us all, I bet
Enter sideways, reaching all around
But you could get back home, you can get back down;
Oh, when this life just gets so grating
I see a happy ending if I stand up tall
I never knew your middle name, no need to play that game 
Lets go my love
I'm a mating rhythm
You make me still
When we have nothing left to say
But don't you ever lose that light
If you believe in magic, don't bother to choose
A life with you I want
And I'm looking like a fool again, whoa oh
And I get so sick with the little things
For the folks back home, I will make them proud
Ça commence comme un rien
Go and make a change before the Big Sleep
'Cause every time before it's been like maybe yes and maybe no
I'm coming clean, please don't let it go
At you grass stained and runk on the ground, 
When we get bored we like to sit around sit around and stare
It's the summer, full of color, baby
You'd see it with your own two eyes
And a hardcore life 
You work on the torso and
And I spend most of my night guessing 
If you start believing in me
Don't you see your dreams lie right 
I hope you're feeling better
Most ideas turn to dust, as there are few in which we all can trust
Shake it back, shake it forth, we wanna see you move
You're a momma's boy, momma's boy
My My Time flies A man in a winter sleigh
Rise and shine my sister
A singer with a Spanish bum
But as she's getting ready to go 
A mother and a son and someone you know
You'll be going to bed soon
That thing can bring the tides, hey
Hiding in the bedroom
Oh, how she rocks in Keds and tube socks
Just mine and my baby
But my breath fogged up the glass
Bout fallen ones and miscues and misviews
I just want to stand and stare
Do it some more, I know we should
So when the shit came down why she was nowhere to be found
And when the plane came in, she said she was crashing
You've got to start somewhere
You can stretch right up and touch the sky
What you gonna do when it all breaks down
We gonna party like
I'll come back for another
You say, mmmm, you're my little girl
I don't think she'll know that I'm saying goodbye
I promise you, I'll show you such a good time
I thought I was Him
I can't feel it right now
Out in our place filled with lost existence
I keep on forgetting myself
Side by side, dream bigger
Thank him for every day you pass
A tape recording of the sound
Whenever I'm with you 
So when I trip on my feet
Teenage, in the pace age
The beat's really hot
Happy without you
As if you actually were inside a saltwater room
You said you hate the sound
Love for those, who can make a mil and sit back and laugh
So much love in you
We're Moments away, Moments away
Hearing them coming back
Everything seems nice
She fills up every corner like she's born in black and white
Now I can't forget you and it makes me mad
Though I know you'll never make the call
And say, "Your hair's on fire, you must have lost your wits," yeah
Was what I was waitin' for
Ah, she wants money, money, money, money, money
So c'mon try try Baby baby won't you try
The youngest was the cherub
And we can sleep where we reside
Knowing, as we're falling under, what was right
So when I say I want
How dare you come to me like Withnail for a favor
Murray Your fly is undone
Tågen går varenda år i samma spår
For the summer, for the summer
Ooh, I shot ya, yeah, I know
Stack it up, be on my way
Even in his heart, the Devil has to know the water level
If you knew what you do
Is it spring where you are
That I was weak at heart
And boy, you got it so wrong
Do you trip on love
Got my back,
I guess I'm stuck in this mad world
Still I know want a strangle or a mouth full
But you could be waiting for a day that won't come
Now it's me against the world
Though the nightmare is gone now I don't have a dream
In an octopus's garden near a cave
You know I won't be happy till you've won
My baby, my darling, I've been thinkin' of leaving
King of the South, every hood's head honcho
Would you stand up and walk out on me
How can I stay cool, calm, and collected
But she only comes when she's on top
We got it, we got it
We fell in fits across the floor
It doesn't matter what you ask, it's who you're asking
Can I get get get to know knknow know you better better, baby
Felt the need to get up for it
In my secret language
I was taking sips of it through my nose
I'll write down letters inside letters but I can't let her see
And she won't give up 'cause she's seventeen
It lets me know just where I've been
I don't want to start without you
Let's get set then to go then and let us jet set we'll be like the Jetsons
There's a place called Kokomo
We can settle by the sea
Before the whole thing is through
It's a precious child
Long live rock, long live rock, long live rock
So many tears to your eyes
You'll protect me with your coat
It's early in the morning
It always seems to be a flowing
What hasn't changed for you
Take it back to square one
I need to flick the switch and show you how to hide
Life is a flower Is a flower
I ain't got nothing to lose
And this was where about I fell 
Some people wind up
I found my soldier girl
You're in my heart
Set on you I got my mind on you
Pay no mind to the clown
Some days I feel like singing
Sickheart
Come fly with me, let's fly let's fly away
Who says we have cold hearts
So out come you clowns, all you wolves, all you martyrs
One hundred telephones shake and ring
I need you near me
But you are always looking out for me
And even when you're gone I listen to my favorite songs
Through countless deserts, dreams and jests
You'd be on your way to better things
You show your face and take it in and scream and pray
You were always meant to walk out that job
Kind of hope your Pops don't hear me right
And let me live again
And if you don't have a home you can buy one there
Throwing beams of bright light
Day turns to night
Some people wear their history like a map on their face
Jump in the line, rock your body in time Hoist those guns a little higher
I ask him very nicely if he'd like a cup of tea
So I got out of it
Woo ooh ooh ooh ooh
And we both have to get it on before the summer's gone
You see the boygirl's at the bar
But they were promised more from this life
I know if it's never coming back, it has to go
Bass, bass down low
'Cause in the evening hush
So change the weather
Here in your arms
In the hills and highlands
And I hope it, hope it stays that way
So rather than me you'd be depressed instead
After a while you start to smile, now you feel cool
That's chimps devoid of any hair
Happy, happy, happy, happy Bring me down, can't nothin'
Free of your future too
Let's kill tonight
Wild beam, wild boy, you burn so bright
Suburban Threat was the name and we really were
So come to me mama it ain't no crime
Sweating out all the whisky tømmermænd
Or a little unsettled inside
I'm fireyou're the ocean 
That I wouldn't be without you babe
And I know that it's so cliche to talk about you this way
Looking at life from the perspective of a boy
Rururururun run run run
Get it together, make it nice
We will write a postcard to our friends
Stranded in the fog of words
And he's bringing me a surprise
'Cause listen kid everybody knows you can fit good company up your nose
Just a touch, away
When my pass came in, you dropped the ball
Not my, not my, not my My imagination
When the daylight doesn't ever stay
Next in line, it's late
On my sleeve, let the runway start
You say stop and I say go, go, go
All that I know
The time has come for me to be someone, a rich man, a superstar
We're feeling so good
Make you feel so good
All this love melting under blue skies
And the way it's gonna be
Try the coffee shop, but somewhere on the way
And I'm like "There's no way to say and there's nothing I can do
You've fallen down so far,
Turn around your back on each other
When I'm far too tired to fall asleep
No matter what has ever come to me
I'm putting guitars on hold when my multitrack comes around
I have always kept my faith in love
I said your kisses are nice, 
You're braking ridicule
She's got a competition clutch with a fouronthefloor
Been getting too hard not to mention 
Acan I, can I get get get to know knknow know you better better baby x
Leaves and trees are calling you
Vámonos ya la luna se va
Miles and miles of English garden stretching past the willow tree
The chance to be heard, not ignored
All of the roads are open
I've got style
And it takes some words to make an action
She'd walk through the door and she'd set up the drinks on the house
The watersbrash and dark
My doctor says that I should take it
They don't sound like they did
She don't feel no pain
Yeah, I like it when the girls stop by in the summer
Play yo position, provide the plans, and follow procedures
She's given you everything she has
Still be into you 
Fillin' up my mind
You've got to make the morning last
I say girl
I had to put it in a song
Uhuh, uhuh, they can't do what we do baby
It seems I'd be sure not not to change it all
Your smile into striptease
Didn't get that TV show
These are a few of the visions I like
Inside the mirror is a false impression
Ain't nothing new, now, now
But they're the only friends that I have
You always knew
Other things just make you swear and curse
The horses are coming
You found success and recognition
'Cause I need you more than just for tonight
Your parents don't understand what's in your head
And I realized all about your lies,
Like the man said, let it all hang out
I doubt my reply would be interesting for you to hear 
The newlyborn crying realizing what life is
Yeah, yeah, yeah, ooh
So come on and hold my hand Hold my hand
I just wanna be your girl
Something so super real
The model with the tragic air
Six in the morning, baby
You look like an ace now, you look like an ace
If I could see you I'd take off your clothes,
Here comes the sun, and I say
And it beholds more than you love, more than you love
And I'm off to save the world
My hands were numb
Jesus told me go after every coin like it was the last in the world
I been photographed and painted up
From the point of loving thunder
And hey you know what
Sometimes I pretend
All together now
They be doin' the same thing y'all be doin'
When I'm feeling disconnected well I sure know what to do
I took a picture that I don't like to look at
They're gonna back up
So bring it up, bring it up, bring it up yeah
Young girl, girl, you're everything
I'll crawl the sandy bottom of Puget Sound
Slide it to the right and I roll
Hoping I could learn a bit about how to give and take
I, I can remember I remember
Hold me deep beneath your waves
We rarely practice discern
And no this won't be a sad song
Don't want to end up a cartoon
I want love in the afternoon
Alright
Spread your love and fly
But I believe the world is burning to the ground
Home for the weekend,
The lights are on 
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Find the snail to give us breath, to give us words
See me and Julio down by the schoolyard
I don't wrap you all the time, girl Don't wanna be rude but
Well, a lot of good cars
But her unhappiness exceeded what she'd flaunt
Ain't got no money, ain't got no class
I'm glad to see you
Be the most closed minded as I could get
Don't you wanna love me no more
Or is it right this way I feel
Inni í hjarta springur, flugvélarbrak
I will put the flowers on
A heart so big it hurts like hell
So I take a Calminex and just chill
Stop selling what you know, suddenly you're so sure
In her saucony kicks
 Chinese brothers; 
In my jacket, pack of playing cards
Don't run away now
Everybody's gonna make it to the cemetery
Cause there was a shift in the paradigm
The mama looked down and spit on the ground
And it's not much, if anything
Because people are the greatest thing to happen
Even when I watch TV
Sir all I want is a chance to amend
If only there were clothes on the floor
Dragging the sea of a trouble mind
Any friends, I've got one two three
Or its just vacation and we'll soon be friends
A pretty girl
But you should know I take it both ways
To sing to make you mine
The old are getting older, watch a young man die
You gotta wait, wait a minute
Wednesday, she's lookin' for a friend
And all the sunshine banishes the dark
Everything he'd do if he was president
But darling these days my favorite view is you
I think I'm in love,
In a forest grove at dawn
Our big break
I could watch the dreams flicker in your eyes 
We both were born to be one with that which the public scorned
Oh Saint Jerome
I can love you better
I was blessed with the body of the Goddesses
You need consistency
To look up at them clouds with that fake silver lining
Will you come with me
No staring out windows now 
Find it and shine it and wind it always
Something's gotta give soon
Oh, please say to me
Wash the blues away
He's out of luck, I'm with you
Cause everybody pitty a fool
Let me go, boys, let me go
And the voices in my head
And life is very fine
Hey you, could you ever fall for me
When tomorrow's too much
"And people are just people
Trying to pick up a girl
Oh damage
Hey, I see you working it
Real sugar, that's what you've got so what's for me
Come on, come on, Come on just get yourself inside her love
No, I never heard you callin' from the moon
But still you're doing whatever the man says
But Jackie had a baby, then she had five more
Clap your hands y'all it's alright 
When I Google I only get depressed
Maybe sometimes, we feel afraid, but it's all right
Heyla, heybahelloah cha cha
From when we get up 
You got me feeling drunk and high
I want you at the moment I feel blue 
Just watching the miles flying by
Because we're dead
You know we're sure to please you no matter what you do
Locked up inside my opium den
And I don't wanna let go
This towns skipping like a record
Oh, can't you see I'm full of lies
Stuck in my cabana, living on Bananas and Blow
And so that I do remember to never go that far,
The golden years are meant to leave a gleam in your eye
Who knows how long I've loved you
And no plans to take back
I can't wait to hit the stage
For your song on karaoke night
Don't you know you spin me out of control
And we'll have so much fun
And watched you tower over me
I tell you something
Can you recognize my thoughts
Mark Cohen will preview his new documentary about
Pick a verse, any verse, I'll hypnotize you with every line
All dress up, and dresstokill
Oh let the rain fall down
Who was recently given a Fulbright
Jacque Cousteau
Bright future, bright pink
Oh babe, I'm down down down on the ground
Come on now, yeah, come on, now,
Aw you've got flaws
Just keep on dancing now
You've been watching me for a while
Well, right you are
Through the park and by the tree
Covers and covers and covers in colours
Out of gas, out of road
There's a land that I dreamed of
Well, then you're down with me
My name would then be handsome Jack
I took something and it feels like karate
I'd like to be under the sea
It's getting darker and I know time wasn't meant for us
Forgive me and let me in
I said "Nothing is gonna be alright, but thank you anyway"
Moving on and down the road to the 
They say you have to have somebody
You got a look that made me think you're cool
Held me flat on my back, taught me how to give in
I took to the desert with your harshest words and they saved me
There was a shopping mall
Singin', don't worry about a thing
We used to believe we were stars aligned
I can't stay, very far
Remember the time we talked about everlastings
The call your life's been issuing you
Girls who are on magazine covers
Oh please, just don't ask me how I've been
Let's go today, in a heartbeat
Icy Cola Cokea, Sprite I love the mosta
I'm bouncing off the walls again, whoa oh
Just a better place to die
Turn your left on your right
Two sad sparks blinking in the sun
Close your eyes and use your mouth 
 ce qu'on ne pourra jamais plus toucher
I've been going wrong
And it burns so bright
Pay the camel back
I hear Beyoncé on the radio
Maybe just a little letter
I guess I get the gist of it
We keep the party moving till we drink the last drop
And It's you that I've been waiting to find
'Cause I can't live without you, without you
Now with your hand in mine
Someday holding hands in the end
These days await if we believe
They're gonna buy your life's time
You win something
It was fun fun fun, oh it was fun
One coast out to the other, following the sound
Out on the midnight the wild ones howl
Tuesday gymnastics
Bring a mirror to my face
Sat there with some new girl, what is this
Salvation waits at ocean shore,
That's the horse I'd ride
And you are having a nice time
When everything is wrong I'll come talk to you
For it is breathless without you
I just bought a table for  bucks
There's nothing to give no more
Electric love
Now you're living in my house
Funny how it seems like yesterday
That symbolize our lives
All night, I guess I did nothing right
Baby, I'm dying for another taste
Watching a film with a talking dog
Hey there sunshine lift my heart,
And you know that you feel it too
Your innocence no longer fuels surprise
Not to put too fine a point on it
Now my last penny has been spent
The help at the door
And if I ever had a wish in the whole world
When we go from the darkness into the light
You can have this song I wrote
To call my lover
And tonight I'm telling you honestly
Do you got mic control
His black shirt cries while his shoes get cold
Hey, it's 'cause of you
All we need is a reason
We were walking there
I hallucinated I could read your mind
We got no penny, no pound
But pain is the only promise that this so called savior is gonna bring
Let's give it a shot, let's give it a shot
The world moves faster than I knew, not fast enough
My mama said to slow down
And call it a gift
To find a room that's natural
Since I've heard your voice
And you light me up
The world beat you for the something nice 
All these beats
By slight of the hand you will turn them into dust
Back then, she was like the star in the movie
Making everybody look like ants from way up there, 
I'm still crying all night and all day
And let's agree there's no need, no more talk of money
You could beat out the comp
I miss you, oh you know
For estranged lovers and time all love ones get held up
But as long as I don't know how to hang a Warhol
And I will wear a badge to show my delight
Reef and Matty C offered me a little money
Let alone you won't forget my name
Jumpstart my kaleidoscope heart
You gave me something like loving
There's a feeling in your bottle
I dream of cherry pies
You held up a stage coach in the rain
They don't think what they say
Young, uniform minds
Many years since I was here
Yet there's something about you that he understands
Pay the camel back,
Trying to get around
A watering hole Big girl, you are beautiful
'Cause we're the kings and the queens of the new broken scene
Them good girls, straight masterpieces
And I don't want to make a wake out of my life
Oh every time I close my eyes
Yesterday's not quite the same let's make it plain
Crept up to my head
Walking around with shit on my shoes, well, here we come
Is it some kind of function
But photos on the walls of New York shopping malls
When we're looking for brushwood
I've got a crummy job
And we go back to where
It makes me crazy
You were lazy about it, you made me wait around
A world record player's on a tour of Japan
Oh, I sincerely miss those heavy metal bands
Sick of dressing like a human when I'm feeling like a leopard
Little bit of love, love, I feel as if I'm wastin'
We used to laugh till we cry
Their definition always changes
You don't need treats
And who you think you are screaming Hollywood burn
Yeah, baby, I'm down down I'm really down
You watered me down till
To go and lead a separate life
Like he's someone who's lost his way
Ferguson mono forty five
Why am I always on a plane or a fast train
If you ain't got the doremi, boys
And I'm feelin' like Mike at his baddest
Death never hands recycled cans
And every one is addressed to me
It is love from the first
He's got to keep his chin up
That they hoped it would rain forever
"Well I have no way to say and there's nothing I can do,
Why is it always, always
Outside it was pouring
City sounds are floating around
You're never coming back again, no, no
Because in supermarkets they turn the lights off when they want you to leave,
Daddy ain't home from the dog run 
That changed this little boy's brain
And I made believe it was me
And just so y'all know everyone else is not
Pretty green polkadot sky
Hell no no, whoa no, I won't let them take you, wont let them take you, hell no no
Learned who to fight with and pray to
What a lovely seaside holiday away
There's something to be said for luck
There's no stopping us
Are the songs that we sung when we chased them away
Until we realize that we are the same
Every little part of me is a part of you
Oh life, with your colorful surprises
I got a selfdestructo bust
It's jealously, they can see that we've got it going on
Twentyfive years old, my mother God rest her soul
Woooohoohoohooh
Been suffering the fools
Always always always travellin'
The sound of fear
I never felt this love from anyone
So I will help you read those books 
I can't help but feeling
You are not my typewriter
From now on somewhere I never knew
Honestly, all the weather storms I bring
And where's my friend, I wanna hold him tight
Gonna' take this boat and drive it out into the sea
And I'm not saying that I know what I want
No more a child
I'm gonna be the man who gets drunk next to you
Climb right on me, lay it on me
To win me some of your love
She's fighting with the sky
Meaning it today
If the malady don't go away we're in a little trouble
Slide over here, climb into my mouth now
It's a hop to a step to a jiggity drop
Time doesn't wait for anyone
To be etched upon my mind
Sometimes I catch myself staring into space
Holdin' back everyday the same
I can't get enough of you
You think you've got it
You tripped over my site
You paint a picture on the wall
Don't stop me
Though I sometimes feel like a clown
If this life is one act
In awe all day,
Woo hoo, but you know I'm yours
Standin' in line in the front of the club
Pack up your troubles, get your old kit bag
Something has died
On the outside
Hold me in your arms and sway me like the sea
Let the sideways rain in the crooked street remain
My lifeahahahahahife
Alone in our pad on Saturday night
Like how you feel if you drink some bud light
The last time you look me in the eyes
And how I, I am not into the idea of living without you
Baby's got a praise like a willow in the wind
For still, the fare of love is true
And dispatches from the back of my mind
You're a old school dude with a kick on your shoes;
Zone  through , you know what I'm sayin'
Have you considered the way
'Cause my heart's been keeping old
And that is why we'll always make it
That I'm passing you by, so fill your little world,
Join the human race
They don't believe our love is real
You like the sun
Ancient walls are tumblin' all over this town
Chance would have it that way
That's why I'm singing baby don't worry
Lovelife, Shifty rolls the dice snake eyes surprise
Just to take the money 
Every time you get high
To not creep up on you and the space we put between
And sway
You're a sane old boy, you're much too crazy to change
Up and down on my legs and my arms from you
As dirt becomes the butterflies
'Cause I never knew what I wanted till I looked into your eyes
I can do anything, anything, anything
You can tell by looking in, the party's plain crack
Yeah such a big day
Feel myself hovering off the ground
Each blade of grass as it lies down
Daddy works a long day
When it's just too far away
I took a photograph of you in the herbaceous border
Just like the gold around your finger and the silver in his hair
Baby sometimes, sometimes we don't know why
I walked the streets to find the one I'd looked for
So you better get on your feet
Might just lose a little faith
In the good and the bad books that I have read
It's a perfect day for getting wild
Don't stop don't stop don't stop, the beat
Yeah, I know sometimes that ya just don't fit in
Everybody was for fighting
Outlining wet sidewalks in halogen
On each street is a tree
It's land I can see for miles
And as we twirl the glow in the dark stars on your ceiling
States that keep us far apart
Talk is cheap but lies are even cheaper
Summer, summer, summer time to help us forget, nine to fives
arm in arm we are the harmless sociopaths
Nothing can stop gestalt
You just can't go back no more
So I will never know the right way to say thanks
You could seem a wasted affair
And I break out in a cold cold sweat
I hope you can forgive me for that time 
Come staggering out
To alter their opinions honey
But out there the world is a beautiful place
You say that there's a thousand like you
I guess I'll always be a child 
But, I'm afraid your brittle bones would break
But I can't live that way, oh
Seven weeks of reading papers
Written in the air
Twoinones forty five
Your lipstick stains
Reign of love
Begin to feel rather sad
We love this exaltation woh oh, ooooh
But I feel warm with your hand in mine
That make it possible for all white boys to dance
I've just got to get myself over me
You've got to let it go
To do it right
Yeah we shut our eyes though we're in doubt
From this black hole I've been living in
It's a shame or a sham, he's half as old as I am
Trapped inside a fantasy
Oregon girl with your lips and curls;
Pay the donkey back,
We're shining bright and I want you,
Because you know wherever you go
To the light
Shout out to the hearts you have known
Deer die with their eyes wide open
There is room for me
I was taught to dodge those issues
Suddenly I see Oh, yeah yeah
To find that our home
And I can't lift you up 'cause my mind is tired
I'm working it out inside
And drinking a beverage
Oh, hey, I put some new shoes on
The snare it sounds like a gunfire
It's Friday I'm in love, oh
I'll brace myself for the loneliness
And wreaking havoc on our world
It looks like the end of history as we know
The light that passes though me
Are we not, are we together 
You are making me crazy
It's such a perfect day
But I've been waiting, I've been waiting, I've been waiting, yeah
Depends on how far out you go
Oh that's the way it is
I'm on your side
It feels like years since it's been here
let's go to, the, the dandance floor
Bent crooked in the light around you
The day glows into the night
Give the word a chance to say 
In these streets we live in and die, when it's your time
Wanna hold you like never before
I've got so much love in my heart
You're drying up my bed
Nothing you can know that isn't known
'Cause we takin' these motherfuckers back to school
Searching the lines in my face for
The world is everlasting
I've been wrong times over
You make me dizzy when you play me like a kid with a crown
'Cause it's one thing to start it with a positive jam
We get down, get down, I want more
Keep shutting down the power
Blue becomes red and red becomes blue
But it turns me on
Make your tongue stick to the sun
Oh have you ever felt so goddamned strong
I'm not as young as I was
I'm turning my head up and down
They conspire in trying to keep us apart
Hey, remember that time when I would only smoke
It's nothing else but us right now
Countless times I've screamed 'oh brother'
Who can take the rainbow
You're gold
Me I ride this cat 'cause its claws have got my eyes,
All I wanna be, yeah all I ever wanna be, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Scattered diamonds through your dress
That the top floor is just an illusion
And leave our worries in the corner
Well my heart goes blind and the sun don't shine
I don't need the answer, the answer
It's getting heavy and I want to run and hide
That adds a dryness to the dry august grass
But I can tell you for the money
They are getting closer now
Love is all you need
These are the best days of our lives
'Cause there ain't nothing that's more certain
Shaking that thang like you're playing pop warner
And if we got hit to the end of the road
To keep my feet from jumping from the ground, dear
Take me to your best friend's house
'Cause I lose my way searching for stage lights
Felt the blushing blood run through my cheeks
Let's keep the moon awake
If you find yourself caught in love
All we care 'bout is talking
Nnnno, no, no, no place I'd rather be
Now the colors all melt together
Dance uptown right down to the gutter
And though I'm dressed up out and all
That's when the feeling hits
Yeah I wonder where you been
Yes we're lovers, and that is that
And I can't help feeling something's wrong
And now you're kicking me out again
There's too much riding on that anyway
I need the other one to hold you
The flower said "I wish I was a tree"
Right about now it's time for everybody to stand up
Oh yeah, all of the tension 
I've been trapped by love
Providing that's what you are into
Yeah, and I wish we could run to the sun
With all the stars above your eyes
The skies behind my eyes 
Because tomorrow always happens yesterday
And when the troubles arise, we hold on tight
He is decked by a Japanese geisha with a garland of pearls
All the zombies on a hot Friday night
You still think I'm someone to look up to
I tried to change their chemistry,
I'll be waiting
You motherfuckers better do your job and roll up, and watch how we roll up
Now that we can hear that sound
But now you need time to clear your mind
Well, it's all right, if you live the life you please
I'm looking in my almanac
As sure as though it always seems to stay the same
That uniform you're wearing
I don't know if you knew that
What you done with your time
Oh anyway, it's looking like a beautiful day
Vivo iludido a acreditar que o amor não se pôs em você
Sleeping with a gun,
To a distant place that you will be
We clicked our heels and we wished we were home
Workin' all day for a mean little guy
Because the world keeps spinning
I'll send a message
 double bins up front 
Don't abandon,
We kept them up instead of
They, they just roll their eyes
Gimme just a little break
Know that I will always run to greet you,
It's alive with the beating of a young heart
Now I would do anything to get the taste out of my mouth
Looking for a bottle to hold it in, hold it in
Some people get up at the break of day
Ooh, ooh, ooh ooh ooh
Remember when you moved to Nashville
The load on the road brings a tear to the indian's eye
It took a car crash to turn it around,
And if the lights are low they'll never see me frown
Eternally will always be
Let every second step in boots on snow
Oh yeah I'm forever lost
We'll start over again
And tell the man in the black cloak
We take back everything we said to
Far away, far away, far away
And sometimes my patience in the whole process starts bending
That no one could ever look at me like you do
Tonight we're gonna sing with the power of a thousand tongues
Sometimes it's not a good thing
I ran my mouth off a bit too much, oh, what did I say
Momma's boy, momma's boy
Could see another kind of mind there
Can't you feel it all come down
So I gather around me all the little pieces of a song
You can see me, don't go away
Listening to a sound
And you glow a purple star
Makes me wanna come right out
For hours there's no doubt
Oh we'll cry 'pass the wine, pass the wine, pass the wine'
Cause you and I we're good together, oh
It's true, everyday I stumble
The pebbles forgive me, the trees forgive me
And some plans for a furniture store
In your message say my name
And they just took her to the sea for the first time
Hey, now, hear what I say
Oh I won't sleep tonight
We both have shiny happy fits of rage
Before I sold records, no promotion
Stop at Third and Fortythree, exit to the night
St paul was there to marry us
The tracksuits are old, and the hoodie's way too moody
Honey, I can stand up and face the world
Oh and she should have kept her head
Doin do do, feelin' groovy
Go for the moon
That you won't walk out on me
Full of twists and turns
From the cinematographer's party
Give you something good to celebrate
I saw the world crashing all around your face
Hits the bottle and goes right to the rocks
In the bank of a million dreams
Well, Barbie, we're just gettin' started
And we're so cold
This moment is the moment I will appreciate
I can't get used to this lifestyle
It's easy being with you, sacred simplicity
Da da da dah, da da da dah
But it was fun fun fun when we were drinking
All we need's a little time to chase the blues away
Ooh I'm dancing, dancing I'm in the groove, babe
This is my heaven at night
When every race is run
That I'm ready to hold you now, hold you now
The dock in the lazy sun
Add just a touch of magic, it's the greatest thing since rock n' roll
I left the house left the room with the foxy on my back
That is just like my mom
That's a thing that I keep 
Till we fall asleep
Don't say it's gonna be all right
When we go out dancing I don't want to be bothered
So let's drive through the night
My friends and family
I'm hanging by my teeth
And I will work, will work these fields
No matter what they say, we're heroes, boy we'll get to break out
Let the world see what you have got
And parallel evenings
That when we forget about everything that hurts us
But does something skip inside you
I suppose that's just the way the cookie crumbles
I wanna be with you tonight
Put a penny in the slot and watch the Drunken sailor boy dance
One fine day we'll run away
I can keep it inside
'Round and 'round and 'round
I'm a little ashamed for asking
We go fishing or go swimming in the sea
Like a hundred souls escaping
You've only got what you've just polished clean
Nothing to do to save his life, call his wife in
And get loose, can you, get loose, can you
Never let it out just like that
Use it for something good
It was always you and me, just me
Good news will work its way to all them plans
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
Now I'm crawling towards the sun
'Cause you're always wrong and I'm always right
Breathe, and I'll carry you away into the velvet sky
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground runnin'
Don't break down, let's go forget about yourself
But I opened my eyes and walked out the door
You give to the next on down the line
My story's infinite
I'm drunk, I'm singing, I'm happy and loud
Clean it out to the side
But it's too late to turn your age around she's not the one you want
The kids were shouting "Let us out"
Crimson and clover Don't, don't, don't let's start, why did we ever part
Well take a journey into my mind
'Cause I know if I'm up all night
Take me to where your sister lives
Ready for the bad things to come
Sitting on a camel back,
He taught me how to watch, fight and pray
Are we just faces in the crowd
Lead me out on the moonlit floor
"I'll break your heart"
It didn't suit Sukie
There's no point in taking chances 
The piano took up the living room
I should have known better with a girl like you
Think I am looking over your shoulder
They could not believe that such a body was for real
Night covers all our tracks 
And the sea is just a wetter version of the skies
Something tells me I'm into something good
Without you, it's a waste of time
I've gotta find my way to your heart
A wet cigarette in the rain
I love to mix in circles, cliques, and social coteries, that's me
Far away, to stay
As their shackles hit the ground
He had money for the truth
I will not tell you this, because
Birthday greetings, bottle of wine
Here's the brand new me
Keep my love going lifting me higher and higher
Try and test that, you' re bound to get served
Last night, girl, like a dream Hey
Everybody gonna sing it out
And it's time for something never knowing, oh
Yes, the Candy Man can 'cause he mixes it with love
Martha, my dear
We'd be the best of friends, you could stay here forever
And gave thanks for being a hundred and still feeling amazed
She didn't make Italia Conte
I get the tinglies in a silly place
Had a boy once who loved me
Write our names in the burning sand
You know, I wish that I could see you soon
You could win a rabbit
I guess I lose but life goes on
You won't have to say it twice
My lifeahahahahahife 
I rise as the morning comes
That feeling when I'm all alone
You know, you know that I'll try
And nights of together are where
I am the green in the grass
Put the windows down, scream in doubt, really tune it out
But don't miss me goodness because I rub away every time
Counting the days until they set you free again,
I don�t keep friends, I keep acquainted
It's your own life
Wake up to show me what I could not find
They never add up anyway
If you need a little money keep working alright
And I feel alive
To me in any sense at all
Oh, c'mon girl
Yea, I'll see you tomorrow
You wear your smile like it was going out of fashion
A ceremony comes An exponential fate
TIP Pimp quad Clique, you understand that Grand Hustle, pimp
She's so beautiful now she doesn't wear her shoes
I'm blowing the day to take a walk in the sun
Maybe I'll fly
But restlessness has siezed me now, it's true 
all I wanna do is get off
Oh, how I need a hand in mine to feel
Until, the light we are returning
You've got the attic window looking out on the cathedral 
But then I started wondering
And you got me wanting you
This maudlin career has come to an end
I believe I believe someone's watching over me
I'm not going to let stuff get me upset, and I won't let all the little things get me depressed
Your heart is too strong anyway
I saw you walking
Moving way too fast
Just give me my first chance, it's gonna be the last
Bucket seats have all got to go
And shop at home
The pay was ok but I didn't like to swab
We better drop them sails and get inside
She wants to dance around the world
You collect lovers like gem stones,
Oh when the wild was all covered by snow
All right
And big bright lights INEQUALITY FRANCHISED
To bring you the beats in time
Ohoh, ohoh everybody
That you give me no reason, you know you're making me work so hard
Of doubt in my mind
Someone help us please
Still I think I'm doin' fine You're doin' fine
The other guy
Talking sweet and looking fine
"Ok, let's fly", she says, "this carpet's made for two"
Then what makes, then what makes What makes, what makes
And let me know that you're mine let me know you're mine
Back to the room where it all began
Before the party's over make it on over
But then he cracks a smile
And that will bring everybody down
Somebody came and took your bed
And so does a table whose name is Ingo
Gotta get it back to
And you thought he was cute before
From the sunrise up above to the sunset below, they all sing
You're putting on an awesome show
In every day and any hour
Solemn summer
My dear, I went for the steal
I fell right through the cracks
And I think about how long it will take them to blow us away
Clean these fingers clossing the line
Their pretty girls and their burning men
I'll be next to you and you'll be right there next to me
And it's okay
The way I'm feeling, it's gonna happen
So what do you say hey hey
Everything, everything's magic
Wonderin' if there's clouds and stuff in hell
Oh baby, I need one more chance, ha
Suddenly all comes back
When your tyres are flat
I have done a few things I regret
See I would if I could I'd do anything spontaneously
Gentle in your eyes
She don't feel the same
I love making you believe
I take a piece of paper
The time I spent with my life on bent
He's on a strike and looking at you
To wake up with a smile
Feel the cold air all around
I've got the magic in me I got the magic, baby
Every second is a highlight
I'm having a ball, oh baby, don't stop me now
The ship you used to sail the sea
It was made up in your mind, could be anyone, anywhere
In your life
Very clever people know we all need a chance
Can I get your lips to speak my name
And it turns off and goes again 
Am I wrong for thinking out the box from where I stay
That you might think of me as a man
I'm spilling out the door
Seems like there's always someone who disapproves
Imagine if the life that you thought you shared wasn't really there
I can't get enough
Some people ride the wave of generosity,
Here in a paradise that shakes the word romantic to the bone
After all that I've come from, you're the woman I should run from
Geezer lighter the futures brighter
"Well maybe you should just drink a lot less coffee
We should know better Dream of better lives the kind which never hate
Oh, they don't know nothing
My love you built a wall inside your heart
You've got your nest and
Oh how does it feel to be the one shut out
I can't hear anything, but hey, hey
And you are not alone
Do you think of me when you are playing
I was employee of the month at seven different shopping malls
Oh, California in the summer
But she takes notice of the beauty everywhere
Do the whirlwind, do the whirlwind
In the streetlight dawn,
I'm a blond, bimbo girl, in a fantasy world
She was the sweetest thing that you had ever seen
Cause now you got me missing you
I wish you were here tonight dear Yoko
The rest is still unwritten
I'm off to the west, it's blinding my eyes
Saying, "Yo, have you ever said a pretty word"
I was dishing out the same dirty looks
I knew no vices and I knew no sins
Take me on a trip, I'd like to go some day
Put on your hard hats and invisible gloves
Where the air was so clear
For that searchlight come shining and finds me under a cloud
And round and round clockwise
To the music of drunken beatings
A little number counting back to nine
So glad that you fell in love with me
Me amongst the blusher and glow
And watch as your heart speeds up endlessly
Let's go away, let's go away To stay in a heartbeat
But it kicks, yeah
Our inclinations, hidden in looks
I will kiss you soft so you know
How many times the city making me promises
Didn't belong to a couple of old white guys 
It's a shot in the dark but I'll make it 
All I know is to take my medicine I always take my medicine
We hope to find enough outstanding
I am at home in this high five
Slip away discreetly
Just like I knew you would like I knew you would, ooh
Creepy clowns from onehorse towns 
I've been a river bed, I tried to salt the wound
Unless it eases your mind
Make it my fault, win the game
Could we please be objective
Our aspirations are wrapped up in books
Now I'm lit up inside
Can't stop thinking 'bout it
All shrunk down in a twofoot tube
Gonna look you right in the face
Our plane is sleeping on a cloud
Burn this land
'Cause I'm done with that, I've got one foot out the door
Now here's a happy ending to believe in
Shake shake shimmy shimmy
No way they said take it, take it and he said make it with your own two hands
You got a feeling nothing here is free
Time flew, cut through, all over town
Drunk all the time
Speed up your breathing
Before the cool done run out I'll be giving it my bestest
We walked along lonely streets and got to know ourselves
And your mind don't work the way you want it to
I'll take your far away
Hold it up, hold it strong,
I wanna make a supersonic man out of you
She's instantly more pretty and more interesting than me
So lovely
I don't know why I feel so tonguetied
Memories bring us back to where we've been
If you want some more then she's fast asleep
Sad hopes I'd hidden under
That you'll find somebody else like me
And we'll all float on okay
Why are we losing time
No surprises in the record collection, you must have thought I was someone else
I've got your photograph
Now the fuzzy stare from not being there on a confusing morning week
Return like a prodigal sheep
And I've seen honey bees before
Or if you're gonna find a new boy to spoon
And all the life about to go is in my mind,
Without saying goodbye
I've been hoping you're moping around the street again
To a reign of love
I'd take all your hope and yearning 
Did you stand there all alone
Won't worry my life away
These are the hymns that today we've ignored
Desmond has a barrow at the marketplace
I've just crossed the line
A kind of love that will break my heart
Electricity wires are down
And now I'm glad I hitched my apple wagon to your star,
You sit on the bed in the dark changing places
And completely new to me
And I can say that I have
I found the cause
Hug my family and take your picture off the wall
I was picked up and then dropped off in a culture counterclockwise turned around
Leave the great indoors
Struck a sparkling tone like a xylophone
The birds have stopped their singing
Here in this diary I write you visions of my summer
I'm gonna do the things you do
You'd better watch that you don't cut your hands
And I know you made your point but I just don't want to remember, yeah
'Cause baby, I can love you, baby, I can love you 
Between his brain and his tail
Why we still runnin' in place frustrated
Just sneak out and don't tell a soul goodbye
Well you knew all along
Everything is fine, dad
Every minute I will count
Stingin' me with your attitude
Let me tell ya, your love your love keeps lifting me
The paedophiles playing his neck of the woods,
But homework he can wait
Sneak a poem in dirty zones 
Can't justify it still
All the things I couldn't mend without escaping
When she knew she had been bad
How could you ever let go
But I'm still, I'm still an animal
Catch a bright star and aplace it on your forehead
I've got you to propel me 
Right here between their crossfire
Forty grand, looked into her eyes, I saw tears falling
Kickdrum on the basement floor
Oh, And in the morning your eyes open so innocent
I won't take anything away
You know I'm not the kind to say that it's over
And I can't stop the reels from turning
Nothing new for me
This is the head, this is the head 
Gonna' paint the sky so red that I won't wanna feel
And know them all
I'll be 'round
Nigga prolly thought, man, I had
I was one of those
She knows she's losing it, oh yeah she's losing it
They call me hell
Leave your baggage behind, you won't need it tonight, enjoy your flight
For my head for my heart for it's true
I hang on every word
She's always looking for a fight
And you know deep down
Then you stumbled around for a good ten minutes 
'Cause love's gonna get you down
But in some ways they remain the same
So I'm showin' you the door, wave goodbye
The bouncer was approaching me
We could steal time just for one day
Just tell me do ya love me Do ya love me 'cause I wanna know
Somos solamente yo y tu conciencia
Well what if I was one of them
Sometimes you get so low, you don't know why,
Stay awake and watch for the data
And you know he never showed his face again
Cause you can't feel a thing
The music shaped our lives
Prepare to be astounded, no ghost or poltergeist
I'll maybe tell you all about it someday
And it feels like there's no place to land
I want to be with you
If everybody had an ocean
I learned how to hold on
be nothing
And if I do I know the way there
Ttttable yet
I wanna get you tonight
And the dream that you dare to, why, oh why can't I
After killing Jason off and countless screaming Argonauts
But now you are all I see
Then show time and now they're making rock 'n' roll
I'm waking up and baking
Electricity in the air
These are my faces
That I ever stayed
She puts her hands against
And when the fun ends 
Do you play with the girls, play with the boys
Parents and governors can you handle the truth
Say it out loud it'll be okay 
I'm in a mess, I'm in a dress
They try to pull the wool over our eyes And tell us everything's all right
The power to see
Our aspirations, wrapped up in books
That you can't define all the paths to take
My baby, my darling, I've been takin' a beating
Completely unaware, could be anywhere, anytime
And when at last, my work is done
That was fast
Boom boom boom tick tock boom
From my head to the
Star light has what you need
Then again, who knows
Mom and Dad are out of town all week,
Why you staring
But time is often on my side but I give it to you tonight
They play Sleepy Jackson on the radio
Given them what they dream of
Last night I had a dream we were inseparably entwined
All the blearyeyed boys getting high on the low street
Even the stars
So we can start right now,
All I wanted was to see her naked
The policeman
Everything laid out for you
You've got to look at life the way it oughta be
Like that time I forgot to tell you about the scar 
Find a tree and put in your house
I can't forget all the things we did
Paintbynumber morning sky
And girl, you got it so bad
If we just don't get it our own way 
He is surrounded by the sound, sound
But I'm in love with Stacy's mom
And your heart is finally mending
Forget about yourself and all your plans
Ikea meatballs, tasty
You'll tell them you're proud of my marvelous flight
That's the kind of world that we're living in today
You're back so late
From this dream where she was trying to show me
The sky is clear and the moon is full
I need you, CHA CHA
Get out of the car
I feel like a ghost who's got a skeleton face
Dap deeh n deeh dah
"Time to put the earphones on"
Don't call me crazy, I'm happy 
Who needs boys when there's Lisa round"
It's like there's no one else in the room
But contessa, I already did
C'mon everybody, move your feet
Make haste, I feel your heartbeat
Taking in the sights of your empire's colony
Go ahead and marry anyway
I can't stand the fact that this extremity is the center of my day
Hanging out at truck stops
We can kiss and undress or if you want just talk
So I will say,
Like the darkness around me
God, the way she moves moves me
That you don't know it's true
With your feet on the ground and your head to the sky
You're too pure for this wicked world
I won't do you no harm
Watching the world go 'round
And makes me fight for something that just can't last
Enjoy the good times love can bring
We feel like strangers
She still got plenty lonely but that's just the case
Come on sweet catastrophe
When they told you to clear the room, that's when it hit you
What the writers say, it means shit to me now
You look down on me, but you don't look down on me at all
You are so rarely
For a minute, I stayed watching this brilliant display,
Below the Northern Lights, I spend my coldest nights
Where they always have belonged
I always knew
My hand still shiver from the very thought of it
You've got to lose control most every night
Keep our teeth nice and clean
By the side of the road
I'll only end up losing you
They're calling us together
In bedrooms above
But, I had to stop from the shock of what I found
Hot diggity dog
Give myself again till the well runs dry
Listen to the music playing in your head
Of lovin' and a cheatin' the snake gon' bite 
Gonna pick you up like a paper cup
But ooh, baby, baby, come pick me up in your ride
A hero zero with a capital Z that's me
But I was so embarressed that I missed your party
Clap along if you feel like that's what you want to do
And if you just look around man
We are shocked to be here in the face of the meantime
Come into my life 
Helping the kids out of their coats
But I'll stay in love, in love with you
Just look at what we got ourselves into
If you don't have a point to make
Depende da paix~ao              	        It depends on the passion
I will be kind and I'll be sweet
Today
Hey, girl, why can't you carry on Carry on
The road is long and winding
Who knows someone I once knew
Down where the walls started shaking
I might be busy doing nothing but I've had my share
I dream about you often, my pretty darlin' Darlin' you're so fine
Measure worn out epigrams for signs of change with age
He says his prayers and
Can't stop, can't stop the beat
I met a girl who kept tattoos
Sometimes I see her sitting on the rooftop
Keep on whispering in my ear
I'm like workin with a bird, I got long product
'Cause baby, I can love you, baby, I can love you better
Everybody has to get their hands on gold
Someone remembers
Run around in circles all day long
There was a time when my world
That I love you
I've got to change your mind change your mind
Shake it, shake it sugar
People in love get everything wrong
You watched as the caravan took your sweetheart away
I've tried to indicate that she could be someone for me
Yeah I promise you my friends
Is that a new boy stuck on your shoe
In church on Sunday making out in front of the preacher
You might not roll back my direction real soon
You just need to understand
So I drop my top, mix and I mingle
Yeah well I believe it all is coming to an end
She knows she's losing it, oh yeah she's losing
That's who has replaced me, what a diss
Friends go jogging at the track
Sugar, sugar Honey, honey, sugar, sugar
Oh, don't you think by now there's truth
I bought a one way ticket
And all of the people come and gone
We discovered one another stumbling through another summer
Soldiers, you've got to soldier on
And never ever let them see you fall
With the sun shining down over me and you
Go home and cry to your mama tonight
Don't try to let yourself down
Well, here comes my car here comes my car
We all want to know when we're all meant to go
You cut in line, you're cutting cake;
I'd turn the, lights down long enough to hit repeat babe
Dearly Beloved We Gather Here To Say
Kate Moss in ads for mascara
You blew me off, but I don't mind
But we're all in this together
The sky above, zing, boom
Now don't that feel like sunshine after all Don't it feel like sunshine after all
If there is one thing that's true
For once I can say
Have you got the time
Let yourself be enchanted, you just might break through 
Boy, let me love you and show you how special you are
Some postman you turned out to be
You've got to pick me up
That love never dies, love never ends
If any word that I said
The weekend we were in love
Friends do not let friends do crack
leaving its scars
Still I kept the sight of my desire
It's the way that she curses
I'm a legend in my spare time
So what's wrong with taking the back streets
Oh Great Bears and Bulls, Joe Jackson Given what you had, has it made you mad
Here is the time when we didn't speak
To take it to the top
Ooh, Tonight the stars are oh so bright
Everyone you see is full of life
You'll be my American boy, American boy
She's always screamin' when she's calling her friend
And you fall in the same routine
Popular mechanics for broken hearts could help me now
Don't go kidd yourself well not today
Life ain't always easy and every day
And then I look down
But this feels so unnatural, Peter Gabriel too
Looking at the trends of men down through your family
You see, I just can't stop it
You said 'drink from me, drink from me'
Here we stand
You give me a feeling in my heart, 
, the heart was not your master
Cross when the drawbridge light is green
To carry out missions 
I feel like I've been missing me
I said people are people regardless of gender
Cold hearts brew colder songs
I loved you then and I love you now
My high heels are clicking towards your door
Now walk with me, walk with me, keep up for sure
Images of rapture
You've got it That's it You've got it That's it, man Whoo That's it, you've got it
Straight from a dreamy castle in the air
But there was nobody to answer
Land I can see for miles
She whispered 'wait for the trumpet's call'
Like love, loss, lies and us and woh oh
Tap the beat on the wheel as the tires spin
So why don't we just move into the other room 
But it's always the same problem,
A palm tree in Christmas lights
It feels less important when you want to wait it out
So let's let yesterday go
The sky the trees, houses, buildings, even my own body
Leave the city for an open highway
Besame Cuando Estes Bailando Come On
Boy, your touch makes me feel like
Wakin' up in someone else's bed,
They just look away
I feel your baseline bumping
Baby, I know you do this to all the girls, but baby, I'm fragile
I'll clear your doubts away
Yeah I know what I should get this time
You know that fortune favors the brave
We just need some time apart
Fly, fly, baby don't cry
No me, no world, no mind, no face
For us to dance, dance, dance till the break of dawn
And looking out her window she could more than assume
Shimmering, travelling by
If that's the way it is
Till your sinews spoil
Let's love now
The words he knows are all obscene
Here is when we shout
There's lots of fun to be had on these streets
Into a fog, into a lonely drink
Clap along if you feel like that's what you wanna do, yeah
I'm undefined
The mountain top
La la la la, friends friends friends
"All that glitters is gold"
You just say what's on your mind
I don't care whether you hear this
And I'm sitting here wearing the weight of the world on my shoulders
What you, don't know
Tryin' to pretend that we both know
A Bright And Charming Girl Like You
What I'm looking for is a sign that you feel how I feel for you
I didn't mind what I did
And I just don't believe my eyes
Your the best girl that I ever did see
Hold me now, don't start shaking
Run like you really wanna be at the top
Held myself down, just steering the wheel
Just wanna shout "What the fuck"
We've gotta get out of this place, she said
And he woke me up again to say
From the light that calls my name 
"Time isn't kind or unkind," you liked to say
Say you will, say you won't
Gotta find it within myself somehow
I guess I've always been a bit of a fighter
I will be your light, I will be your light 
I know you hate that
This girl he thought she was,
Dressed up as bubblegum, I'm stuck to your shoe, let's run
Well, shake it up, baby, now shake it up, baby
Call the police and the fireman
To sing you're okay
Gonna make some plans
I wonder what clothes you wear to school
Love, love, love, love you till Tuesday
Yes I'll make it all mine
I know you're gone
It makes you calm
That was never my intention
Wanna make love show you what I can do
Holy Moses our hearts are screaming
Keep me up, but keep me in my head
They come on strong and it ain't too long
'Cause they're those girls, yeah, you know those girls
Take me off somewhere cold
But I'm a little glowing friend
Oohoohhoooohooh oohoohoohoohoohoohooh
Ooh, by your side
But sister, it's the opposite of hallelujah
When did your heart go missing, yeah
I had a dream we went away,
A little bit of Rita is all I need
Oh, I just want to sit around your life and breathe your air
To get better with time
I don't feel like I'm fallin' And I'm so fly that
But Fly Ty didn't have the contract we wanted
It was a strange thing to do
And to strike faster than lightning
Oh no, what did I say What can I say
With nothing but a piece of rope
Just say oui si sim da ja yow igen kylla
Come and go, caught that slow alright
You may hear the angels cheer 
There's a party going down
Seven weeks of river walkways
We stayed up till  am, with all the gossip and the latest girls
There are things you can do man
When we can say good night and stay together
Eclectic electric, ladies of the evenin', drinkin' booze and minglin'
And the captain is playing the radio
We're on our way
Joining together and still faster x
I lie awake ain't asleep no more
They call me quiet girl
Of falling in love
Just slept way too much, just slept
Stolen goods stashed underneath the overhang
Lay down in the tall grass
I gotta get away 
But now since I see you in his arms, uh huh
It might be you and me oh just wait and see
'Cause they all lead to better days
Well goodness, goodness woe is me
Sentada do seu lado eu queria encostar
To do some lovin' and hold you tight
The color after sunset
The room calls to me, says we're all strung out
I saw you just the other day
I'm gonna swim in seas of green, I tell you
And you know we're all tied, and it's tied at one
Strings on my fathers old guitar
Two little kids out selling lemonade in the sun
Oh woes be me, it's a jungle inside
Pardon god and mom
Care to put your life in mine
Friends walk together, la la la la
And I've been flying high all night
Oh yeah Oh yeah Oh yeah Oh yeah
I've been thinking I'm drinking too many drinks all by myself
Please don't play the matchmaker
I might walk home alone
On the floor
Blood, blood, blood; blood and fire
And we can't be together
Mister Blue Sky is living here today
Never really know until you try
I like watchin' the puddles gather rain
Rocking in the dance hall moving with you
Everybody's wondering where'd he go
Picture a scene in your mind
Clawing at my skin and bones
Go on believe, if it turns you on
The bottom of the bottle is my only friend
Will you stay here, for awhile, dear
Now the plain blondes are playing along with you
See the world sometimes
Let's go buy an icecream and a magazine with an attitude and put on a cassette,
I always knew you were a fraud
That I will love you
Yeah, every Friday I'm getting ready to roll
And if you don't see yourself in the mirror, forget what you did
To worry about some things
Put your arms around me baby
You're right back where you started 
No, I can't sleep
Now I found my feet
About the people we see
It's all bad, it's all good baby can't you see
The ship going down
I sit in the window watching my days from a safe distance
Hey, hey I keep my head down but I keep on swingin'
Who am I we both don't know
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off whoo
To the jungle through the night in paradise
Say love, say love
Take order in your own hands
A hand over the window
You are the colour my dear
I remember
Oh Silvia, no one will care in a hundred years
Break your heart
It's like I'm on the moon 
Is hoping to take you away
From the moment I arise 
To build a house up on an Oregon hill
You didn't see it coming
In the cold wet ground
She's there to love me, all day and night
You I will Will rise will rise Above above The room
You'll love him till you die
So this is what they do out here for fun
Through the rain and open wind
We're sinking
Just one of those days, had a blue, perfect wave
Always look on the right side of life
I wrote to tell you that I hope you're feeling better
There's a glow off the pavement, you walk me to the car
Are you with me
I'll savor the pause for a while 
Pack up your troubles in your old kit bag
Because a part of you will die
But now I can't seem to pretend 
Hell no no, oh no, I won't let them take you, won't let them take you,
That to live you let go of me with each step
And I've sung all I have to sing
Eternally it will always be
The reconstruction had just started
If you're the bird whenever we pretend it's summer
Clap along if you feel like happiness is the truth
This is the definition of my life 
I'mma let you try to convince me to 
Find the money for your rent, find the money for your rent
I hear it calling outside my window 
In its love
And it's another thing to see it all through
What is she thinking Too much uncertainty 
You're just jonesing for a spill
The fast child is gonna have a dead hand
While lessons learned go down the drain 
We can't wait for June
Same sweet fate
Pour your sweetness over me
The way for us to change
Carve into the drawing board, just to wash it clean
Send your epistle to my better fellows
Sat by the fireside, apondering on
A single thing to say
The great weight of ordeals
Who You baby, you Baby, yeah
'Cause you were my protection from the rain outside
Let's get happy
They say, you learn from your mistakes
In your heart
No hope, no love, no glory
The light is the sign, that love will guide you home True love
If we could all say we're sorry
It stands for hero, and the hero is me
So meet her by the sugar mill after school 
But in discos they turn them on
And we know that it could be
And she should've had her day
About the good things I found
But I still need so much
Sunshine it's all I wanted
And wherever you are, land on another star
Please don't let me go
Yes, I saw everything
Walk your walk and don't look back, always do what you decide
And I'm dancing like every song he spins is bis
Crying's not for me, 'cause,
Tie you to a stake and watch you burn in Hell
LOVE love, it's coming back, it's coming back
All together now
I want you back
Looking for fun and feeling groovy
And the redbreasted robin beats his wings
Occupy my mind
Heaven was a place still in space not in motion
Still I'm the only one who seems to care
I'm trav'ling at the speed of light
Your dark mascara bids me to historical deeds
While my friend, my associate
I'm about to take this drink and just stuff it
No, you don't even know my name
My sunshine If you steal my sunshine
So I changed it for a bass guitar
Sell a block for  you got for  a gram
And I feel like I do
I've got friends who have married
When I was a young boy
The trips reset so I'm unsure
You see, we just can't stop it
Hello sunshine
So it's really me I want you to count the ways you can make it up to me
It's all about the wordplay
Why would anyone need a map or a compass
Her CD changer's full of singers that are mad at their dad
Rules are rules
It's okay if you don't know everything
Oh, they don't know
With fronds like these, well who needs anemones
So black and blue, ooh
I don't need a photograph 'cause you've never left my mind
Well, there's a few things in this world 
I didn't say
I knew that it would be that way
And ba, bababababy, please don't blow me away away away
And hope that my dreams will come true
I just can't switch myself off
A homeless woman walking around in the snow
Wont you come out and dance with me
Got to leave and get ready for my second date
People around you
Is it amanaemonesia
We can be a whole group of friends
But your body language is telling me that I'm not to blame
And their tiny little hands
It hurts to see you looking so fine
Let's come together
You're so restless, it must be special there
You touch my inner smlie
So what went wrong, it was a lie, it crumbled apart
Bury your eyes in a secret place
That's not always the case
So let the love tear us apart
Sing your life
And float down Grand Street in daylight
Someday you're going to realise
That you don't know me anymore
You are driving me frantic
I said girl
Those are the best days of my
And played some memories stored in it
Maybe losing my mind
As a broken man
You've got time, you've got money but you wrap it in a joint 'cause you don't see the point in using your time for making your dreams come true
There's nothing from here till tomorrow morning
Pour a little sugar on it, yeah
I left all my friends at the morning bus stop shaking their heads
The days before the day we die
Some are worth while and some are so so
Hell if music is the victim then so am I 
Whoa, yeah
Oh, someday I'll wish upon a star
I don't feel like I'm falling falling falling
And we don't care about their own folks
And I can't keep this smile off my face
When the night always ends with a fight I'm excited
Everyone you see is half asleep
They're picking scars
Well they're the perfect jumping up point
If you are confused, check with the sun
That you can't decide all the ways to say
What will it take to make or break this hint of love
But I've got wheels 
No one gets you any, no one needs you any 
Of luck
You'll always keep the magic
And drift, into water
Just like the dollar's gonna make everybody scream
I'm done dreamin' that we can fly
A message you can swallow, 
I kneel to condition all the feelings that I feel
And though I can't guarantee there's nothing scary hiding under your bed
And I'm on my way, I don't know where I'm going
Is it ours to let go
I have to let you know
I've been, I've been thinking
They come and they go
Too many shades of gray
Anywhere anymore you are what I'm looking for
It makes my baby seem so far
If it's a dry life that you want
Well you didn't stop
Trying all the time to find something that would make you mine
A breeze whips through the trees
When I consider what you put up with I'm amazed you still have skin
Sometimes my tries 
'Cause everybody knows he pumps you for your money
You're the love of my life
Of the scene as she turns
Colours are what keep me alive
I'm feeling sexy and free
To save my life
And you fall apart, cause you felt apart
Reluctantly, cause most of this press don't fuck wit me
There's always more left over,
Let your love fly like a bird on a wing
They say, Sir, do you got a light
Oohoohooh, hoohoo, hoohoohoo
So wouldn't you like to come with me
And the air hangs heavy like a dulling wine
Work, work, work, Senora
And carry the hope that stings all night long,
Yeah, yeah, yeah la la la
Why can't you understand
I've been poking a voodoo doll that you do not know I made 
Well I've been pushed to the edge by my headache blues
I said, Darlin' do not fear what you don't really know
To live their life on a sunny day
So what if this world just throws me off the edge
It wasn't true
But if you don't have a home you can buy one there
She sings and sounds off the hammer of God
Well, I see trees of green and red roses too
So I could see my life
Oh yeah it's no reason to go crazy
You broke the law, it was your first offence
I drove home in the California dusk
One of these days
Don't take a genius to understand the reason why
Tossed aside the mirrored life
You and your sister finally severed the line
No he can cut it with the best
But I'm so fake happy
Boom boom boom an a bang bang bang
Throwing out your frown and just smiling at the sound
Blood and fire
 Riverside, it's time to say goodbye
Yo a lot of y'all sitting with y'all girls
Sunset at the shoreline, we are laughing, breaking up,
Oh, let's get rich and buy our parents homes in the South of France 
Plant a seed, plant a flower, plant a rose
I see them and I understand
Saturday, wait
Payback the piggy
Winding through, a plot controller from another age 
You wanted her and you got her
Throw your hands in the air 'cause we'll shake it tonight
Each happy ending's a brand new beginning 
Wild as a flower, true love carries on anywhere
See the French kids by the door
Separated from the rest
Lost in a silent ballet silent ballet
She says, "Dad, the prom is just one week away
And we are homeless, homeless
It wont be no man of me
You had to send a wrecking crew after me
Hip like a drum I'll make you go
People need to get the axing
Your lips, they pout and twist
I'll give you my sweet grass
'Cause last night I had something so good
Longing for the old fecundity of my homeland
Put your arms around me, tell me everything's OK
With our hands and feet, making peace
Any sunny morning
Whenever I want you around, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
You hope that if you're lucky this is where you'll settle down
Jinga jangler, tinga lingle, picture on a bricky wall
I been clubbed and I been snubbed
Where I'm going you cannot come
And say "hello" to jersey
And if it kills me I am going to smile, cause
No I got nothing at all
Lining up around the block
M'm'maybe you've been caught out once before
I'm gonna make it mine
So come away with me
I wanna make you feel alive
Too scared to own up to one little lie
Take off your overcoat, you're staying for the weekend
Our lips were cold as clay
About yourself or your family
I never felt so much life
Somebody shows me how
You'll open up the cage
He's gonna have a ball, give it all that he can
Let true genius in the padded room remain
So I've been walking home alone,
We got to love
Let's go home and throw away the key
Follow the wind that pushes me west
And I wonder If I were to walk by you once more
Once there were parking lots
Despite all the wrong, dragging you back
Ready for the rail to break now
Come home
Play the lead, play the lead
I'll choose unloved instead
From the other direction, she was calling my eye
Life is like a rollercoaster
And all the pretty people party while the petty people shout
I hadn't planned to stay
Nothing at all in the world to do with you
Having the time of my life
Who'd like to know I'd like to know
Like dreamers do
I finally fell in love, I've been waiting forever
I took a look at myself
God knows I've never been a spiritual man
An incredible eight foot heap
Turned on let's go
It'll be sad my friend
Is he teasing you with underage
I believe in the sand beneath my toes
Just as long as you were with me, let the cold winds blow
And surprise 'em with a victory cry
Baby, there's a shark in the water
Walking down by the bay on the shore
Tore it up and walked away
If the folks come home
Well, then the rhythm is complete,
If I knew hate, I'd call it love for you, man
We waste away the days with nicotine and television samples
To feel better, to get a man
So much they can't see the top of the stack
Bitter words under my breath
The world lives for the weekends
And you made this come true,
And it just feels good when you're next to me
You get me freaked freaked freaked on Preakness
With your grapes and bottled rain
City please don't let me down You are what you mean
Make sense of the scene
Love on the filthy streets is so divine
Sukie was a kid, and she liked to hang out in the graveyard
I miss you and it don't feel right
When you always would win
So they hang like ghosts of the people I've been
I want to stop, but I don't dare
Don't brag about it, come show me
Oh, somewhere over the rainbow way up high
Everybody just hold hands
Nothing at all
When I say 
Hang it up, daddy
Over me, yeah Over me
And you shout out loud
'Cause I spy something red
Underneath our feathered skin
I've got the goodies baked
I'm out of control
Lets go fishing for a dream
Do it good, alright
Far out of my view
This is it, call it quits with honesty
And these tiresome paper dreams
You were like a power of nature
Because there's nothing for the kids to do today
Sleepless long nights
Between the person that I was and have become
Is there anything left that you haven't done
I left my washing in the launderette
It feels like ten thousand nights of thunder
My record would be number one
Of an emotional landslide,
Sometimes that's just how it is
But don't sleep, 'cause now it's time to go
The scene ends badly, as you might imagine
Make this dream the best I've ever known
Yeah yeah
You gotta know what you want to be
And then these seven little men get up to dance
I'm going to get you
All you need is love Hey
Us to be together
That I shoot across the sky
You put your life on hold as we interest one another
Don't wanna hear you say mayheyheybe Do ya love me 'cause I wanna know
Like I'm a stranger on this road
The wind that sweeps the sky clean and lets the sun shine again
Hoop, Leggy Blonde, you got it goin' on
If you're willing just to take a chance
And all of a sudden BOOM American family
And his mother isn't growing old gracefully
Key Largo, Montego, baby why don't we go
Grinding your teeth in the middle of the night
What you touch you believe
We gonna party like like it's 
Listen to reason, season is calling
She saw the future, she heard voices from inside
What's a matter, what's a matter, what's a matter you
Que amanh~a                     		That tomorrow
Said I had to go down to where the cliffs meet the sea
Write me a storm, just tape the letter to the door
With some old grandmother
So here I am, we're good to go
Cleveland city grinding man stay afloat the kids hope
Gonna be a bright, bright, bright sunshining day
On a subway train before the dawn
Things are what they will be
One day, we're gonna get out
Can you see through the wonder of amazement
Everybody gonna to say you, K
Guess what happened to my coat of arms
I will shout the same to the world
And dry up every tear
Of the scene, as she turns
Baby look what you've done to me
The finer things keep shining through
No matter what you say
How are you doing
Something tells me I'm into something
I was looking for a decent boy
I feel my heart underneath my skin
For my emotional stunts
I hope you feel just like I feel
And it's berries in my heart bread
Till Your ready to fall
Destroys your hope and dignity
Do you wanna play with me
But I still wanna know
Then we should be ok, and we won't get in a muddle
And it bangs about the newmade leaves
To the sound of a ticking bomb
Open your eyes look around you
Oh, you make me happy in my everyday life
I am a satellite, I'm out of control
But my Stockholm syndrome
That I was far away
Then we follow the sky with the eye
Oh if only I knew the key
I keep you with me in my heart
With my chick by my side the radio does the trick
There are stormclouds brewing at the back of his mind
Oh, baby, you know I'm down down I'm really down
In five years time, I might not know you
Baptize your tears and dry your eyes
Uptown funk you up ah
Corre o que correr, custe o que custar
Grow paradise gardens
Cunts watch their bodies
And it always hurts the worst when it's the ones we love the most
All the people in this world
In my soul and in my skin
Got no regard for the thing that you don't understand,
The old republic was dead and gone
Can I get a little Goose in my OJ
Who can take the rainbow
California, Florida, Detroit, they all gon' ride wit' a G
And outrage and mesmerize
Baby, you're a rich man, too
We shall walk again
Under these white Northern skies
I'm Looking For Baggage That Goes
And I am breathless over you
Aloha my happy west coast friend
Three times that I told you
And I shouldn't sleep all day
This boy has broke down
But you still put me to sleep
Somebody followed me even though I packed and moved my home
Zima Saturday sunsets, watching the world
It's a dangerous scene
To your mother
I wanna feel this way today
So put your foot in the door because it's free admission
I walked her home and she held my hand
Will you still be sending me a Valentine
Yes please don't ever note me as your friend
You're bringin' up times I can't recall
Yitho omanqoba  ih hih ih hih ih yitho omanqoba
You know my name
Seeing our dragon when we look
It's fresh, so heavy, hear it breaking down
A backseat sofa in the dark
And all the music seeping through
'Cause here they come
'Cause she has so much fun has so much joy
Cool out, thinkin' we local, c'mon homey we major
Just let it go, and I will throw you a lifeline
Honey I think you're just right
I don't need no tv, I don't need no news
Pretend everything can be alright
I know I was up all night
I'm the wolf today, hey, hey, hey
I said, uptown funk you up
Past the Thames River, glistening like gold
Big boy, come on around
Keeping my head down
I used to love the taste, I would do anything for it
Sensitive heart, you're doomed from the start
I would wait forever, exalted in the scene 
When my baby
Aand my parents
Lord how can a heart
When she doesn't speak to anyone till four o' clock
I just want to know something today
Like you wanna say "hi"
And she's got the curse of curves
Well maybe I did
Tonight I will sleep in my car,
I'm feeling upsidedown down I'm really down
And I know that it's so cliche to tell you that everyday
Yeah I could show you a place
Hit the ground running, it's all over and been done
Till the light was absorbed by the night
Shorter nights and longer days
I know this night is like no other
Hey, now, you're a rock star
Livin' with louie dogs the only way to stay sane
They may not make sense but they sure as hell made me
Around, around, around, around, around, around, around
So toot what took man choke on it
We're ready to move
Stayed awake, stayed awake 
Made a promise to never say goodbye
But I noticed that I didn't really feel
Icy Cola Coca, Sprite I love the mosta
Misunderstood
I said goodbye to someone that I love
Such a wonderful plaything
Pretending that no one is there
I can't live without you, without you
Sparking up a rhythm
Everybody, everybody just wanna fall in love
I say no
An infinity of dancing white light
You hold a candle in your heart,
And I was denied the future I'd been searching for
Was it you who spoke the words that things would happen but not to me
Come on with the rain
For the perfect time to come
For Jade is the girl of the hour
You can hide around the corner
Oh we can be heroes just for one day
And oh oh, the ancient commonsense of things
My hands are in the air, yes I'm in love
With the moon on my nose 
Out on the floor
You know it's gonna haunt me
You're all out of tune
Don't point that thing at me
After the floods have washed away
This guy is 'gorge' and I got hit
We'll till the land and duck our debts
Get off, get up, you son of pop
Surround me
'Cause I can't stay in the middle of it all
Hot day, midJune
My excuse is, my pops just died, and I ain't wanna make music
What scarecrows think would turn your pale cheek pink
You wrote your number on my hand
And if we've only got this life
Do you feel the same
When the angels hung around
I'd get to see you again
Listening to 's songs
Well it's about the patience and getting revenge
It's such a burden to carry 'round the vestiges of dead dreams,
The candles light dances across the table
Bursts are colour till I'm sick
When that light's gonna shine
Bad boys then, bad boys now
Lisa met Chelsea at the knocking school
Since we had reason left to smile
In the middle
The way that it is, oh
So come on minger
Mr Pleasant is kind 
I'm gonna fix tomorrow when 
Baby you're like lightning in a bottle
You try and make like this is so much fun
A tragic event I must admit but let's not be overblown
In the hills and highlands
If it wasn't for the good souls
When times are tough in your new age
When I've spend one with you
Then I pull myself together
Some chimps that wish they could be mine
Well every hour I try to get somethin' done
And you don't know who I am
The countless ways you thought to die no hesitation
She got out first  away from me
This isn't happening, stop this now
And you're with me around the clock, all around the clock
'Cause she's the girl all the bad guys want
Let them bums stay mad 'cause we living it up
So give me your hand and let's jump out the window
Build home
Oh my god, the way you look tonight
Rock is dead they say
Pushed back her fringe, see her birthmark
But I was asleep
Leave me dancing with myself
Waiting for a love like this
To the space man movies I'd call my life
He crazy, I know what you're thinkin'
They culled you from a cartoon
Maybe be your baby tonight
Mister Blue Sky, please tell us why
Mott's in the corner of the room 
By three we are thinking of the love we lost
Others sang your life
You've already robbed me blind
I'm yours and you're mine
And what's new, pussycat, is that you were once a lioness; 
That you're coming along with me
Wire up the radio
Oh don't you know we're not like this
And he says, "Lets get lost, let them send out alarms"
Too many regulations coming back at you
The simple life honey is good
Be me, be mine
You're my love
She feels peaceful there
Go grab a cup I dunno what people waitin' on
I hear that she likes to dance around the room
She's enough to make me warm
What's the matter with you
Every Sunday morning
This was a discount store
An old man's eyes
I know your eyes are just for me but
Our inclinations are hidden in looks
I trace the faith to a broken down television
Awoo arf
I've been everywhere and back tryin' to replace
Pitch by my doorstep
I think I see you coming to town,
I know we had our problems, I can't remember one
And it's your heart, it's alive
Do you wanna dance
Fly away
I swear that I'm not kidding
You're driving me crazy, When are you coming home
Try to find a better life
Keep it in the background
I'm outside the house and not thinking right today
We need to fetch back the time
That's got me waiting for your dynamite
Oh but I'm not one for handouts, no they got to pay their dues
I wear your golden heart in mine
Such were the grounds, such were the grounds for divorce I know
Oh, so hold on to the ones who really care
I say "I've never heard the tune"
Uhuh, I got stung
Will you wake if I open the door
Walking 'round London town
"You are too young to put all of your hopes in just one envelope"
Then I'll kiss you between the ears
Ah, and the postcard's gonna read
I'll still go on loving you 
I'm no fucking Buddhist but this is enlightenment
I keep calling you up, calling you up
Well, baby, I'm down down I'm really down
So I'm back again it's ok
Summer wind, desert stars
Every heartbeat needs a reason"
You're never gonna bring me down, don't come around
We will not let time erase us
Hey can we go by walking
Completely out of reach
We took the evening ferry over to the peninsula
My arms will keep me warm on cold and lonely nights
'Cause the world keeps dancing with the paperman
Ooh oh oh yeah
They said "Don't take your business to the big town"
Rolling fog into my room 
Where were you when I needed you most
I'm not looking for a way to replace what love can give
But I will die for my own sins, thanks a lot
Here comes my baby, here she comes now
I've been this way for quite some time
I knock you off ya feet, put holes in ya 'til ya clothes leak
Come on lay down these arms, all our best defenses
One of us is gonna be running
Stop, wait a minute
And that would be all right, all right
Ding dong ding dong ding dong ding donana phone
Now I'm not a highly metaphysical man
Sometimes fade to grey
You're eating brains out the back of my head
So Stand Up For the lololololololololololove Oh Oh
With whom you're spending your today
Changing looks slightly like back in the 's, 
A handful of pills
Three more weeks, and we could say
It's coming around again
What's that thing on your chest
Please come with me
And the whole wide world is on your side, hey hey
Every day we're getting closer
For a safety dance, ohoho
That was the moment that you lost your charm
I feel sad
Where you wring your hands
Though you're probably feelin' blue
I do this every day, hocus pocus is my steelo
Praying that the holy water don't go dry get it, get it
Yowayohwayohwayoh
Your voice rings like a bell anyway
I don't get lonely So
With a girl I really don't like
Honey pie, honey pie
In love with a girl who lives
If you get deep, you'll touch my mind
My skin is covered with sharp spikes 
When all the sentimental memories you own 
Never say it's the last one
Is it true, do I care
Oh, I'll be there, yeah,
I know I'll never be lonely
The golden state wins again
To new days of doubt without you
These are days you'll remember
However much she loves me I will always love her more
Come on, come on, because everybody's after love
Blessed is this life and I'm gonna celebrate being alive
What is on your mind
Deep beneath the blue waves
'Cause they don't let you talk
And mountains and the sky 
Trading swigs from a bottle, all bitter and clean
And the boys do the boogiewoogie on the corner of the street
You could be waiting for a day that won't come
In your fire below
Thinking 'bout true romance
The blue lighting
I'll call the white house, have a chat
Leave a little room for some naiveté
In my imagination
The minute before we play
I got your nights I got your nights
But they are all imaginary
And why should I be sane without you
I want to change my orbit
Of the Velvet Underground
In and out somewhere else right now
Can't get enough of you, baby
Oh, let it all hang out
Goodnight darlin', you're so fine
Yeah, can't forget about me, stupid
Yeah, I need you to come and keep me amused 
In New Jersey, they got a god damned Swedish parade
Does a mullet make a man
Want you to be happy
I see Mindfreak like, "What's up man, what's happenin'"
I was broken but free
There's much in the world I don't understand
Each other's eyes 
I'm enchanted I've fallen under your spell
And from what I've heard with skin you'll win
To do more things like that 
Uh huh won't fight your war until I'm finished with mine
You got me to hitch my knees up
Friends
Man I gotta lease nothin' I own one
Running from running
We took the floor, and she said
I think I've got a reason to enjoy the sun
Hello, goodbye
"Do you feel alone in that way"
And way out there, it is the same old place that it always has been
Wait for me, wait for me
Tickticktick now they know where you are
I'll huff, I'll puff, I'll huff, I'll puff and blow you away
Who turned into a killer
Cause you know I never will
It would have worked out so well
Convinced that it's mine with her
Smiles light up as we walk in
All the bees and birds are flying ah ah ah
And two to three minutes doesn't seem that long
I just want to float through the sea
As everyone else seems to think we are Don't it feel like, like sunshine
You've gotta let her go because you're breaking up the girl
Things will be alright
'Cause tonight's the night it goes
Bins up front 
Comes a time when a man loses his mind
So hum hallelujah, just off the key of reason
We're doing it right
And they wouldn't let me sign on
If you got the money,
Rroom boom boom boom boom boom
Move your arm in your watch To another time on the block
The ships, and treasures make reef
It's because happiness writes white
Headed for the open door
There are so many special people in the world
Creep past the hours like the shorter hand on the clock
Got to get you into my life
You make me happy, you make me happy
Und falls du mal kein Rücklicht hast
Of a dead and hanging man
Cherry apples, long grass meadows
It means you walk backwards
Do you remember when I shook your hand
Just picking up where I left off
She can't always be wrong, he can't always be right
She has abandoned me on highways and desert plains
A mistful meet with teachers speaking there muffled by buzzes and hums
And I love
And when the summer's here, the waves are crashing
With your mother
With photographs we never took
To find our way home
I hear the music all the time
You can touch, you can play,
From now on let the risk lead me to
Eager, hopeful, content to play the friend
Yes, I know everything
I don't pay attention to the ones who never cared
Dissolve in lemonade
I call my dad; I call my dad
And I don't know how you're taking all the shit you see
Around the clock  Yes you are around the clock
From a seat on a whirling waltzer
Total strangers feel my eyes,
I was always late
As we entered in to our surprise
'Cause I got some intuition
You looked a lot older
And you could be so much more than, than you've been
Just walk on down this road with me
You're so restless, what can be over there
In so far to know the measure of love ain't lost
Hey heart on the run again
'Cause every little thing gonna be all right 
Scotty liked all of the books that I recommended
Is another dream to ashes 
This has become a weakness
They'll still remind me of when we were in school
Lay down your arms
In life, it ain't easy
I said, "Son you've got a full blown case of what is known as jellybones"
You're a disgrace to your country
Should I address all my letters to the well to be
Will you break and take all the words from my mouth
It's been this way for so long
Of the love and laughter yo
When I really wanna stay
Another long quiet, lonely night spent at your side
And we played in the sun as the curtain was tumbling
And waste the time with you
She didn't enrol, but she wiped the floor with all the arseholes
You are a book for me to read
Work, work, work, Senora, work your body line
We're all in this together
Adds an awful twisting touch
To get the first bread of the morning
I'd like to know
Always cried into her pillow
So you know the rhyme, so you know the rhyme
Which was slightly unnerving
With fifty men
Just open your window and follow your memory upstream
Stealing our thoughts with the force of their non sequiturs
Oh Stacey, look what you've done 
Will we pay for who we've been
And run, run, run, run, run, run 
So what do you need, what do you need, what do you need
Should I better not take it so personally if all the good loving is never received
But I can dance, dance, dance
Oh, they're gonna put me away this time
And bombs going off in my head
Everybody's got a secret to hide
There's so much I need to say
Oh I got so much I'd like to give
Shake it like a Polaroid picture Hey ya
Keep on rolling, never boring 
At the dance club
That's right
But this place is getting crowded and my house is two blocks away
C'mon we can rock this party
And I, I am not into the idea of being without you
Four of these fingers set to see
I need some help, help me out boys
The only light that shines there
It's silly wrong, but vivid right
For life is quite absurd
And kiss it all goodbye
I just can't believe the wonder of this feeling, too
I must be sure these are the signs
Everybody's hurting
It's a whole lot brighter
It's just love, ahy
S'Come fly with me, let's fly let's fly away
I've played that song from long ago
Till the break of the dawn, yeah, party on my lawn
She hid inside the attic of the sculpture building
Now all I need is just to hear a song I know
Makes me wanna shake and shout
It's cold in the keep
I will be alright, I will be alright 
Now you're really givin' everything
Like a hundred souls
The lights spell out a code
Tempted just to make an ugly scene
Butterfly, baby I still have my doubts about you cause
But while they search for a mate
I tip top topple over for my fun loving nun
I'm looking up,
Dragging names through the mud, instead of biting his tongue
And try to win a little love
Born and raised on the wrong side of town
Intimacy has the greater charm
I said from the start, that you could take it or leave it
To your surprise
I make these snake mistakes but I know
I want something else, not listening when you say
The doctor walked her crew of surgeons to the table where I lay
Don't throw your youth away and don't let me hear you say
No don't say then 
I was a lonely soul, but that's the old me
Husbands in winter, they know the truth
When I'm lost inside a dream
The characters become my friends
But I've been sleepwalking down to the lake
All in a line we go, we will
It looks like we got what we wished
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart
But yesterday when I saw your eyes in a black haze
I don't believe that anything will ever be enough
Double dare kids up pollute their lungs
I see you're dressed to kill
If you love it 
So don't you worry 'bout a thing
I'll be by your side
Is the new American way
Whatever you do, do it good
Merry Christmas, girl
Ccc'cause, baby, it will all soon come to an end
But you're waiting at the door
Well, creeping's just my way
He had a sister named Erin, for sure was fine
On the old left bank, my baby in a charàbanc
Come out to the west backsides of my eyes 
But how much, baby, do we really need
How can a scalpel tear into skin
First thing they teach us, not to give a fuck How I got o
I can't stop can't stop can't stop the beat
No, that's not fair
Oh Stacey look what you've done,
Let you go, baby
Cheers to the miles it took to get here
When I get some money imma buy me some time
She'll understand what kind of guy I've been I've been
You didn't think that they were too great
Become bitter from our loneliness
Now I'm on a comeback trail to make a statement
And they would sing along with me
Well the people will gauk
Higher, higher, high on love
Your hands on my cheeks, your shoulder in my mouth
Well, everybody wants to go forever
I didn't even see it, then another one
Another monkey in the mail could make me lose my mind
Dirty talk talk talk louder
Como en el muro la enredadera
I got something I think I really wanna show ya
They say she's left a letter up the stairs for everyone
But if you look twice
I tongue the roof of my mouth
Until we're there crank the radio
And baby, baby, you're irresistible and I'm insatiable Ooohooohooohooohooo
But life is good and "It's always worth living at least
That people could smile more
I just wanna move, I don't care what the song's about
I need someone to hold me
I've got a thousand opinions, and half the time, I'm trying to explain
I'm not pretending
Maybe I, had too little love to realise
I can't feel anything at all
He's got no safety numbers, his ASBO won't allow him to be hanging around in gangs
The way you love me, eh eh
I said, baby, I just want you back, and I want you to stay
But hug my flower with your eyes"
So what it I break down
This is what I'd say
Here I am in the graveyard waiting for a war
We all want to grow with the seeds we will sow
And I would walk five hundred miles
Oh, but there's no need to play with my heart
When I was down, when I was hurt
All right Just give me a call
He got a needle for a head
I know I'm searching for something
With tears like flashbulbs
And round and round, around, around, around, around
City roof top, summer night
Cherrycherry boomboom
We come back to heal ya, janglin soul
Baby your electric love
But I'm finding now love's unreliable
What a wonderful phrase
Came down upon her head dodo dodoodoo
Flying kites way up high into the blue sky
Say your piece and get out
She got the power to be
Can't drive off so what should I do instead
Can you tell me Oh yeah
I been oaked and I been doped
This ain't fair uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh
Everything that's made is made to decay 
When I get you home
And a full beard with no warning
Woke up with rain on my head
So let's sing while we still can
Why did you leave me here alone
She said, "Let's put a plastic bag over our heads
I say we're out to blow the trumpet
Holding on to his words but baby
Sunshine she's here, you can take a break
Floating in the magic world, donate all your money
Squeeze me baby all through the night
Eftermiddagen går
We'll turn out all of the lights and set this ballroom aglow
Amen
Me a little more skin it would fulfill my fantasy
In the slats of light which creep across the room
But you, I'm just an illusion you don't seem to care I wish that I could
Somebody's birthday
Woo, all my loving
Though nothing, nothing will keep us together
Oh, great white city
Doesn't matter if I take my time
Just for a second the combination of sights, sounds around him
It's a lesson to me
Though the days are counting backwards ohohoh, ohohoh
I shake loose of your laces
If I lived in China I'd have some Chinese children
Come on, come out of the rain
When your song is sung
And tonight I have to
Ever high, never fall
You've got to feel the rush, feel the spice of life
And I'll walk you outside
I was very lonely till I met you on Sunday
I say just use me
I hear it call in the center of it all
And all the things I hate, I wish I didn't have to hate
And give us nothing more
You represent saying "I'm real"
Cause everything must belong somewhere
I don't have diddly squat
I said baby, you're amazing
We're only just as happy We're happy
We are the stars of your sexy dream
Try and say the things you want,
Examined the dirty ground
Steal some covers, share some skin 
Came in the door said it before
Yeah, I feel just like a child 
Shaky legs holding up my feet
I gotta feel like it don't make sense
When this party ends, when this party ends
Maybe you should travel with me, is this the best idea
She makes the Indy  look like the Roman chariot race now
So tell them all I'm on my way
But with a little wink I'll be there Little wink I'll be there
Ringing in my head so clearly
My best friend's house tonight
I'm staying at home tonight 'cause I don't want to know
It's you against the world
You're starting to discover it's a great big lie
Take another better look around
Can you feel my love, my love, my love, my love, my love my love
Trying to feel the high
Oh, it's a picture of perfection
Every word is a curse let loose on me
Of everyone's contentment and you
I think of life without pain
People might react to all the things that your characters say
Do you remember
Oh, will there be dancing in the hall tonight
It was pretty bright, up on the rainbow bridge tonight
I know that there might come a day my life is through
'Cause I don't know how to love
Messed around with gender roles
Just remember, tomorrow never knows 
You stole my heart when Eddie Vedder was king
And hold her tight
Happy with your role
I used to sit next to you at school
Living with no reason, dwarfed, alone, imprisoned
It makes you laugh 
Can really break it down Together
I know I'm always asking for something
The speed slow me down but I'm still smartest in my class, boy
Some kind of innocence is measured out in years
And this time I know it's real
So I will dance with Cinderella
It still brings a smile to my face
It's just a matter of time before we learn how to fly
Ancient walls of flowers tumblin' down,
There must be some word todayayay
Point the finger, place the blame
Just leap don't look 
Say the sweet little things that Make me cry
How I got over, where the people come apart 
Contact was questioned from the boulevard
Upon a roof below the moon
Today is where your book begins
and land, deflated, in some neighbor state that's strewn 
I just don't wanna see good love
We gotta hurry in our worry to get done today
But it's too late to turn your age around she's no the one you want
Best place in Paris to be
Flies in the air, comb your hair
And when our city, vast and shitty, falls to the Axis, yeah
Just get it out
Ain't going nowhere, like froze baby
While they wax and wax of their lives in the country
Or are you just a decoy dream in my head
And we will all go down together
And I need you to hide it when it shows 
Here I go thinkin' 'bout all the things I could have done
It's such a lovely cup
Over a chairback
So you either start screaming or start singing
The remedy is the experience, this is a dangerous liaison 
That the grass is not always greener
Maybe it's not right
About  years from now
And I've been hoping and closed
And people are people, regardless of creed
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelu
Imagination, life is your creation
Of the churches still in style
All the way home
Doubling back now
He's keeping us warm
And you know I might have just flown
Trial, tribulation, but I know God
And everything will happen and you wonder
Color me with images of faith
And when I'm dreaming, well, I know I'm gonna dream
There's gonna come a time when the true scene leaders
Do a turn or return the twentyfive
The color, the color, the color of your skin don't matter to me
And I see the sun up 
And I need you to recognize my friends 
But this is love so we'll survive
You tuck me in just like a child now
Mama don't take my Kodachrome away
London bridge is safe and sound
Next spring will bring you back again
Dancing in the night in the middle of June
Look up the number you know me name
It's your heart, it's alive
G Rap tried to get us to sign to Cold Chill
Give in my friend
I'm sick of waiting
I heard a knock at the door
Do I end up, do I end up happy
I wish that I knew what I know now
But the sun has gone away
Yeah yeah yeah, la la la, la la la la My girl
Buhhuhbuh waoohuh bo bo
A Nolita fairytale
She said unpredictability's my responsibility baby
Just clap your hands But it don't seem like me
Hey beautiful day, hey beautiful day
Carolina, happy belated
Alive, Alive, Alive with glory alive with glory
And when you need to change the light bulb
I'll let you get naked too
Something's not right with these smiles and tantrums
The Mississippi amends
To feel something constant under my feet,
It's when you hit the ground
We got the man then stab him in his back
Said, "Where you going man, you know the world is headed for hell"
And girl you know
Why don't you keep it in the corners
But with my careless words I tread upon your vision
Let's pretend we don't exist, let's pretend we're in Antarctica
Tonight, the city is yours and mine
Love was out to get me, that's the way it seems
Wreck all the things that I know
Con tu felicidad me encontraré
I guess when it comes down to it
David won't you stop writing songs 
Get up now, get up, get up now
There's one thing you should know
Let's play makebelieve
Are you invited to the party of life
You just gotta call on me, yeah
I've been so damned tired
I don't want to stop at all
Tu attends que je viennes
That's faith, there's happiness in death
Well, I'd like to be with you
And it feels like
The bullets may singe your skin
Of love's uneven remainders
Of a speedway operator
Right on the foyer, on this dark day, right in plain view Oh yeah
If I can't even dream up a dream that's worth the keep
Look, metal flowerpetal tears do not even appear in the myopic mirror
I'm just a girl that's only chewing for fun
Or am I just a roadblock in your way
It would not be new
And the stars in the sky, they never caught my eye
Over the moon under the sun
Welcome to the tea party
My heart is beatin' like a jungle drum
Let's have bizarre celebrations let's forget who, forget what, forget where
She hits the dancefloor, she LIGHTS up the dancefloor with glowsticks and
It grows in bunches, I've got my hunches,
And although this boat is steady now
Woo, you get that woo
Y lloras de emoción oyendo un bandoneón 
I'm a superstitious girl,
Love stands beside
Lying on your bed, I think you're pretty too
With the blue skies ahead
Oh baby, give it to me
Baby, you're sailing today
My brother punches my ear
And when she gets the sensation
Plainly the words love and your name
Fly, fly, baby don't cry
And sing that old song, how does it go 
That�s my life, nothing is sacred
Why not just cut up all your old clothes and make a quilt
Here is heaven and earth and the brilliant sky inbetween
Is in your room
And if I go out tonight, dress up my fears
Celebrate the few, celebrate the new
You can raise everything to the ground
One is for the money
And with each new day
You no get my life 'cause I don't have a side, and I
Sunday morning rain is falling 
Music is my back rub
But you don't get me
Kyrie Eleison
There is a game I like to play
I gotta feelin' that you can relate
With the guy, with the guy too shy 
You're happy, you're happy, you're happy, you're happy
It's, er, gettin' larger
Even more than I did
Aye yippey aye ooh wah
Somethin' in your eyes went and drove me crazy
Whatever comes our way
Cause now I wear Louis Vuitton and dress cherry  from pink
What's our deal I don't know
In our blood and in our souls
My world's on fire, how 'bout yours
The jumping dust made catfish bust from corners now dripping with mud
'Cause I couldn't really stand it I'd admit that I was wrong
When I come back to bed
Somebody sing hello, hello, hello
I live here without you
Over and over Kickstart my rock 'n' roll heart
Monday, you can hold your head
A cottage in the country built with real wood beams
Bathing in the sight of the others
And then the sun came crashing in 
You look beautiful all of the time
From living hell
One dance left; This world is gonna pull through
Do you remember when Do you remember when
I've never loved you
And say
We'll see our name in city lights
The sun will come out wait and see
That might be decked out like a christmas tree
And at the end of all your knees fall down to me
She's a little pilot in my mind
Webbe As my feet become unstuck
Baby baby, baby baby, baby baby
I been charred and I been scarred
Fabrications complicate the world in a web
Blue as the sky, sunburnt and lonely,
If I stay in one place I lose my mind
You know it's worth the nights we wait there
Yeah we sailed through all the sleazy scenes
I gave you a foot massage
Don't give up, oh no, all right
I wanted to wear what he wore in summer
I'm wakin' up at the start of the end of the world
Goodbye today
And I'm always gonna wanna blow your mind
Let down your hair
"What didn't you tell me"
Somewhere there is a happy affair, a ghost of a good mood
But I don't want to write a love song for the world
And erosion can't stop their being
History
Transforms a grumpy look into a smiling face
Brought me back to thinking you were mine, all those times
Et le cachalot a dit
Got my mouth,
Every single molecule is right, when
Won't you come and make up my mind
It's somehow all I need
To see a girl that's prettier than a diamond shining in the sun
Your trigger finger's cocked, and I'm feeling weak
If I could hold ya,
To say that you deserve this 
There's a monkey in the jungle
I've been standing here waitin', Mr Postman
You will search, babe, at any cost
Hey, I live for that look
See I deceive you with my intergalactic ether
To get to know the world
Water shines like tiny bells
Can you knit the stiletto back into the bloodstain
Will shine for us as love sweeps over the room 'cause we tend to
And I wonder if you already know
Oh, Spanish bands use all the echo
Oh I dream of yesterday
But into every life a little rain must fall
I could write a song with my new piano;
Let us stop
It's easy to get right next to you
Them pregnant fiends, killin' they child
Now every time I go for the mailbox, gotta hold myself down
Keep my ocean calm
What I care to see
Spend all our lives just having lives
But I don't know her address
Even more than I did before
Oh, take me to your best friend's house
You can turn off the sun, but I'm still going to shine 
Somethin' without warnin' love
Clouds of birds are covering her sky
Everything you are to me
Without the low, you know
When I was a young boy I got a stereo and I taped all the songs straight off the radio
So in the day when you wake
Made sure that he was dead 
I know we've lost the final battle
She's always running from something
Oh baby won't you cum again
And I was hunted by the wolves and I was heckled by the crows
The sky was blue beyond compare
And smell the ocean in your hair Ocean in your hair, ocean in your hair
You know, the look right before you cry it's always here
You're always wearing Dodger blue
They come back around 
Oh I'm searching
Around at his house,
Walk a little line
And go all the way back home
Twist and turn on a lonely road
Till the angels hung around
Feel my head explode from a night of gin,
Anything you want me to
Man I know you wanna let yourself go
Everybody knows that he is gonna steal the show
To make it hurt twice when your restless body caves to its whims
Undid our footprints, even furled our flag, and
Get off your lazy arse, Alfie please use your brain
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
So I watch you making plans and I make plans
I've got nostalgic pavements, I've got familiar faces,
Chose to push it aside
And I still dream of you
Give me a moment Give me one shot
My keys around my neck were jingling
Doing crystal meth will lift you up until you break
Just go and listen, and it'll start with a smile
It didn't lead nowhere
And down along the avenue some guys are shootin' pool
Then you're in my face telling me to grow up
The ooh's and ah's and falala's are back in love
It's that I can't dance a single step
Nightly, beside the green, green grass
Oh, it could start again
Get it, get it 
Yo tengo pila y loco haciendo cola
Knowing there ain't no sucker in the world
When I'm running out of loving
Everybody needs a bosom for a pillow
And if they come for us,
And I don't understand why I sleep all day
The frozen city starts to glow, and
To give you something to go on
Just now, the part about my love for you
We rattle this town, we rattle this scene
I don't drive in the lane of whipped cream
Lend me some sugar, I am your neighbor
Promoter's in the pay box wondering where the band's gone
Anything that you might do
Come on let's go get it on, everybody let's go have some fun
And they think about the night so sweet
Winter is springtime
It just existed in your head, the reflection used wasn't you
Lately I've been so happy
I ain't gotta wait for no one
Does love buzz because that's what it does
Just a minute close your eyes
Don't need quarters, don't need dimes,
It took a car crash to turn it around
I'm scared of what you'll do 
Let me show you, girl
The knots in the laces, heart it races
They got the drugs I could use but then I don't want any
Back down, you could get back down, 'storian
It's time we take control get down
That's right, look up the number
I see water, I see land
Well you know I'm a woman
Away we go And away we go
I'd still know where I'd want to be
Just assumed that you lost me like a left turn
But I want the whole world to celebrate
And if you think you see with just your eyes you're mad
In your big house on the hill
Almost loved you
I'm a windup toy in an up down world
Oh good, good life
Brand new sheets, let's break them in
The mama pajama rolled out of bed
Say hello to feelings that I detest
'Cause we are changing
Mohammed Rafi forty five
This time, we should be starting again
But some people really suck
Waiting for someone to tell you everything At the end of the line
You'll be happy
'Cause when the sun always shines down on your shoes
And the black and blue body from the weekend fights
Oh, it's a big boat and it pumps up the poor boys pride
Every one is addressed to me
Cover your eyes in the pouring rain
It must be getting early
We're all perfectly clear on what we're ignoring
We Spat, Orbit, spoke of lost hopes
And a chair and a lamp
Something showing
Dance, dance, dance, Senora
I draw the curtains in the glare of the same old sun
I like it when I bump you, an accident's a truth gate, I'm humbled in your pretty lens
Your Uncle Walter saw who fired the shots
Or just some mother's wasted son
You got that beep, that beep, that bopbopbop
This doesn't have to end in tragedy
Like a queen in days of old
Through the curtains of the waterfall
Stop the car, lay on the grass
The weather here was nice
But you are always looking out for me because
A thing or two at night
A picture of fragility
That seep down from the bitter sky tonight
She never told me that you called
Because seriously, this high life scenery
That surround me
Well, it's all right, remember to live and let live
I think I'm on the edge of something new with you
Is with us every night
You better look it over
And now it's time that you should know
There's a whole floor before us,
Everywhere is balanced there like a rainbow above you
One shrunken head from Africa,
Give me that thing
I don't need a reason not to care what you say
How can you be ready for life
Tell me how you feel Feel
Nothing else but you and I you and I
Smile with the risin' sun
And this, this could be the summer when I grow up
The paper boy's at it again, but I can't get no sleep
Drop you to drink it,
Yes, I know but I must say in my own defense
And I'm taking off tonight, now I'm free
And even with the lights down real low
Pay back the piggy back,
I'm gonna make your life so sweet Yeah, yeah, yeah
Everything falls apart
Just to hear it fall is the sweetest sounding thing
But if I had someone I would do anything and never, never, never let you feel alone
For some people it's an easy choice
How time can move both fast and slow
You know my name, look up the number 
Trying to live without your love
Why did you leave me alone
So now it seem like we can't get no further
I've been shaking from making an awful decision
And let it wet your lips
If you hear him coming, won't you say for me
In the moonlight, on a joyride
Then  years, then  years
Hear the beat still rocking everyone around
I was there from the moment that you were born
Know if words could say
Alarms going off in my head
I got strung up from our loving 
To the jungle through the night in paradise, paradise
This boy has broken down, hey yeah yeah
There's just one thing you should know
I think about you every day
Stay out or stay in
Near the bed,
Hasn't hollowed and swallowed you and I from inside
Ah, la, la, la, life is meaningful
A thousand ways that make you statuesque
We stop and go, the promise is already run cold
No no no no I don't need it
A sweet little lie, I cry wolf, cry
And I will pay no mind
Similes, metaphors, and we pop pills
Throw on your clothes, the second side of Surfer Rosa
Falling down the river
So many people that I know, they're just tryna touch ya
More in the mornings
And it don't have to make no sense to you at all
I want to forget how conviction fits
Station wagon rides
You'll never feel settled in or become an equal  no
While they may depending on your heart and wealth
Now I'm getting calls just for product placement
We always have been caged
Oh I'd run as fast as I can
I know you were historical from all the books I've read
When I look up in the darkest night
I promise hidden words of tenderness in every single line that I write
It's always say goodnight and go
Tea and a toast to yesterday's capers
Today seems like a good day
Been getting to hard to imagine 
I'm alive  and the world shines for me today
Oh, yeah, I'm on sunshine, baby 
Gotta get to the top
Still I can't stop thinking about you
It's the good times keeping me alive
It comes down to me and you
Will you still need me, will you still feed me
You could kill a rabbit with a rib
Mad doggin' me and
I'm on my way, gonna make it big, gonna make the songs for the chicks to dig
Chelsea, Chelsea, I think it's 'bout time
A small story which always happens
And in every way, you know I just want you to stay
Nice day for a talk with your girl
'Cause it's alright
'Fore they make you feel a man
I'm out and about, so I'm in with a shout
I'm still taken by surprise
She killed it with kisses and from it she fled
To hide my hope from this scissor strain
I don't even need to see your face
Soaking up the thirst of the land
Work all day, little to no pay
Oh, this is the greatest peace I've ever known x
To what I want I land further away from where and when I was a little bit younger
We're gonna rattle this ghost town
You got me singing, like
Of the misuse of words used to diss dudes
Óró mo churaichín ó Flicking fire like saltwater into my eyes
Five years, she fears to hold my broken head
They big talk but they will never say what they mean
Merry, merry, merry Christmas baby
Yes I'm havin' a good time
And the way you love keeps me hanging on
Or upsidedown
I stand in awe of gratefulness
As long as we're together
And when I put my arms around him
I never will be good enough for her
They bring me down, so
Nothing against you but you dragged me for too long
Gave me a push and he started singing
Because it seems to me that I wake up and sleep
'Cause I hate what I've become
But I see how you get sucked in
The radio and the bones we found frozen
This is the last time that I'll hold your hand
Yeah, I get up 
I love you more than ever, girl, I do
Hoping it would stay there for just a little while
And I could never understand
Pride is mistaken for hate, it's upgraded
And this is my body 
From time to time I turn around
I'll never let you turn around
To try and learn when you teach me a lesson
All around the world statues crumble for me
And we're outta space and you're out of space
Well, it's all right, we're going to the end of the line
Beyond your darkness, I'm your light, oh
Always bold and wise and unsettling
Wear your shoes
I try to cross to the opposite side
Half asleep we wait till she arrives
I'm on top of the world
I gotta know,
The sun's got my pride
It's the dollar signs
Or was it that you lied
My money's got no hold on me
'Cause I'm one of a kind and kinda hard to find
You want my love
You're my love come till empty
I need my Bo Peep
Tell me, how does it feel in my arms
With the hella good hair
Warmed up weather, let's get together
I'll be buzzin' 'round your hive
Come go with me, we've got it made ooh Go, escapade
I say hey, I'll be gone today
And construct a summer home
If I get home before the rain you're mine, but I won't bet
So your boyfriend has no clue
Everything you are now 
And damn sure do a lot more than FEMA did
Wake up in a hotel room
Wish my dream would never go away
There's no stopping us
Could we live together and agree on the same wares
Then I fall
'Cause I can't do all of my dose and still feel ill
"Man it feels good to feel this way"
Running wild, but always in control
I can see it in your stars
And I don't understand
Would you go along with someone like me
You're still the one
I get under your skin and I sebaceously form
Here comes my face here comes my face
The dog days are done
I found the truth beneath your lies
Livin' life in these cold streets
Which stood on rocky shores and kept the beaches shipwreck free
They served steamed puddings, she went without
How kind of them to mellow mellow mellow my soul
I don't mind a little pain
It's getting very near the end
Come go with me, we've got it made
Yeah, Estelle, we about to get down get down
Beautiful songs of love
Yeah, I'm just a little bit caught in the middle
Sun is shinin' in the sky,
Why must I spend my time
Stomp, stomp the beat
You with the
Weight is coming off, soaring high, Pleading you to stay, come alive
Want to fall in love tonight
Whenever you came near the clouds would disappear,
Only place I know I feel safe, I'm gonna call this home
She's looking beautiful, totally beautiful
What else can I say
In their bereavement, all of her colorful friends turned to a milkygrey depressing blend, 
And all that I can say is that she's all I want and all that I live for
'Cause I ain't never had nobody like you
Riding on my moped, looking for fun
It feels so nice
As I continue to expand your head is gonna burst
Won't stop, won't stop the beat
All these places
Will it stay skyhigh
Why are you so far away from me
I've got the cure for you
If they ever find out you're not one of their kind
All the while
When I spoke I explained my feelings
I'm gonna run behind you in the shadow's place
She drinks coffee
Go baby, go go
In the sky are next to mountains anyway
Ghost in your house, ghost in your arms
I was never young, even as a child
When you send us in
'Cause I can feel it,
When your beating heart explodes
A protester's sandwich board in the park
What fills up this space in your life 
I've come so far to meet you here
We are surrounded
The word is on your lips  say the word
Just because he loves you too
Back when I was still
Step right in
So mama don't take my Kodachrome away
That you're the one I just don't need
Oh yeah, that's where the money is
No politics, no history
But in every way you know I just want you to say
Their kids so there's not a sound a sound
I know it gets hard sometimes
Hold it up, hold it tight,
What's in your blood is in my mind
So you better run
I kinda wanna be more than friends
And curses through your door
When I look into your eyes
Adelaide, Adelaide, you need to quit, quit making a scene
And I was on a lot of shit too, but what I saw, man, I tell you, was
Back those eyes
I'm not above being unloved
Big strong tower, yeah
I hope it doesn't take the rest of my life
I'm feeling better ever since you know me
Once again if I feel better
I made a big mistake, alright
I'm caught in the crossfire why can't we get along
Let the children act like furniture
Try my luck
And my way
The bridge and tunnel just seems to escape near our home
She makes me feel like I could be a tower
I've got a fever, baby, your love
I'm the sorest sight, now I feel like trash
Yeah baby come on
Me and my crew, we came to get down
You and me chasing paper
The more we know, the less we care, what's damaged on the way
"I got booked last night I need another fix, dig"
Við spilum endalaust saman
Started something
All the people come have gone
I can say that I have
In the way that I spell it out
And it's the moment you remember you're alive
Four bitches guardin' me safely as we walk to the window
Bird outside the kitchen fighting his reflection
So I'm burning the thoughts of the things that I once said
Poppin' a couple of bottles, drink it all and get another round
Just to keep her out of mind
Heartbreakers gonna break, break, break, break, break mmm
The soft drinks, expansion
Party like, like it's the end of the world
Don't let your white dress wear you out
You got a mouth
And she was, like a blade of ice
Ein Schluck vom Flakon
Make a little money, take a lot of shit
Would it be easier if it was all my fault
Once I get you up there,
I'm coming back but will you show
Anybody's title
Gon' be your whole family on that funeral line
Steal the feeling and focus on the flames, girl
There's nothing here to lose
You know I'm gonna bid
He's got me runnin' around the office like a dog around a track
A girl's not a tonic or a pill
Baby, you're a rich whoo man
'Cause if there is dancing I won't lack fight
But something flipped like a switch when you came around
Just a little bit a little bit hot
Nothing's gonna change there's no need to complain 
Mr Postman
Karma, karma, karma chameleon 
I almost wished you would've loved me, too
Of your rentcontrol apartment
Told you a thousand times
But I am the stranger now amongst all of the recognized
'Cause I want to pick peaches off of a cherry tree
Just over a day and a night
Now boy, you know me well
We played golf on the moon
Sometimes I'm talkative and sometimes you're not talkative, I know
I'm not sleeping
Before we crash in the ground
As she knows me now
Ain't got no mind
I've only ever dreamt of this
While neighbors talk and talk and talk
Secure life, baby, you should
Oh, baby, I'm down down
And I'm dizzy from her kiss
And maybe I talk too fast
Beat beat beat of the song song
It made you do the things that drove you crazy
And honey, there's no hurry, 
Don't you let those other boys fool you,
Baby, don't you know
Girl, put your records on, tell me your favourite song
It�s such a gas when you bring up the past
It'd be like hearing now
So this is why I say
You made so sweet
It's a new world
You did
I'm not a , baby
It's true you're my love, whoaohohoh
You've always got a new bubble to blow
Gotta lot to learn, baby,
Because you've never seen a Redwood and you've never touched a deer
Slow it down, make it stop
Don't get upset, and now is just the beginning
I knew before, long ago
Står i din port, står bara still
To see through to our star bodies go
I don't know, half asleep
We ain't gonna go it alone no more So let's get on
Oh yeah, they've been helping us out
And she should've had more friends,
Now your hands, your tiny pink hands, grew larger than my hands ever grew
Time that I take you home girl
Meet me in the middle 
All my life
The taste buds taste right
Feel good from morning 
It's separated only by scars
I'd not be so scared of falling
We sat there looking at the faces
Heart still beating but it's not working
Like walking down ChampsÉlysées
Who cares what it does since you broke my heart
To the sea I offer this heavy load
If you were the love, I'd be the desire
Please, oh yeah, ooh
Your eyes are doing naughty butterflies
This is the only place for me
Under a pale blue sky
Mister Blue Sky's up there waitin' and today
be a dream
I kissed you on the playground
But with nothin' to consider they forget my name ame, ame, ame
The lovin' is a mess, what happened to all of the feeling All of the feeling
That the word is just the way 
My heart it dances, 
Gonna try, try, try 'til the morning comes
Behind the facade is a lonely angel still
So now you're giving up like they always said you would
You're halfway till you're fully grown, you've got a real good shot
Everybody, everybody just wanna play the lead
And you don't need tricks
I can call you Betty Oohoohoohoohooh
We can't be wrong, so say 'solong'
But it's got on for so long, for so long
You know I know you know you're not the tough guy that I thought you were
At twenty one the world was mine
We're taking our chances here on the run
Closer to the soulful days that counters all our evil ways
Well here comes my bab
Heaven at night heaven at night
Don't nobody care about 'cha, only thing you got is God
Yo, yo, this ain't the end, this ain't the end
And the day is rising
I got my sex
I took my sister down to the ocean
Now I'm walking on sunshine, whoa
For the face that I once saw
I made a lot of mistakes
Found a flaw in the ending of a book that I've read twice, 
So I spend time guessing on you, oh
Then it's back on the road again
When you go up, down, jump around
I climbed the stair that led me to your front door
You know
It's still in the evenin' if I'm sleepin' paper problems
Feelin' better than some head on a Sunday afternoon
When I'm so far away Oh why would I
No, don't you worry, we'll all float on alright
Elevator, elevator, take me home
We say that we'd take you down
You got everybody listening
Turn up your radio
The rhythm of a line of idle days
There's just something
Think about the place where you live
I'll let you down
But I can feel, I can feel, I can feel it's beginning to end
Nervous and shy for the moment we will come
Guilty feelings
Celia, you're breaking my heart
C'mon Brian, cheer up
That was a  a big slash of paint
Got to remember to fight
They say the Nile used to run from east to west
I've got mixedup memories, and I've got favourite places
Far away from all the violence, safely flying in our own orbit
Uh huh gon' forward move, gon' buy me some time
So hear this please
My friends say I'm crazy and I agree
My sisters and my brothers of every different color
I opened my eyes last night
Coming home again
We all know someone,
When you sleep next to me
Behind your closet door
I give a smile I give a song
The bar men used to call her "Little Lisa, Looney Tunes"
I like where you sleep
Fate will play us out
The ones who told me I'd be better off dead
I know it looks bad 'cause I kissed all your girlfriends
And to those of you who mourn your lives through one day to the next
Anchored by an astronaut's patriot tune
Singin' sweet songs
I can't stop hearing all the singing
Shaking at the sight of you
The beauty in every inch, oh
I can't stand by the side
The dogs will let me know
I remember the day when I could walk right down the streets and feel so confident,
There's more of those tunnels in your home town
Behind my eyes 
Can't go wrong with that
If that's how I've got to pay
We all got along
The nursery rhymes that helped us out in making sense of our lives
I'll be the last one on the dance floor
And that's at least a start to get inside your heart
Yeah everybody
K  I  A in love, I'm your target
You make me bleed when I look up and you're not around
Locking eyes, holding hands
Is sitting right next to me
Here come bad news talkin' this and that Yeah
We come running
When I'm in the mood
They stumbled and wavered, but caught me a saviour
But look at me shuffling through the stack until I finally find
Neon black flames cook the calm air
If you cross the road and a drunk struck you
Come on and show that energy
If you were a river in the mountains tall,
It counted up our feelings
I dreamt that you were on a train
Yeah, everybody's gone surfin'
Moments away, Moments away
Fingers trace your every outline, oh yeah
The wind circles among the trees
And see the talent you always hide
I'm gonna go out in the street and do anything I want
I live with you
Will dry the tears behind your eyes
Another day to do it all again
Sing me to sleep tonight
Now it feels like sinners in the sun
I know everything reminds you of me
There's no last thing now
Made me feel weak and
Yours is the kind of love
I was falling deep, deeply in love with you, and I never told you till just now"
But you never call at all
It lets me know that I'm OK
And I didn't even know it
And yellow stones are standing on her eyes
And when you came my heart was saved
OohDo your thing
Remember the foggy window
Where the trees I planted grow
Now it's payback for the rainy days
Should they catch us, and dispatch us to those separate work camps
Never mind wonderful you
Not much good to take better to give
Chutes and sorrows are over now
Though I never meant to let it get away from me
I find in this town that it's hard to see
And being strangers to change
And the family heirloom jewelery
And the sun is unrelenting
For all my life
Hey, come on, yeah
And their parents did
And I been in love only once
Bingo and rock were pushing out Xrating
They we're very very friendly men
You've got more than money and sense, my friend
Unless the dreamer is the real you
Climbing up the walls
And though you seem absent minded with that lazy walk 
Staring over at the neighbor's, knickers down
I hope some day you'll understand
Steal that beat like he would, RRRobin Hood 
Oh these are the comforts that be 
Wait 'til your mother and your papa's gone
Whispering to live your dreams instead
Absorbing sound that's never been right
In your old car 
You won't hear me, still you endear me
Hold your fire
Aaaallllllll the people gather 'round now
Uncovering the ways to plan the next big attack 
But forever seems so far away
Tambourine style, walking in a single file
So that's fine, yeah come by we'll take the afternoon off
Talking 'bout their own style
I got cursed or something man but
I'll make it famous in every way
Away we go Away we go
Oh yes, I'm fine
Instead of leaving it behind you
All I do is dream of you the whole night through
Drop for me, missile that'll make you go boom
Come on out and dance
We've got an energy
I've been corrupted 'cause
Twisting its secret course all through the city's heart 
You look inside me wild mind
Hey you know my friend lisa
I always knew you were a
The Mason winter door
A slaveship
Feel the sun shining for your eyes
When I told you to stop
Ooh There's nowhere else to go, I hope that you'll stay the night
Well they're the gambling kind
Blue canary in the outlet by the light switch
But you know you know you can trust
Those happy thoughts in my head I'm feeling like I'm Peter Pan minus the tights and the fairies
To fall down at your door
All the things you loathe
Oh my mind wanders through all that I've been hiding from
A king to sing you the blues
Music is power, let it flow through your mind
Well, it's Saturday night and we in the spot
Don't believe me just watch, come on
Hug and kiss it 
With open arms and fists
Even day takes relief every day
A psychotropic segment so tasteless,
The plane took off and my love went with it
And cold nights make staying alert so hard
Friends say I'm crazy cause
Your heart is just as long as mine
I knew I'd find you in a day or two I knew that I would find you in a day or two
Go on ahead and let it fade away
He dances in secret, he's a parttime punk
Waste my days Oh, oh
Like a flying saucer landing
All that I ask is that I know where you are 
The feeling of coming, the feeling of going
The coral that lies beneath the waves
Stay the way I am today is certainement disaster
From your lovers, and pause all the suffering
Let me make you happy
Hanging on the wall of a schoolhouse somewhere
Strong wind, strong wind
Oh deary me
There's a picture opposite me
We make love to Some Weird Sin
Do ya, do ya, do ya, do ya love me
Because, because
They say that this is where the fun begins
Besame Cuando Estes Bailando 
In a special way
To do this things that people do
Show me some positivity all right
Behind the fringe of a whiskey high
Would you be my American boy, American boy
Out on the weekend when I'm just havin' some fun
Come on over here and take a second chance
There was a car in the bay
Awkward choices with smiles from ear to ear
Do you know what it's like to fall on the floor hey
Sittin' back in the sun
Please stay for a while now
Everything will change, ooh
I'll be back tomorrow
I know what I should get this time
Where they ride horses, no cars
Look into their eyes and you suddenly know
No need for a thousand cranes
Counting seconds through the night and got carried away
I get so hot inside I'm burning my clothes
Was it not sick when we came across three men
The calm of turbulent seas, fallen to sleep
Baby, I've been waiting for you
When we're sleeping in daily
Far away
And I know every constellation
One day Death is going to conquer me
This is your heart, it's alive
But the sunlight's creeping in
A picture of you in your birthday suit
We only danced for a minute or two
I'm gonna bring it down
Whoa whoa, I got to tell you something
With your babies breath
Baby, I can love you, baby, I can love you better
And I was there outside in green
Who sings for women of great virtue
Ah, Ah, Shaking all our lives
Me and the ocean, me and the sea
I did before and had my share
It's better if you say you hate it, that's the truth exactly
And I will find her in the skies 
I'm convinced God works in mysterious ways
With the light
We should find a flock of birds big enough
Walk by the man who sings a song to the street lights
Home is wherever I'm with you
The writing's on the wall
Better get to the table, get to the table on time
I'll ride across the park
I know you'll never change
Albums back as you're lying there
Should I choose to stay here now all depends 
Rise above, gonna start the war
O my dear you're a threat to the bad in us all
And your hopes 
I can feel the bones are smiling in my body
Que faire quand on a tout fait, tout lu, tout bu, tout mangé
But there's no ideal inside of me
Over and over Started my rock 'n' roll fantasy
Well I need you I want you to know it's AOK
He drove his chair in the cavalcade
Charlie's fixing his van, he's waiting for a postcard
I can see all obstacles in my way
We've been on the same boat since day one
The world is made up of so many opinions
All right, kick it
Just where we know
But the story is mine
Lady on the water, bring me branches, bring me twine
You could even write your name upon my back
Won't let you go
It cannot wait I'm sure
We've been places like this
Not my imagination
You'll be half of who you were
And it's starting to show
I thought it was funny but now I got money on a monkeyfight
And been dragged through the dirt
And when you use your lips they better be on me
They make me feel that I'm only all I see sometimes
The future freaks me out"
Performing with the Apples
Through the gorgeous light of the sun
You will know that it will show the way the ocean always knows
How does it feel
From a guy too cynical for love
And you like to be home most of the time
I can't stop if you can't start
Oh c'mon, what's a boy to do
I'm turning turning turning turning turning around
In the car when your mother lost her temper
Now the rainy season reminds me of Maria
Waiting for the day you're not looking for something else
So just be gentle, be gentle with me
The clouds the darkest gray
The buzz of love is busy buggin' you
You don't need no memory
It is quiet here, I am powerful
I'm alive  and the dawn breaks across the sky
A loss of the senses
We'll write a song
I'm alright, I'm alright
But I only work here to pay my tuition
All right now, fellas Yeah
My dear, oh dear
My baby, my darling
Well its OK, I know you've got the time
Calling it off just to keep crawling to your arms
You didn't sink when I sank
Gonna cry, yeah
Let the songs begin
You cut your eyes so you could finally see
Thoughts has crossed my mind
Take a look at the boy like me
And I'm so happy
Till this wish is my command
Sun is getting high
Lucky to have been where I have been
For what once was gold and once was rich and now is poor, 
It's coming around again
As the fraud I really was
For us to shout, shout, shout these words out
Don't you ever fear for I'm always near
I am delighted
Well, all right Well, all right
But I guess I was wrong, hey
And we'll stop fighting once your circuit board's igniting
You'll never find a boyfriend unless you get it adjusted
Tunnel under, tunnel under, underground
I talk to you, understand
I'll blame it on the pain
David won't you stop dreaming now
Whenever you stop
Home is when I'm alone with you
Mother Mary heard us approaching her door
The past is holding on so tight 
Under pinups on the wall
There's something in my eye, a little midge, so beguiling
Now, what's cooler than being cool Ice cold
This old heart gonna take them away
I don't know, honestly
When I'm in the glow of the warmth you throw
A watering hole
By the time we hit Mexico you'll know little girl
You need another man
Is something I'll get used to, oh
But if you wonder why I never wrote you a song
Girl, let me love you and show you how special you are
Do you still think that you know
Better say goodbye
To keep my heart from jumping through my mouth, dear
Oh, every time I close my eyes
Way up in the sky
She's got a love like woe Woe oh oh oh
That is, unless they're walking slow, and
She holds you captivated in her palm
And they're splattered up and down your windshield and the headlights
Aeyyoh, I came here to party
You're sensitive to light
Dansa pa scenen och dansa i publiken dansa for rappet
You missed my eye, I wonder why, I didn't complain
I'm loving life
Sssing my song and
Throw your love around, love me, love me
Might leave yo face down in the dirt because hurtin's not an option
You walk like an ace now, you walk like an ace
Just as soon as I'm on top of my life, there you are again
You'd better dig and take a look inside yourself
Under fourteen feet of clothes
Let his riddle rub on to my pride
Chain smoking cigarettes and three bottles of red wine
I'm having a daydream, we're getting somewhere
Hey Annie, well look at you
Why do you make a start
The shape of your lips and the size of your nose
There's nothing you can do that can't be done
Don't you think by now there's truth
I got a shelf full of books and most of my teeth
Stand up don't make a sound, your ears might bleed
There will not be a new one
I don't care what they say about us anyway
When things don't feel right
I was an angry young man
'Cause we're seeing other people
Frankly, I let my heavy eyelids flutter
What I wanna do with you
I don't know if I'll make it, but watch how good I'll fake it
So whatever you saying, it don't entertain my ego
Put your hands on my heart
And the tiny chefs they waved their giant knives
Stay awake to break the habit
The sun falls down like money
In a violent rage
So say Geronimo
Yeah we will run
Because we hadn't slept for days
Enjoy the moment
Said I can't go on, not in this way
I know you think
In a village in the hills
I'll do my best to keep you, keep you sleepy as the south
My walls are coming down
That loving is all about doors unlocking
I had a dream that I had to drive to Madison
For seein' through superhuman vision
Well then we've got to end it before it's too late
Your wounds are going to heal 
But with you
Off alone to the great unknown
I can't let you go now that I got it
What's the matter, matter
I traced your steps through the city of romance lazily
Makin' hairpins outta glass
I've got a sickness, you've got the cure
I need to concentrate
So y'all copped the LP's and y'all fiends got dealt
And some water for my throat
"Help me someone, I'm out here all alone"
You could've been getting down to this sick beat
She waits and
And I just can't wait till the day when you knock on my door
Little Lisa, today is your day
Because I'm free
New friends and new places to see
Just for tonight,
The radio waxes romantic Its lullabies fill our eyes with tears
I wouldn't say that I'm sorry oh no
E'rey day feel like my birthday
You play along to songs written for you
I hear you're somewhere in the sand
Shake, shake, shake, Senora, shake your body line, whoa
All over Manhattan Inside, outside, USA
Dead weight to carry around
Must be the season when that love light shines
I come to this world so wild and free
Dance with me pretty boy tonight pull shapes,
Eric B man looking like touchitheshootme
Music is my hometown
More soul than I ever had
I'm in love but its only temporary, temporary
The waves are crashing by
But where are you these days
That's why we have come to collect you bodies
Until you find your Rolex in the sand
No, no, 'cause I can't go on without you
Watching the skirts you start to flirt, now you're in gear
But I love her and I'm sorry
And you, you gots the stuff
Did your mom get back from her business trip business trip
I used to be involved, and I felt like a king
You got on the TV
Mass romantic fool wears Foster Grants, his books on tape ring true,
Everyone's getting ready
All I want is you, will you stay with me
I've been thinking about you and what you've been up to
East or West well home is the best
Barcelona  How can I forget
I put one foot in front of the other one
I'd like to take your head, place it
Ooh, I will drive a thousand miles or I'll meet you at the station
Hey, I'm looking up for my star girl
Colours are where my old makes new
Who makes love to the flower bed
Looking for a way that I can see your face
The machine in the ghost within
It ain't the way it has to be
First let's see the West End, I'll show you to my brethren
The way I'm feeling inside
For thinking that we could be something for real
I see a rainbow, purple and gold
I love cheap thrills
We hit you, bboom bang, a bboomerang
You're so scene, listening
Wake up, kids, we got the dreamers' disease
She will always seem exotic and aloof
It's the last to come back when the sun melts the snow
'Cause there's a friendship, a lovely kinship
Wear your hair long, babe, you can't go wrong
The food supply has been depleted
Well, the years start comin', and they don't stop comin'
High above the chimney tops, that's where you'll find me
It's outta sight in the dead of night
That golden cross Lord
Look at the ground
And the atrocities of school I can forgive
Phase One, in which Doris gets her oats
Tous les oiseaux du point du jour chantent l'amour
The dream is over
Seen your scars and kissed your crime
I saw you in the corner of my eye on the sidelines
And you comb your hair, grab your coat and hat
Illuminate the main streets
Don't know just what I said wrong
It don't make sense to me, but
I want to kiss you on the mouth and tell you
She was a gymnast happily swinging
Then breathe breathe breathe breathe a sigh of sweet relief
And you gave up so many just to make a livin'
I've been watching you
Yeah, we're so happy
Shut your mouth, my wallet's fat
When I feel kinda bad and don't want to stress
We're lost behind enemy lines
Music is the question to things unsaid
So many reasons to be happy
The time is getting closer
Oh baby, give me one more chance
Here I'll be driving, you look the other way
Then we can pretend it's natural
He's been there for years
Lord I got high 
Well I'm just a boy
All my life, I've been searching for ya
And when I, I wanna kiss you, yeah
And I'm giggling again for no reason
We heard that's what you are into
Looking for a guy guy
And never come down
If that's a tear I see
It makes the world go 'round and around and around and around
She did brass rubbings, she learned you never had to press hard
I thought I loved you, and it's just how you looked in the light
Oh, just when you think that you're in control
And you, you needed you, you, you needed me to hold you
Control your bad side in to peril
I'll take care of you tonight
And I knew we'd view it piece by piece
Darling, what you gonna say now
Oh, something once pure 
You're making something out of nothing
Kindly send her sailing back to me tttee
And kept out of sight
So doctor won't you pull the fucking plug Won't you cut the cord
I say, hey momma, hey momma, hey momma, hey momma
My world's getting clearer
I don't know what I knew before
I tell you in the kitchen about my day
That great love sound
A look, a laugh, a smile, a second passes by and I regret it
What happened in November is what I needed
Whoaoh, baby
And, I felt like there were two days missing
Drags me kicking and screaming through fast dreams 
For once in my life for once in my life
I won't live without it, I won't let us go
Moments away
She's talking to a hypodermic reflection
It's too late to phone her now
What you don't have now will come back again
For some time I went to school
And Betty, when you call me
Monday's gone
And all the sadness inside me
Windows of chance there, lost on the trail of dissent
So leave me where the kids are alright
If only I could always be just as I am right here
Hot wire my heart
Let's get lost till empty
Called up my mama, said I'm in love with a stripper, yo
I'm nothing but a sandcastle  Baby, don't blow me away away
I can see the ground approaching now
He can make me happy
I know you're still the one
Mistaking cables for veins can be quite misleading
Come over here with your heart Come over here with your
To sheltered from the cold, who really knows
I will not sleep until I've counted to  three times
And as I look to the stars
Each breath that you take has a thunderous sound
Backwards through her vocoder, while
From the morning
Content to yield, despite pride
We'll fight fire with fire, fire with fire, fire with fire
The pain it won't end, even if she falls in love
Just touched down in London town
I was beat down to a pulp, rocking back and forth somewhere 
And you could even take more spills
Empty the pack and watch your wings grow back
No more sun, why's it always night
Dressed up in awomens underwear
You're good at making me feel so small
Baby get your feet on the floor
Hot kind of music
Yitho omanqoha
And all the presents from her uptown boys uptown boys
Hey All right now
I guess we'll have to wait until the trade winds blow
From the projects, I send shots where the cops is, nigga
Just a boy, just an ordinary boy, but
It's going to be a bright bright
Now that summer is here
Banana phone, ring ring ring
We like our fun and we never fight
If you wanted to be my friend
I know ya don't know who ya, think I think I am
You are the light, light
And by the time that it was dark, you and me had something, yeah
Way we get by
I can't stand to think about
And which I could never outrun
It's like a fairy from the ancient time
Got a feeling this is something strong
You're gon' be my girl My girl
Sick of being someone
Sea Lion woman
She's my little deuce coupe, you don't know what I got
I'm your only friend
Waiting on a phone that never calls, at all
Let the good times roll, let the good times roll
Summer girls come and summer girls go
Told me why, I, was
I don't get the connection
Coldest winter for me
With a suitcase on your back
Hard to find the words to tell ohoohoh
Não há paz  There is no peace
Before I do something lame
We don't care about no
I'm travelling at the speed of light
Oh happy happy day
To put my head in a mess
Heyla, heybahelloah whoohoo
Yeah, I'm just a teenage dirtbag, baby
When your oldest son wonderin' what to be
But you were just some silly girl
Better start running
From laughing and crying to pain that comes easy
A new home with a place to breathe
And watch your eyes as they poured
Don't stop me Heyhi
The rain must fall on everyone 
And the eagle flies with the dove
In the streetlight dawn, this beat turns on
You know you're catching the fever, you know you're catching the fever,
Everyday, a shade of blue
And even Edison has no idea
In your mind
And play what I want to play
Kinda suits you anyway
Something inching past the edge of reserve
And the lighting is fine
From anything we could call loving 
I didn't even notice it till it fell apart,
Lying here with you
I was trying to hide
It's all about tonight act a fool
We've watched it all from the window ledge,
This little southwest village shouldn't cost that much
Turn back to the ground
I'm everything a girl could need
Always seem to be on the run
Let's all melt down together
'Cause she's watching wrestling
Tell me where it all went wrong, don't you know that you really upset her
Pretending that I've got a clue
I never thought we'd fall out of place, eh, hey
And say this must stop,
Anywhere you looked was right 
We gotta rock the neighborhood
But if you're a friend of any sort
Lost control, hit a wall
I know a movie star, I've got her plastered to my wall
Oh, I need what the world can't give me can't give me
You see this perfect boy,
We were in Heaven for five or six minutes, then we passed out
When you're bored and you need a kick
For all of these simple things and much more a flower was born
Lay your hands on me
I feel it in my feet on the streets
Lovin' is what I got, I said remember that
And the hours of your life
The sun can't burn away our sins 
To get a word from the wise,
And heaven who knows
Do you want to fall apart
I hope the message made it's way down the wire
Bad mind, let me put on good habits
The only plans of mine might sound to you cliché
I'm a nobody, too
Till there's nothing left that I haven't tried
And if I didn't hurt so much, you know I'd give you it all
Don't you try to tell me that you never loved me
This place is so lovely
I'll take her home after midnight
When every single second of my waking day
Alright everybody, gather around
Well, if I did, you made me
And talk about me
Maybe we gotta try
They say candy is sweet, but it just can't compete with you, baby
Cheers to the wives of the drunks
I laughed out loud, could they all see that it was madness
That I could love you like you want me to
Today is, where your book begins
I could be violet sky
Ever since I was a kid, I've been a brooding basket case
Come on back to me, reality
I need to know your lips
And you looked so cute there, you were crying
Now she drinks away the will and she's not proud of it
Sends shivers, up and down my spine
Swing, swing, swing the spinning step
Gonna love
And the beats my heart missed,
For dancing like you can't hear the beat
I'll be back in the ballroom swingin'
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
It's a good thing this is just a game
I gotta say what's up to Tony Williams
I shake it off, I shake it off whoo
The world we loved forever gone All you love, but it's gone
And  reclining chair
I'm closing up inside and I was only just started,
Kuluman
You're not a gold mine
It's pure in a sense 
It doesn't matter what you say
Your mom came out with just a towel on, ohho ohhon towel on
How can you laugh when you know I'm down
But still I am in love with this life
If you need, if you, if you need to
And sun sun sun so what the heck
I took you to Best Buy, you took me home to meet your mom and dad
Nothing new to say
He can tell me what to do but he can't tell me what to feel
I can't sleep, in the silence, broken
It's been a perfect day
You tell me that your love is true on each and every day
That's why I can't leave my house
So let's spend
But that's just how I feel,
Go ahead with your schemin'
Leaves you twinkling with the stars
Oh you will run
Guess I walked right into it
Slumber party, pillow fight
Nico, come back home
You think I'm fly don't you Whoo
Chatting on the phone
When we bend the 
Away from everything you've loved before
And as they lead us to their village, a thousand voices all started to sing out loud
I been bummin' around this old town for way too, way
Calendar, the years, verbal hemispheres
She's a player and a downright bore
Jerry's Kids are knockin' at my door could you be a sponsor
Living with ignorance
Freight train rattled through my head 
'Cause I'm sure that some day it's gonna start
Oh girl, when I'm in love with you
I was glad that it didn't destroy you
I want the people in the country to be open and kind
This time you're not homecoming king
And I would have called you
Boy I hear you in my dreams
To get me through this
On the back of your hand,
Don't get mad
'Cause we can always sing girl
So come on, come on, come on, come on
I don't think so, I don't think it was meant to be
Tell me something over nothing ain't so wrong
'Cause I know the life from your burning wheel won't wane
Hold your hand out, you silly girl
Come on, come on, come on, come on, baby, now come on, baby
When there's girls all over the world
When I look into your eyes 
No I don't feel like I'm falling
Keeps me shaking up all night
When she smiles they all feel the power 
On the other side, on the other side, on the other side
As there's dancing to be done
You've caused all this pain
There's so much in life that's undecided
I can hang 'round with you
Woahohoh, come on, ohohoh, all you animals
My boy MC Serch nevertheless
Birds fly over the rainbow
And if she likes, I'll tell her lies
And watched you tower over meover me
I got most of the means and scripts for the scenes
Then I'm the worm, I know the part is such a bummer
So dreamy, oh Mandy
Your desire, desi sire, desire, through your desire
For a ride
It's time to shine cause what you've got is
But you wouldn't benefit from knowing all the truth
Living your life in the gray
Now I love to feel that warm southern rain
Your cigarette cuts to the inside
Neither one was able to hold it in, hold it in
"Swim in the ocean that'd be my dish
Shake your head to the sound
And we'll all float on anyway
So take me and save me and change me and then make me
Easily I fall in love
Your love washes over
I think it would be funny
So if I die today I'll be the happy phantom
But your body language is telling me that you're worth the pain
Get back here
We'll never know what anything was for
Hot hot like a fire
As I turn my white skin red
Now with all due respect
Is somebody to you
'Cause you're leaving and I won't know how it ends
Show up late dressed like a domino
'Cause right always takes too long
But the river is wide
I gotta feel like
Got nothing to say I got nothing to say
Oh Alfie get up it's a brand new day
Just watching the world
Run along with your new boy
With loving all around me,
And her face is like a sail
Oh no I was just cleaning my throat
So you'd get away with it
Used to hate school so I had to play hookie
I'll carry it all
So that you'll know I'm out of hiding
Well, some things just, some things just make sense
Won't help to hold inside, give a real, give a real, shout out
You'll miss your train and come stay with me
When will you all run out of gas
It's a perfect place above full of everlasting love
There's nothing after that but you and I
To let you know what you meant to me
Underneath the stars
I'm red as a beet 'cause I'm so embarrassed
No One's Perfect, I've Got Baggage
Up up and away
Dressed me up in womens clothes
And whoa, my nights are so long
to light the eyes of all the harmless sociopaths
When you walk out through your door, I'll wave my flag and shout
If you don't say what you feel
Once I get you up there
But I know gold is just a trick of light
You tell me that the tears of a clown
Let's go on the subway, take me to your hood
Get yourself to the Butterfly Lounge Big girl, you are beautiful
I never let a motherfucker break me dogg who gives a fuck if a nigga don't like your steez
And the flower 
With a face like that you'll never ever make it big,
Yeah, some people try and treat me like a man 
Light me up that cigarette and I'll strap shoes on my feet
Always surprised to find more
And no, she don't know what I do in my spare time
You sweet talk like a cop and you know it
You'd get a seven inches
I'm in the mood, I'm in the mood
And if you were a kiss, I know I'd be a hug
One night I fell asleep
Encoded title doesn't give away as much as it should
And hope that nobody does get through
But Abraham Lincoln was the great emancipator
Ooh baby, baby, got me feeling so right
Hanging up there in the sky as though a balloon
Thank god the band's doing well
Lives which have played a part
She'll say I'm not so tough
We run green
In the eyes of my grandpa, right before dying
I figured it'd take 'em too long to look up and besides
I'm down on the ground down I'm really down
"I thought you were straight, now I'm wondering"
I put the pedal to the floor
'Cause now he's telling me I'm the girl that he likes most
It's been a while
It all falls apart, apart
And love, just like blood, will always stain
piece band all dressed up like me
And our hearts won't sink 'cause it's obviously nothing at all
And I will make a lovely
Didn't make sense not to live for fun
Friday night at the drivein bingo
Wake up in the evening
Throw in the brittle skeleton fake tomb
And I'm glad you fell in love with me
Sleep well, I pray that cardboard boxes,
But you know it won't be long before
He has just thrown a bunch of gold paint
If it's still alive be gone to sleep
Bein' lewd with two dudes for food
Speak about the future in past tense, here it comes
I sold my soul way down in the dirt
You can't find the words to say
My family's not rich by any means
It's always the issue
Of the days too early to come and too early to stay
I fell asleep, I was hoping you'd call
Can I get get get to know knknow know you better, baby
When I can't move 
I was born to endure this kind of weather
Go night swimming, leave your clothes on the ground
Say cheerio to books now
Where there's a will, there's away
I'm smiling, she's living
I need somebody to love
West Side of the ATown, nigga, if you don't know no better, nigga
Flowers grow through my window and I love you again
And before I knew I had shiny skin and it felt easy being clean like him
Solace and sway of the sheets,
She gonna steal my lovn'
But mine and my baby
Singin', don't worry 'bout a thing
Yes I need you
We make a pair of parentheses
Junkyard fool with eyes of gluegloomblue 
Girl's got a love like woe Woe oh oh oh
So tell me something That I didn't know
Our hair in the air
But I'm listening as it evolved in my head
Well the cats and dogs well they love to play
You've got to burn baby burn
Pass the wealth around
Are we so out of line
All the boys voices cracking
I picked her up and she was threeforths gone
With our heads so high
If you are the ghost of New York City
From the first time I set my eyes up on yours
But me, I'm feeling pretty good as of now
Gonna watch you grow
And any snide remarks from my father about your tattoos will be ignored
Stop treating me like I was just a child
You've got me running around in circles 
The winds of fear
I'm king of it all, the belle of the ball
All you gotta do
When your past lingers like rain clouds casting shadows below 
Let's board a plane without no destination
Yeah, we all shine on
Through my head and mouth
Everything you do is all I need to know
Baby if you telephone
All I do the whole day through is dream of you
Uptown funk you up hey, say what
From East Side niggas in Kirkwood and Li'l Vietnam
Watch me fall
I can only think it must be love
Throughout the world
You make everything make sense
If music is the victim then so am I
And I'm singing "oh oh" on a Friday night, and I hope everything's gonna be alright
To see your shoes and your spirits rise
No need to be uncalm, 
People are just people
There's no resting in my heart
And I don't know whose land were on
Looks like I got here just in time
The paparazzi's lurking
Deliver de letter
Give up all awkward tomorrows
You can see that birds and worms don't get along
I wanna be your girl
I've got music on my radio, oh, oh, oh
To the bypass of the town I hadn't visited
I don't wanna say I'm leaving
This is gonna be the best day of my life 
I've carried more than I can
Sometimes they justify my claim
In the light of day
And there's nowhere else in the world I'd rather be
"Lisa I don't know anymore
Losing control
But I hear you crying in your sleeping bag
One wave can pull me under
Here I stand, crawlin' home at night
That's our new princess of hiphop and r&b
'Cause I need you like the dragonfly's wings need the wind
And she's got the curse, the curse of I want someone
How I'm barely breathin'
She knows that she can't win
And things pushed in my face
With Tom the astronomer, who'd name a star for you
Shimmy, shimmy, quarter turn
Sometimes there's airplanes I can't jump out
I love the way that your hair is always neat
Come in to take me home
She's got a secret and she wants to tell
So come on let me sing
But you are an artist
And watching the evening news
There was a dead mouse in your arms
Gonna party like
Broken hearts and faded dreams
I'm just trying to be happy
I won't stop won't stop won't stop the beat
How will I get one I don't know
Addiction don't come close to this
I'm making a list
Cause you and I we're good together, oh You always get me feeling better
The sun on your bare shoulders,
It's been so dull since you left Nashville
Yes I am the man who wont come breakn' your heart
Troubles while I can burst
So this is the last time that I'll hold your hand
I walk the streets with a song in my head
With him your troubles you can share
Oh, don't it feel good, don't it feel good
When the streetlights are far beyond you
Oh everybody
That you work you have no face
As I wander through the street
Up in dark and empty skies
You know I shan't ever stop tonight
Oh my soul has never had this feeling
And I'd change the song now if I could
I caught it on the rebound and landed with a soft sound
And words of pledging trust and lifetimes stretching forever
Got my fingers, got my legs
Turn everything red and the beat is complete
And tell me bout your song  
She's a lot like Catwoman
Wave lengths pull magnetically and I was right
Keep it clean, I didn't mean to be mean
Yes, I saw her face, now I'm a believer
Everybody trying to reach out to each other
Yes everything is different
Are you my curse or are you my friend
Honestly, a single wrong is not enough
Tell me what you're waiting for
The passing stars light the way
And you carry a little speech with you
Especially when some of you so called "poor kids" have got the money for a digital camcorder
Yeah I wanna show anybody who wants to see it
There's too much sky, not enough blue 
You get right down to the bottom of the barrel and float back on top
Don't stop, don't stop don't stop, the beat
I know I say it too much
I always find my way back home
Talk of better days that have yet to come
The many winged escape
You'll never believe the view
I look into your eyes and say 
It feels like so, so,
Step back and here comes the night time
Sugar, shake it, susugar
Make it better, we're here to welcome you
Over hill and highway the banana buggies go
I've said goodbye before
You've one more chance, so get it right
My room is darker
We mix up your guts, your insides xrayed
Always in a foggy haze
Nolita flat on rent control
Made you feel like it's not such a bad world
Will be accompanied with tips on how to smile
Plenty of girls and boys in love,
So I said I'm a snowball running
And all the girls walk by, dressed up for each other
I can't believe I came home to find my car keyed
The way it tastes right
You will not back up an inch ever,
And although not really, it might not even come true
What would you say was the matter
Where we'll work so hard, we can do no harm
'Cause I almost got popped for a fight with a thug
Sometimes you reach what's realest by making believe 
Woooohoohoohoohoohooh
Sunday morning rain is falling, and I'm calling out to you
Come and get my inner smile
We might have our freedom, but we're still on crack
I got a feeling you could use a little smile
He started the day with a mood and a shake, he was finally arranged
We're believing everything that we have heard
My car is ugly but then I'm ugly too
Someone I used to know
Children at your feet
Bed clothes, why am I in bed clothes
All the things I wanna say
Weatherwise it's such a lovely day 
Everyone's gotta get bottom
You torture each other from day to day and then one day you part
The blues they send to meet me
Somewhere over the rainbow
Let me see, let me see you drink it down
'Cause I'm missing you, it's making me cry
And if this all I've ever known
Without I'm a one track mind dear Yoko
Wear it like a bruise or black eye
Ah, la, la, la, life goes full circle
With loving all the time
We're goin' where the wind is blowin'
And my rainbow cake
And the entertainment saccharin
It used to seem we were number one, but now it sounds so far away
Gaze into these eyes of blue,
It's gonna be a bright, bright sunshining day
Just like us they are waiting
Don't think, don't talk
Oh yeah, so happy
You can trip on my
She said I can be a lion, I can be a Gila monster
Than just sit down at the piano and write this tune
I think I'm in love with a girl who lives
Without losing sleep, without losing sleep
And to think is more simple than changing the mood
So you tell me that there's nothing left to say
Livin' within a lie
As the scions of history guess another mystery wrong
But more I gave the less I've got, oh yeah
There's a light inside of me
Come and open up your folding chair next to me
Y no estas, y no estas Yolanda
Sing it out loud, get away with me
Dirty mind, don't know what you're gonna find,
You've got a shot though
Happy to know
You only get what you give
Do what you want, there is no need to impress us
And the way we were the day we climbed to the top of the
She couldn't seem to make up her mind
Come out where you are
And I'm not doubling back now
I might have not have reminded
Think about that summer and I bug 'cause I miss it
In this heaven up above filled with everlasting love
We are the happy boys and girls
And adopt a bunch of babies that ain't never had shit
It is raining, he's got no umbrella
You're okay, you're with me here in the silence
Always heading towards
Feel the rain on your skin
I reason with my cigarette
I'm glad I hitched my apple wagon to your star
And your tree, it never grew any leaves
Insects flutter up against my window
Please write my folks and throw away my keys
I hang on to what I got
The world goes crashing by
I felt like I could just fly
I may see you, I may tell you to run On my way, on my way
And we talked a lot, 
Every single day
I had my fill, and I know how bad it feels
And it's a Get together to tear it apart
Please don't ask me all those questions I don't know
But in a minute realize that true love always waits
I've been having good days, think we are the right age to start our own peculiar ways
Kick that shit
I'll be shaking at the sight
Hey, come on
Wahwah Here comes the sun
'Cause if it's all you've got left
How it feels
It's all love
Tonight we're gonna take the breath of a thousand lungs
There is no one else around
I learn to part with a smile on my face
C'mon we gotta kick that shit
Shine, shine, shine on
Because you know how much I wanted
Carry the people that you hate
Never miss opportunity
Or I might fail to be a lawyer someday
Come with me Friday, don't say maybe
But don't let me fall
Will we need it, will we need it
While I'm just contemplating sounds
And it would do no harm
The silhouettes behind the dust clouds call me friend
She's good to me
I know you didn't mean that
You come from Georgia where the peaches grow
Here's to all the pretty girls
Maybe I could carry on
Can you inject love's tender touch back into the gang bang
Your magazines, the people at the seams
I really don't understand a word
Well, I see skies of blue, and I see clouds of white
With whoever's gonna get her the highest
And I've got platinum vision and a tin foil touch
I had made up my mind that there must be a higher power
swinging his arms
And in the daylight I don't pick up my phone
I found some poison in your bed
Eeer, wooh
I thought about a new destination 
If I ever found a pot of gold
I wanted someone to love completely
And looking for the right guy
Have been made
Love started making sense
Or a little upset all inside
You'll never know if you don't go
Ooh, and every time I heard you breathe
Ah You're tender and you're tired
Lucky to have stayed where we have stayed
You're such a lovely cup
Sipping the golden drinks
And if it's the one thing
No need to fantasize
I've been a spoken word, I've been a river bed, I've been a rabid force
Rurururun run run
Still photos and noisy arcades
I'm gonna make a supersonic woman of you
The sound of the engines and the smell of the grain
We're hungry, next that I know
Because the last thing that I need is somebody like you
Of a girl I used to know
Show me a rerun on the W
But once they go, they don't come back
Now I'm in a familiar place
Never makes a sound
Bluebirds fly
Whooooh
My head's in a whirl and I'll love you till Tuesday
Restless future burning bright 
The soul of a dog, he's alive and not gone
I'll just wait awhile
And it's the feeling like you're oh so glad you came
And if I tell you something
Never said we'd be friends,
I'm getting restless looking at you
I've found the weakness and put it to play
Like everything just brings you down
I need your love
And the world I'll turn it inside out, yeah
I'll be the fire escape that's bolted to the ancient brick
And gone upon your quiet way Quiet way
My heels are high, my eyes cast low
Today I feel like laughing
And we're all on our way to the beach
Well, it's all right all right, if you live the life you please
There was an awful row between her mum and dad
And I've felt how a heart melts down
But it won't be long before my turn is next, to express
Life is not a play, it's what we
Destruct, As It Broadcast The Words
She's golden, she lives for me
Because people are very very special
As for now I will stay in the oven I will bake
That can make this life so unkind
Lacking in emotion, think about it now
Oh baby girl in those baby pants
Gotta throw it away
No one but you, you babynobody but you
I knew it couldn't last
But then you came and it soon departed
MC Hammer girls can't touch this
He thought I might need his help
Should have known
Magnetic screens that fold in backward
That nobody knows
Well, we'll float on, good news is on the way
Long winded Cambridge medicative care
Notice how her hair curls
A  minute lecture
Here is the place where
If I ever had a chance, it's now then
A land sakes alive
She wore scarlet begonias tucked into her curls
This opportunity
It's such a feeling that my love
About how crappy I felt, not realizing how many other people would relate
Everything you are now
It breaks my heart to see you
And if you want to say no, say no
Till the time I saw your face
It's a hideous trait on her mother's side
It could be over in a moment
We kept him from the world's glare
Where we don't know, though we can't see
We stay young through each other's eyes 
There were Vikings and boats
It was then I, it was then I understood
If it's not now then tell me when would be the time that you would stand up and be a man
When we roll out, we roll on dubs, rollin' up bud
On every table in every lounge
'Cause we are just seconds 
And the thunder with the storm
I'm thinking, do I have to plead to get you by my side
Or let the sky be grey
She is anyway
I'd rather dance, I'd rather dance than talk with you 
I will face the world alone
It's always been about me, myself, and I
Away
To seek my fortune Nanna thank you for this mob
You know he's so much more like Spiderman than you will ever, ever be
Away above the chimney tops
And the next thing you know 
But I can't remember what I meant to say
Pour a little sugar on it, honey
Butt's getting bigger, do you think he'll notice, maybe
Dress me up, make me talk, I'm your dollie
Should I stay Should I go
Damn right you got me good
Falling through the door
Well I can tell you for the money
So move your feet, babe
Quilted on my hands and feet 
It's gonna take plenty of money
But even if I changed
Sneaking up from behind
Not the snow, not the rain can change my mind
'Cause when I hear those drums late at night
Oh, it feels so big it almost hurts
Left to right is the tempo
Ah ah ah ah dialetto è bellissimo non
Attic in a basement with a knife serrated, I'll protect you
And your toes creepin' around
Money never beats soul
When I am full with endeavor
Liverpudlian lady, sophisticated male
I know it won't just be you and I
Go ahead and do your worst then
So many motherfuckers wanna down me
The roots are shooting up through the tool shed
You wanna find peace of mind
She made from nothing Aaah
Ain't as bright as the star I've found
They didn't like BB guns, or stupid archery
I'm always looking away
And free the human race from suffering
There is no space in our hearts
The time was passed so pleasantly
And unhappiness is treason
Lalalala, take me home
Now you can endure the lies now you can endure the fear
I said, "You're still miles away"
Won't change how I feel today
And I thought that I would kiss you
If I'm your boy, let's take a shortcut we remember
Gonna fix the world up, up for you
Will you help me break it down and get on through
It's not an easy road
So please don't please don't please don't
Can we take the next hours and talk about me
Here comes the sun again
Just drive away, yeah yeah yeah, go
'Cause the ASBO generation make this a terror nation full of loathing and fear
But a whole lot smarter
Heyla, heybahelloah whoooo
Your lips on my lips
I could be handy mending a fuse
Worrying about my brother finding out,
So devoted, completely swept off your feet
You can bet it is a bitch, kid
They say I'm too kind and sentimental like you could catch affection
Climbed in the world's biggest tree
So we could walk down to the stream
And I walk the neighborhood
I never thought that I'd be living on your floor
What if you choose to use turn me round,
Nearby a fountain in a park
The stakes are high, the waters rough
I blame myself Feel my head explode from a night of gin
I don't know why
The finer things I feel in me
On my mattress I've been drawing a line 
My parents say think about your future and my teachers say the same
I'm trying to beat is hiding in me, oh 
Darling, if you only knew
If it's all one in the same thing
Generate the music that makes you feel better
Real sugar, that's what I want or none at all
And we can go to that private view
It's not that I can't go on without you 
To say that we will never part
I was so crazy about you, I didn't mind
But you know you got it up, you gotta get that number
Rise and shine
But you know I love it
Charm your way across the Khyber Pass
But I'll break them too
Everyone's banging on their gongs
Saw our hearts were little stones
Yeah baby come on
And I'm picking up the phone
You must make your own shoes
We can dance, we can dance, everything's out of control
You get high
I promise to make it worth your while
And get to work, work, work till the job gets done
So baby, you'd better believe 
The British Summer time's just great whatever
I'm not cruel and you're not evil and we're not like all those stupid people
I'm tired of the books and I'm tired of the tables
As your friends complain
When storm clouds gather 'round
See now I'll be on my way to make this claim
Be whatever you need
No, please don't let me go
The king in I died
I'll never make you stay
Though it's making me crazy, yeah
I know you know your
Then I'll try to hold on to you
Perfectly at peace so I move along a bit higher
Why won't you give love
I bet she never had a backstreet guy
One day like this a year would see me right for life
Taken out of my soul
There is no more water to stop the fire
I'll be CtrlAltdeleting your face with no reservations
Your car is pulling off of the curb, hey
I guess it really depends
I'll be here holding you high above it all
So go home
I'm not a threat to nobody
And if the sword is hidden among you
Pining away in a heatwave there
I just want to be bothered with real love
In search of lost time, with the magic of true light
My hips they lie
Put my suits right on the guest list
Will I set the sun
"Do you remember that day you fell out of my window"
We are the chaseups of the night
Are just a picture of my needs
Didn't get much sleep last night 
And have fun
Tiny breaks for every day
For the girls you hate or just don't know
And we'll remember when we said
You didn't think that you'd be coming home again
His heart's in a bowl behind the bank
If we were a pair of jigsaw puzzle pieces
If I knew what you were up to
Singing helps all right
So tie your mask on and pretend that nothing's wrong
And it's hard to breathe when you're not near
You got some money do you right
Sweet sweet music
Is that what you'd want to view
Kneedeep snow Mushaboom, mushaboom
You're changing your heart
The same way I want you
Oh yeah
She's got superpower lovin'
My tears rolled down and arms went round at night, I gapped at her gowns
The future's trying to wait
Let's see how far we've come oh yeah
I'm the luckiest guy 
Here comes the sun
'Cause baby, I've been lightly drinking
I promise you I'll pay you back with Time
Oh if you find yourself amongst the lonely ones
And shivering we cling together and watch it pass us by
The architect's rendition 'Meri
Then I saw her face
I'm not in love with you
I waved my hands and I shouted to you
Oh oh what are you waiting for
It's a crime to fall in love
Grand view was hilarious
Must be something,
It's shaking the sky and I'm following lightning
I done been through a whole lot
That I needed to prove
For the people write me off like I'm a onehit wonder
Take my hand, we'll get there
But baby I need more than that
Saved you the room you used to stay in every Sunday,
You know that I'm the girl that you should call
Or recognize who you've become
Don't abandon him
Seems fine, though it ain't no no
Crashing through the levy moving with a mighty rush
I fell in love again
My mind's beat up
Work, work, work, Senora, work it all the time
And I am a beating rhythm
And I say too much, yeah, that's true
And can I break your sentiment
She says I remind her of her father,
Get in my rocketship
The clock is ticking
I just ask let me be
Hey, love's gonna get you down Lollipop
See I notice nothing makes you shatter, no, no
Your all right
Spread the facts on the floor like a fan
You told me I was pretty
And you come back to me
Seconds today
Oh, and if there's any love in me
And here comes Mary
And this life is a beautiful one,
There's a city I saw signed Something
'Cause your friends don't dance
I'm closing up a bag of air and wire
'Cause we're playin' the Palladium you can't get on Star Search
How near we've come is yet to show
You know what to ask for
I'm energyyou're the rhythm 
I can act like a star, I can beg on my knees
I was livin' like half a man
Breathtaking, breathtaking
So I darted back quickly to spell out your name
Take me back to beautiful England
Teacher thinks that I sound funny
Went home and cried to her mama tonight
It's hard to say, it's hard to say
The frozen city starts to glow
All those wasted days
Then show me right where your heart is
Let's sully every stage we meet
A Rhodesian Ridgeback, off the beaten track
I called your doctor up and he promised me pain was fun 
The more things seems to change, the more they stay the same
She's so glad she's telling all the world ooh
En la gran feria, de la mentira, yo fui el ciego el que no sabía
'Cause we don't know how
It's a secret no one knows
And, yes, they know New York will thaw, but
And through many dreadful nights
And I was yours and you're divine
Snow still fall as beautiful
Now take the glitz back, I want the soul instead
Do you know the price you pay
Now it gets ethereal, feet ain't on the floor
Now did you know this is limited time offer
Don't say anything
Sequin covered swans, that are used to make their own mosaics
I see you've got your list out
But time ran out and I, I let you down
It was some time in early September
'Cause there's a million things to do
Through all the summers
And you cannot run or ever, ever escape
To a river so deep
They say true love's the greatest weapon
Shame the band's broke up I just hope we'll remember these
Honestly, I think you've lost your mind
The beach gives a feeling, an earthy feeling
Wegotta get that shit
But if you don't listen to the voices then my friend
From the dark end of the street
When all the doors should be closed
You can see her ghost, but that's a lie, because the naughty woman isn't dead
So I could go into the sea
Don't worry 'cause it will all turn around
To fill a book or two
Racing through my brain
Fell in love when I saw you standin' there
That night I smoked a joint with my best friend, we found ourselves in bed
Its gotta get worse for a day
Shit a little funny, feel a little laughter
Silver scars in your hand, in your hand
You are never ahead of, never behind us
They'll suppress you of your spirit and rinse you dry of smiles
He wants to know what he doesn't know
And stories are all fiction from their moment of birth"
In a heartbeat
The train leaves at half past ten
And I'll stare off through the darkness
'Cause I can feel it, I can see it,
Pee Wee Herman
Like a song I once sung
All the things that I relate to them
Bleak church on a cold tundra
There's a place in this world
Like a number two pencil I always got a point
Making due is a thing, a thing I will do no more
Writing this letter hoping you're okay
It is within us all the time
Please come with you
But now I've got it
That was bursting at all the seams
'Cause a real woman
But when I get enough
Grasshopper greensnake, hold my hand
First thing they teach us, not to give a fuck How I got over
Well if I lived in India, they'd still be Chinese children uh huh
But I wonder what goes on behind doors
Made a friend tonight
The country
So sweetly you said
An opportune in a world of dreams
And I'm not bummed, some works not fun then we crawl in the carpet like bugs
But I dropped them for Chelsea
Underneath the tropical sun
It's a jungle gym
I want to crashland
And time stands still
And I want to know everything that you do
Some blades will cut you right to the bone
Colors fading and frayed at the sides
'Cause every little thing gonna be all right, I won't worry
If you're not feeling the way that your bredgin is dressin'
If you still don't know the way we roll
And I'm screaming at the top of my lungs
'Cause I'll remember everything you sang
And you said don't you want to be like that man
It's words I wanted
Two of us wearing raincoats
When we peer into the great unknown
It's  o' clock on a Friday morning
Oh, I'm a little child
And their whisperings fill the night
'Cause your a pretty little windstorm
Then I guess I fall
Play the pipes and drum
Poor young grandson, there's nothing I can say
For seeing lost opportunity
We'll take the trail marked on your father's map
Whoa, shades of gold displayed naturally
Sun comes up on the old neighbourhood
Such were the grounds for divorce I know
While trying to restructure my character
I'm in over my head inside
Here's hoping all the days ahead 
Now who you gonna wave to
They want you in the front line
Shake, shake, shake, Senora, shake it all the time
In focus but at miles away
Then I started adding figures up in my head
And now I'm back in the city, I'm counting frick frick frick
Makes the world taste good
You've never been there before
But you never let me fall
Another day to give you all my love
Said no no no baby music cannot last
Oh, when you're sleeping on your own
Rolled a pair of dice in Paris that got me to paradise all safe and sound
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh Then what we've got is gold
Small town hearts of the New Year
The electric bills are staggering
I was wearing that dumb sweatshirt
She wasn't asking anything
Came to London town
So now I'm staring at the interstate screaming at myself
In our eyes we're falling
Around him
Oh and this year's for the brakemen
We are the kings and the queens of the new broken scene
'Cause I know, I know
I'll bring you down
Those sapphire eyes
Take those waters and settle 'em down
You'll notice the beat is gone,
He was in the habit of taking things for granted
Will this make our lives much better 
Say we'll be together every day
You know I didn't think I'd find you
Il ne s�en rend même pas compte à croire qu�il est bête
A standin' joker like a vocal oneliner
At least you got your nest and
There ain't that much room at the top
Oh, oh, I just can't think of what to say,
Wednesdays they are the worst
Nighttime is mine, and my eyes are wide at night
Your spirited friends, now a ghost town
And everybody wants us to stay with you
You're sure you wanna talk to me
To hold us back
And there we're gonna do baby
And I'm sorry that it shows, but life ain't so bad you know
If you have a hard time getting there
It's a dance floor now 
I spent it with you 
Lay beside you, hear you breathing
Let me through, paper and fist
'Cause you're there when you talk and you're there not to stop
Do you wish upon a star
Oh I will dance with Cinderella
But now I know this hurt is poison
But I think I'll stay stuck
You left your black gloves on my table
For just a card
Paper dreams honey, yeah
Timid advances with mutual regret
Tye dye O'er, I roll the dye, I coast, I dose, I
He's got a heart that will never never melt
Everyone, c'mon
I come home late and I love your soul
Move on to the next one down the line
The reasons for the tears
Who would've known the rain and the sunshine
Someone who never made it into my new life
When I look at you, you're so ashamed
The mother, the child, the tame and the wild
Out of which only twelve will make it back again
Floating in circles, there's more to remind 'em of less
Spoken Oh, let's hear it  Go on, Denis, let's hear it for Denis O'Bell
'Cause I am losing my mind
Lying in wait at the Birmingham Mall
I was wrong to string you along
'Cause every time I see your bubbly face
Can I get get get to know knknow know you better, baby Yeah Yeah Yeah x
No I don't feel like I'm falling down
Duck and I sway  what's my line
If you want me down, I will get really low
I've been running and running feels like my head is spinning round 
Success, success, success
Ooh, woo, oh It's the reason why my heart's been racing
Cause who I put my faith in it ain't no four leaf clover
With the lights turned up, it's hard to hide
Till the day you turn three"
While you're waiting for that sound
As his smiling face just shines away
Let me hear you say ooh
And we are height and seeking,
When the desert ends, I'll ask the dust
Get your gaze off tomorrow
Mixin' vodka with caffeine
Goin' faster than a roller coaster
April nd at the Avalon, you teased me
Years they, years they, years they 
As the people that you know
And we knew it was time to take a chance here
It's just an ittybitty little thing on my mind
What that window door went to
I can laugh it in the face
Whatever you do, whatever you say
Inevitably, well it still exists, pale and fine
I wanna feel so brand new,
And she probably lives in Tahiti
This is my face
A map of the roads they go down
My crowd of pals observed my fingers and prayed for the lunch I had hung
All my days inactive will be justified
To the liquor store around the corner
I found sunlight six hours away
Please don't go away
The light was on but it was dim
Weatherwise it's such a lovely day
Disappear in the world she brought
Aright or wrong
Moments in time
Been away for too long
Your footsteps in the leaves
What're you tryin' to say to me
Maybe I better stay in bed
I'll repay you in the end
She's got deep brown eyes
Hold music
"I woke up this morning out the door
I swear we're gonna get there
Sayin' this is my message to yououou
With the roar of cars and the lolling of the café bars
To get your attention
"Son this world's gonna kick you in the ass"
'Cause dumb is back
Helpless to the bass and the fading light
What's with these homies dissin' my girl
Where everything could change
Let me love you night
You and I go shopping and fall asleep inside the mattress store
I'll stop the world You've seen some changes and it's getting better all the time
Here they come
Are we breakin' up Breakin' up
To wander down that oneway road
Those certain words I just found
Ooh yeah, days when the rains came
I'm shot to the moon
Say shut your mouth you're in a fatal tiz
Va piè via dialetto guarda,
Every night on the way home
Walk a direction, see where we get
You'll hold the thunder while I bring the rain
But as I looked to the door 
Out of black paint,
And her daddy is an engineer,
If you've got something that sheds some light
I'll say it, I'll say it, I'll say it again now
I want her blue eyes start sayin' "Hi" and "Hello"
Huddled up with fear and hate because we know our fate and it's a lot to put us through
Stand back in the shadows and be a right hand man
And then you say
Just wait for me the night through make it on over
Why do I give jealous judgement
Touch the stars, for time will not flee
I tried to call you names
All about the dangling possibilities that keep turning in and turning out
In any season
I jumped so high I touched the clouds 
The scent was perfect in the dusk by the moon
Driving on the road again the Chevy's packed
To get out of town tonight
You know what I'm talking about
Hey baby
Believe that somebody like you'd end up with someone like me
Not knowin' where we're gonna stay
Michael J Fox was Alex P Keaton
Nostalgia's thick as the August air
Keep ya toes on the lively side
The landlord say your rent is late
As my eyes begin to close
I'm not saying you're not on my mind
You'll always be mine
Party like like it's the end of the World
He doesn't need a house
'Cause aI ain't the way you found me
All of this will end
My imagination, my imagination
Be happy 
I'm burning through the sky, yeah
And do nothing
Banging on the door
Everything you have done
Bailando Es que uno Sabe Que Sera Buena Amante
Terrified of telephones and shopping malls and knives
But everybody's going away
They say you gotta lose a couple fights to win
Pickin' up things we shouldn't read
It's me who's feeling strange
Safe in the dawn he gets under the sheets
And I don't know why but with you I dance
You look perfect King king king He looks perfect Fresh king
But if I could have my way
Your words are the only words
And I've trained myself to give up on the past
Carolinas, Virginia, Philly, come and ride wit' a G
They all get run over in petrol stations but they rock
Only for people with no real ambition in their life
I put all type a wholes in ya face black
Kulumani, Kulumani sizwe
Now I'm feeling left so dead
Keep it safe I know you will
That I'm a child 
He ducked back down the alley
Pulling the cord of mystery 
Better things are coming
Waiting on this for a while now
He came, he came to my bedroom
It's true, you'll know how it was meant to be
I'm packed and I'm holding
I was kidnapped real young by the sweet taste of love
We'd waste our weeks beneath the sun
DJ's spinning up my favourite song
Everything here is beautiful
And don't you know
I felt it in my chest as she looked at me
Hey, yeah
Hey momma, hey momma
That I kept it beneath my bed
We've got everything you need
I can't hear you baby,
Step into the corners, the darker colder corners fit best
That our love is true
Oh tonight he's not gonna come back home
'Cause I don't really need to wonder at all
Give love
He takes off both of his shoes
Somebody stop me
Word gets in the wind
With the sinking of the sun
Just grab the stuff and hit the door
And tobacco juice rolling down his chin
Don't try to work it out 
You gotta get rid of the more conservative habits of your mind Get rid of the mourning, you've got to have a real good time
Focused on the pain to see how we can get along
Every time I touch that track it turns into gold Yes, it turns to gold
Or take her for a spin around the town
I'm feeling alive again
All of her possessions gonna make her feel fine
Well it was cool, cool, it was just all cool
Something never quite so defined
But she's so beautiful it made me stay
To shut it all off and make a run for the door
Please come home
And suddenly everything is right
Yeah, we're alright though We're alright though
What are we waiting for What are we waiting for
That I like in a man
Slammed your fingers in the door
I just got myself to blame
And let me watch my soap
Who all know their limits and won't go too far
Your every day is full of sunshine
Can't stop thinking about you, baby
Without you by my side I just can't sleep
I was walking away,
And you get so high on the highlife pills
So come on everybody let's rock this break
The way that you kiss
Because you're bringing me in
Don't let your day grow long before it comes a week
You're making all time alright
You've got something I can't resist
Than a bit of advice
Please oohooh
Wish that I could step away and breathe
Steeple with its people spewing angels out their mouths and letting tables turn to charcoal in the lipstick and the lipstick in the evening oh no
That I have been around for awhile
John Boy in the barn with a horse in the hay
Gonna cut my water with a rebel yell
Well, I feel just like I do when I'm with you
I warm the engine compartment up
Singin', don't worry don't worry 'bout a thing
And you're someone who knows someone
For the right hand takes what it can,
She's got super power hips, for super reproduction
It knows no time, it knows no bounds
Can you stay up
'Cause it's nine in the afternoon
Well I could live in this town
Music is my brother
And I need you to help me put on my clothes 
It's a casual goodbye, goodbye
Just can't let her slip away
It's only right on movie night
If we forget the things we know
And we get better
Special guest Starks  Mark Ronson
"Do you really think she will wait for you"
I said aren't you the woman 
Call out these chains and get me home
Black shoes, white socks, no uh oh
The thing that I tell you now
Hey you, when I hold you in my arms
You can't just give it away
And plummet out of sight and sound
You've shaken me down
Com seu carro esporte
You never seem to see me standin' there
When they say give up
But we know it to be quite contrary
Past our muscles and our bones
Tell lies, tell dirty lies, tell diggory lies, until you're lying in his bed
Yeah we've been walking barefoot
Do you remember when the only thing that mattered was
You feel your dreams are dying
I figured out her number
She holds him, though, he probably won't remember it
You pull them out, feel they're changed
It's gone away
The sun's coming up 
But the snake it bit me
What would you think if I sang out of tune
Scattered in a thousand little pieces on the ground
Before I go back to the Heavenly Father 
I said how come
So wipe the sleep from your eyes
'Cause I've been on
I would go along with someone like you
And I turned my amp up loud and I began to play
It's just a matter of time, before we learn how to fly
Oh, bad girls get you down
We slept in parking lots
I've got to admit it's getting better Better
I'm so proud to know that she is mine
K  I  A is my faith departed
I'm tired of the fork in the road
The front page is all your pictures,
'Cause you are the light by which I travel into this and that
Same girl then, right now's a groupie
We'll be handinhand down in the park
Your dad's a boozer and you keep him alive
Everybody just hold hands
Bright and loud,
I love what you've done with your hair oh yeah
Ain't got no gal to make you smile
Oh Saint Jerome, I don't ever ever wanna be alone
How's your brand, new limousine
I can buy my own cigarettes
Any kind of monkey she wants to be
Alcohol under my breath
They'll never take my body from your side
My reflection just blends in to roads of gold
Everything is all right, now My computer
Well, I love you
To see the stars and heaven's journey flashing 'cross the sky
I bet her mama never told her why
The ride was short but my thoughts were long
To have something to hold
And it rips my life away, but it's a great escape
Ventura County line Inside, outside, USA
To know my stories I told are not true
So I'ma let you do the leading,
I don't understand it
Yeah, what do you think she got up to last night
There's a restlessness in me
'Cause happy boys and happy girls around the world
A hand over my mouth
And over the seas
And the music within makes me whole
And circle round once more
Now the party's on
Then you could lend a helping hand
Now see how the two colors blend, my friend
You did what you said that I did when I was gone
People are people regardless of anything
The feelings that I feel
Gathered around the quiet earth
And I'm so sick of hearing how your love for this has died
He would never cut his heart out for you
The tree it fell on all the people
We could fake our deaths to get insurance money
You're bad mood just ties my hands
I could tell how you pushed your foot on the gas
You'll let me hold your hand
Eh, yeah
And all of these spirit voices
When you love without desire
I'm ready for this, so darling, hold my hand
And wasted gasstation attendants
We've both been searching for
What was left now is right
Long ago in days of yore
But I'm in my bedroom
I got a mongo's dream, yeah, yeah
And while awake submerged
I could feel the alcohol inside of me hum
It's a long way, Nehalem, to let the water in
But he doesn't care
We'll be swimming in the sea of wisdom and serenity
Come on and work it on out work it on out, ooh
She don't know what you do
Young and old, be happy
He just woke and dreamt and ate and died
They carry the dust of the failing wisdom
Or changed by a potion
Yeah I think you're cute but really you should know 
And I read it to the man 'cause he couldn't read so well
When they're spitting in your eye
But I still froze when I saw the ghost
These walls don't stand,
I'd give anything for you to call me
Wash that sugar down
And wanting to give love another try
With dull knives and white hands
In the fields where I was in their company
Stuck me with a sickness
And sneak off to this island
Hey, I'm in love
Is six feet underground
You've seen the difference and it's getting better all the time
If you steal my sunshine
If my depression stood the wind
Cut it to the left and I rock
I'd love to let you go
I'm so glad that she's my little girl ooh
To unlock this mystery
You are the cover of my magazine
Oh, you've been playing nice,
Empty homes, plastic combs
Don't let the moment slip away
You wanna go for a ride
On a highway 
Now they're on the ocean floor coastin'
Come and show me the magic
She's my one desire
And all my friends
To see you eat in the middle of the night
Of the clouds begin to flow
We sit sidebyside in every class
I hope they didn't get your mind
To the bright side of the road
See the waves go down
Work it out baby sweat
It doesn't change our mind 
You will get the best of me 
Watch out we are rhythm bandits
I won't stop, won't stop won't stop the beat
I'll be loving you until
Cruising across town,
And dreaming of houses, none of them that I own
I'm starting to think that I'm kinda shy or at least I'd like to be
It's never been like this
I got cars, I got cribs among other things
The candlelight flickers
Sailing silver waves, through the skies and round your eyes
Welcome to the island of the honest man
Dim the lights
Your fickle heart's unwavering
But they tryin' to pull me back
Gum drops Anything you want
You're going to see how life itself 
Then you decide to take a walk by the old school
I'm shaking harder then I've ever shook before
And now we're free to be number one, the morning isn't far away
The sun keeps on shooting through pine trees
You'll be damned to pining through the windowpanes
It's the mess that feels so right
The confidence is full with your faith etched in stone
I haven't seen you in forever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, baby
Standing in the light now 
Just ease your mind have a banana or two
Molly is the singer in a band
You know you'd trade your life for any ordinary Joe
but there's a reason why the last is smiling wide and sitting higher than the others, 
Oh it is love from the first
We're gonna be alright, yeah, yeah
And we can dance
With a headache made in hell
And the next night I see you sitting over there with girl 
And you feel like there's no pretend for you
Yeah, we laughing like a Wednesday night
You'll sell your vinyl records
Why am I scarred from what she did to me
Yeah yeah Mmm
Get a handle of yourself, son
Take another heart through this lonely town
But it rings and I rise, wipe the sleep out of my eyes
And know everything's okay
There's nothing to see, show's over
Tonnight we have not got on well
And so the story goes
Now I count the hours until you wake
Hey remember that time I tried to save a pigeon with a broken wing
Even the walls start caving in
Tears land on a hand on a chest
Stay right where you are
Stating point of view
I welcome the sun
When you get old and start losing your hair
Dug a whole was so fun
I will be your lifeline,
On a business trip one day
And I managed to sleep alright
And they will haunt the streets at night
And even if we were it's not the scene you're thinking of
Been thinking 'bout the way you'll leave me right, here
Trying to get it through to my friends
And everybody knows you're a liar
To a strange and distant land
And carried away
And all the lines of your life
And the skin violin is where the neighbors wont read meals
I bought a paperback and want to go real soon
But frozen things they all unfreeze and now I taste like
There is no end to what I'm saying
Rush of excitement as he holds it in his hand
Sweet, sweet fantasy baby x
In every life we have some trouble
We both know how to drive
So fancy free, hey, but you say
Of these things behind the door
When the weather's fine
Oh, the sinking spell;
I believe in travellin' light
That may be all I need 
I'll stay forever
Come, come back to me, honey pie, ha, ha, ha
I still don't know anything about you
As life's most precious part
I sit in the window watching my days from a great distance
Her mind and bring me back to her place
So bored to death you held your breath
And balancing the whole thing
And when I come back to the room everybody just seemed to move
Heard you laughing behind your friend
With a torch and a Woman's Realm to keep you warm
I'm supposed to fill it up with something
Four days of the week
We've got to eat some of them
You know I hate to fly
But since your dad walked out, your mom could use a guy like me
This whole life is just overrated
I just wanna be touched 
'Cause we'll know just what they're thinking
You can have it which way you choose
You got a dangerous obsession
And he turned into a killer
But I'd rather make a song they can play on the radio
The steps he's needing to take
Its very funny to be a frog
I think the air is finally safe to breathe again
I'm falling to the ground
The feelings insecure
It's not you it's just all of the times I missed out
There's nowhere else to go, I hope that you'll stay the night
And I don't know how to love
No need to wonder why
I'll walk in that room and see your eyes opened so wide
And when you walk across the room
Well, we can do it better, yeah, I'm talking to you
Your hair And nothing more
We gotta party like
Wit' dreams of ownin' a records label, flippin' words
I learned how to keep my head 
You are a radar detector
We're holdin' hands in the rain
And know Matt Rouse and Jest are watching me achieve my dreams
Payback the camel, payback,
Why are my eyes filling up with these lonely tears
She gonna steal my money
Here I am, I'll take my chance
And nothing here's worth winning without a fight 
Look across the great divide
Everyone from the place
A baby king with a grown man's crown
You carved
It does me no good 
 years on the coast figuring out the weather
I replay it in the back of my mind
All this noise that you remove just
All the things I wanna say, and 
But just right now
Yeah, yeah, what I've got, full stock
In five years time, we might not get along
German Wine, Turpentine, Gertrude Stein
And in the pockets of the tide, a meeting place by night
Take my hand, close your eyes
Dance with me and we'll be all right,
It never does but who's to say at least my doctor gets paid
I can taste the tension like a cloud of smoke in the air
And it takes a road to go nowhere
'Cause when it's black means "watch your back" because you're probably
Underneath the moon
The way for us to change
Rumors say that you're very sorry
You talk of freedom don't you see talk of freedom
And a rock on the corner and a line full of fiends
We'll make the clock stop
And we're slow to acknowledge
The teachers that taught me weren't cool No I can't complain
Every time you call, you get so emotional
In the satin air
One of those was someone who knew you
When it's nine in the afternoon
Lazy sunny day
The mattress, the floozies Run from yourself, from your friends
Let you take me home, let you rearrange
Fact, you wanna turn back
And to my surprise my eyes were wide and already open
In every way, you know I just want you to stay
She laughs as she dances, her feet wake the flowers
That no one's gonna take your place
Come into my life
Walk with me, Suzy Lee
And there's more to this than acting my age
And everyday, it's changed since then
We sure are cute for two ugly people
But I spun around and searched no more
But they'll be bringing you the same old shit strife
Much too dumb for school and much too lazy for a job
Andy would bicycle across town 
Speed it up, or if you mean it slow it up a little bit just to speed it back up again
Bring the beat back
There is no thing that makes wanna settle down
I threw them all away
But he's gotta have the qualities
And if you're looking for a boy with a voice, well baby I'm single
Let's perform our favorite little scene, oho
And I can't help but back up when I think of what happens inside
Daydreaming, daydreaming all the time
If we make it to the final scene fake flowers
Won't you come pass the torch Bring your hands
I would rather stand if you stay
Say love Say love Say love Say love
There's times I need for you to phone oh
Yeh when we are together
It's getting so complicated
For you to be all mine
C'mon darling
Walk with me, crimson day
I count the days the Great Frontier
And everything will be okay
When I got there, she'd already rubbed it off
I'm in love with a girl, sees what you are what you are
Did he asked, if I would come along
She is love
Pass my way
Know Jade's the girl of the hour
It's a trip on a flip
Careful and steady
And it ain't me, it ain't you, it's only us, it's us right now
They rave and shout
That illiterate light
The ones with hearts on the outside
And you know
To help you through the hard nights like a flask filled with hope
Tell me all the things that I wanna hear
'Cause uptown funk gon' give it to you woo
It's you that I've been waiting to find
Alright
I guess I changed my mind
Give her up a song and then ask for it back
I am the black in the book
I'm a child 
One saw right through me
A lovely singing voice
So say all right
I shoot at a full moon  what's my line
What I do, think, or say
And don't tell me it's "just because"
And I wonder if your listening to what I'm thinking
It's your money or life, it's alright, it's alright
In his magical armchair
Kiss me slow and softly make me dream of you
I don't want nothing from you but to sweetly hold your hand
Soon I'll be feeling out so cold
Four beats from the party line
I know you understand
A finger in every country
Louder than it ever was
Smile at the man when you wake up in his bed
Now, you talk about your childhood wishes
You don't need this
All rejoice we are in her hands
In your hippy hat
One summer, a suicide
Shake shake shimmy
So stay with me and I'll have it made
I wake people up
With this sick tune, play it in the car
But way down underneath
Forever could even start today 
To spend my time missin' you
Is now it's getting so much clearer
It's the sell out show that no one wants to go to, yeah 
Lighten up, it's gonna brighten up
I'm living my life
You're tripping over what is wrong and right
I think about you day and night
Is a well, if you need
A Nolita fairytale Ba da da da da da, Ba da da da da da
'Cause I'm waiting for the moment to strike you back
It was such an important thing
It's a crying shame, that the love won't leave me alone
I will feel no pain and
Driving slow on Sunday morning, driving slow
So I sat with him awhile
You must always face the curtain with a bow
And all the pretty people party while the petty people pout
The position of the northern star
I'm not afraid to fall
That's what our love can do
The solemn warmth you feel inside of you
"Oh, don't you dare look back
Home among these mountaintops can be so awfully dull
Do you, do you, do you, do you wanna dance
Though nothing will drive them away
Oh dear, oh dear
What's left's so rare
We won't let the sun go down
And we'll pray, all damn day, every day,
Feel into the city
Ours is a family that's based upon tradition
It's for you I swoon
I'm sneaking out and making ties
And my chest it wears a singlet
Looked like a newlywed
mais ton regard de braise est tellement froid
So we would make it down with no claim on Ghost Mountain
Now the sun glows soft and red
He's never had so much fun
I'm coming clean, please don't let go
Now, I don't want you back for the weekend, not back for a day, no, no, no
So they ask me, why you call it "Late Registration" Ye
And I am a war of flesh and heart that's left undone
But this morning
Little brother's
I want the whole sea an endless cherry street
'Cause I sung songs spun stories loved laughed and drank wine
A star,
And I was wishing I'd break down your walls
But baby if he don't change his mind
Do you even know where it is coming from
Take your friends and move them out
Boom shak got two shoes for dancing
In a cage where only one thing could be free
Oh that's tremendous
It's really such a lazy way to be
When I saw you behind the corner you asked me
You're the best we've got going
Lead me to the land that you understand
Roger picks up a guiter and plays
And I know I'll only do this by
Where's the fun in doing what you're told
Sweetheart I'm telling you
I, I saw a girl in my dreams,
Get dirty, get clean
And in the morning time she makes me feel all right
Our stepmom, we did everything to hate her
Cheers to the husbands that tag along for good luck
It's something I will never do without you
It's not that I won't remember where I'm from
Then I know that it wouldn't be straight
The way that she let
I got it set on you
Oh, with a whimper in the place of a bang
With your grannyfied curtain designs
Got my heart, got my soul
I hope we're floating
Things were so good
When you're with me, baby, the skies will be blue for all my life
I saw the dark side of the moon
Only shootin' stars break the mold
Leave my door open just a crack
You and I left our troubles far behind troubles far behind
Butterfly, I don't know how it is you got inside of me
Just to hear about my day
Being grown up isn't half as fun as growing up
Who take the subway from their homes to their lonely nights
The hint of alcohol and nicotine it keeps us warm inside
Cover it with chocolate and a miracle or two
Just doesn't matter
You know I'll have it made
I thought was stolen
Hip Hop, marmalade, spic and span
I got peace in my heart
While I lay dying upon some bed
I'm thinking you're the girl I need 
You're holding me down Ah, turning me 'round Oh
And I remember the time my balance was fine
Her heels so high and my hopes so low
Smell the break of dawn
But I've got the fastest set of wheels in town
Oh make some big jumps, big jumps,
They don't think what to say
You better get here soon
I'll drive around all day and kill processed fish
Watch who's gonna get you back on the bus
No hope or love or glory
Because of alcohol, I've shared  beds
The pleasure with the pain pain pain pain pain pain papapapapapapain
She's got a super long tongue
Friends help you shift into a new place
Be my head and I'll be yours x
You're the only one I'm dreaming of, you see
We can see your troubled soul, give us all your money
Am I tripping for having a vision
And break them all if we're not havin' fun
To lead into the life we want
Bravely I look further than I see,
Angels "do you really think she will wait for you"
I don't want you back for the weekend
I need a simple space, and rest my head, and everything gets clear
What I want, you've got
I'm not harmonic
Woah, I say so
My hands were meant for somewhere else
The people in town now just wake up to see her for
The city is my jungle gym
And all of your troubles are dead and gone
You wear those shoes and I will wear that dress
The life she had
And sun sun sun all down our necks
So go make your mind up before our times up
Come and ride with a nigga right quick, a'ight
The cathedral of reason lets the bells chime
SFA  Hello sunshine
You got me and I got you
And the world
I've boarded up all the doors
I'm standing in the middle of town
They got the karma
I never thought you knew,
Said, I'm a believer, yeah
But you know she's getting something other
The sunlight rising over the horizon
I need a second chance second chance
It broke the heart of men and flowers and girls and trees
It will always be like this
Poor old Grandad
Oohoohhoohooooh oohoohoohoohoohoohooh
And we're alright though
And only one has the time right
As you step down from the podium
No no no no no no are you crazy 
And a prostitute with money spilling out her hands
Oh yeah, you make amy dreams come true
She's also saying I got low self esteem
You say, you say to everybody that you hate me
Doesn't that make you shiver; the way things could have gone
Never let your mother race 
And it's wonderful, baby
Drinking in the morning sun
And they pulled it out of my head
Hello, I've had you on my mind
Let me be the one to light a fire inside those eyes,
We'd be good, we'd be great together
With your own eyes
Into yesterday
Don't roll up when they're playing my song
And maybe be your baby tonight
Don't care about all the pain in front of me
Then I've been waiting for the fallout with history
By the time we hit the ocean we'll jump little girl,
It's not right, it's not right 
A little bit of Jessica, here I am
Give me a shot at the night
We both know I won't be standing still
Girl you blow my mind, you do
On the ocean On the ocean
I rock the Haro sport
A picture with a past, a future so vast
Well, you stood there with me in the doorway
But who cares where it's going
When we came inside
Buys a twenty carat golden ring rinring
Been tumbling down quick first right from the start
It's waiting just for you
Hold till my blues fade
Got nothing but funny money, man New York Dogs
But just before we left and started kickin' it
You're how I wanna be Just how I wanna be baby
I don't know where I am going
When you got that spiderbite on your hand
It all ends up the same
your eyes dilated as light plays upon the sight 
Ease my mind
Un p'tit air un air d'amour
That ghost just stop
And tell my friends I'll be around 
Waste my days Waste my days
I'll give you a taste
I knew this would be the part
Don't make me play pretend
We made a promise to never get old
I don't care if Monday's blue
Too late for you to say
Ohooh
Timing's everything
A superstar
Scared of a world outside
There's no need to complicate
Electronic world for every boy and every girl
But you kept my fast to the right, I want to thank you tonight
Go on, it's gotta be time
I should be over all the butterflies
When the sun comes up there'll be nothing wrong,
For to steal the secrets of the heavens
By the infinite parade of punk rock tshirts on
Good morning to you, I hope you're feeling better baby
I was happy by myself
And sometimes it takes more than a lifetime to know
As I'm wanderin' from town to town
Morning dreams come true
Hearts need a beat, like awake needs asleep
"What can I say"
Take a good look around you
And roll with the toppers
Stick with the imprints
And so it goes another lonely day
Honey, ah, sugar, sugar
Tuesday, Wednesday, heart attack
In the middle of the summer, or even twenty below
They wanna say there's a war outside and a bomb in the street
There's something about you
The sound of happiness
Every single line
Ikea selling furniture for college kids and divorced men
Close your eyes and I'll kiss you
To make the stars come out
Stacy's mom has got it going on
I need to
Like the moon and the stars and the sun
And I woke up beside the ocean
Always take a big bite, it's such a gorgeous sight
Nervous walks in a park
Don't break
Because you know
No stopping us
Rabbit in the hat yeah, so that's why I'm bringing
'Cause I found it but I don't know what it is
They don't play me on the radio
I can't walk through life facing backwards
Everything we should but don't
Cause there's nothing like seeing each other again
All those years gone by
I behold travellin' light
No one else could heal my pain
With rap dudes, thinking wow she moved me
Is this the last time my dear
You know your love your love keeps lifting me
As time alone stands still for some
You don't respect me, no girl
I'm happy on my own
And that's all there is to say
One thing for certain,
Chérie, chérie, comment ça va 
Darling, hold my hand
Someone tell me how I feel
Come around to this fine town
I'm in, I can't get off, I'm so soft
I knew it would be tonight
If this is what we've got, then what we've got is gold
You got me good
So why you gotta act like you know when you don't know
Ocean man
Everyone, be happy
Wasn't a rapper then I coulda got a pop deal
You can only find it in the jungle
You don't need poltergeists for sidekicks
I was tired, I was hungry, I fight
And incite the firmament's portrait of a drowning in Styx that gives impotents kicks
I've fallen for you
I feel them when you're gone
I wanna go home
Put your fingers in a mouth, and kiss it if it wants
If I'm wrong, let me know
That had ever hurt our feelings
You've got your headphones on
I got good at feeling bad and that's why I'm still here
You're going to crash, I'll set the bails in front of you
Why not dash your ugly boots on the fire and then dump charcoal
Because you could be better than that
It's true that you are touched by something
Build yourself around me
My day just got misted, 
I've come to embrace it
A chorus of car alarms, shoes on the powerlines
Don't let the sun be the one
Hey man, now you're really living
That is all I need
Pay them all back
Well look out, Sunshine, here they go
Then you moved on Woe oh oh oh
I'm waiting in my room 
Something's broken in the way we smile
He'd let us in, knows where we've been
A melody is like a pretty girl 
Lights turn on and dark turns up
Go to the shop, make plans to be leaving 
We know that something is wrong
I've got nothing to add or contest
In your light, just when I'm in your light
You are go to continue descent
I think I'm falling
ya Don't believe me just watch, uh
Perpetual feeling in the grown up world that's all 
I'll spread my wings and fly
She's so far away from crowded nights
Is coming to take you away
Think about the things were right
Is the day we've waited for, ah
Daddy Legs standin' tall he can do the funky lurch
Is gonna come to me early
If I had blood in my eyes
Oh, there'll be love love love wherever you go
We're conjuring the night
What a golden age,
So we'll just get it with no Edison
Do the whirlwind
el mejor de todos los tiempos come on
It's all right to show me
I'mma let you try to convince me to
Bursts are blocks, Stickle Bricks
Black as night on a summer day
Heyo heyo heyyyo So you say, "Yeah I'm all right"
And the brightness of day, I like the dark 
I'll come around and make peace
Bins up front
You just roll your window down and place your bets
Watching out the window
We sent ourselves in on the gray card scale
If you could take all the love without giving any back 
Now, it's turned into a cornfield
And they told me I don't need to worry
We can make love not war, and live with peace in our hearts
What did I miss back then
Now, it's only fields and trees
I tied it to the net, girl
Of what's become your life
Too late to think about it anyway
So I thought that must be a way
The fool, the drunk, the child, and his wife
Have you even considered
Ist da etwa jemand
I wish I knew, 
Yeah, reminding me
You'll be okay
In sickness and in health baby always be yourself
When that moon is big and bright
A killa for tha skrilla, Nigga, Best not be stalkin'
And this ain't the place for me
But it's hard to form a good opinion
I was asked to improvise
Because it makes no sense at all
In regards to the last word
Maybe I can meet you in the morning
The time is passing by, I still want you
She was an alcoholic artist
I wish I lived in the Golden Age, giving it up on the Broadway stage
I'll be by your side till the very end
Get these mutts away from me
But I don't wanna come on too strong 
Attic in a basement
The people follow the signs
From the point I've come from
I'm leaving you tomorrow, but she already left, she already left me
Strange powers
I believe that I hear them say
Yeah, my heart needs a polygraph
And the way they move and the way move their hands
So far away I wanna be
But you know you know that I must
Everything is looking up, everybody up now
Sleeping in until your father's shaking you down
Casual we ride, we ride
Always be
When you're with me, baby, the skies'll be blue
Kinda like an Injun without his fire water wine
That's where I spend my time
We're going and I'm never knowing never knowing where we're going
Tu tienes pila y loco haciendo cola
Then everybody'd be surfin'
Giving it up, now you're taking away
"Boys like you are overrated" So save your breath
There's a good wind to blow me home
You found a girl that you could truly love again
Like a ball and a chain
I would, do you catch my drift Yeah PreChorus 'Cause I would go the distance for you, baby
Am I breakin' up Breakin' up
You got what you want
'Cause I couldn't really stand it, I'd admit that I was wrong
But to surrender I just wept and regretted this moment I don't know
It's the best of world's feeling, like nothing can go wrong
She's a frozen fire
Just because we use cheats doesn't mean we're not smart
It's fine by me 
The way they did to others
Some people change lovers like they change their sheets
Fake funeral
I know won't desert me
Whose that guy, I don't know
I don't care if its right
Hannah takes the stairs
It's got a CD player
Everything I knew, why didn't I feel
Why don't you come on over
There's a million lies burning brightly just like fireflies
You bought a new bag of pot, said let's make a new start
Say something and I'll feel alright
So I've arranged for your phobias to be performed by a string quartet
And the dry, cracked, trembling lips
'Cause then she might be happy, no longer lonely
I drive around a bit 'cause work isn't very far
Selling subtleties in cities 
Oh Great River, green with envy
I hope it lasts forever
To find opportunity you should give yourself to me
Below sheets where dreams are made
How good it could be
Something I can't define So let's
Fly it on out like an eagle in a sunbeam
I woke up with the rising sun
'Cause it doesn't matter anyway, yeah woo hoo
I'm gonna stare into the sun, stare into the sun
New York niggas is foul, we body sling shit in the val'
But don't take those pills your boyfriend gave you 
If the trials at hand are really getting you down
Weeping in a tropical moonlit night
I had a dream so big and loud 
There's something taking over my heart
Rocking in the dance hall moving with you
It starts in my soul
But they all figure the only way he make a fortune cruise
It's been a long day and there's still work to do
With an uptown girl oh
A few pairs of socks and a door with a lock
Say you mean it, seal it up, say you wanna try
And in the morning you'll know all you know
Because once we hit the top we've just begun
You've got a heart of gold
You walked out when I asked you to stay
Woke up in London yesterday
But I still have just one more question on my mind
Michelle Pfeiffer, that white gold
And I knew the world was over
This is where it's at six in the morning
Told me not to take it to heart
This room is a, a fluorescent tomb it's brazen bulbs mimic death's heina croon
Of the life that's breeding in the dirt
Everybody drinks on me, buy out the bar
Will you share them with me
Amusement or treasure
I'm watching all the clouds drift by below me
Drift away and die
All I'm askin' is for one little chance
Except everything you had and what was left after that, too, oh
When they say they think they know exactly so 
Still, I've got miles to walk from the cape along the coast
From your house to my house to the Mews
And love is not the answer if you're taking me for a ride
In a tree
Blood stripe falcons
Everything that I wanted in you
It keeps turning in my mind
And you can be anyone or just some mother's wasted son
So save me here 'cause I can barely stand
I don't trust my fingers, I don't trust my tongue
We're just looking to fit in
'Cause I can't recall a better day
Don't you love in vain
'Cause they gon' judge me anyway so whatever
We'd get so drunk that we can hardly see
You look as strong as you did before;
Never had a battle with my bulletproof vest
Clutching your soul to the toll of the blight
My heart beats out of time
You know I gonna be right there behind you
You're so fine
Ugly trends and pickup lines
So you gave me your wings
Let's not nothing a gallon flawed
The Candy Man can 'cause he mixes it with love
'Cause life here in the states has escaped
I am all out of love to mouth into your ear, 
Soon they're gunna know
Far as the eye can see
What's the point of worryin' about being cool
I say the same thing twice, I'm awkward when I speak
Won't somebody help
You've agreed to give me everything
Leaf by leaf and page by page
A sock hop beneath my bed
We're Taking It Slow
That always cries when it gets some sleep 
I've got my baby
If we show up, we gon' show out
And that clock up on the wall was tickin'
I'm on the edge of something shattering
No more wondering where I belong,
Baby, then there wouldn't be a single thing we couldn't do
And I pretend it's you by my side
Look up the number 
Where I've built too many walls
If everything you want is free
I got you spinning 
Another rainy day, we're trapped inside with a train set
It's a little bit you
But I'm still the king of me
It all falls apart
Start another fire
I, I needed, I, I, I needed someone to talk to
He showed me the low, showed me the down
You can touch, you can play
Baby I'm in love and maybe it's not to tell
We'll make it better make it better, we're here to welcome you
I'm going to get you out of my head  get out
And if you held me, would you let me see that part of yourself
Get back here, yeah
Paint every insignificance a sign
I feel positively filthy standing next to you
Gotta do my hair, put my makeup on
I need another
Simon No more riding on my love
When passion turns into greed
And you were looking so cold
So if you're playin' in a rock and roll band
Well, everything I've done
She had rings on her fingers and bells on her shoes
You came around
But I might move in" and
You are what you lean on
Person 
Crowning of the cool kid queen
Drives me away
I know that it's time
Inquisitive mind, you're destined to find
I wish all the pretty girls were shaking me down
Cause girl we're good together
Buzzin' in my brain
Wow didi didi I just had to look
Is all about the wordplay
You've come to pass
Yeaheyeaheyeaheyeaheyeah, yeah, yeah 
If you stay gone
I would like you to dance birthday
With that on tv you just don't care
Act like monkeys in a row
A dozen point the other way
Don't let me colour your opinion
Into your beautiful garden
Fed to the rules, and I hit the ground runnin'
Make me walk, make me talk, do whatever you please
But when we were kids
She had several hours to find a place to stay
And I say
Oh, baby, I'm down down I'm really down
And I hate looking like a fool 
Yesterday you told me 'bout the blue blue sky
Looking out on Coney Island
And it's waiting for me
We are the tourists in the cafes
So stand up
Of that guitar and the bass
Big band
To the river so deep
Sing it out loud, on a trip back honey
Both can't be right
Now, yeah
And cut out a door
It was a hospital
You'd see 'em wearing their baggies
Set 'em all on fire
I'm overflowing with ambition, but I got to keep in mind
And the kids on the corner playing ghetto games
Never wanna stop at all
Suck my menthol feeling fresh all night long
Why can't I sleep at night
About everything
I can dream realistically 
I want somebody new
On a moonbeam
All all I need,
Now I feel silly
All this love saved up for nothing
It's never too late to start living
He's got a dirty mind, just don't know what you're gonna find
And in the morning and the afternoon
Dreaming of someone else's wife and kids kids and wife
And it's always sad to go, but it's never that sad,
Couldn't you have stayed on your feet
You talkin' double
Sleeping to dream about you and I'm so tired
Oh yeah Well
Magic City, New York dogs, Rolex
Everything we could but won't
Would it take a half a pound to roll a joint for you
I whistle down the wind
There are times every now and then
Perfect in so many ways
I've tried to cut these corners
But all the news reports recommended that I stay indoors
Heart is pure and thoughts are clear Love, release our mind
Everything worked out at school then
Join our group and you will find harmony and peace of mind
Don't let it go
Call you up If I should call you up, invest a dime
Leaving me alone in the broad daylight
Maybe you got room to spare
Our hearts will spill, over you, over me, over this
You remind me of a former love that I once knew
Fly away to what you want to make
I'm happy for you
A smile I've bought
Wherever we touch back down
I'll make it to the show
Are only taking space up in our heads
You get so high you can't come down
A timeless flight to reach the stars
Knock me off my feet
Make our break to our star bodies go
You I see Will see My dream Your dream for real Come true
I saw your wife the other day
It made such perfect sense
From thinking
I was told
Flowers and the love in my arms
When I'm driving around, you are a radar detector
Yours and mine
But love is blind and you soon will find
Have sun clear blue skies
So you've been going out for years and I'm sure that you've been happy
Everything that I broke till my feet went numb
I'm all about the wordplay
But I wanna talk to you
You make the whole world wanna dance,
I don't want to get up oh
I don't dare to think of you
Your fly was drownin in some bitter tea
My tears turned into butterflies
Oh, this love is make believe
We could drift all night until the new sun rise
And a nice drive in the country
Some plans were made and rice was thrown
Oh baby, don't stop me now I'm having a good time
See my life come undone
Never get enough of you
No she don't know that we've been up all night
So keep it it up, quench my desire
Now I'm in a movie seen as a star
Wondering will you call
Because the remedy is the experience, this is a dangerous liaison 
Now back when I was just a boy, you know
I'll admit I was short on luck
CCCCounting sheep, if only sheep could put me to sleep, oh
There's flowers in my house and I bought them myself
Some guy wrote 
They gave her a mirror so she could talk to a face
We've gotten quiet for it's last precious seconds
I talk a lot of shh when I'm drinking, baby,
Screen falling off the door, door hanging off the hinges
Release them for a while
There's dancing
But I'm not a roll of Charmin so don't give me no crap
Who can take a sunrise
The sun is hot in the sky
I know nothing can tear us apart
Happy birthday to you
Bitter after all these years
Happy, happy Bring me down, I said
Childlike, no one understands
Your precious love, uhhuhhuh
I know why, I know why
How does it feel in my arms
Seems like we traveled for days though we vanish away
What my mama and my daddy said was real
Well, it's all right, even if the sun don't shine
I'll take second place just to end the race
Sneakers looking fresh to death, I'm loving those shell toes
You are my jetstream lover
Behind the shelter in the middle of the roundabout
Whoa, ooo yeah
I know you feel it too
Getting closer to your butterfly
I'm waiting, waiting for nothing
In the dark we are without a light
But right now, my time is theirs
Like lipstick traces on pillow cases
I only wanted to reach out and touch you
Like a shooting star, he shines
I think I'm falling in love with you
With a new portfolio
When Jesus washed
Ain't no thing I can be lugubrious with you
Now there's a majesty at, my doorstep
Just clap your hands But I have no money
Of ages and battered books and
Looks so good, good, good
And the way you kiss keeps me hanging on
Everybody gonna dance around tonight
On and on and on and on and on and on yeah, yeah
We will rest upon the ground
Now I'm locked inside a stall at the cantina
"Yeah I know, I know it's wrong but I can't be bothered to pay,
Told her from the start,
You like the adrenaline rush
You taste like sweet wine
Started crying and I couldn't stop myself
You know you wanna
To your golden age where your crown is shining bright
You know the way it works don't be afraid to ask
And soon it would come into focus
He don't want to sell his life to you
She loves me again
Got peace in my soul
Who cares if it's the dumbest in the world 
Now it's the th hour of a twoday night
Because you look so lonely
That feeling when you don't want to leave
Dance dance dance dance dance dance yeah
Still you act like a man who is cross with every woman he's never had
Trust me, darlin', come on, listen to me
You are looking at the working week through the eyes of a gigolo
Oh, oh, I love you so
When it's time to get ill
I still wear these worn out jeans
Wasted days
And when she's walking, she's looking so fine
You didn't RSVP
If you hold me
Ills, man
Let me in your love it's sticky when we touch
I always think now when I'm with you
I know the world's not fair to you
Tttttthings are never gonna be quite what you want
There's nothing in between
And my life with change
And when I ask you to be mine
One night of love
Listen, I don't really know you
 I heard you got to the top this year
And I remember there was a radio 
Every little thing gonna be all right, don't worry
To get away from it all
I know you'll get me, know you'll get me through
As I was walkin' by
All poison and thrills
There is no need to be afraid
He'd thank God it's Friday
Do I really wanna know
Oh, someone warm like you
When they're messing with the dreamer
I'll stop the world I'll stop the world and melt with you
And I'll lay next to you in that grave side by side
"What's the day What's you doing How's your mood How's that song"
He said, "Hey, sister, it's really, really nice to meet ya"
He condescends to read the words I wrote about him
A thousand years in one piece of silver
Composing their songs of love 
Like you rewrote a essay for a class
So I live my life like every day is the last, last, last
Running down into the spring that's coming
And you can know it all
We're never gonna differ 'cause we know it's true
What you believe and what you dream 
Now I'm feeling drunk and high
But I'm out in the cold
With the one thing that brings light to all of my darkness
History begins with you and I
But the pretty girls don't look at me
By the eyes were ears and the arms are
Until you find your man
Forget about it, don't let it get you down
And we couldn't have even done this if it wasn't for you
I've had the deepest rivers
Try putting your armour down, oh 
And all I said was "Someone get that girl a mood ring"
It's a beautiful new day
Let's not stop
It'll help that soul, a little help may do some right
I don't want to give you away
And now I know
That I get
Tonight our song will find it though
A kind of love that reconstructs and remodels the past
Drink cider from a lemon
Put up with me then I'll make you see
A flick of light and wonder
Can't see no person there
So, so I need it too and
In my city, eh eh eh
I'll say nothing on your microphone
They said "I hope that you will never change"
It brought me back to life
We used to play outdoors
People on the street now
What you got
The motley kids and ugly cast
Left his house at midnight
Find that clip I been lookin'
Choke, choking on a wishbone in the firing line of lovers who will never slow down
Backwards through the megaphone
Bring it back
Home sweet home,
What you see is what you get
Height and seeking
And baby, you'd better believe 
So I got it made
It's just another rainy Sunday afternoon
And she keeps calling
It's okay with me if you don't have that much to say 
It don't matter if you're by my side At the end of the line
We seek out the taciturn
But I didn't feel them change
Monday, I'm all high
He didn't believe her but the boy revered her
Walk down streets
I met a man
They are tangled up in the light
So feel the air, feel the air,
And will you get over it this time
I'll be dancing with myself
Because we're together
Felt the strangest sense of satisfaction
Don't blow me away
I thought that you were standing over me
Zero chance of rain,
Don't stop me, don't stop me, don't stop me, don't stop me
I could run but I'd never
There's plenty space to encase
But you know just what to do
She is Supergirl, Superwoman, Supersexywomannnnn
It is the gold, the green, the yellow and the grey
But I think about you everyday
You misunderstand me,
Oh I wound around you for miles
And posters take the walls away
past the silver bridge
About the state of the world today
Pay no mind what others think
Come tomorrow I'll be on my way back home
Well if I lived in Spainland, they'd still be Chinese children
Where everybody's hanging out just like they hung out before
When you say you never
Or retreat to the bottom of the sea
Climb the fence, books and pens
Hey brother, do you remember when
Oh well, it's safety dance
Ritalin's never gonna feel the same
Whenever you come back, I'll be waiting
Is taking my hand
I feel it too
I'll stay if you're gonna keep me in line in line
We take life slow
Swore upon the sun I'd save you for a rainy day
All the time while you're looking away
And you'll always tape the football
It's gotten so bad, there's just no more anger
Well I packed up all my things
She's got super human thighs,
Underwater you and me
I'd turn it off for this
But all you say is we're all spinning
I never let you go
You, evening virgin cotton nymph
I can't recall a better day
If I smile with my teeth
Little bit of love
Your name into the wall
Honestly, why are my clothes out on the street
But we're alright though We're alright though
Beat beat of the song song
Will start to show
Should have watched my step
When I wanna stay x
I saw your face in front of me
Anyway you want the truth is
And the feeling of the wind in your face can lift your heart
And I think it's fly when girls stop by
I be filmin' her friends too, hit 'em back on that
She's looking through me
You can't hold back
I Got a woman, way over town
I see the way the wind blows
A higher, higher power
Everything I can arrange
Please repeat the message
We're flying through the night
And you'll get nowhere
Sie sagen ich hätt' Power und wollen alle meine Tracks loben
You're driving me crazy, when are you coming home
Don't you hear that rhythm
Good life
Hey, remember that other time, when I would only read the backs of
But does the heart grow fonder
Try the river boat, the carousel, feed the pigeons, BarBQ
You are not my kind
Tired dogs rest their paws
New heights and seeking
It's this one thing that caught me slippin'
But the one you'll always be
Into oblivion through sticks and stones
There's every good reason
Meet me halfway
When I wanted sunshine I got rain
I climbed the hill, I wanted to look down on you
The rust and the rain endure
The golden dance life could be
Thought you'd want to hang for a while
Come and kick it with me for a minute, you know what I'm sayin' King of the South
Shall we stop, let's stop
This time is yours, this time is mine
But no, none of it's true 'cause I never knew you
I'll bail you out again, I've got the readies
Well, we all shine on
Acting like a bad bad man
Pretending that everythings cool
Maybe it's the answer I've been wanting in disguise
How do I get it back the way it was before
You lay there naked upon your back
Then you come and I feel better
It's uncomfortable to see I give it away so easily
She's got super human thighs
Ah, and my hair is growing long
Make it up and then let's move on
Can't get over your love
I must misread what the good book said
There are so many things I can do, just like falling in love with you
You can feel them on the rise
Bandages, bandages, bandages
When I kiss you
And couldn't you've stayed on the ground
Well, I don't know where I'm gonna be next
I just wanna be your girl, yeah
Built a fondness for things that just weren't good enough
And don't sit crying over good times you had
Looking for treasure
And they, they just roll their eyes
I've been waiting, I've been waiting, wanna know if you'll wait for me too
My shattered mind across the borderline
Ooh, you'll stay the night, Ooh, yeah
You're thinking 'bout your mother way too much"
I only say it 'cause I care
Good men come to those who wait
Is it true looks could kill Is it true looks could kill
Now I know what I mean
They never sleep, they never will
Take a good look
Your embrace was my air
Well, I got all this time to be waiting for what is mine
She said don't I know you
Oh, I keep feeling older
I throw my fear around
I wanna hold you close but I never wanna feel ashamed
Hold your head high and reach the top
Let's get a silver bullet trailer
Forever when time runs dry
Dance a little stranger show me where you've been
So maybe I should stay and map around your world
We all need something,
Hey, you talked to Mark lately
And eventually you'll finally get it right
I fell behind on my nightly fourcourse meal of rainbow pills
Well it's gone, gone, baby it's all gone
'Cause you make me feel
Used to be in my backyard
'Cause you can't put the life back into this hospital ward
This way I feel that she's always with me
Sometimes dreams are all you got to keep you going when the day gets long
We cruise crippled in someone else's shoes
Never running in the streets, leaving me all alone
I look up to the sun, it only hurts my eyes
And I've got nothing left to lose
So baby drive slow 'til we run out of road
So I could steal into the night
All our broken plans I will mend
And dreams of splintered sounds
Slot machines, dingdingdingdingding, when they ring off
I wish the rockets stayed over the Promenade
Said, 'There's no sex in the champagne room'
And no two are alike
Disappearing
You pick me up when I'm feelin' sad
Everything you say is right
Baby if it was me well I wouldn't think twice
And they'll blow up, we know that without a doubt
'Cause the love, the love, the love, the love, the love
I take you on a trip
Up one more flight
I'll enjoy the still for a while 
I couldn't wait to meet
Strolling so casually 
When I look back on what I done
They realized there was a hole in the boat
But all her looks were too sad
Gotta hold myself down
If life seems jolly rotten
Beneath the wormwood, ooh love me so good, they won't hear us screw away the day
You're thinking, "Christ,
Love will clean your mind
Seasons come and go 
Chinese homeruns over the backstop 
The years have been turning on
An easy girl to love
And all I say is I don't wanna say good night
We talkin' bout  million dollars here, this ain't Playdoh dough
Face down on the ground
In fact, there's nothing I can't be
Damn right, you got me good
The sequence of a life form braised in the sand
And I could take her out the next day for pretty much free
So it's your job to dance and smile 
See the Buddha on the second floor
'Cause she's the one makes me feel this way
Well I wait so long
In the hope of saving me 
So get on up and let your body sway body sway
Bandages bandages bandages
Who said it was time, time to take, take love
Now she's gonna make it out ok, but she's shaking like a revolution
I hope we can still be friends
No rhyme no reason no job no class
The floods and fires might be coming through,
It's nothing wrong with perfect and perfect
I'm gonna save a million songs for you, so I hope you enjoy it
Why would I test my faith Oh why would I
When she warned me what people say
Talk about me, and we'll only talk about me
What I want to say
What you behold is no longer a word, no longer a word
They've got us pinned terribly
Clearly I am a passerby but I'll find a place to stay
Who on Earth d'you think you are
A thousand ways that I can hurt you
She shoots colours all around
This one is good
Let's stop the world You've seen the difference and it's getting better all the time
Sometimes it ain't no simple drop in the ocean 
I'm an Alka Seltzer that's right you're a seagull
Since I've seen that smile
"I quit, you you m I didn't I didn't make it all the way through that"
And you will always have my heart
See my eyes they're full of water
I can't walk right
I wouldn't put much stock in fact 'cause the fact is
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart, now
Music is my boyfriend
Don't shrug your shoulders, lay down beside me
When will the weather ever let us go
Get down, get down, get down
Maybe it's because I've finally found
I feel it in my soul soul 
You're my favourite book
No I can't control it
Where did you go now where did you go
So let's make a list of who we need
And two to three minutes don't seem that long
I bet her feet don't even stink
It makes the world go 'round and 'round and 'round
For time is a river rolling into nowhere
The winter would hold no spring
We walk the city,
It will some day let you down
More times that I get it right
The more I learn, the less I know 
She's got super human eyes
Because if I could have my way
Oh, just fooling around
Souls are lifting only dreaming
There was a little old lady who was walking down the road
A noise comes from behind 
We always have to wait
Yes I could live in this town
Like a ghost town, I've found
Just put your arms around me, tell me everything's OK
It's the sound of her verbs
Gonna be a bright, bright sunshining  day
But what does it change
I see my body shake, it's tensing up
Flew to my heart
From ocean to sky, summer and fall
I wouldn't even if I could pretend
Some are collectors
Don't be scared of what you cannot see
I hear you calling,
We won't look back,
That's why you get tired so fast of everyone
I cried myself to sleep last night
Pay the monkey back
There's a Saul, there's a Chip
Come on, come on, and the world's a little brighter
See, I'm gonna draw up my lipstick wider than my mouth
Ariella, , I don't want to go to sleep
But there's a power
I was still in love
No you can't control it
Deep in her eyes
You've never earned your soul
She heard about a place, somewhere she could go 
We all have a story of adolescence and all its glory
Disturbed real sad
Now it's day, I've been trying to get that taste off my tongue
Just a kiss, he won't miss
Brand new shoes, walking blues
I can stay
But youth�s taken over by rock and roll
And we can dress real neat
You're making everything inside
And I ain't need nothing else,
Tapered jean girl kills me
What was my number What was my number I don't care
Took her home and nearly made it
You holy rat rattlers, holy found fathers
At least I won't have to keep faking
With a couple of kids running in the yard
I'll be there in a while
'Cause it's your heart, it's alive
The happy times together we've been spending
I sang along while I was swinging
Are falling down and nearing the rose beds
Won't you come home
Once or twice I've been on the floor
Take it slow, oh yeah you never know
I have been waiting, I have been waiting for you
Express yourself, click your fingers now
You were waiting
Yeah, I feel so down
Now grab each others' hands, get on up;
They'll never know we're in here if we don't make a sound
The way black is black
When I was only seventeen 
, , , woo
Screaming someone shoot me
Wanna come over tonight
I got some troubles but they won't last
How can you live with that
But all I see is films where a colourless despair
To a place you and I
I know you're young, but you're out of touch
Kelly says she could have
We're holding back our tears
Unkissed boys and girls of paradise
It's like a power
I met you in the dead of winter
Images I imagined with pretty imagery means you and me
If we've got to burn out, let's do it together
An' all the boys they go
The bright lights might say your name
And I knew without asking she was into the blues
Not unless you stay
And we sleep all, sleep all day, sleep all, we sleep all day over
A king who's still in the news
In the morning when you awake, let's disappear
All that matters is right now 
Take you today
The light below is bright on top
Hustling the latest changes to the book that's the strangest in an attempt to multiply
We're gonna take your breath away
You've got it, you've got it
Oohoohoohoohooh
I wonder if you're gonna wait for me
Success, success, success is over
You've got to have eyes in the back of your head
It's safety dance
Oh sweet angelangelbearded face
That she's seen love
Forget all your politics for a while
The cars are moving like a half a mile an hour and I
Notice how your every look gives me tingles
I guess that's just the way it be
And the big bright lights INEQUALITY FRANCHISED
Move like you really wanna be number one
That dreamy look in your eye
Open hydrant rolled down windows
In five years time, we might not speak at all
I'm tryin' to help you out so can you stop being a twat
And still I chew it up and spit it out
Does it rain where you are Does it snow
I stare, seems like I don't care
You don't believe, and your grievances show
The things you know 
If I am good to you
You could eat off the floor,
A place for everything in the house
And I gave it to you in a paper bag
The desert is the sand
You might lose faith in wealth
You gave me love and took it away
Just want a way of keeping you inside
Why didn't I dare
All you can think about is breaking free
Love for those who gotta watch tha hater's rollin' bubbles
Put it in your heart where tomorrow shines
Yeah, you make me merry
All of our feelings, 
Oh, I knew when you first said hello,
My cellular, bananular phone
Come on, Barbie, let's go party
You won't have to strain to look into my eyes
As we land, you pinch my hand
When the radio just plays on anyway
I close my eyes and here it comes again
Live while you can
Ooh, did I tell you I need you
I've come alone
I've already had your kind
And dancing
Cause everyone thinks they've got a new phrase
Fourteenth street, booze and swallow
And I stepped outside and smoked myself a J
I say
When she wind up, she bottom, she go like a rocket
Where's my wife and family
Sick of playing my part
Then we'll see who's kiddin' who now
So my hips can swing, so my head can nod
Hey, you, sittin' in your tree
You don't dream for me
You and me it will always be
A lifetime full of words to say
That's when love burns
You should tell your gathering friends
I guess there's just a part of me that likes to bring you down 
I'll make it stay when I will save it
Everything was fine until membership lost its privileges
Now everybody wants some presto magic, magic, magic
And all the people on the island they all want to show why they sing,
And bring it all back
These are some good things that I found
Stardust and high class scenes of popular teens
Coming, colours in the air
And if you wanna lose the rest of the night
She smelled like sugar and spoke like the sea
I hope that you don't think I'm unkind
We're finally intertwined
In front of a dirty doublemirror they found me
And I can't help until you start
We get farther away in the blink of an eye
I know she got a ring on her toes
I'm the center of attention in the walls inside my head
I'm feeling all right, I'm with my boys, I'm with my troops, yeah
You can talk about Cha Cha
Problem with saying goodbye
Young love dead
Think hard woman
Is right there now in her home
You've got my secret combination
Ten grand, let me see you shake it like you got no
Jessica numbers tell me if we're clear
It's just my Japanese cigarette case,
Last ones to laugh pull the trigger here on the run
The messages on the tablet
Then what makes love the exception
Yeah, I've got nothing at all
Spending someone's hardearned pay
I could not crawl back if I tried 
That's a good idea
So just lick your lips
Aggressors are in their places,
Music is my kingsize bed
I kinda, I kinda, I kinda like to be the president
Right everybody
We don't need no secret code
Well, that all depends what you qualify as friends
Always on the movewe heard that business will boom if some people are removed
So hold up and take it through the night,
'Cause you know
Then both of you'll get practice"
I know you love to rub a dub with a thug
And stupid words keep falling from my mouth
Bedspread bandit since '
Blind to the evils you give them no sight
And had it nailed to my forehead again
Then put it all together
But sometimes I forget
Strangers' silence makes me wanna take the stairs
Would I see the world the way I do
Let the sun shine
I'm walking till the break of dawn
There was no trace on him,
When I'm in pieces you pick me up and put me together
I was thinking of not growing old, forgetting and forgot
What makes you not care
Wear a tall hat like a druid in the old days
And get well cars to the hostage vans
You're playing with your telephone, you're playing with your hair
Make me very very happy
But there's a few things more beautiful than Fall
Oh whoa whoa whoa, way oh, way oh
And my dear dear dear Khalana, I talk too much about you
Me far away from my wise Senorita
"Hold on, hold on to your old ways
She's just sitting in her room reading books about UFOs
And if we're near or far from our city by the seaside
'Cause love only gets you down
I remember what I had
Came down upon her head 
It seems you plan to stay
I can't sleep
Because you looked just like a girl,
But are you mine
Well there's an ideal inside of me
To turn your world around
But I was up in the velvet goldmine
I feel it now, I hope you feel it too
Now people send me emails that say thanks for saying the things they didn't know how to say
Couldn't this be the moment you discover my intentions
He'll find me fighting back a terrible force
Shouldn't talk about it
That you always give out
All the riches one could dream
A pallbearer aboard took me to the giant tire swing
The rhythm hit, it got my movement off the ground
Ya' take a holiday, is this what you want
Let's see what needles do
Don't push it baby
Yeah, the world was still in my backyard
But come right here, I swear I'll never let you go
If I know one thing that's true
To the light
That you are blessed and lucky
Still I'll take care to see
Away we go Away
But you could be waiting right here for a day that won't come
Feels like the world's at stake yeaaaaa
She rises up like a yawn, grips my heart like a claw, splits apart like a jaw, like an eye
Oh, yeah OoooooooMr Postman
There's a sword in your side,
No you can't, you can not know
Caught up in the things that everyone wants
Just my imagination My imagination
Feels like we've already waited to long
The free world
If you break my dick, I won't break you're balls
How I've hacked at our southern hemispheric eleven gods
The colors of the rainbow so pretty in the sky
Welcome to the human race
Go ahead and take the town
Before I met you I wasn't terribly lucky
Everyone who sees him says, "Eww"
I cannot find the way out of here
And clarity turns to dark, blindfolding prisoners of war,
But that's when the feeling hits
I'm gonna be the man who goes along with you
Helicopter, helicopter let your long rope down
Something I'd never lose
And when I see ya walking down the street
So I can see if I'm inside
Free, yeah 
And I got troubles oh, but not today
This is the way you left me Oh, I feel as if I'm wastin'
Bought JayZ's CD with my own cash, man
But I don't know what I've been waiting for
Nothing will come from nothing, you know what they say
Giant heart, down in this dust
Life, oh life, oh life, oh life, oh life
Lies, lies and propaganda
Was planted deep inside your bag
Your heart got broken,
I'll be the one to hold the gun
Lose all your heart,
Under green moons
I'll still change my underwear if that's okay with you
You will come down too soon
I am walking in my sleep
Stop climaxing, you got your fight
Don't you know that Rome wasn't built in a day
Single in his bed somewhere
I try to find a set of chords, but you know how long that takes me
The boy in the corner
I breathe in every particle
Interchange plazas, and malls, and crowded chain restaurants
Who knows soon your spit will land on Mars
Leave the bright blue door on the whitewashed wall
Just holding you and gazing into your eyes
In the morning call from a roadside telephone
Like athletes of the afternoon 
For a holiday romance
Hit the redial, maybe we should sigh a while, save our second wind for sentimental warm weather
As long as, as long as, as long as we can live in harmony, yeah, yeah
And someone's home 
And why's it gotta be dark
And author of "My Life Among the Kids Who Go to Shows",
It's all love you know
Had hope in its ring
Being gentle with the people who were knockkneed from the fall
You hold my arm and wait forever and look me in the eye
And I hope, I hope you are tired out
But that don't mean we're not still family
Nothing to do, it's up to you
For awhile for awhile
And I got nothing at all
You gave me the word, I finally heard
Thin limbed gorgeous green eyes smiling
If you don't have a song
Yo, tantalizing teaser
A talking fish comes as she moves
I told you a thousand times
Seeing you combing your hair
Someone has to care
I would like to hold my little hand
I got a letter from my mama which my stupid dog has ate
Makes you wonder where you are
Everything I need
You tell me that you heard every sound there is 
All the people they're rhyming
But it was all in your head
You don't need that soul, well that's fine, alright
I've got the adequate committee
Because I borrowed a book that I saw
Packing guilt for a trip
Everybody gonna jump and shout
And even if time ain't really on my side
Love can make you hostage, wanna do it again
These flights connect through Arizona
It's so hard baby, out here
Anything you want you can make it yours
In my mind, I miss you every night that you're not here
But winter's cold is too much to handle
We can be happy underground
I have someone who needs me
I'll join 'em talking 'bout whatever everybody talks about
Oh, somebody
We're falling to the ground
Lets forget about the rain  x
We are one
Or a fitted sheet for Christmas bed
The Hudson River all filled with snow
Your New Boyfriend Doesn't Know
We have got all day to recover
How will you know
When the chaperone crowned us the king and the queen
Left one day and never came back
Mornings eleven, the feelings are severed
Cause the other boys are queuing up behind us
Out of this town
You shout and you yell, hi, ho, ho
And I agree, I never think now when I'm with you
Við spilum út um allt saman
Many years from now
If ten million fireflies
Because
She's giving me looks, I can't help it
Your body's a dream that turns violent
I stay out too late
I cradled the crow, always shooed off the dove
I know I said that I was doing good and that I'm happy now
Well, it's all right, every day is Judgment Day
It's a joke, nobody knows
My favorite food and my birthday
Can you smell the spring time in the breeze
Whoo, dance, dance
Happy, happy, happy
And it takes no time to fall in love
Hope, hoping you might whistle, get all dizzy, 'cause I found the reason why you're around
He'll drive a funky car
Springs comes in when I'm rolling up another one
Some postman
Bit more then the girls he pretends he doesn't thrill
Those years never came
She made her Father worry till he was sick
Nothing can come between us
Now we watch TV
Losersbite it
Now I'm Cracking my sweet love
Mymymy heart like a kick drum
From your head down to your toes
Oh but honey I still see him
I only know when I'm in your embrace
Walking with her love, with her love, that's ohso fine
Lock yourself indoors and plan a getaway
Someone's been sleepin' in my bed
You stand up with pride
You fall apart
The sun is shining down
There's too much talk and not enough time 
You drove me crazy, but I don't know, baby
I wanna get better, better, better, better
Blinking in the morning sun
She says 'everyone around me is wasting all my time'
I'll remember you this way
Ills, man kills
Our lips can touch 
But I got something that I gotta do
But it's like trying to tell a stranger 'bouta rock and roll
The stars fall down like money
Because there ain't no party like the party going on in my house,
And I'm gonna want a girl that I know I can take home
When the sun only shines as if it's giving a warning
Wrecking ball outside the door
Now we're dancing, dancing, dancing with no music
There always the same
'Cause I was dressed really inappropriately
Sometimes I feel so full of love, it just comes spilling out
My troubles drift away
I'll wait and see if you'll give it to me
och man kan var dom andra eller du och jag har festival
You'll never know
So I moved to the Sunshine State
Your hands in the pocket
I was trying to raise my roof
And let me hold my broken parts
I get a shiver when I see you with those other guys 
And lay you under its loving embrace
Combined with the lightness in my head
When I think back on all the crap I learned in high school
Yes I'm on my way
More housing developments go up named after the things they replace
I'm tryin' so hard not to get caught up now
To ride a wave on your inhaling
Music is my hot hot bath
My sticky paws were into making straws out of big fat slurpy treats
And to my surprise
I live in the middle of a combat zone
After the light has faded
I could take care of my mom
I know you like it sweet
And you're such a great kisser and I know that you agree 
These are the days we won't forget
Shake, shake, shake, Senora, shake it all the time Whoa
We'll give you shakes and we'll make you sweat
Livin' life in these hard streets
Like the party going on in my house
And no, well this won't be a sad song
I just wanna be happy 
And I'm looking through the glass
Clap our hands and stomp our feet or something,
Woo Peter you did do well
Maybe I think you're cute and funny 
They say love is a stream that will find its own course
So deep you say
So lay your head onto me
I took the Polaroid down in my room
Oh yeah, I've been waiting for, waiting for you, girl
Where's the right in all of our fighting
When are you free to take some tea with me
Yesterday it rained in Tennessee
With all of the violence crashing around
Wooh ooh
And though you're out of tune
How d'you do  Comment allezvous 
And girls, you better beware
Hey, remember that time when we decided to kiss anywhere
It's been so long since we met
So I can stop running and the air can hum
Y'know baby
That's what takes up time in this life
Out of which only seven really even care
Just leave the hot whitetrash in their shopping malls
Oh, I'm burning through the sky, yeah
People around gotta find somethin' to say now
Everything's happy underground, everything's happy underground
We had a close call
It is so wonderful
Put up your hands girl but not so, so pushy
I'd pretend
I will be your king
Their ears are getting tired of me singing all the night through
And the heat is turned all the way to full
My friends say I'm uncool
Festival varenda dag gör mig glad
Lisa knows a girl who's been abused
Look at the sky
Oh lovely Rita, meter maid
They love while they can
I don't always tell the truth
You do the whirlwind,
Is this the way to carry on 
Soak it in the sun and make a groovy lemon pie
Planet earth presents you
How can you look in the eyes
And you take my kiss
I need you darling
In the parking lot
We've missed, so let's get back together 
What in God's name did I do
And I'll put my hands over your eyes, but you'll peep through
All the troubles you and I have seen
That you didn't have to do it but you would anyway
He said; oh baby fry some more eggs 
And I've been holding this microphone
You say yeah
I give thanks for this hollow chest of mine
It's safety dance
Won't help to hold inside, give a real, give a real shout out
And then I'm left in bits
Take a look at yourself
Spare me of this cause
Walking up a slide
And doing anything you want to do
I need help and you're way across the sea
See our friends, see the sights
This boy you chance, this man you'll find
Is it a call for an emergency
So let me see you Yeah Yeah
Where troubles melt like lemon drops
Stayed out those tunnels that pull people down
What you're calling a sin, isn't up to them
His heart is pumping blood
Those are the best days of my life
Knew they were some millionaires, their ropes were dookie
Don't say no 
But as long as you are with me, there's no place I'd rather be 
Stuck to aging feet, and
And we left things to protect my mental health
Well I don't know what I'm looking for
I want to let you see
But I'm in pieces, pick me up, and put me together
When she knows I like it
It's not as if the sun won't shine
Don't wanna guess, but I think it's time we turned around
Maybe when my eyes were closed
You got me up so high heyey
There is no need to deny 
Well, it's all right, you still got something to say
One thought has me turning back
And I twisted it wrong just to make it right
Pay the piggy back
And in the middle of the night
Super soaked in honeycomb 
By the harbor, we found a boat with your name written on it
You've got it all
You'll never get back, yeah
I will follow the electric lines
Finna run into a building, lay my body in the street
That's making me feel good
Standing beneath that mistletoe
Oh oh oh oh, sing it right back, I like it like that
Do I slowly get erased
Could you leave me with a scar
Fly in the air, comb your hair
I lead with my left hand,
Ohh, talking 'bout the magic
I got something that I really want to let you know
Cause now they all throw me they money like a wishing well
A plane is making a loop 
The only things I'll read are faces
Who You baby, you I'm talking about my baby yeah
I took my hits on a dumb road trip to Nashville, Tennessee,
When you're feeling in the dumps
Windows down we see a falling star
We're not bad people, we're not dirty, we're not mean
You turn the dial, I'll try and smile
Remember I'll always be true
I've never seen two friends like them
What kind of candy do you want
We long to see the sun
Bring it all back now
And do you feel the same
And suddenly struggles to take flight
And so I drew a new face and I laughed
Oh yeah the world can sometimes make you feel bad
And I was flashing around and the news spread all over town
This could really be a good life, good life
On a tear, far from home by a thread, Anna Lee
Tell my friends I'll be around 
Sun is in the sky, oh why, oh why
Is the old magic still there
Yo, yo, who think I don't got it
They just bring me down, so
Look around see what you do Blue
'Cause it wasn't televised
'Cause I'm more scarred, more scarred then my wrist is
Jessica numbers are due
I see a thousand cherry tulips lined up
Ah, 'round the bend
And my bass down low
Its just the sun you need
The weekend is the weekend
What did I do to deserve her love
Tell him I got nothing for him
Nothing's going right
The sky can fall down, the wind can cry now
I turn myself in, turn turn turn
She'll do a hundred and forty in the top end floored
'Cause I've been waitin' all week to feel this way
The way we've been made to live
Now When we do our thing, it's an original groove
I ain't got no home, ain't got no shoes
All your friends are going 'round
Can I get get get to know, know you better, baby
Put your weight against the door
It was like fire around the brim
'Cause I just can't wait till you write me
I'm the last chick standing up against the wall
And I've got a plan, we walk out the door
It's that desire over love I have to turn around
Take a look at the girl next door
Get a new name and cut your hair
Heartbeat, heartbeat
And I've sent signals and signs from the mountainsides
Sing about that, oh love is a brittle madness
Don't you wanna just curve away
My brother in arms
Boohoo I'm dying
I don't need no money
Ariella are you sleeping
I just had to let you go
Yeah, here she comes
I left my man in Houston Texas 
I think it's all just a peculiar game
How she's a "special" girl
Nothing but net could ever give to me
Ain't nobody's business
Yeah, that's the way I like it
Spinning around, trying not to look down 
Spend all your spare time trying to escape
You're a part time lover and a full time friend
And then the fireman rushes in
You still don't believe, you don't believe
Yes we'll come and we'll make a scene
Walking a straight line, copping a plea as they went
Finding trust and love is not always easy to make
You feel it when the dance gets hot, hot
She said I'm so obsessed that I've become a bore, oh no
Past infidelities please do not send
And I love you
They were in our minds
A canvas of a billion suns
They're shooting bullets
I guess we got off to a bad start
And you wanted to know, all about me, and my hobbies
I've a smile on my face
There's something wrong with me, I'm a cuckoo
Something sacred I lost
For the death of summer
Kicking us back down to the suburbs
Say the word
The sky will lie upon me like a passedout drunk
'Cause killing people's not my scene not my scene
And you're talking to the town"
I lose control of myself when ever you are near me
Some people are very kind
And I'm wondering why we bother at all
In the morning when the day is new
Because I wanna stay wet for a little bit longer
Because without a doubt he'd given up the fight
I need a definition, is it love that we're sharing
Why do you wanna grow up, why do you wanna grow so fast and throw your youth away
So that I never feel alone again
Even music music music will not last
Asleep inside, a parasite's appetite
I'm enchanted by your smile
Tell me I should be looking for love with some other girl
To pretend I do seems really dumb
And if I fall
Talking to you makes me wanna shake and shout
And when you loss control
Picking up the pieces of our hearts
And I will only look up
You should see me high, you should just be here, be with me here
That wish the harbor wasn't quite so deep
Seems to be part of human nature
And when they say that I'm just a terrible kite
But my skin is warm and my heart is full
All I dreamed of
I'm waiting on my knees
I've never heard her say
They make you look so small,
And fought the shadows back
And give me back my broken parts
Trolley cars and buses too
I gotta get some, baby
The things we left unsaid
When you worry about your tan, when the weather's getting clammy
Careful or you'll hurt yourself
We would shout and swim about
But I feel no pain
You're never gonna understand what you're seeing
And all the drugs that I don't have the guts to take to soothe my mind
Could've sworn that wine and one and four made two,
She don't like the way you look
Sing about that, oh, love is a brittle madness
I want to always feel like part of this was mine
You won't come back
Won't let my heart, my heart turn into stone
I'm in love but it's only temporary, temporary
That hides with your clothes
When the day that lies ahead of me
Well she'll have something to say about it but
Needs a whole lot more
And it's become just like a chemical stress
Happy Bring me down, can't nothin'
She hid around corners and she hid under beds
This time I'll get it right This time I'll get it right
Blazing down that highway on my way to Rock Star Land
Mostly you're a mind game in my head 
It would be great, right
Right now there's the the right time
I was a boy at an open door
She'll be mine too, I get off
He might get it on, on his own and start building a throne
But when them boys from out of town 
We used to rock some tunes with a guy named lloyd
I'll work on the limbs if
Can drive to big family
And you're getting all the words wrong
We're only just as happy
I'm gonna break the spell she's got on you
When you make me feel this way
He's got his knickers down
I'm as deep as the plot to an amateur gay porn
If it's drama you want, then look no further
Your Slayer Tshirt, fit the scene just right
I want to know
I'm crying late now, the sun is gone
I know I'm getting nowhere when I only sit and stare like
You're 'bout to miss, winding to this, don't make me start without you
Got my dreams, got my life, got my love
Empty arms
Should we chance our arms' alarms set to high noon until the shiver in the river is gone
We play in a basement
Where the rest of the dreamers go
The city we live in
You don't need eyes to see
Could you picture Russell needing a check, man
What more do you want baby
Want me girlie to come give me some sweet lovn'
Meet me downstairs Stairs
Till you cut through my tether and changed everything
And I won't sit back and take this anymore
Was thinking of you, thinking of you, you never know
Have you landed yet and, if so, would you let me know
Often enough to know
So hello, good friend, I wanna be next to you
Your face, come on, is dead and gone
This cruel world is killing you
But I'm hoping she might feel the same
When you drink with your buddies on the weekend
Still it's fine from afar, 
That I almost got hooked on, 'cause you ran away
Gotta paint my nails, put my high heels on
She said what would your mother think and how would your father react
The sweat rolls down your thigh
We'd fry our brains 
It was the best I ever had
Make it a nice place
Cause who knew that my luck would change
And leave your clothes over there, that's grandma couch
I'll follow you into the park
With all our dignity just in place
She's got her jaws now locked down in a smile
And there's a light on in Chicago every pane of glass
I got
You gotta let the water drain in
I don't care about tomorrow
I get to play at being irresponsible
He'll never get
See how sad the real fun gets with the morrissey girls
We never ever made it down to Nashville in the end,
Like when my hands got lost in your thick hair
And strange how clouds that look like mountains
I gotta message for your auntie
In the end I'll be all right
You know that you're cutting ties when you cut in town,
I can love you better than that
Down to our feet
We've eaten plastic weather
Clap your hands if you want some more,
I'd like to go out taking a shower
If you listen to your words then he might like what you say
We can be us just for one day
And I will break it for you now
Why don't you keep it in the background
What did you want to be when you grew up
My thoughts is jukin' the block, and dodgin' the one time
Now that half your life is over, if you're lucky
Is she right side up
I fall on my knees for my, for my city, eh
Don't look back on life man and only see tragic
Yeah, the touch of your lips
The flaws in this design
My, my the kindest truths are often spoke but never heard
You don't know what I'm going through
She'd deserted on the previous morning
I'd go from door to door
If we'd had never changed a thing
I can't deny these things that I do
But you don't bode and you don't pay, you got everything you need
Cozy and cold, put the horse before the cart
Don't it feel so bad
Black bird slow and softly breaks a glass of wine
The tractortrailor driver radios
Oh happy day
This is all I have to say
Finesse an innocent, from her partying
Who cares that you get home safe
Loose lips might sink ships but loose gooses take trips
There's a shadow on the wall and it's nine feet tall
True to color, a town, a time, or a place
You may hear all the angels cheer 
And all I need is to be struck by your electric love
And true love never has to hide
And there's something right in front of me and I
So just say it, say it anyway
With the wings that god will give you someday
Then you lay me down in clover
Eating the bananas and the cocaine off the mirror
Let's get rich and give everybody nice sweaters and teach them how to dance 
And they would string you up gladly 
Back in your heart
He approached my window
Yeah yeah yeah
Girl you give me reason to come question your love
Lord, I don't know if I'll ever be back again
Straighten up your tie, take the microphone
And whether we're supposed to or not, we still will
But as long as I can't get into Carnegie Hall
So don't you worry your pretty little mind
All my friends drink alcohol
You never knew what I could find
Said little women with your pretty red dress on
You know, you know, me num you know my name
Waiting for a bit of you baby
They can tell something is wrong
Remember lightning and wet clothes
You been gettin' what you want from me
That lives like yours, were in the hands of these erroneous fools
I know, I know such a big day
I wandered down the streets with my new town
All I have, all I know, I changed the station and our song is on the radio
We just want tomorrow to be better than today
Well I got Chinese children
Muck around
But now since I see you in his arms
Life is a trip and the roadmap leads you
Oh baby, all I need is one more chance
It�s here, baby
They are turning my head out
Well, staring through a window, standing outside they're just too happy to care
Wish I was going too
You could love
This man makin' money, how I know
You'll always make me feel best even when I'm blue
I said there's nothing that I can do for you you can't do for yourself
Live for your just 'cause he can't hear what you say
And we'll become silhouettes when our bodies finally go
Oh oh oh, ooh ooh
Well, it all amounts to nothing 
You know it don't mean a thing to us
You'll think of me and wonder where I am these days At the end of the line
But there's a heavy cloud inside my head
Reign of love on my knees go praying
You know you're gonna miss this
Talk about, taking breaks
I feel a cold flush going through my hair
And his mother is his mother reluctantly
How I know your face like the back of my hands
Yeah if I lived in Brooklyn, I'd still have Chinese children
And so I went and let you blow my mind
The times we had were so and so
And into an hour's time, within which a day's worth of work
Do you remember, do you remember
Out of sight
The great Larry Bird, jersey 
I can't get you off my brain
You've been a teenage runaway
It may be only a moment
So is this how it ends
We moved out to the places, heart it races
Don't go, say you'll stay
I'm gonna stand guard like a postcard of a golden retriever
She's the meanest hag that has ever been
Liars turn me on
Will only bring you years of fear
Make it sweat baby
Boy, we'll find how to make it with the rain
Girl in the blue with the big bust on 
When everything breaks
Your potty mouth is pushy
A candy man, a candy man
Bababass down low
Till we go sleep at night 
Apparatus to the ground
And I forget myself
I tossed and turned all night
With their petals on my back
Open academies, avenues and tree
Forget what happened then
I'm happy, I'm happy, I'm happy, I'm happy
Nothing else but us right now
Remember through sounds, remember through smells
Oh, a heart that functions at all
Work, work, work, Senora
I want to be a lilikoi boy  You
You can watch TV and watch the media
Saw you with the dude who gave us
And I started to shout
And you to look at me
There are those who know to look
Makes nothing else feel good enough
Well, it's all right all right, riding around on the breeze
So when you come home you & I'll be twins
Sometimes words just can't explain
I wish, we should have stayed at home
How does it feel in my arms
Don't let this moment slip away
I've got a red belt around my mind
It's wrong, you dreamt of him
The world is a ghetto with big guns and picket signs
And when she walks
Try hard to commit to a girl 
Running down my face, bound by tacks and paste
Should I choose not to run
That's the way you sip my cup
The sky turns to a different shade of blue
But I can't get out of it
I'm gonna marry you out of common sense
In a canvas covered wagon stuff with apples and with guns
Oh, yeah
All my friends are going out but I've been thinking
We can shake, shake, shake
I can't tell you but I know it's mine
And faith is all we need to be the one, far from my own ground
You are
I'd hoped, beneath, asleep, is where that you had been
Did you ever care to shoot your silver gun
A pretty girl is like 
But he's got to have the qualities that I like
Elevator buttons and morning air
Who knew my luck would change
I hear a song it makes me think of a girl I used to know
The bottom line is the dollar signs
Drop a chance in your hands, then
I wonder what you're dreaming of, lands rare and far
Trying to forgive what was said, but was never really meant
Love was just something you found to add to your collection
She's got a doll with one eye, 
I'll be just fine
The dogs barked long days, not dark
Practiced for millions of years
Come on, sister have a drink
You get the blessing from above
Chasing the lampcords back to the wall
Sidewalk, streetcar, dance a goofy dance
It was perfect clarity
Go press that dissonance, if you dare
I thought love was more or less a giving thing
We'll cut our bodies free from the tethers of this scene
I'd go the whole wide world to find out where they hide her
She still hears music in the air
Happy birthday
Come on out, make romance
The sweetness flies to her
Your love is like a city I visited
I know I should get next to you
Come over here with your heart
Naked kids, running wild, and free
My hands shake, I'm not usually this way
So I just sign the dotted line
You're no fun at all
You were bright, like a new day
If you want, want my heart
I'm fine, I'm fine with waiting on the line
Well, it comes in waves, but it's hardest from the start
Your head is there to move you around
Do ya, do ya, do ya love me
Come on make some big jumps, big jumps,
When I go out, yeah, I know I'm gonna be
'Cause I will be away from you
I've known you for lifetimes, baby
Clap your hands But it won't do nothing
My knees they got some cuts and bruises
Getting in the car again
Should we move to the UK
'Cause you get me
I was revealed
When I find love with Uranus
I know where the lady goes
I've gotta rise above
I see you in the park
When the wind comes racing off the river
I miss the power
No one gets you anymore
Him hangin' 'round around you
I've got all the right clothes to wear
Oh well, my baby's number one
You'll never be a burden and my love for you will never die
And embrace me and then brave my heart for you
But then he cracks that smile
Next day, suck my teste
Now a whole lotta woman
When I think of life without 'us' 
I am driving in my car up Highway  
Discretion hardly I'm known for
Until a god with a broom came and swept them away
In the grey, there's still colors,
I've been thinking, and I've got this plan
Who'll draw the line in the sand
All this beauty;
Laughing in the face of love
As we lay them on the granite counter top
Have you, ever been to heaven at night to heaven at night
But money can't buy you love, baby that's a fact
These shoes are poor man's ice skates
Oh, oh when you say it
Dear Dominique well I hope you're feeling better
And I would gladly hit the road, get up, and go if I knew
Oooooh weee, ooh wee, lalalala, lalalalalala
The only thing at all
But I don't wanna talk about it anymore
I will not sleep until my pencils lie in a straight line
I'll throw a party and greet my undersea friends it depends
And I think I don't really get it
That type of thinking can't get you nowhere How I got over
I wanna runaway
You, you are the thing
There is not enough love to offer
You make we wanna say I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do
In the nearest neighbourhood
It just makes much more sense with my hand in your hand
All right, at five minutes to midnight
Than just sit down at the piano and a write this tune
I'm lota, yo sir
I was so scared that you'd leave, so I hid it
Ain't got no friends, ain't got no schooling
Now the look in your eye
Hey Hey don't pay no mind,
Is he a family man
I hope you believe me
Enjoy it while you still have it
Gives me the greatest peace I've ever known
It's a long way, oh, joker, to let the fire burn
And I'm like "there's no way to say and there's nothing I can do
I you keep tearing out the pages of an alibi
You can't take a fall
Okay I'll tell you why I never look back
Well our mamas, they left us
Springs alive to circle down
To take with me into eternity
Never walk under ladders,
I cried a tear 
It's not fair it's not fair
And I feel like walking the world
Sometimes all I want is one favorite song
But not a friend worth noting
To prove that I was tough I hopped on one foot
Lie in my arms, sleep secure
Thinking Oh is it love
Let us shine for what it's worth
Your folks were next to you, and you were right there next to me
Looking for a good time;
Get comfortable, get unfrustrated
Then it's over before beginning the good part
And she's just waiting for something to do
Whispering vocal chords
Never did, never did I ever love anyone other than you
I got something I think I really wanna tell ya
What a time of right and reason
'Cause I'm done with that; I've got one foot out the door,
Sun melting the fake smile away
Hey, it's goin' no place
I don't want you now, bang, bang, bang, gone
She don't care what you say
Bring it forward to the present day now
You came upon a quiet day
But only because we thought 
Well okay, it's settled
I want your arms to wrap around me twice
Do you hear me I'm talking to you
And we wanna get caught
I've got a third upon my shoulder, 
We go to sleep to Shake Appeal
A whippoorwhill in flight, turns east towards westphalia
Heartbeat racing, body losing all control
Let the morningtime drop all its petals on me
I know it's hard
Sometimes even the right is wrong
Yes, but I, I'm a boy
I understand why they say
Bending reason
Life would not matter
Not my imagination My imagination
But getting old, it takes its toll
Left alone to drive ourselves on the opposite side
I know it's overdue there's a key to the door, 
Hey babe, I know in time
Or are you, looking away
You can't stop it
But it all coincides some way
You are the fortunate all the time
My brown eyed girl
It's , the girls are just friends
Pull myself around
Sometimes I feel so confused,
If you've got the money, I think it would be funny
I know I might never come home
Everybody knows it
If we fall dow
They feel like they're the same
But now it's my turn
You say I hate you, you mean it
Look out for dreams that keep returning
Man I was mean but I'm changing my scene
I make my own way
I gotta dance dance dance dance now the beat's really hot right on the spot
And the senses being dulled are mine
I had enough feeling give me what I want or put me on the streets
But it never feels right
You know there's something going on here
In the end, technology unto the world will set us free
People walk in sideways pretending that they're leaving
My name is Denver Max please excuse the mask,
Maybe we were born to love
Can you tell me who will still care 
When it's cold
The time was passed so easily
Like she told her old man now
I want something else
When it looks to me the grass is greener on the other side
Helping with your alarms,
Sample  So hard to say goodbye
One glance was all it took
I had a dream, it was all a dream 
Oh, I never want to be without you
For the desk with the windows
If only I could say that everything's okay
But that's OK, that the way I like to be
Concentration slip away
In the mortal life
Live while you can,
I'll end it, don't you start it
The crooked, the straight, all the hip and the fake
Next to mine
I wanna make a supersonic woman of you
Still, I only feel alive when the VU is flashing
Hey girl
Hey you with the long and lonely face
I just wonder Louie, have you got room for me
Now the sky could be blue
I want to get so stoned and take a walk out in the light drizzle
To the feel good hit of the fall 
And I can't stop thinking how wonderful this is
But that won't wake your father from his every lasting sleep
We staked out on a mission to find our inner peace
Imma do it till I get it right
Go to a show, you hope she goes
And so our truths wait patiently
You know that you make it shine
While the players at United get a hundred grand a week
So we make a lot of noise
Track down the beating of my heart
Form a line through here
Do your thing, your
You've got it all, you've got it all, you've got it all
That was a hit before your mother was born
And watch them fall away into the Hudson Bay
You got everybody talking
You know my name you know me number
Searching all the crowded streets
And I got pulled by the pull of the tide
Girl let's get it poppin' Crackin'
If I was crying
And a pretty pair of blueeyed birds
Crossed the line, didn't mean to
The deadly silent kind
Keeping their voices down
And all I can do is just pour some tea for two
The morning
I was feeling pretty good then
Maybe we'll be friends
I'm not saying there's nothing to cry for
And there's dancing
And when you see in them something you recognise
People are my enemies and people are my friends
The only thing that He can do is hold it in, hold it in
It's the season
Next stop, Paid In Full posse recruits me
So I may understand
I know what I know
On the street I was passin' my time away
He said 'oh my dear listen here
But you can't hide standing under these stars
We got scribbes, Anthony Acid, rockin' the show
Everybody knows I've got the magic in me
Win or lose, win or lose, I can't say
Eh, eh, there's nothing else I can say
No way they said take it, take it and don't break it with your own two hands
Here comes my Chinese rug
Aaaaaa, for you, ba ba ba ba babaaaa, yeah yeah yeah
And I've only got one sock
I never tried to hold you tight until you left me and
By the eyes of the blind
And put your feet back on higher ground
That I will love her
Because I'm faking my own suicide
I can see what I need 
I really don't like your skinny jeans
Translation not sung
Better than a chick that say yes too soon
What makes it so different
It takes some good to make it hurt
Singing, squeaking, "We built this city"
Sweet honey
I wanna pay her back
We're all waiting on dream
The secret on your lips
Who will believe me, won't deceive me, won't try to change me
Sit around idle and nod my head
Her last words keep raining down, on shelter
Waiting like a flower to open wide
And you stashed my heart
But I won't get me down
You can ride downtown and stay warm by the fire
We are just
Oh, no, we, don't care
And I, where was I
This life can turn a good girl bad
'Cause I know something the prince never knew
And now together we're alone
Go, go, baby don't go
To a line I'll never understand
Always on my mind
Back corner table, order lobsters and Black Label
Hang me from the ceilings, little mobile constellation lights
Girl, you might hold your breath 
When I lived in Denver, I met a millionaire
But she'll walk a Thunderbird like she's standin' still
Hey, trees fall and so do men
Wake me, shake me
Should they kill me, your love will fill me as warm as the bullets, yeah
He was a diplomat's son, it was '
"Hey, I wanna get better"
When you find it all around
You'll be happy for the rest of your life
I knew I had to make my, decision
And do everything that I need you to do
Until our shells simply cannot hold
Don't say when 
Find a road to a humble abode where both of our routes meet
Feeling as good as lovers can, you know
There is nothing stopping you,
You'll say I'm thin and bring the washing in
Some feelings never seem to let go 
You're every song
Through the jungle, through the dark
Gathered up your things and slipped away
All night like a friendly ghost
Let them have their way with us
To push me around and tell me what to do
That I can't say
We're gonna see the sunlight ah huh yeah
Sing a happy song
I was sick of the west
Óró mo churaichín ó You were one inch from the edge of this bed
They seem to like my face
Colours and colours and colours of colours
I know a place where it's warm and it's dry, dear
Your precious love, uhhuh, oh
Premo, what up man
I'll drop kick Russell Stover, move into the starting over house
I don't even care
But you wouldn't even come around to see me
I'm just saying it's fine by me 
I must stay deep, 'cause talk is cheap
People should smile more
Uh uh from this day forth only forward I pedal
And if I die today
Like a tidal wave
You put up with my shit
Lalalala to end
Shshake it
Get together to tear it apart
Won't change how I feel today 
All adrifting, he's a nogood boyo
They'll look after your grave
You just do your part, form a line lets march under the golden arch
Nobody likes us
Askin for the next together
We raise what we bring
Three thousand miles northeast
Fumbling 'round in the dark with a flashlight 
As the world keeps spinning round
Sometimes I want to disappear
I thought love was more or less a given thing
You slow down heartrate
All of the bad feelings have disappeared
The mistake you don't make or the rain cloud covers above your house
Come back and stay
Just hold me together
I wish you the best on your way, eh
Oh, it's safety dance
All things go, all things go
Hoowoodoo oohooh
All the money
It is the fear inside that you can overcome
Clouds drift by and everything is like a dream
Some postman is gonna cry
How I feel inside
'Cause they've been wait, wait, waiting for Friday night
All the animals together break it down let me hear ya
I suppose our thoughts about United Nations
If you could make everybody poor just so you could be rich 
It was crime at the time, but the laws, we changed 'em
When you can't break through
Home is a boxcar and it's so far out of reach
Eyes closed and shouting right now
Then me gotta be waitn' till the day turns to night
Don't believe me, just watch, come on
You stare at him long, you can find a new song
There are stories in the soil, loose leaves cover the ground
And everything else
They'd take their feet
Don't let the waves let you drown
'Cause I never knew a home
With all the plans I had before
Only to find you'd nothing more to say
This is the only place
So we trucked on down to try our luck along the Rio Grande,
When the lush hangs off the chron, I know that you're gone, ya feel me feel me
You and me will always be
And I never want to be your little friend, the abject failure
Subtle patterns in the sky
Oh, and leave me without
And you've got the curse of curves
Feeling good, on top of the pops
Hello, how could I ever feel this way
And the moment's flown
My joy will be complete
Go to sleep, it's just another day
Walking a bridge on weakening cables
Just you and me let's break it down,
To stand
Yeah, but I really love it here
Upon your face, you may think you're alone but you
If I lived in Prussia, I'd have some Chinese children
So would you say you're mine We'll be just fine
Hopelessly I feel like there might be something that I'll miss
No traces of civilized living eaten by earth
So when you sing this song out loud
It's one of those days for taking a walk outside
The numbers over the dam,
Well I know that it's a wonderful world from the sky down to the sea
And I don't give a damn if you don't like me
Up and down checking you out now 
Neon black corpses, stacked, eclipse the horizon
Sure did help but it didn't solve everything
Pharoah on the microphone Sing all hail
Please just let me go
Not much like a lover
Oh yeah
Changes this Fall are going to last forever
I love you never talk in dreams, 
And Cairo at his head
And the mail room shift gets a real short shrift
I'm gonna stick him in the house of detention
In the middle of our world, I'll be waiting
"Oh, do you remember me is your mind that worn
Under the tree where the grass don't grow
And my lips are unhappy without you
Beneath your window pane
It's all so safe and sound
And I'd sell records by the ton
Informing me I'm near the axis of feeling
All bananas playing in the bright warm sun
Across the water across the deep blue ocean
She won't stop until we stop trying,
Coming out your speaker cones 
It'll be just like the day
The walls of Jericho
I love, I love, I love you, baby
Could be we step out again
No hoes with me, you know all the blow these folk have sold with me
To think about the girl you love
Take it, baby
I have to get this grade
I'd rather dance with you 
Why am I scared of people in a room
Such a thing as love
In this town where we roam
But I don't have any messages
We would be hundreds, thousands, millions
And can I get, yeah, what I ordered
For me to come unglued
He got her meals and he got her a bed
We're on our way somehow
Come come come
And if this is what we've got,
Have been covering the canvas,
I say, hey poppa, hey poppa
'Cause it's what we needed to have a good time
Now what happened to our coat of arms
You charmed the lifeguard, he let them use the pool all day for free
Do you have a heart to feel it
When it does, I ain't looking back
I'm not the kinda girl who'd get messed up with you 
I can sleep twelve hours
And he dresses alright but the conversation is wrong, all wrong
The way your words keep me in line
I can feel it
Though I respect that a lot
When I was alone
She said, "You've been pushing me like I was a sore tooth
Soon I could be happy
I'll cheer you up if you're depressed
Jump in the line, rock your body in time Rock your body, child
Love the one you're with
And there's so sense in trying
Trying to be a tough guy
But I worked somethin' out last night
I don't know, yes, honestly
Can't take back those hours
Topic of the discussion, but beat it like a percussion
But I will bend the light pretending
'Cause when I think of you as mine
I said "So here we are now and I can't stop from crying Lilly"
Ham me up or send me down
And talk about virility
Which means you and me, my love
They say ooooooh wee
How d'you do Comment allezvous 
If you touch its skin 
I met somebody cute and funny
Bad news comes, don't you worry, even when it lands
Hopes and dreams and memories
You say you wanna walk with me
There's ice on the road
And of course you can't become if you only say what you would've done
Damn it feels so sweet tonight, all by myself
With a girl the lonely sea looks good with moonlight
And lick the light
Let the lovin', let the lovin' come back to me
Woman's whisper Okay children, remember your breathing One, two, three, four
I'm gonna pave the way at night
His Senorita a heavenly sweet soul
The way you can cut a rug
So won't you please show me yeah
I know there's a light inside
Quick you dirty rat shake your buns
Just to be amongst your presence
So don't worry, be happy
Hoping that somebody gets in
There's no need to play with my heart
But while it was all going accordingly to plan
'Cause you never made a sound
Go to bed, you sleepyhead
Accept my loss and head back to the mound
You appeared right in front of me
All I do the whole day through is dream I'm dreaming, dreaming a dream of just dreaming dreaming a little dream you
Sky's the ball and it fits in
Oh yes, I started wondering
Chatting so delightfully
So do the bluebirds sing
Once you start to open your heart
This time he will break down
You're exhausted always coming down
They're takin' me down as the prisoners riot
But the songs that make me dance along
'Cause we always breakin' the mold
True love never has to hide
I've got to let you know I've got to let you know
Do the piggy payback
Ticktock, this clockwork will stop, 
Keep kicking myself in the nuts
'Cause life long cracks
Well I don't feel right
Never get to let you know how much I think of you
We were humans being useless
I can take my clothes off
I'm gonna make a supersonic woman out of you
Don't hesitate to come by, yeah, yeah, yeah
Tried to learn what's right and wrong
Fashion shoots with Beck and Hanson
Summertime, summertime
'Cause you're two friends I can count on when I'm blue
The brilliant girl with the famous thighs
I just might walk home alone
Awatchin all the snow that's fallin'
So at my show on Monday
Like it never been done
I been bummin' around this old town too long
Goin' 'round this roundabout, oh yeah
The sun is out
Everything you want is not free
That Doesn't Remind Us Of 'Musetta's
You kept back, you kept unspoken
Break my bones but you won't see me fall, oh
Everyday I sit down and I feel like I'm waiting
And it don't hurt like anything I've ever felt before
And eagle flies with the dove
And twice you left in fall
Like Peter Pan up in the sky
You're in my dreams
And I could show you the way
Hands to tear apart
Ride to Harlem, Hollywood
Ah, hold on, not my fairy tale you're trying to start
Can't say I've felt such twisting
It was the best sex she ever had
I found you a home
I've got to have till I am dead
Let's get older
Flashing eyes and if they are color blind
Where it's like they lost they mind
The lips that slip are the lips that press
But no matter how far I row
That's all I have to say so, baby, can we dance
Egolovers need more power
Nice day for a driveby shooting
Then I got high 
"While you were sitting in the backseat, smoking a cigarette you thought was gonna be your last,
Got to find the reason, the reason things went wrong
Makes me feel like I took happy pills,
Have you ever sat down in the freshcut grass hey
You can do anything you wanna do
I'm liking this American boy, American boy
High above the chimney top, that's where you'll find me
Now that you are gone, I'll never see here for tech repair
So everybody that I love can have a couple bucks
And I give a thank you to my father for not raising me
Something is about to be born
'Cause he quivers when he hears your song
She knows when things are happening
Back to the middle of no where
Oh yeah yeah, oh yeah yeah, oh yeah
I wasn't expecting nothing,
You think you know me, but you haven't got a clue
The patient, the patient fall
Yeah, hot, hot, love
Than let you come to harm
Life, life without surrender
I fell asleep on the passenger seat
I'll never find another way to say, I love you more each day
Stop and say hello
I'm telling you now that you got me good
It's ending all too soon you'll see
Georgie said romantic love is flat
I wouldn't be so scared of dying
You know you really gonna wet my dream;
Revealing walks in the park
It must have been the way
Well one of them is mine
Stay up get drunk with all your best friends
Forgetting makes things easier
'Til her daddy takes the TBird away
Yellow lines they blend together in my eyes
Because it hurts me so bad
Little white clouds like gambolling lambs
She makes me feel glad
The horizon took us all a little by surprise
I want you by my side
For he is defenceless without you
She'll always give you peace of mind
Baby, please
I think I see you coming to town, hunting you down
'Cause holy cow, I love your eyes
Address to places like Abbey Road
You say the words will get there soon
A little bit of Tina is what I see
Like a street to a hustler, a face to the soul
You've gotta hold, hold open my eyelids
In the broad day
I feel much better, baby, when you're near
What is he to do He's been kicked out of school
I promise I'll show you heart, heart, heart, heart
And still make a day of it
The two of us together
And I'll be falling fast asleep
Its torturous analytical thoughts make me go insane
Here comes corner winds and the changin' tide
Eating good, sleeping soundly
That you will be around
Just say yes
With good friendly homes
I kept a bottle by the foot of the bed
Then someone falls in love
But that's what you get when you live in a small world
The wuthering heights
'Cause love is free
I'm a man in a dream and there, dancing in front of my eyes
Civil War skeletons in their graves
'Cause I know the grass,
No matter how they toss the dice, it has to be
This is your moment
That was the time I used to pray
I want a smile like a glistening shard
And my heart beats faster
I must've had fun 'cause now I'm broke
Out cruising with their friends
You hold me tight
Look up the number How's that, boys
What's right and wrong
No turning around now
Don't close the door, on what you adore
I was never meant to go to school
Tonight I'll dream while I'm in bed
I understand why you're looking for tears in my eyes
I shake it off, I shake it off
'Cause every little thing gonna be all right
Life is a maze, and love is a riddle
Dance with me 
I say, we can dance if we want to
Where friends won't debate my health
Song and melodies change and change
Let's stop the world I'll stop the world and melt with you
Sometimes there's bullshit that don't work now
I feel the love
Makes me feel tingly and hot
Not a chance, that is
In the sun
And the oceans
Is the only sense I've left
I'm far away
We have dropped right out of
When I was a river dried up
Oh it's only getting sweeter
It's all right, all right, tonight, tonight
I'd have something to say
We all know the girls that I am talking about
I got stung by a sweet honey bee
In love with someone
I can't get enough of you, baby 
Just decide, I've been waiting all night
'Cause the grass will never be greener on the other side
Agonic lines, ascendances and amatory tendencies
Finding the word
If I were king of this night,
Then she flew away into the night
But my heart was still mine
Made sure she was dead 
As a walkie talkie
It's taking over me
While I stand here and think it up
Of these white nights
Und erst dann trifft man sich irgendwo zu zweit
It's just the way we feel
Não há paz  There's no peace
I tripped on my way in, got kicked outside, everybody saw
Another dream about shapeshifting
Everytime the tears run dry
Are more than I can let by
To all our love letters
That everything good always would 
Got each other and that's funny, eh, eh, heh
'Cause I can shine my light on
Jesus loves her, she wants more
Sailed along a foreign wave
Get a house in Devon
And if you do, then you're my friend
And you keep saying you keep saying
This nightmare's supposed to end
Watchin' my youth slip away
Everything's heavy underground
So, I can call
There are prostitues in Thailand
Let's get it, homeboy Ha ha ha ay
You've got to open up your, open up your, open up your throat, Matt
Since I was in my braces
Oh, I saw your face in front of me
Said "Mister, mister, with your beard so long
I gave it a chance, she must be crazy not to leave
Where the air is rarefied
There's no need to cryah
At least they know where to put it
And love is five in the morning
To find the place you can breathe
The preachers and books of your empire will fight here alone
And in every way you know I just want you to stay
Run fast for your mother, fast for your father
Do you know the seasons in your mind
It's too much that they say you need
So here's to what the future brings
No I won't no I won't no I won't alive alive with love, alive with love
'Cause you're the one who showed me
Oh, happy
All your troubles they don't stand a chance
Betty won't stop listening to modern rock
Hello partner, tell me love can't fail
I'm a thief who's just been caught
I can be sincere and say I like them
Brickbrack, if you don't wind me up,
Wearyeyed and forlorn
These streets have got a rhythm
Escapade Let me take you on an escapade on an escapade, baby
Once you get the feeling it, wants you back for more
De mon bateau ancre profond
But I'm glad that you thought of it
I don't know
We'll rise up ourselves, thanks for nothing at all
And slowly open wide all this beauty
And I want to do so many things to you
I know you know, we don't see
They'll learn much more than we'll know
Just like steady choppers
I was all right
I started smiling
She looked me over
Love is all you need
My mon frère
I know it might be wrong
I'm gonna pack up my troubles in my old kitbag, I'm gonna run a mile from here
Riding with the boys and pushing the luck 
Falling down 'round our very heads
You wouldn't need binoculars
I've got my freedom
He drop the record, I start a stampede
And you can jump all the time and everywhere
I'm all grownup now, baby, can't you see
But the sky is old
I'll say it one last time one last time
Most of the time it's misery but there's some joy at the start
No one knows just how deep it goes
Accidentally in love
'Cause I'm the ugliest guy 
Let's put our money where our mouth is and get out today
A teenage vow in a parking lot, till tonight do us part
We'll escape beneath a violet sky
Baby we were on our way
Can't think of anything better to do
Is all I need
Mine and my baby
Just don't use me up I say
Made you feel like it's not such a bad world hey
Follow your heart
Conventional sister no she's not
If I ever talk to you again
I'ma call ya afro cause you never bald
Ooooohoohooooh oohoohoohoohoohoohooh
You are such a blessing and I won't be messing
You're so good, and I'm so bad
Someone to take your life beyond
Why would you wanna make the very first scar
And at the ceiling of my feeling, backed up against the wall,
Called it the happy low down
Never say goodbye
'Cause there'll be Ma and Pa and Grandmama
I'm in love
I'm a lady, futhermucker
That you can't define all the ways to say
Deep beyond the things I don't show
I can't believe everything 
There is only one thing
But fairness she don't see
When there's a basketball game in the park
You know what to do, ah ha ha ha ha
Under the moon and with the girl that's in your place
We're the magic boys and we'll make you smile
Drivin' away, just drive away, leaving it all behind
Tonight we're gonna shine with the power of a thousand suns
With someone who loves me too
And the land was hot
And turned ourselves in on our selfish turns
Love's what I got, don't start a riot
Can we go far away to the humming meadow
What did I do to you
Then someone's beaten up
In despair with your drugs and your hardcore porn
I haven't been there for years
But now I know I want to win the war
Until they sparked
Try something new 'cause it ain't over
To take your girl and spend a bit of your cash for me
And you know I'm so wired up
If you sell that soul you'll be burning up right
And you don't say much, yeah, that's true
But there was somebody to mentioned
You're gonna walk backwards
Didn't have a word to say
Play it back in slow motion
Educated, but a refugee still
We gonna wash away
And they stuck up their noses and started some fights
To get it right
Closer to the clouds than all the people ever cared to see
I've been waiting a long, long time
Get free from the middleman
I'm the skilled love doctor growlin' What's your sign
'Cause if it's good
From a word that means only not a thing
But I still feel you pulsing like sonar
Waiting around nails cut to the quick
Yeah, oh, yeah, oh
And will you remember me
Big brother
Every time we say goodbye
And I was just walking on one fine wire
I hang from every word
Sorry 'bout the things that I said
Synchronicity weaves like a web
She drank beer with CocaCola
Some are the messengers
The crowd is a stare
I want a taste of that Oregon girl
You always brought it among dreams
With the moon keeping watch over me
Well I watched as my weeks bleed right into them
He's keeping you inside
Leave everything up to fate
But I think you're a pretty sweet pill that I'm swallowing down
It would take a left wing Robin Hood to pay for school
Bitch, say my name you know who I am
It's more than you've got
And it's fun
Lay back down I told myself
You know it's gonna make it that much better
And the whole wide world is whistling
It's the way my heart beats,
Now listen, now that I am across the sea
'Cause you got sad 
Without fade, inside lovers
And when I wake up in the morning
If you've got will and a little time
And never leave 'til I leave you with a sweet dream in your head
I know I can't express
Ooh what did I get myself into
Bring me my Japanese cigarette case,
Anyone you've loved once was right
In case our timing is right
How the wind went and pulled me into your hurricane
I play tough as nails with my heart on my sleeve
But you can get back home, you can get back down;
Sand beneath our feet, big blue sky above our heads,
Now they want us to surrender
And I will waste no time
And there is no end
From being my daddy's sperm to being packed in an urn 
We both got fired on exactly the same day
No matter how they tossed the dice
All I have, all I know, drive all night go anywhere you wanna go
Shimmering, travellin' light, echoing love at first sight
I've never felt so much at home
Lata Mangeshkar forty five
Ooh The morning's on it's way
A little ray of sunshine, a little bit of soul, 
Just what they're thinking
The curtain falls before you know it
We all have a story to tell
And I bet she never thought I was
And its hi  ho silver lining
Brand new tecs, food stamps and welfare checks
As long as you're open to the possibility, yeah 
Make a little birdhouse in your soul
Rely a bit too heavily on alcohol and irony
On your way to the best years of your life
And I'm always pretty happy when I'm just kicking back with you
Touchdown turnaround I never see you around
All the good times my friend
Now her dogs are alone and there's no one to watch her TV
Can I take my friend to bed
Friends tell you when your fly's undone
And catch my disease
The beach homes and ocean side
So what's my line  shake it shake it baby
Only shootin' stars
Whistle through your teeth and spit
You thinking that it's me you're fooling
The man from Galilee
Do your thing, make my body sing
Baby, not a day goes by that I'm not into you
Monday's child has learned to tie his bootlace
I'm lost at sea
Try to show some class
Something so beautiful and chilled to the bone
It ain't nothing, kid
Well they work in both ways
To see a girl that's sweeter than an apple picked from Adam's tree
With ribbons in her blonde hair
I got a wild heart
It was me that paid for it eventually
Over a sea of grief, Scarlet died
So won't you please come home
Dom akta vi backar dom vi ger dom karlek
I'll trade your broken wings for mine
My ears are blank
And this'll turn into something else, something else
Looking for the answer
Start a brand new colony
And get nicked by the strobe light
If what you say is moving you
You got my heart unlocked,
But I have been tricked again into forgiving you
You don't get to the bottom of nothin'
She likes 'em with a mustache
The way you walk, the rhythm when you're dancing
Though her face is ugly, her eyes don't match
Love my monkey on ice
I'll see you on the other side
Wet trunks and schoolbooks and sand on my toes 
Are outside the lines
And that don't look so bad to me
You humble people everywhere I don't mean to hurt you
Ohohohohohoh We're only half alive
I got one question for you liars, man
You make me runaway,
Yeah I slip, I'm still an animal
And it was hard
Can you feel the drops as it starts to rain
But you're the only one who knows how to handle me 
You don't know how far you've gone
It would just bring so many tears
Hologram or telephone 
I hope that you'll stay the night
Loosen the noose then let go of the rope
Leading their Fifteen sordid, wretched, checkered lives
They don't know about soul wine habit club
Even now I'm holding my breath for you
Where did we go wrong
And it brings me to you and I won't just pass through
Now that I know what I feel must be right 
Someone is smiling, someone cries 
You still say 'what did you say' Argentinean Accent 
And I welcomed the dew as much as you did
Like the Longines Symphonette it doesn't rest
When the walls are caving in
The monkey on your back is the latest trend
Sweet thing, take me to the end
So much I wanna say
But what can I say I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive
Watching me like you never watched no one
You think still
Like a pen needs a page, to learn right you need a mistake
Firecrackers in the east, my car parked south
I need your love tonight
Catch my disease
Classical music blasting masks the ringing in my ears
Come on baby, let me tell you 
Bluebird of friendliness
I thought that we'd start over
Ikea plywood, brushed steel
Ladies and gentlemen, this is Mambo Number 
All we forget
Even just for a while
Leave the joyful air in that rubber ball today
They've a million ways to kill you
'Cause I know that you wanna dance
Come around, we'll kick your ass in
A bboomerang
Said, I'm that kind of feeling
When, it all amounts to nothing 
Could you back me up
And, I'm seeing stars as I'm rubbing my eyes
We may never find our reason to shine
Returned from the war to a hero's welcome
And all the pleasure points attacking
She says
The only freedom that you'll ever really know that you'll ever really know
So please, try to understand that if I could, I'd call and I would be there
Wait for me I'm nothing on my own,
I want earth to breathe to me
It's just love
And at the show on Tuesday
I saw my friend and he couldn't believe that
Of your dramatic ways
Oh now I think I must be miles up
'Cause if I had a set of wings, man, I know she could fly
They let us play with markers but I keep trying to draw infinity
Point at the epiphanies and call 'em all drug related
Looking at the stars from underneath the tree
I'm alive  suddenly I am here today
They remind me of the pickup truck out in front of your neighbor's
Because I haven't read a single book all year 
It's a clear day
I know you got the feeling and I can't say I'm agreeing
Cause the money
And I've got you to propel me, but I still need so much
Of the whole ghetto, the bootstomped meadows, but we ignore that yeah
Your fashion caught her eye Another conquest of your personality
From the projects, she know we need our welfare cut
And that's what they don't know, mmhhmm
Oh yeah, dirtbag
Joined at the hip, yeah your sidekick needs you
It's a warm summer breeze
In the misty morning fog
Another day to sing about the magic that was you and me
Fall through like change in the daylight
They're people, you're not like them
You'll always be the one that I want to come home to
I think I'm falling in
Like I love you
God made me, yeah
Go down to the sea
Thanks for everything
Just forget it, just forget it
Not saying that you brought me down all the time
A beauty so strange, something he didn't expect
I was gazing in your eyes
Shake my head dizzy so I'll never know
Little bit of love, little bit of love, little bit of love, little bit of love
And the people passin' by stare in wild wonder
But the girl's got a lot to be mad about
Not serious, about the way that you are
Oh, yeah Mr Postman
Now you're acting like she was pretending
Corporal Bradley of regiment five
Birthright's a trouble, my father dug too
We all get there eventually
Oh yeah you're the best damn friend that I'll ever have
Oh, in so many ways
I blame myself, Feel my head explode from a night of gin
I heard you say in some interview that "feminist"
The truth lies we could be together
Done living like a runaway, break those hearts so carefully
Do you run from magic
House buried to the window sills in snow
You have a tendency to rush back into your past
But it's still the same
You, you know, you know my name
Honey, I'm afraid to say
And although you try to infringe, you cannot confine
Oh when she love me, love me, love me so tenderly
But baby I was doing fine How do you think
In my mind, in my mind
I thought he was a bitter man
I was the youngest son of a congressman
We watched Titanic and it didn't make us sad
We'll get up, to sing some music
All I need is you
What did you want to be
Shimmy down and show us part of in the meantime
At any time my little world seems blue
I woke up today with this feeling
Knew Nevers
I'm takin' it back , takin' it back
Say whatever we think actions are
Another day, another way
There's too much doubt and not enough dare 
Now your ears are ringing
Say goodbye to the setting sun
Past the evening
I'll have my eyes set on you
Some mob that brought me here I know it is my job
Lend me your ears and I'll sing you a song
Your talk is all the talk, sister you've got it all
Within the rocks hard and cold
And there's no one else around,
Pick it up, pack it up, put it in a bag
You take command and lose control
Darlin' do not fear what you don't really know
Kick it with the King and let me show you what I mean, man
Name the place, I'll be there,
And it will be a long time before shit starts to give
Sixteen years later, here I go
I wish she cared to see 
But I've never seen another Oregon girl
I got magic in my dancing shoes
You know I'm happy up here
Who lives in those lights in the distance 
Yeah uh huh yeah yeah
And that's the way we get by
When we're with all our friends, we will drink and laugh
Can I have some please of that
Some sick game and it's not insincere
Late nights and weekends our hearts only walk slowly on the local track
You're hoping for a ride
We got the feel good vibe to make the place jam
I like the sound of his voice
I'd get to see you again
Ooh, can we be a family
We'll share the shelter of my single bed
And I know we both need room
Yes I really need you
You think you're clever but you never say nothing at all
In the middle of a very happy ending
I only wanna find a way
Boy down at the corner store copping some smokes
I even hear you gotta new car
And, in just  year, the straight world can pay to see 
Breaking barriers, tearing walls like it's berlin
I've got a family, and I drink cups of tea
All the things in only on the screen
I'm a rocket ship on my way to Mars
Fight for yours and don't let go, don't let them compare you, no
And it will be a long time before shit
That it's okay now
You, you, you, ooh ooh ooh, you
Once in a lifetime Once in a lifetime
And I can stare into the sun
Come back round, round, round
We are skinny dipping underneath the sea
And never ever watch the ten o'clock news
I am livin' out the life of a poet
When her heart kindles next to mine
With every breath, I wish your body will be broken again, again
And still I want you all the time
With the voice in our head
You know we're all a part of the world, of course
If I went away
And although you've been a foreigner 
She got lips like a sofa
And if the sunshine has a meaning
Jump in the line, rock your body in time OK, I believe you
The rap world like, what's all this commotion
You ain't suffering
I got your days I got you on
We couldn't speak anyway
Candy, she's sweet like candy in my veins
Oh yeah I know that I'm not perfect baby
Oh girl
Am I a disappointment
He also said, "Imagine you go away
Hold me, darlin', come on, listen to me
I was messing up your signals
Warm in the woods that conceal him from light
You make me restless
Now he's unemployed he lives on milk and bread
And the dreams don't lie
So I called up Lisa
And the colors of the street signs 
Love for the single parent's that's workin' through the struggle
We fell apart in the parties of the empty heart
My friends said homie you know that your white, dude
We havin' fun partying till the break of dawn
Go baby, go go, oh we're right behind you,
Well, it's all right, as long as you got somewhere to lay
Then meet me after the world with the shivers
Drifting off to sleep drifting off to sleep
I see the birds, they fly on something
We'll be sharing the same next of kin
It starts to call on me
Because it kicks, yeah
Suspense controlling my mind
She sleeps with the covers down
The invincible, untouchable, CNN
Oh, the trees were all leafless
You've got so much to give
What you gonna do when I turn around
Heart you're stealing
Please just let me go
You would not believe your eyes
Her name is Noelle, I have a dream about her
I have a bad day
You don't see me fly into the red  one more you're done
Won't you tell me what I need
So happy, yeah, we're so happy
I sing the blues and you swallow them too
Know that you'll still do it
Lay down on daddy's lawn
'Cause he don't feel right
I want somebody to love
I'll be there when close your eyes
Here comes the mapinguari singing awww
It is such a fine and natural sight
To buy bread, milk and better homes and gardens
Have a drink, have a drive
How many acres, how much light
If the world were to die, the light will guide you True love
Start puckering up
I got ping pong Wednesday
Tokens of a lifetime
Nothing
And we'll keep working on the problem
Been mine since I was a child
When you feel too much,
Now clap your hands high, no need to be shy
It be really good for you
Well, give me all you got and don't hold it back Yeah
Anything you know you mean
I can't live without it, I can't let it go
Come and go with me
I like where we are
Yeah, sing it 'cause we're all, all, all
If she doesn't beat me, well brother she tried
And stay in bed until Sunday
We laid by a river, we looked at the stars
Oh what fun
Shoot beams lightening 
I told you a thousand times
Out in the street
The parttime jobbers at a call center
Beyond the rough where not as much is good enough
All I got's a moped moped, moped
Buzzin' in my head head head
I was told that I'm a man now and I'm not allowed to cry
I know that I could never be your man
Silly me, I left a message with no return number
Smiling, throwing kisses, busy making lazy sounds
Yes, I know sometimes we all wanna give in
Oh, Mister Blue Sky, please tell us why
Now, I've been sitting on this abandoned beach
Where cherry bombs stain the blackbirds red
You got your youth, and you got food in your belly
Same DJ's working
Creaming over tough guys
Get some new scene to wipe the dirt from everything
You're just trying to be cool in front of your mates
An octopus's garden with me
Wash away Sin City
The silver sound is all around and the colors fall like snow
And you've come around
I recall, a time when I knew it all
You're all fakes, run to your mansions
Coconut hit me on the head jonesin' for a fig
From life to life with me
What is scaring you
We blow away
Stay on the road, so I call my mama when I got time
Covered in freckles, with the occasional spot and some veins
It keeps my soul all right
You know it, ooh, ooh
And it feels so good, so good I'm on top of the world
So many special people in the world, in the world
It's making me crazy
Evocative song
Oh if you knew what it meant to me
That you'll ignore until blood shows,
Mutilating cat like eyes
Tell me that we'll always be together
To tell me that you're not the guy
Preparing to battle an enemy unseen
This is the hardest story that I've ever told
Because my dreams are bursting at the seams
Bbbbaby, I think I'm going ccccrazy
With going places
Why can't you leave me tomorrow instead
Just the way that you dance
Extended works of fiction about imaginary success
I'd sing to them with a guitar
Beat of the song song
You know my name, 
I'm traveling at the speed of light
'Cause we gonna wash away
Come home with me
Did you cash in all your dreams
Or you can break somebody's heart in two
Half past one on the dancefloor,
We hit the sky, there goes the light
You oughta know, that I'm here no matter where you go
If you're a friend of any sort
I'm gonna make it all mine
When love came and hit me in the eye
'Cause a dream's a lie
Well, it's my birthday too, yeah
Rainbow colours fading to brown
A house fit for two
So let's love fully
Upup, downdown, leftright, leftright, BA, start
Yeah, I know that I left you all alone
You and I buy star maps and drive my car around Los Angeles
You can find a better way
Adds an awful twisting touch, touch, touch, touch, touch
Held captive, the crowd was inactive
Woooohwoooohoohoohooh
Like skies that are so blue
So happy without you
Can you look at the truth
And then walked you home through the park
The train off in the distance, bicycle chained to the stairs
Donde estas, donde estas, Yolanda 
It's our world, girl
Awww, it looks good on him, look He looks great Hey king
Its gone with the wind
Put myself into bed
Hello, my baby
I've found the cure for a broken heart
You got that keeping it warm
I'd rather dance with you than talk with you 
People say, get away, somebody will turn you in
But you're all out of tune
I was dreaming of just you, now our cereal, it is warm
Them bitches sure were crunked up on it 
I call you
Is a queen formed out of flaws, with her eyes all gone odd and a rod bolted into her spine
In case the shit goes down, yeah
Fantasize long enough, you know it just might come true
I'm in the mood so baby dance
Barcelona  It was the first time that we met
Stuffing my face and now
These are the days we won't regret
To the stars now baby yeah
You are over dramatising
They know they got their heads screwed on
Nah na na no 'right
Help yourself to a bit of what is all around you
I am just starting over
Speak through these walls
Money can't buy you back the love that you had then
And if I lived in Greeceland, they'd still be Chinese children
To a place we never, ever go, go
I've been looking for a way out
Love is all you need
How can you sleep at a time like this
And I fear the guys with normal eyes
Love it love it 
Intensively she's aware,
There's a baby in the bedroom, he's starting to scream
My mind rejects the frequency
Oh, that sleepwalk should be over by now, I know
Still I notice nothing makes you shatter, no, no
Oh, I'll get 'em back in a few more tries
Jumping into the streets
be great
You were stuck in the badlands
As we change about
With your back against the wall
My heart is crammed in my cranium, and it still knows how to pound
Was anything enough to kiss the ground
Thinking of me while you are far away
Maybe tonight we could be the last shout
We'll all be gone for the summer
Put it back into the grass again
But then she started to moan
And the angels hung around
Hey, we don't know each other well
You're never coming back
On top of everything
I just got to got to got to
Is there a hand to take hold of the scene"
Oh, how I've wanted to change
Love cleans the mind
And I am right beside you
And you say
So they left the place for another school
Does anybody know
Tryin' to guess which shell living hell sleeps under
With everything I ever wrote
And feel an ocean breathing waves,
Compare where you are to where you wanna be
Well the couple with the baby and it's no secret why
Maybe I don't know how to treat you right
Still I think I'm doin' fine
When I met you, I was just a kid  hadn't built up my defenses
We are heading out of town and
Atell me all the things that I wanna hear
And I get set to exercise your right
And I fret so much about our loving 
I've got to get you into my life
If it was up to y'all I would never get discover
For figure eights in the ice in your stare, 
I was bore white, dry, and scaly
Don't you touch my boyfriend
Out of no numbers, some harsh looking colour
When they're spittin' in your eye
Came back at noon
To find an old man with a lime and a kind eye
Yeah, girl, I gotta tell you, I'm feelin' much better
Help me get my feet back on the ground
Say love will never ever be lost on me
Aye yippey aye ooh
Boom, da da, da da, boom
Or do you give yourself things to do
Oh yeah gotta stay away from my jock
And check the stove four times each day
Pretty girl, pretty boy, pony on a tin can
All of her boyfriends gonna make her feel fine
Don't let them control your life, that's just how I feel
For fear of it falling harder
But one last time let's go there, lay down beside me
And little kids sliding down the steel park slide
See I would if I could I would do anything spontaneously
You're just another song and dance"
And I can't stop
Your foots on the clutch
If it's not what you thought it was, legs are for discovering
in your eyes, i lost myself 
I've been dealing with depression ever since an adolescent
Feeling OK, feeling OK
I'm living in the moment
Don't believe a word he says
For your criminal clothing that fled the scene
And then I would become all knowing
And I can feel your rhythm if you feel my rhythm
And if you don't reach for the moon you can't fall on the stars
It's a new day, In a new land
I say oh
Or Eskimo your nose real close to mine
I have no reason to run;
Wednesday, stay with me Thursday
Well if I lived in Japan, I'd still have Chinese children
A little bit of Sandra in the sun
We are jacking the ball
I duck and I sway  what's my line
I'll meet you where the sun it always shines
Cold to the touch, right
But every weekend I see you walking with her quarter to three
Do your thing, your thing, my thing, oh oh oh oh
But you have never known
I love the wonderful thing it does
I'm the American dream 
Chimps aworking on a chain gang
Ya Don't believe me just watch, uh
Just who you are
Oh Yoko, oh Yoko, my love will turn you on
A track fiend and saw dust
In the water that we made
Hangin' out up at Laquiji rock with friends for sure
And it kinda looks just like you
Please call to say that you miss me, feel me or whatever
The great indoors
My girl's name is Senora
Talking points from talking heads
I want to be like water and slip into your throat
Leave the worried look on your lover's face
Come fly with me, let's take off in the blue
You're so scene, listening,
Dancing, dancing just feel the beat, babe
You show me yours, I'll show you mine
I would've listened to my brother when he spoke to me
I can serve sixteen ounces for six and get back ninetysix
Hey, what do you say
The one that lies close to me
I swear there's truth in that
Do what you've got to do,
We are not what you think we are, we are
Show me a rerun on the WB
It feels like you're lost
You're alright but I'm here darling to enjoy the party 
Are swans deceiving us all Oh, I for one should know
And you're bursting with pride
'Cause I am the only child there is
But they'll drop you without hesitation if you try changing the station
Everything around it isn't
Love, when I get that gig, get a crib, get a car when tha grip stack up
People throw rocks at things that shine
You can use his higher power
Time stops too when you've lost love, ahah
I feel fantastic
So let's abandon that track and leave our fathers fighting in a sack
Will have me thinking such filth I'll gouge my eyes
And if somebody's going to make it
We can do it all, just don't let the music stop
Well, I might be able to stretch it till Wednesday
Or has your life shut down
I would be right there to catch your tears
Until that day, I guess we stay
Gonna shoot somebody
You know I'm no Pinocchio, I've never told a lie
Hold back the river, hold back the river, hold back the river
Come on home
California, a place they say glistens gold
Always the same
Or hold her head down
I knew when you first said hello,
Big effects and big named stars
If you come a little close I'm going to pull your hair
'Cause I know we're taking a break
But he just wants so skin Up
And break my back  tombstoned
But you still sing
And that's okay
While Zak without a 'c' tried out some new guitars
Girl's got a love like woe Woe oh oh oh
To live my life
I'm thinking of a song or two, a boy a girl and a rendezvous
The riders on the chan de lise
And everything is going to the beat
Now its really pouring,
When I'm working, yes, I know I'm gonna be
 part nos vies qu'on laisse de côté
I'm taking far too many chances
Chocolate on the boil, steamy windows when we met
I carry myself to the fortress
He likes to remember when
They're sent by some teenager and kid whoever you are
That's just how I feel
Tudo vai permanecer igual, afinal
Every moment that will get you by
Feel today
Modern exploring of 
I love God all the same
Now I'm watching wrestling
Summer came like cinnamon
Acting out our old parts
And your daddy ain't around to pay your bills
Heart on your sleeve and your soul in your shoes
You got a million things you want to flee
The voice of  years experience
There's someone else inside my head
By all of the quiet sleepers inside the quiet earth
Like a pair of black wizards
I didn't wanna fall in love with you
Ooh, baby I know you do that to all the girls  You know that I'm fragile
What if I can't see mine
I'm still waiting for your heart
That I want you for more than a friend
It's the mines, in Africa 
I beat her and kept her apart from the things that she loved
Wherever I'm staying, you're going away
We went out late last night and we danced through the night
Ev'ry day at five
I want to go on a mountaintop
To step out of your cradle is like coming down
And I'm dancing with myself
Left you with nothing but they want some more
Shoot at a full moon  what's my line
Don't try and tell me you've been looking at me
Drivin' away
They're not gonna make their money back, you know
I want to call requests through heating vents
Boy do you hear me say
That depressed me yesterday
But I hear those voices at night
Now it's your turn
He was, he was in the churchyard
Just keep on having fun
And my suffering
Check it out, I'm rocking steady to the beat in my head
Like the way that you drive your car
The voices of the canopy singers
So now you're chasin' the American dream
Said the voice from afar
If you could make your own money and then give it to everybody 
You can do it today
Thinking about the time we share
I feel it all, I feel it all, ha
We take a walk
I don't think you know just what you're doing
Keep my head way down
He's not making much sense
The dancer, the fisher American, 'Merica
Yeah it's too late to turn your age around she's not the one you want
Nothing never I'll ever learnt
, , , you'll fall in my arms now
Sleepyhead Óró mo churaichín, churaichín
Don't tell me I don't know you
So I took you into my confidence without a thought of consequence
Like a strangers love
Yeah, everything must belong somewhere
Monday, Tuesday
What are you waiting
All these thoughts as I open up a zingo
Staring at the blank page before you
Yeah make it feel good
I hate people that think that their ass don't stink
Ooh, it feels good to be free
I feel love, yes, honestly
When half of being good is being lucky, anyways
I got troubles oh, but not today
Because I know you love me
This modern romance
If we ever go back there someday
Give my story to the children and the lesson they can read
You've got me to worry about tonight
I need to be high
You've been called here today
I should run away and think of those
I'm screaming from my bedroom window
Found myself in the city near Piccadilly
I'll keep it with mine
By the winding stream
Say that you're with me
But you counted all the seconds and it made you feel worse, 
Waiting for my travellin' light
Take it into town, happy, happy
Just smile and let it go
They've come for you and me
When the people in the city aren't the slightest pretty
But our destiny got us intertwined 
Unlike girlfriends they don't mind if you have more than one
We're back from Bloomington
Well, it's all right, as long as you lend a hand
My ears fill with the sound of your kneeling
And we're taking some pictures or something
I don't have a reason
Why can't she give some sort of sign 
They sit back and watch the evil grow from the youth club ruins where the kids used to go
Run, run, run, run, run, run
For now it conveys a subtle mystery
You and I go shopping and find exactly what we're looking for
Just to keep you around 
Now take it in but don't look down
Wilted pleasures leave you with a breath
People, just move along
All our senses come alive, let the music take me
Wake up at first light hearing you calling out
Oh twisted me, I came to eat at the hall where we danced to some duds
I have returned to the Northern skies
Makes you feel warmer when you're trying to remember
You just sit and get stoned with yearolds,
Oh language is dead,
I represent them nigga's ballin' wit' jewelry full of zickels
Come over come quick come laugh get sick
There are things that I can do things that I can do
Just enjoy the show, oh, oh
Clap along if you feel like a room without a roof
But I can't blame you, baby
Sorry I couldn't be there, I was tied to a rocking chair 
This whole life is just overrated now
What's the point of livin' if you don't take a chance
And it just kills me how they get away with murder
Can I call you just to hear you would you care
All dressed in black
I don't care what the people may say 
Worst in all the world
I went to the market to fill up my heart
'Bout their promotion of the simple life
On a sandy lawn
There's nobody else around, around
I'm driving around in my car
Who always inhales
And shout out and wave my arms and hold my tongue
So turn the lights off
Please, Mr Postman, look and see
Well if I lived in Thailand, I'd have some Chinese children
I saw an angel become the devil
It doesn't seem there's hope for me, I let you down
Down to the last cup
For to seek a warmer sky
Well, you're really cool and you always say the right things to me
'Cause some wise guy built you pretty
Boy your touch makes me feel like
And we drink our cup of laughter
Ride the tiger round the kingdom
I'm so happy that I found someone
The fantastic kids are so nasty Say what
At least she makes a lovely pair
Saturday Morning
I need to know, darling
We don't need it
Home with items in my bag from your house
The world is our dance floor now 
So let it all go by
For me, I didn't know I was sleeping 
Your picture on my wall so gentle and modest
When she was passing by
And fter all, we'll have a ball
You deserve everything
You're gonna win it for yourself and us today
Beknown, beknown future
Run run run run
But if you don't, stop there
Up in D&D, stayin with some rats and some sluts
With the girl next door
I didn't even see you coming,
Roll up, roll up for the Magical Mystery Tour
I was so near
But I hear the call of a lifetime ring
May your feet serve you well,
On a long lost day when you're gray and dull
Making excuses for his dodgy holiday
I don't want to say goodnight to records I love
I can't stop dancing dancing
What is the outcome
Suits me very fine
We're off to new lands
Burned deep into my brain
That's where mine go
Sing the last thing on your mind
Looping round and round to me
But I'll keep trying to stay this way
'Cause on my feet are shoes for dancing
Who let you down
Your love makes me feel like
Well the girls can't stand her
Singin' along to the words you don't know
Let's get nice and friendly, join us for a surfride in the mud
When you can't sleep, well you can't dream
She said she'd had enough of playing games
So stand Stand
It's been a long, lonely time
Know this ain't going away, here to stay,
Wherever I'm going, I'm already home
Someday you're going to realise
But the hard times are golden
All that I can say
We'll get hot by the refrigerator
When I was loving
Ain't gotten to except at a slant
Yeah, we're alright though
There must be enough love around the world
You can hear the waves in underwater caves
And I start to complain that there's no rain
Hand to mouth
Well I know that it's late
The world is just waiting now 
But I still want more, with the cuts and the bruises
To see it come to an end
Then please don't go
Infact I feel like I just
I want to see your sunshine
And I'm lovin' every step I take
But every time it comes out the same
He's building up a shine but he take it slow
And if I could reverse it, I don't think that it'd be worth it because I know in my heart I would never let you tumble to the ground
I feel like my heart was broken
Oh please, Daddy, please"
I hope the world is treating you right 
So polite, we're busy still saying please
And what is mine
What's the harm in knowing one more
All things grow, all things grow
Turn it up turn it up mash it up
It goes while you're here
At the speed of sound
You always look so beautiful
So let your hips do the talking 
He's been fighting all his life
Well there's a light on
We were darting from the place where we just couldn't fit,
Do you know what it's like to care too much
You know what to do
My girl, she know what to do
I can shine my light on you
Don't want to meet your daddy Hey ya
I put a pillow right on top of my head
Still they walk pretty good hand in hand
We'll dance until morning till there's just you and me
So release the dove into flight now,
Of a thousand centuries of death
Bombs away
And I'm feeling alone
Yo baby, can I get another lap dance I tell you I
Third time they called me was cold as ice,
Nothing's worrying me
Now and then you can bend
But you could be my demon
The city is a million miles away
Bursts are made to colour me rich
She took an apartment in Washington Heights
And I can't control it, I can't hold it, it's so nuts
Marry the man and then spend a long, sweet night
Well your wartime is funny
And when Zak finished Sara's song, Sara clapped
Sometimes it gets lonely
Well he's watching all the wealthy folk on his way to work
Now I'm away, I write home everyday
It's been hardly a moment
And you don't know what you've lost
Gonna' fly this place so high that I won't know what's real
Got you scared of ghosts in the dead of night
But I never had the feeling I could offer that to you
Oh, comes down to hope, came down on me
She said, "Shut up and dance with me"
You already know what it is, man, this ain't nothin' new to y'all, man Yeah yeah ha ay
Hurry up and get a move on
And a taste that's floating
I'm taking my time, but I don't know where
Daddy left when I was three
And even then we'll start again and just pretend that
But c'mon get back up
The devil's in the air and I'm spitting out prayers,
Do it for the living and do it for the dead
Shot callers, What are you a preacher
On dark and stormy days, somewhere it's glowing
Well I got mine, you got yours babe
If I'm to know
For all the niggas who keep askin, when CNN gonna do a joint with Premier
I'm not goin' to school
So many people I know, they're just tryna touch ya
Eh, eh eh, eh  There's nothing else I can say
Do you know what it's like to fall on the floor
Please tell me that you've got me and you're never gonna leave
You must try to understand try to understand
And wait to be called
Now the funny glare to pay a gleaming tear in a staring under heat
Attack We keep it on the dance floor
You know dessert comes last
Not when she hugs me and says she loves me so
'Cause they're calling me by my name
Guess it was meant to be
So now I always, always hold my breath you see
Five cold years
Is what you gave to me the day I wandered
You're underneath my skin but I'm confused
Life is a flower
Love will never ever be lost on me, oh not tonight
Take all of your money give it off to charitytytyty
Have to contend with it all night
I got yours and you got mine
You know it kills me to see such a pretty girl so tired
This land is not your land
Maxine, put your red shoes on
I was lost and uncertain
Why don't you let me 
And to this day
The Queen says no to potsmoking FBI members
Kodachrome
Hey man, now you're really livin'
In the middle of nowhere
How my heart seemed to leap out of me
You oughta know that I'm here no matter where you go
And I know we'd do anything for love Oh yeah
But she'll always be his girl
A stomach full of pills didn't work again
Well I'm afraid I'm not gonna give you back any of those kilojoules
And if it looks like this, then you're doing it right
Just don't stop let's keep the beat pumpin'
But most times I've met those with a narrow mind
It feels like
That's right, look up my number Hey
You know I've seen her in her uptown world uptown world
I feel
I know happiness writes white, I know happiness writes white
But you're always on the run
I'm seeing Hollywood stars
We're so ahead of this
Now I'm looking up at you
I've got to change your mind I've got to change your mind
And if you need me
The whole town is laughing
Of the little things
It's the last  hours and this whole world is ours eternally, eternally
Served on a leafy bed of sixteen military wives
But I would walk five hundred miles
Yeah this is a feeling I'm not used to
You don't need no Hallows Eve
So all your fashion sense aware, the sweaters unfold themselves
There are some squirrels jumping in the trees
Do, yeah yeah
You know, it seems the more we talk about it
I'm taking a vacation, I'll see you at the station
It's a new start
Hit the finish line
Dip it in a dream
But don't say a word, till they teach you the way
How you got there, so just blow your mind
No fact or fiction or storyline
Well then I hate to say it, but it's obvious
I've got no claims to your crown Let you settle down
You're a carousel
That's good
Graft my heart upon the vine
I like this kind of, hot kind of music
I had a million things to do baby
So please don't make me wait, 'cause I don't wanna break
She's like a rainbow
And lead you through the dance floor
Will I pay for who I been
Around my arms and began to shiver violently before
With the mirror reflection
Oh, I remember you said can I fight and breathe
So can I break your sentiment
Sipping on the sweet nectar of your memories
You get what you take
Dear Valerie Plame, I'll look for that long exchange
Well, Stevie knows and I thank her so
What makes you think that it won't grow back
And it feels like heaven
I've been slipping through the years 
We live in a free world
When the night falls
'Cause it's ok if you don't know everything
Whoa, come on out and make romance
But now I'll show that I know
Maybe you been caught out once before
I'll make you laugh by acting like the guy who sings 
His vision borrows mine
Fuck all you bitches and I'll never call
Walking on the milky way
Hear the bells are ringing joyful and triumphant and
Inside I'm burning
When I worry about smoke 'stead of putting out the fire
You ain't never gonna know me
And check your credit on your new Nokia
And as my steps echo echo,
He's not your boyfriend
I can tell that you have got the same for me
I'm so embarrassed for mankind
You said you hate the way they scrape their brakes all over town
Of thirtytwo gently clenching wrinkled little hands
Molly stays at home and does her pretty face
Carry your love in a trinket hanging round your throat
If you're messing with a good heart
And timing changes everything when I was right
Anything to show you
Like Wilson Bentley found on black velvet
Is The Equipment In A Pyramid
CNN, CNN, Capone and Noreaga, you know what I'm sayin'
Are you feeling, feeling, feeling like I'm, feeling
I held my breath every time
So I gave my heart completely  Vaseline all over the lenses
She'd have to tow the line, she'd have to give it a go
A wicked lady, sittin' by my side, sayin' "Where are we"
I'd feel for certain I was bedroom dancing
It's been a long time comin' since I seen your face
If I lived in this land, if I lived in that land, uh huh
Look at all the people, happy faces all around
To stay awake
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
But I'll break them to
I got tha, mentality and tha motive I'm on a mission
DJ drop the record, I'mma start a stampede
We have got to leave all that behind
You know it makes my heart beat
"Yourself and tourists, yeah that's what I hate"
Have we missed an opportunity 
Like open minds for us
Sprinkle it with dew
Or in between the attic and the basement
For all the AM phone calls
Fridays I see your face
Sometimes there's bullshit that don't work now 
And you will never touch my hand
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes
Boy now you are really, really bugging
There's nothing at all
We'll get there fast
Clap your hands once and clap your hands twice
'cause hopelessly the hope is we have so much to feel good about
The rest don't really matter now anyway honey
I wanna breathe in a sunlight beam
Your girlfriend says it's time to sell,
Held together, holding each other with no one else in mind
After the struggle, Id watch the sand settle
Woman, I don't need it
And there's nothing wrong with the look that's in her eyes
Six pounds and seven ounces A ball of bones and flesh and tears were you
If you wanna have a good time
Come and get it
But my middle finger is going to carry it out
You are the light
I don't care about the world
Oh yeah yeah 
At the end of the day, when there's no one watching
Well, it's all right, everything'll work out fine
I'm in love but its only temporary
If I had the chance I'd do it over again
I thought if I succeeded I'd be happy and they'd go away
Play that thing
Yeah, baby, you got me
I was a better honey, so I did it again
Yeah you need to direct them this way
Peradventure we might play
Lucky Strike and I will travel woo hoo
I know everything's going to be alright
That looked like helium
There's something about you and I can't help but show it
"The Whiz Man" will never fit you like "The Whiz Kid" did
Yeah, yeah, yeah, who can take tomorrow
Shake shake shimmy without you
That said "use these down to your bones"
I was walking home alone,
Hold me close, we're falling to the ground
When the sun shines down what's left of me
Take it back if I thought it'd make it work
Maybe somewhere down the road when somebody plays At the end of the line
'Cause you're so ooh Tootootoo, so ah Tootootoo, so cool
And they're shining down their light to bring you back again
But it's not funny
You're just the one that I've been waiting for
From my sleep behind the wheel
The day away
Maybe we're lying, then you better not stay
I wish I were free from this pain in me
Are you with me now
Strolling so casually
Oh how I hope that you're happy
It's what a heart is for
And that's got to be, because I never even think of making it
Kiss me down by the broken treehouse
And words come out, words come out like
Dip it in a dream
'Cause I'm falling bad for you
A little dream together
You just wanna dance
My heart is crammed in my cranium, and it still knows how to pound How to pound
A string of verses that goes on and on and on
Time to take a chance here
I reckon it's again my turn to win some or learn some
And the bag across her shoulder
So please forgive the words I use my mind it tends to run
Shake it, shake it, susugar
Would you turn me down if I'm not what you're looking for
C'mon
You were born to love this scene 
And I wrote my girl, told her I would not return
But maybe someday when my ship comes in
I'm just to hollow inside
Declared a war
Well, you and me, we'd run away to be wherever our adventure awaits,
'Cause I made this bed
My head is spinning
Payback the camel
Always in love
We got all we need so here we go
'Cause I got no sun down
And on the drive back to my house
And we blow away
Here she comes
You can make it, make it good and really fine
And freedom can be an empty cup from which everybody want to drink
By the bedrock
And let your love bind you to all living things
A little bit of heaven but a little bit of hell
With every breath, I wish your body will be broken again
And I know
Will come alive
But it doesn't really matter
Of any sort, then please don't go
But there's a light on in Chicago
I don't care, whoa oh oh oh
And he'd simply kick my ass if he knew the truth
'Cause I'll be there, wherever you are
To spy and try to poke your eyes,
Although it was sad, I couldn't help but laugh
And when I wake tomorrow, I'll bet
And I can start a book
You know I wish I was an ocean
Back in the old days, tight like a fight,
I've got the mind to walk away
I seen ya, I seen ya, I seen ya standing in it every time
No On Knew Her Worth
Storybook endings, fairy tales coming true 
In my mind, a hard lesson to learn
Anything we've ever owned
I was on my back staring at stars 
Time comes and goes
And the weeks fly by and the years roll on
Well you better go back to beautiful Texas
But you won't see me wasting the best thing I ever had
Underneath soft sun, chewing Nicorette
I am my voice
And I know one thing
Because you tend to take them turns just a little too fast
I'd like to turn you all upside down
I came to the city
You've even got money to spend
One of the beautiful people
Con la cara hacia atrás
Back in school again
Seems impossible to face
You've denied me baby,
Should we take the chance The chance, chance
So many turns that I can't see
As I lay me back to sleep 
Six in the morning
The time is short You know we only live one life
My uptown girl
This string keeps cutting out,
Only you make me feel the same
We don't need to drive, oh no
As long as I can feel the beat
Just give me a call
What's the use of money of you got no time to use it
Why I don't cry when my dog runs away
Yeah, he's got a shot though No, not really
Where's the love
Within shouting distance, you can hear a blind man's bluff
There ain't no way the gangstas say
Thank you for coming out this evening,
And look it's on my backx
I wish you thought that I was dead
Strings that bowed in concert, make a symphony
I raise my head and whisper
And all the earthly things they stop to play
No I can't say that I'm in love
As usual you'll get your way
I fear I won't see surprise
Hanging out his mouth, he's a cowboy kid
And all I know is it's wrong
Human law, automatic oracles
I hope you got a healthy appetite
To the point that no one would even believe that we existed
If you ain't ever been to the suburbs, don't you ever come to the suburbs,
In the back of my Cadillac 
You just need
Mum and Daddy would be so proud Time is taking lies
I'm gonna tilt a while
You really got a hold on me
In your tank top, rainbow styling
I knew the worthless dregs we've always been
Far away from each other every day
While I try to find words
I know I've got to let it go
If i ask 'how do you say' Colombian Accent 
They don't teach humility
While cookin' up bones
You look so good in the clothes of a poser
From all the things and the thoughts and assumptions that I had wrong
We all got our stories but please tell me
In this game you lose
That your fathers set before you
'Cause I'm a little bit tired of fearing that I'll be the bad fruit nobody
Hello, hello, hello
But it's always the same problem, in the end,
Didn't want you sleeping with a boy too long
Wanna run away
Instant Karma's gonna get you
Put dirtballs in your pocket
With your long blonde hair and your eyes of blue 
Make a dragon wanna retire, man
Feel the beat of the drum
You're a butterfly in the wind without a care
Maybe you'd be better with a Barbie girl
Hear the sound coming round, see what you nearly missed
And the sleek sleek skeleton I hold
Do you want to fuck like you know I do
Staggerin, bang like the wild Aficans
Well hot dog, I'm a chewing machine
Wherever it goes, I always know
Loneliness, don't come around here
They never stopped moving
And on the days I stayed in bed I sang and sang and sang
Bonsoir Jacqueline, bonsoir à toutes et à tous Pour toutes les zones de la mer du Nord et de la Manche
There's Nothing To Know
The mystery you're trying to preserve
But I still want your love
And I wish I could say that it ended just fine
You were young and man you were sad 
It's fine with me, I'm just taking in the scenery
At least a million times
It makes me crazy
What makes you think you're something special when you smile
So I rode my bike like lightning
I never wanna shake their hands and stay
I was only a baby
You feel emotional
And I know that it's a wonderful world
And would you make sure my mother gets half my weight in gold
Stepping out tonight, flying so high
To your golden age where they tuck you in at night
And you look like
You were racing in a car
I started crying
Why must you keep me in your prison at night
Oh, skip to the ending
The actress gave up all her old dreams
That they inflicted on you along the way 
I'm gonna have a party
The future's open wide
The house we got at Sears Illi'
Asleep and constantly floating away
If I could part
How I know
Will cast down things
It's the best Beats the rest
When you're looking at the rain
With just one more day one more day
If I could do just one near perfect thing I'd be happy
Did you feel it
You take all my pain away from me
Shakespeare
And if you wait a little my pretty friend
And no one wants a tune about the th luftballoon 
And behind closed eyes, I cannot make them go away 
Emptier still and there probably won't be
With a couple of gold coins
So, let's go
A reconstruction of where you've always been
Composing their songs of love
Please don't despair
Oh, but I'll be right there beside you,
To get it right tonight
I was high from playing shows
Trash sack, jump back, EFG
Let's save our troubles for another day ooh
In my pocket piece of paper and a key
We put on our makeup and work out all the leadins
Yeah, you wet through and me headfirst
I was too proud to see 
Du kommst nie dahinter,
I starting sending you a note
That the people there aren't inviting
It felt so sweet, it felt so strong
Say the word and you'll be free 
Shit And look at me can't think of anything better to do
I thought it better not to fight, I thought there was a virtue in always being cool
You're so ooh You're so, so ah You're so, so cool Baby, you're so supersupremelybabadioh
She wants everyone to sit around, talk about her life
I'm beggin' not to fall
And find what you are here for
'Cause I'd get a thousand hugs
Old teenage hopes are alive at your door
To stay with him for worse and for better 
And can I wait for my decoder
And he's just put the paint on his new boat
Dancing girls at the Candybox Night
You tore away my shirt
All alone in the clear view
everything we've become, you're all that I need
But I don't, man
We haunt the ins and outs of this house of our gracious host
Don't go away we're so near
You feel the sunlight
Just enjoy the show
We are here to save your life
Attempting to walk
Went plat', mad bottles I'm toasting
Oh I'm away with the fairies now
I stay game till sun'll shake my shoulders
And a snake it bit you
When I get down, I get so down
Anything fly, it's all good, let me dump it
But if he doesn't stop fucking with me
You know, you know, you know my name You know my name
I get a lotta doubletakes when I'm comin' around the corners
I'll loosen my hold
Pick up the phone  listen to me moan
Eagle eye, eagle eye
Oh, they'll split before they part
And I'll blend up that rainbow above you
The trumpets call out now
You don't ever need to be lonely
You come to me, you're my best friend
I need to be high 
We took the tourist route, the nights are light until midnight Light until midnight
Of his golden thread
'Cause no one's really watching
The writin's on the wall
Heard of milk great things, speaking soft and thick
You cast your line and hope you get a bite
Old dirt road
I'm gonna lay right down here in the grass
Would you care to sit with me
You're lovely baby, this war is crazy, I won't let you down, OH NO no
Mother I can tell what you've been thinking
Shake shake shimmy shimmy
You jumped into my heart, now I couldn't start
And what l feel
How you gonna feel when it's all found out
You could cut all the telephone wires
Stare into the sun, stare into the sun
Nobody else, nobody else
We were love at first sight, now it's crush, it's crushing
Maybe I won't, but your cold eyes baby
In the ivory dome you've made it your home
There's a girl right next to you
In a crossfire kind of new reality show
Now that summer is gone, you have to go back home
It's here in my heart and it's here in my head
Good day, sunshine
I've seen a half a dozen ghosts but I don't believe 
Somewhere in the back of my mind
Try not to worry 'bout a thing
They said farewell
We just look a lot better in the blue light
And a five mile sky over me
In my arms, in my head, in my eyes, in my heart
Get up in the morning
It don't matter if it's rain or shine
And all the good times on which we do depend
All the grittiness of life
Tha taste of your lips
And move away to the Midwest
But it's a while since you shut that door
And you're all working in a submarine"
And heres to my lovers hands and feet
She'll never forget it
As I walked down the alleyway it was a Sunday
D'a lic'enca um momento         	        Excuse me, one moment
In the van with my friend
I used to get mad at my school Now I can't complain
La maison, la maison d'autrefois, la maison la maison d'avenir
That's how I know
But you could get back down, you can get back down
Alcoholic and very bitter
Will you make my children bear
Back to the street, back to the place
These dreams under my pillow 
And I feel it's time that you should know
In the land where the furniture folds to a much smaller size
In my heart this way
All this justice in my hands
And I'll fight their doubt and give you faith with this song for you
Cclimb right on me, llay it on me
I got a greeting, can't say what it's all about 
I was walking, like I said, by myself
What'll be revealed today
You know my name, look up the number
And the way it came down to me
Oh and I have returned to the somber greens
Scootch over closer dear
And I got more balls than the daily lottery
Yeah, that's a slowrolling country caravan of many sons
Up in the sky Honolulu bound
You're gonna hit me with a big wave
So with enough that I can afford
And no, none of it's true 'cause I never knew you
All the clouds have silver linings ohohoh, ohohoh
Will it bring you down
"The world is everlasting
He's on a strike and looking for you
I can play the guitar like a motherfuckin' riot
Measuring your dreams of this life seems
With a heart of gold and arms to fall into
Oh, something
Lost in the ether with no one to blame
Lala, how the life goes on ha ha ha ha
Don't play it safe 
Free, yeah, and you can know it all
That's why I'm standing here today
Reruns get me so bored
I love you baby rest of my life
Who's got the looks
Well do you want to fall apart
I was raised in a Catholic school
In the blackout they dance right into the aisle
Midnight at the shoreline, fireworks above us
They say you have to be someone's
I could be but here in your arms
Loove, love
Making sure I'm not in too deep
Don't I need to see you pull your knee socks up
Hit the town, fool around, let's go party
I love to take a photograph
That was one lonely night
Oh, I see what the world can't show me can't show me
No one wants to hear about your th tear, 
Ooh, yeah
The reason for aviation
All my friends begin to weep
Take that gross look off your faces
Or lose faith in yourself
You're from outer space
And the sight
Down with abandon and no understanding 
Adrift on the sea
And the anchor person on TV
There were people who needed something from me 
I sat on feelings that I buried deep down
If what they say is
 years
Six days without sleep means
'Cause we gotta a lot of things to do now
I can feel, I can feel, I can feel the celestial beings
We're young enough to say
You would not stay
But when the night is falling
I got you on
Oh no it's not the life that I chose
She turns a lonely room into a happy place
Impaired my tribal lunarspeak
I would like to think that you'd know your way
We're out for beerhunt, look out for our razzia, hands up, hit and run
I survived the livest niggas around
Don't bother to pack your bags or your map
Nothing else is love
Who gives a damn about the family you come from
Oh, you think you've got it
Load the box and then pump that shit
I used to have to stay in this locked up basement
Lies are gonna get you some day
Do the signs begin to show
Take your shoes off, man
This wasn't supposed to happen
And we should've known
Who's always sure of where you are
Your holiday
Life, life, without surrender
I say only if it's better
All things go, all things go I made a lot of mistakes
No one will ever forget your name
And I just get sick of the things that we think, we think we know
People, happy people
I can't stay, so far
I want to play, you're in the way of our sunshine
It's not a change, it's just a slight vacation
Don't tell me, I already know
Like kerosene for dee dee scene
I feel so happy these days
Touch the rocks
Don't ever close your mouth,
The dog days are over
We play in a bar
Can't cushion the beats of my heart,
You and me, no one else, nothing else but us right now
You go tie a string around us
Until you lose your hair, oh
On the window near my bed
I don't care for walkin' downtown
Went to the corner of a second and main
We're gonna run away, we're gonna run away
Don't you know they ain't never going to but I feel okay
I just got paid, we've got it made, ready to go
We've got a reason to keep holding on, tomorrow has become today
Oohoohwee, wild night is calling
Can't say it's been there once and for all
Kind of frail, I feel it in my bones
I'd be fired if that were my job
I admit it's getting better Better
I'll try hard not to pretend
If you want to know the truth
There's a big day waiting for you
So won't you tell me my future
While the world just stayed the same
And it almost blows my mind
Try not to move so fast
What are the forces that try to tease us
And you don't know how it feels to be alive
And you're in a rut, and I know that you know what I mean
Sometimes you just can't hold back the river
This is the summer
Oh, here she comes
Closer to the mountains, woods, oceans, and rivers and trees
Every women too
With a little help from my friends
You've got to
People still actually give a shit about the Queen
I was thinking of things the blue ocean brings
Candlelight, coconut ice
That you may reasonably require
There's a shortcut through the forest that smells
Don't panic, panic, don't act too manic, manic
Whisky that came from Twickenham
Never be who you aren't
Why would I stick around Oh why would I
We are okay, we are alright
The parents are sleeping soundly
She's winding 'em down on her clock machine
When I feel put down I try to shake it off quick
Oh my crush, I've gotta crush
I'm going out with Fontaine
Backward I brood and forward I dream for figments of existence
My star girl, rules the skies
Ever fallen in love
I'm gonna dream about the time when I'm with you
I'm feeling like a lost little boy in a brand new town
Haven't you noticed I've been shedding all of mine
Scared of what I'm feeling
Been caught without her knickers on been caught without her knickers on
And I sing songs back to back until I go to bed
Two kids, a dog, and then the cautionary wife
Nothing is ever quite the same, really
I've already noticed the many cuts 
Me, I write the song that ends right when it starts,
But when I get back home you're always there to rub my back
And I'm wastin' everyday, hey, hey, hey
You worry on your mental health
Lying here asleep on a sunbeam 
I keep sketching birds, that are all like herds
Never be said that I'd be unstable
I don't care 'bout that, I don't care 'bout that
'Cause I keep on forgetting myself
Got my toes on my pup at the foot of my bed
I left you with your nose a bleedin'
Now listen to the beat
That's who you've got to be
Cause I'm havin' a good time
There's a ball at the castle and I've been invited
This world has a warm, sunny heart
I used to see you every day
Tell me how you feel about me
One day girl
So come on, Davey, sing me something that I know
About your hair you needn't care
Our love is so alive
I'm having a good time and of that I am proud
We've got a beat, beat, beat, that will beat your beat
In a cartoon graveyard
Now we're finally standing up to the sky
Tell me 'cause I don't want you to
Who thinks that you're one of a kind
To these tiresome paper dreams
And if you are a deity of any sort
Cause you left me out in the cold
In your mind
PreChorus 'Cause I would go the distance for you, baby I'd travel 'round the world if you would let me
Smiling in the pictures you would take
When you're chewing on life's gristle
The sun is shining in her sky
Hey friends, break in the back door
I was never young
I'm thinking about you
I hate every single movie by that midget Spike Lee
All the sadness, all the rage
Up above the world
So let's screw this one up right
She said what did you think your mother would do this and how would your father react oh lord
I could live with so many burdens 
So breathe in and breate out 
I don't know what are you now
I like to move around
I wonder could they tell, how did they know
Say a prayer to the man above
And that changes everything
Call on the man
Floating down the Pontchartrain
I've got buttons for my coat
He said to hope for the best
It's our favorite part of the story 
I see the road is long, so get on my side
Is 'cause I was never broken by you
Girl you got me wishin' this would happen every night
Put it in the ground where the flowers grow
Right, now, it's something you create
I'm laughing at clouds
'Cause I'm feeling kinda good
The way you moveit's wonderful
How come it ended up like this
Father of the son
Ambitions are already starting to fade 
To taking props from nineties boy band fashions
Oh, you know I would go the distance
That float and turn and hold the flecks of light,
I'm in love, but I'm lazy
Shaking off a heavy one
Don't blow me, baby
You know he's so much more like Spiderman than you will ever, ever be
I have a hammer, a hammer to break down,
'Cause music is the power, power, submit to the sound
We are young
And I know how you've hurt
Numetal friends and what became of them
And what about your friends
We felt our hearts so strong
Reminds me of something else
But I really don't know how,
Tell your boss that you've gone away
Yes, I'm havin' a good time
Who knows you can't be replaced
'Cause there'll be sun and snow and a horse Jethro
But then you dance dande dance with the women that lets you
The spirit, the carpenter
A feather in the sunshine
And bend their heads all adown
Just keep on getting down
And waste the afternoon
I want to get along with you
How 'bout the tree back your house where the owls go
I'm a sight to see
That's the life I choose
Forget what happened yesterday
* He sings "the radio" but mimes "my radio" in the official video
An end to that my friends
I can't see me loving nobody but you
I should've guessed that you'd be just like all the rest
You've got your dreams, I've got mine too
Therefore we are
I can't stop the tape machine
Any day I'll come back thinking that if one is against me
We're flying through the night way up high
Those nasty kids are fantastic
This feeling of tenderness
Well, in the waiting room while waiting for news of you, 
Messageminder
And if your the type of girl that do anything me please
Well I'd like to spread your perfume around the old apartment
Ow woo woo woo woo
That I've been sure of,
You kissed me on the forehead, now this kiss is giving me a concussion
You ring the bell, bim, bam
Four forever, two together, we'll play dead, we'll play dead We'll play deadly
Just because I'm in love
For having fun
We're sick like animals, we play pretend
Once clear together now one's passing
I know that you can hold me down
Any more tears for the birthing pool
Your mother should know know
How could I ever forget you
Are you trying to stop it Everyone's watching
That when I see my lady
Let's get something to eat
There's no sense in complaining 
Und bis ich die Kohle irgendwann dann mal zusammenkratze
Ça commence à faire froid ici
In the end, you find out that my heart was battered
Of the song song
And she do what I say and I say what I mean
Some people ride the wave of mediocrity
With every bubble she sank with a drink
Soon as I get up it's just another day, another dollar
That I can't tell you anything
Like we've done for years 
Then I learned to play some lead guitar
Everything fades away
Gonna be all right
Push through, push through baby
And there are no floors beneath me
The moonlight sleeping on a midnight lake
But right now, CNN and Premier nigga, do it like this nigga
'Cause today's the day I got over you
Bringing peanut butter jelly and other snacks
It's such, it's such a perfect day
Yes the type of lovn' that can tear mine apart
The carpet and the trade
Models and magazines a striking runway entrance
Just think while you've been getting down and out about the liars and the dirty, dirty cheats of the world
When chandeliers light up the engine room
They'll search the buildings, collect gold fillings, wallets, and rings Oh yeah
But in the end he'll soon recover
Shake you coconuts, come on, coco girls
Living my life
You've got to be good to yourself
And years from now you'll make it to the next world
We have fun we have fun we have fun when we please
The city's changing
Are you callin' me darlin'
I guess that I was afraid that if you rolled away
Come out to the west backsides of my eyes
Waving goodbye to the audience
Dirty talk talk talk quiet
You want a new song
A love attack
Really don't matter 
Take off your shoes and socks
Still it made us kind of happy and it kept me off of drugs
'Cause lovin' is what I got, I said remember that
You don't get what you don't deserve
Follow you home
To get this off the ground
The Macon county cars,
You can make the blue sky blush
So you know the time, so you know the time
Neon black future charging like a bull with a funeral bouqet ready to explode
I feel mighty fine, y'all
Smiles grotesquely in the light of the day
And the sidewalk bagatelles, it's like a dream
Feels like I've been here before
Dancing, dancing I'm in the mood, babe
Everything is gonna be alright
Was only Spring's lost bets 
Go ahead
You watered me down till I drifted abound
I'll be the girl of his dreams maybe
Two sisters,
Who told you to play the victim
Pay the piggy back,
You're all our brothers, sisters and our babies
Billy Shakespeare wrote a whole bunch of sonnets
Get your green green tambourine, it never gets dark
Just clap your hands But I just look funny
Should I tear up the letters signed signed from my black knight who thrills me
All along I was faking my own suicide
Sailing sasailing through the clouds
And there's a lot to be said and to be done today
Your heart will attack, even if she falls in love
You're gonna say you love me too, oh
Heads are holes and clouds
To The Village Voice
And I'm never gonna get it just because of my bad credit
I got a family, and I drink cups of tea
And other dreary worlds you know
Talk about your childhood wishes
I'll never act my age
This life is so confusing
In the twilight
And if ever you find your love,
Is always greener in someone else's yard
And to the moon's delight,
Honey, I ain't never had nobody like you
I'm going home alone
Then the conversation stopped, and I looked down at the ring
Before you go and break her heart
If you're friends with P
Another year and the job was done
They break and they bend
I would fall beneath your feet
I fear the need to standardise
Hang up the chick habit
And everything I do
Maybe we were born to love each other
The strong in me, I still smile
A roomful of dust and a broom to sweep up
Common and breathless, shrugging at what they've become
I don't feel like I'm falling
I got me goin' crazy
You got it all wrong
You can call me Travie Claus, minus the ho ho
Call me up before you're dead, we can make some plans instead
And in the end what have we learned
Who give into romance like hands give into gloves
Father, I will always be
But now I don't interest you, I'm like a blog from 
I would never bring you down, so down
Godgiven grace and a holy Heaven face
Can put back together
With a little luck we could get away from where we are
'Cause for all we know
Cigarette Barbie
All I know is my steak tastes better when I take my steak tastes better pill
We in recession, but let me take a crack at it
Kiss him in the face with no lips and no tongue
I wish that I could swim and sleep like a shark does
Little codes bring the balance to none 
I've got a lot over here without you
I might have looked the other way
Uptown funk you up woo, come on
A lazy day
oh, arm in arm with all the harmless sociopaths
And the dance music
Oh I've been watching
Oh baby, I'll beg I'll beg
I will let you into my dreams
That I'm confusing while abusing my mind
If you trip over I'll catch you're fall
Three little birds, sat on my window
I'm getting up and coming over
While the sun hangs high up above
We walk
Your feelings you shouldn't
I just can't sit back and watch you waste your life away
The Theodore Unit, we controllin' the club
So he waits behind 
Back in the pub the governor stops the clock
And I cannot help but ignore the people staring at my scars
Let me be the one to lift your heart up and save your life,
Work hard, now we know how to top bills
Johanna drove slowly into the city
That can make a storm cloud break
I get sad just thinking
Just keep walkin' on
Oh I can't stop it
Can we forget
I am swallowed by the guilt of this
Shake your body line
'Cause I'm becoming someone else
Just another day in the hood lalalala, lalalalalala
Vom leuchtenden Saft mit der feurigen Kraft,
"Don't you know it doesn't have to be so hard"
Hey, boy, oi, where you at
We don't need to
You know you love me and it shows
And you get the evil eye
But the musicals don't play with me
From now on call me Royal Blue
Oh yeah she's losing it
A pack of men, they're yours to stay,
And when you make it back to Nashville
I'm not complaining that it's raining, I'm just saying that I like it a lot
But you can tell by the lines in my smile
'Cause you're my only friend
It's not right
Like drunks we spin until we're sick 
Yeah, I met somebody in a sea of people, and that's just how I'll leave it
About the man that you'd become and the positions you'd hold
Now you got me missing you
I always know
I want it all to be gone tomorrow
So I gotta go, gotta go,
Yeah it's all right, all right, tonight, tonight
That's the way I like it and I'll never get bored
What did he spend it all on
From all the boys the one I take home is music
When the night comes
You'll bring me flowers and you'll bring the showers
But no, I won't get that call
And the world is possibility
The ground control couldn't stop them
I'm on my way now
I built this cardboard neighborhoods disgrace
Boy just stop what your doin' and come and follow me around
And when I come home When I come home, yes, I know I'm gonna be
Somehow, someway
Gotta save for rainy days
Had a conversation with you at night
Everything I've learned
Tell me what your point is in defense
But we'll search 'til we grow old
Go baby, go go, we're right behind you,
Be strong, get off at the next stop
I'm holding your hand by the shore
All I gotta say is I must've done something right
Dance with me pretty boy tonight,
And It's frayed at both the ends
I wanna live my life now
Just yell out my name baby
Just a boy and a girl gonna take on the world
And there's a thousand chances to get it right
Uhhuh, goddamn right, it's a beautiful day
Don't recall a time I felt this alive
And I'm sure you had your reasons you change 'em every season
And rage
I'm living every moment, girl, for you 
When all our friends were there
It's not you, it's not mine
We're the outsiders
That's why I'm standing on the overpass screaming at myself
And we will wait for you
I've been waiting such a long a long, long time
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet
If I should fall away
George Burns' pacemaker beats steady slow and low
And the things you loathe
People in love get fast and foolish
Ignore them for a little while
Teacher marks our height against the wall
I can't help but lose my temper and I don't know why 
You can't respect me 'cause I've done so much for you"
And I just can't wait to be home
You look like someone
You know I should 
Call up my mama, said I'm in love with a stripper yo
But it makes me think I'm winning
So put your arms around me
But you don't bode, you don't pay, you got everything you need
And I feel like
I make these phoney ropes but I know
Wake up song
It was quite a day hey hey
I'm still into you
There ain't nothing left to prove
Folk take for granted as they walk to church
Oh, I think I need your help
Don't it feel like sunshine after all
Some days I wake up dreaming
Oh yes we're rolling
And I use mouthwash  Sometimes I floss;
Especially me, sister you've got it all
When I always wanna be else where
If you have to come and choose a name"
Tungsun
Ordinary thoughts
Stole my temper back from the lost and found
Somebody will take you there
At the altar of someone else's love for me
Walking waking on a crowded street
Ba duba dop ba do, yeah yeah
And they sell things for apartments smaller than mine
Off the darkness that comes in sometimes
The moonlight lingers softly in the air,
Late nights and early parades and early parades
My head it tends to stray away, sometimes I can't see clear
When the music's making people tonguetied
Back to where we left off, baby
I got a whole bag of trouble to be taken away
And pulled my legs apart
Lightly on your rightwing shoulder
We are collapsed in the act of just being here
For us to make a home
So put your faith in a late night show
He doesn't know what he wants to know
No me tengas mas consideración
Talking, only me and you
Just for tonight
We're going at it tonight, tonight
And now it's two o'clock on the dancefloor,
You left me at home
Leave the bird you killed at your father's feet
Yes it's clear to me that this life is gonna be
On the darkside let the light shine
Sweetheart I'm telling you
Can I say no
I'll be out of my mind
'Cause I wanna go where the people go
Maybe I just need a change, maybe I just need a new cologne
You'll make a sharp one being so kind
'Round and 'round drama every time
And true, you might get away with it
It sets my heart on fire
We can stick around and see this night through
His hat is a funny shape, his heart is a brick
To me ain't nothing else
The only thing there is to say
I'll stay forever with you
Rosetinted view 
So get yourself into a ranchstyle home
I know, I know, I know, I know
Neighborhoods under the lights
Took up all his old things
The Candy Man makes everything he bakes
August of last year
But everybody's lied
On these less than idealistic romances
Say the word and be like me 
There's one more thing, I got the pink slip, daddy
A hope that time will slow the passing day
You remember your first kiss
You're my best friend
With skin you'll win
The songs that I have sung
But the beats so boring
I'm gonna be the man who's lonely without you
Is there a letter
Four beats from soft
Oh yeah Laquiji rock it was a blessing
He's gotta be all for me
Twits and Jerks
Should I feel flattered that you hate everything but me
Your sabbatical was burning
Just remember that death is not the end
Find the words that define these feelings
Our hopes become a starting pistol
This car might make a good old boat
We don't need a ghost in the light off hope
And there's a road with a distant glow
And people don't rely on the traffic lights, they don't believe in lights
But the world just falls away
Because seriously, this high life scenery 
Lady on the water, rest my head upon your chest
When I feel alive
So every morning he wake
In my new living room floor
They don't bark and they don't bite
You're lying through your teeth
And I gave a beer to a bum that was drinking
They may say some awful things
Someone's beaten up
Mr Postman
My name is Denver Max and wont you come sit on my lap
Well it's late in the evening 
Oh marry marry me oh baby now I am insisting
But you don't care, oh care yeah
Oh, anyway, it's looking like a beautiful day
It runs so deep in you and me
When the one from our dream
And the house will be shakin' from the bare feet
Because it had become vile to its creator
I'm passed out in your garden
Your life's got happy
I'm seeking girls 
In the corners I get lost
Headless guru in the night show me what you mean
Hey Hey man, now you're really living
Honey, lovin' you is the greatest thing
Don't give up your independence,
Where the summer had not touhed the clouds that pass above
Steady my hands, this one can turn around
At our still lives posed
Because of the things you told me
Damn diggie dog
We're eye to eye 
Boom shak we making some loving
I'll send up all my prayers and hope they're understood
We're so pleased to be with you
Close their eyes and open
Your envelope and fall to little pieces every time
It started with a mix, 
And if you don't know anyone
I don't need a new love or a new life
We're happy together
I never knew you don't give up on me
I'm feeling sorry for myself
Yeah I know nothing ever falls apart
Sick with electricion
The story started and it ended so quick
I'm ringing all the warning bells 
Can't stop, won't stop movin'
Well, I ain't often right but I've never been wrong
Than the average detective,
The stretcher's coming, it's just what I need
We're still boys on the inside
Just let yourself go
He was apart and she was a part of it
Sometimes a sigh is a song
Oh well, I guess we're gonna pretend
Are you holding me up
For, for the teenage boys
I thought the older women would like me if I did
Work, work, work, Senora, work your body line Yep
That love was bigger
I never knew could get so dark
And all the pretty people party while the petty people fight
It's just a dream he keeps having
He's going to the country
It's the times we say
But your mind was wound so tightly
Then you turn your back and they're gone so fast
I know I know I know I know
You don't set an example for the youth of our humanity
Like the sunset going down
I know he knocks you off your feet
I know how to make you forget her
There's a town I know called Nevers
We are here to make you feel
Dancing to the beat of rain
The road is long and winding like a good mystery unfolding
Every time I touch that track it turns into gold
All my life, they tried to push me down
'Cause I want to take the pleasure with the pain
Been like twelve years since a nigga first signed
Tired father at the bus stop hey bus driver take him home
'Cause she's my only friend
Then I'll say
She said, "Oh my sweet goodness, wish you could be here every time
If you're my girl, swirl me around your room with feeling
Sometimes we don't pull or flex
I get wired like Western Union and I got to be me
There's no stopping us, no
In love with love and lousy poetry
Feel the air moving, submit to the sound
Call a man
Bury it in the ground
And we are legends every day
Do you call me
And every country ruled by me
I've got emotion dripping out my pores
Turn tomorrow into yesterday
Stop the car
And watch the sun rise
Long legs don't give me no head rush in the morning
I'm a young soul 
And it would take a calculated blow to the head 
Evil came down on earth
Give up your will to Him that loves you
"I can't believe how naive a man can be
Mummy always wants you to come for tea
Payback the chicken
They make me feel that you're only what I see sometimes
She stuck her voodoo pins where my eyes used to be
And I been burned and I been learned
You ain't gotta say it
You're so hot get me into the shade
The ones who told me that I would never win
And everyone who sees him says, "Eww"
All of my friends think I'm mad
As we're shifted through this twisted abandon
The more you stay the same, the more they seem to change
Light and day
While it was all going accordingly to plan
The power to be
Is this the way to carry on
Then there's no hurry I'm a patient man
We don't want these days to ever end
So let me get you in your birthday suit
This means less than we know it does please tell me
She saves her lovin' early in the morning
Oh my god
But she had to go around
I'll call for pizza I'll call my cat
Summertime girls are the kind I like
She had a slut slave and his name was Dave
Take me away from the norm
'Cause I think you're too doggone outta sight
Sometimes your path is marked in the sky
Looking coquet and smirking
Early in the mornin' risin' to the street
And my blues they won't go away
Seven stories we're climbing tonight, 
Thinking of you like a movie star
Berries in my heart bread
Feeling better than I ever felt before today If you feelin' good
When did your heart go missing
Tasting like postage stamps
Into warm liquid, flowing, blowing glass
All around us
Everything seems to look as it should
The world is in your palm now
But keep the fives, twentys, tens and Bens completely separate
Put away change for Ibiza
Up in my bedroom
Close your eyes, crystal eyes
Secretly I know you will find
So I called up danger, my friends and some strangers
And when it's clear it means she's completely emotionless
If this is love you gotta give me more
And through these crazy times
I start choking on my pencil
Dream like there's nothing to scream about
Gonna let it all out an do my thing
Morning Today's forecast calls for blue skies
You feel the need
That you will believe in love
When you talk sweet things in my ear
And let time, all of that time, all of that time, all of that time go
And there are things you can't avoid, you have to face them when you're not prepared to face them
Turn your right on your left
My shrink is telling me I got crazy dreams
I told the guy who's at the door
He was lookin' to the sky
Take away my record deal
That I would love everything that you do
For trying to reach the things that I can't see
At the curtains of the waterfall
It starts in my toes
I used to think I had to change the way I am
I couldn't look on the bright side
But don't you know
What a way to fix a fool, we are failing our youth
If yer always tryin' to get to the top
Wanting bracelets, never had a rope on my neck
From the hard time living till the Chelsea days
But the truth is so undeniable
But you can't sleep on account of screaming grandkids
Wrestle to the ground,
Yes I did
It was totally weird
Wheat paste and concrete walls
Imma go 'cause I got no
Because the air outside will make
I'll be the switch she turns on
Oooooo, ne me quitte pas mon cher
How do I live for the moment
We're the  boys and we'll make you smile
As long as Mr Pleasant's alright, hey hey
An Alsatian barking for the stars to go
Yeah got my stash
Standing by the wall by the wall
Your life's becoming hell
Got the waiting cab, stopped at the red light
You can knit a sweater by the fireside
This is the last night of the fair
Now a whole lotta woman 
And it starts in my toes
No looking back you know the past will stay
While others grab terror, call me shuffle a deck
Gonna make you a lover
Nothing in this room but empty space
 years remain in a trash can
Close my eyes
Making a lot of noise up there, throw your hands up in the air
Ride it on out like a bird in the skyways
No, I'd never make it through without you around
Well look out, Sunshine, here they come 
From all the jobs the one I choose is music
I really don't think it gets any better than this
We are the second, you're minutes behind
I know they're easy words to say
All I gotta say is I must've done something good
That's gone and I know that it won't ever come back
But it's something I'll never do
I have walked this earth and watched people
I'm never gonna look back, whoa
Just a little, know you like it
And when your mind's made up
Chase another heart that was up in doubt
So let the beat control you now,
And if I was a tree growing tall and greeen
What you gonna do when she turns around
I kiss you all starry eyed, my body's swinging from side to side
I just want to write a song about a boy and a girl
Walked a couple of blocks to her destination
My burning desire started on Sunday
Love in this town  it's like a joke
True love from me
And nothing else would matter to us so
When I'm bored, I, kinda drift away
And the only thing constant was the constant reminder she'd never change
Finding myself making every possible mistake
When I've lost control and I'm heading to crashland
And I feel her gaze on me during sleeping hours and when I shower
What my heart used to dream of
Oh darlin', I was blind to let you go
Chuck the deuce up, and tell 'em it's just love
And you've got me wanting you
Pay the chicken back,
I can't listen to all your reasons
Of your two shoes sitting in the bathtub
Oh I'm gonna try with a little help from my friends
We're going backwards now
River, river, river, river
And the talk of the town be true
Some of the other stay, give it up and run away
Come fly with me, let's float down to Peru
One more tab and your silk hits the chrome
This parade still marches on
It was love at first sight
Carved in your name with my pocket knife
i know what causes your heart to ache 
That some gray men with telescopes are gazing right into her eyes
Won't you just step into the car little girl;
Got my feet, got my toes
I shoulda known better not to wait around
Purple striped,
I tell ya that I love you
Ooh, let's see how far that we have run
And the day is closing in
Soul black vinyl to stop your tears
What hurts but feels so fine
Draw the curtains, I don't care
In my dreams
Rolldown gates look the same
Trouble is sometimes
I've been spending my time in the old town
Crazy Eddie in the slammer 'cause he's givin' it all away
I saw a man
In the rain to bring you candy 
I recall the sun in our faces
They play bingo and let their engines run
Happy without you
What a day for a daydream
I love, I love, in the rain, oh
Our disappointed hearts will heal
And people gonna come and people gonna cry
What's the point of livin' if you don't wanna dance
Stickin' with the wordplay
He woke up at nights, he thought he was twice, he was moving away
Awake to take in the view
Well life's a train that goes from February on day by day
You get that woo, you get that woo
The river's running fast right now
Down in Times Square
Turned your face into the squall
Ah ah ah yeah
And you accept me like nobody
It hurts from the bottom to the top
I got a desk full of paper that means nothing at all
Be there if I fall but
To be part of the miracles you see in every hour
Wants to get in your eyes
Let's take a chance and try love baby
I'm sure you could, be happy
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Hey You know my name
Coming home
Let's count the days until winter comes our way
Good grief I don't think that I can take this heartbreak any longer
Just feel the power put your hands in the air, hey
Others stopped where we'd begin
You'll still meet some new friends
But giving up just makes no sense
Then you're gone before you know it;
"I'll come another day" 
In the middle of the street doing cartwheels
So just get out while you can
Maybe I talk too much
I've got the best of interventions
Loading in the back of a pickup truck 
Commas and ampersands 
Everybody knows there's nothing doing
Starting something
I'm sure, because I'm in so far to know measure of love ain't lost
Really, I'll try to get right with myself
As I opened up my bloodshot eyes
Sit back,
Fifteen celebrity minds
And when the seasons change again then I will too
You are my candy girl Para, papara
I listen to my juddering bones
A little bit of Monica in my life
Well, it's safety dance
I have faith in my fellow man
And only for your eyes
CCCCinnamon lips and candy kisses, on my tongue, fun
Work is anything but quiet these days
But I guess that's the way that things go
You put me in the magic position
But never knew how much illusions hide a torture
First we run, and then we laugh till we cry
You're drivin' around town
Just lemme go dance and give me no blues tonight
And then characters will come to you
And I feel the pain you feel when you start crying
And I know I should be home every pane of glass
Until the end of timeI, I, we can make it last
We were the first band to vomit in the bar
Could be tomorrow but then
'Til they get the best of the night
Been waiting for countless hours
Living in the moment
'Cause there's a million ways to go
Look at this big great world that we're living in
I don't like the way they look at me
Who watches over you
Don't want to meet your mama Hey ya
So you gave me your wings
As only Betty knows
Before getting involved in a game
Sugar, shake it, shshake it
They were in the habit of taking things for granted
When you search in vain to find
Is life, love, with you
And I'm not supposed to let it bother me
The numbers come like a revelation
If I had to guess, I'd say the monkeysender thinks its great
Frenemies, who, when you're down, ain't your friend
We're going and I'm never knowing Never knowing where we're going
Ooh, I know it's turning
But I'm the luckiest guy 
She comes 'round and she goes down on me
You'd sleep here, I'd sleep there
You are the night light
With the air, like I don't care baby by the way
All I can say is eh, eh
That I've yet to have kissed
One thing that I just can't conceive
Till their lips start to move
The postman holds on ohso tight
'Cause getting down and jumping up
And I'm ready for love
But the ocean made me feel stupid
What it was all about
Dee Dee, he left home
Through the room
And clap your hands
I got a woman, way over town
Eh, eh eh, eh Wish he'd never looked at me that way
It's silent down here, hey I want to get loud again
I said I have faith in my fellow man
And you wrote the song I wanna play
And the bouncing body drone
I put the needle on the record
When we're at home
It's the sun you need
Jessica numbers give me this
And if you see him out tonight
All the things that you loathe
Où sontils nos deux corps
For a kid with the will to funk
Launched a thousand ships in my heart, so easy
My god just please don't ever let me go
Peace in my soul
Oh I love you Amy
Boom, boom, boom
I'm having a ball, don't stop me now
The dirt bikes going on stage thank you
I'm so aware of where I am, but I don't know where that is,
They're an embarrassment, they should be shamed
It's wanting what you've got 
And I've been there before, I held up the door
It kind of makes me very happy
Le p'tit air et toujours
The weekends of downtime and months of an ennui that kills
And you leave me with my jaw on the floor, hey
A smile a guise
I want to make you mine
Hearts need a mind, like a clock needs the time
I am dancing with my friends in elation
And that's a slowrolling country caravan of many sons
For romance is
And don't say you won't
People tell me not to lose my self control
Responsible for what I say 
My laughing boyfriend
And I'm looking like a fool again
Man, oh man, you're my best friend
Don't forget me
And it was late in the evening
Self righteous me, it's so wrong and
Tonight, I'm seein' stars
I was faking my own suicide
It's the greatest thing from the man above
Drop your guard, get over yourself
We go out in stormy weather
There is still a bit of your skin
No longer needed to be seated on a sinking ship just waiting there to drown
I will find my niche in your car
And I play songs back to back until I got to bed
Away from this machine 
So I thank the city, the lights that it's spinning
You won't last another day
I got ba ba ba inside my head
Chelsea, Chelsea, tell me you love me
Will you be pulled from the ocean
If I need to take a breath
And we can't get it back
Me and you over something to do
It's the word, love 
We can break blue laws with our skin and bones
Gimme the love of an orchestra x
And you cannot hide or ever put it away
I'm still here
And I can hardly relax or even oversleep
She says, "I like the nightlife, baby"
Oh so happy
And looking so mysterious honey
Keeping on the heels, 'cause you're sagging just a teeny
'Cause I've poured my heart into
I've been sleeping with ghosts
Everybody will die
I've been hungry but not enough to kill, boy
And with a mean sewing machine
Can only get, can only get
Bombs away Say Geronimo
Can we get away this weekend, take me to Broadway
I'll sit back and relax and think of all the things I'm going to do
With new taste for speed, out on the street
And the walls are closing in
In the end 
Back to the things that got you here
But that's not my province, that's not for what I am known
Something's been going on and I don't know what it is
Look what you do to me baby
Don't you know they ain't never going to help you anyway
I know you'll get me through
That I'll make you forget her
The one that tells you to taste past the tip of your tongue
So I was late for class, I locked my bike to yours
I know you will
Since that summer, since that summer
And I know fake happy
When I watch you, wanna do you, right where your standing, yeah
Everyone trips, everyone falls
All my life, I've been feeling for you
Oh, I did it
And I know that you and me be happy
You know that there are
Brand new on the scene, it's the Team called Go
You could love without desire
How does it feel in my arms 
Devastator sleeps under satin sheets
They wanna wake up with you everyday
She decided that she better check in at home
It ain't no carnival cruise
And it kills me to know
Self around me
Cloning while they're multiplying
What makes gold look like rust
Come on baby, let me tell you
They say "get to the table, get to the table on time"
'Cause your love makes me feel like
This wellknown flow, man I got this shit from Simpson Road
Jo Davies and the band,
Address unsure of, but it turned out just right
Your house will float on Noah's wood
And when she knows what she wants from her time
She played a good game of darts, and the men slapped her back,
I hear babies cry, and I watch them grow
I've got sense to hold it
Like a popping sin call
Come on girl
Oh, the days the rain would fall your way 
My lady on the water, place your thumb upon my tongue
Breathing tornadoes
Where I rest my head
Looked at my insides clicking
Ain't no stopping us
I have never known the like of this
And I have left the warmth of the sun
Let me hear you say it
So play that sweet tune
Sometimes I need to be alone
Everybody gonna dance tonight
Crack it open, let me outta here
I get up early when the sleeping pill wakes me
Listening to the sound
And I don't know what's to do
By the sea
Sitting alone, with the TV on
I don't care 'bout that, I don't care 'bout that, oh
On sugar maple wings
And with this chance I've missed I feel remiss
Got something, got something to say
Like I'm something worth holding on to
Something so undefined
We'll make quite a pair, dazzling all the time
That let their emotions get the best of them
Down on the rocks where we sat
Oh yeah, I tell you something
There's no time to think 'bout the starting or the end
Out of thin air,
I put what I want, when I want, in my body
Change the beat fast
My city shakes the fear in me
The inside lingo had me at hello
Just want a girl as cool as Kim Deal
So sing like you need this
Some things last a life time
She rings my bell, I got gym class in half an hour
Then came high school
They're breaking your heart
It feels good they're a little tight
I wanna be with a girl like she
When the desert ends, I ask the dust
Nothing else matters anymore 'cause you're in my arms again
With a lovely wife beside him
I change shapes just to hide in this place
The Neverending Story with Atreyu
While the rubbernecks all get their fill
I have a surprise
From now on wear my love for you loose
Without you, my heart is blue
And look out the window with you
Tuesday badminton
I know you damage me
Why on Earth are you there
Is this the last part
Let the traveling band on the interstate remain
Frustration, hell, who needs it anyway
Oh what a world it seems we live in
I don't know why I feel so skinned alive, oh
Move through the sleazy scenes
You won't mind
You're everything
Ooh let me be X
When I woke up he was gone
The opportunity's on
We'll all be leaving with a broken heart
I've been trying too long with too dull of a knife
Do you know this house is falling apart
And then never let go
And no one will ever know it if I keep my mouth shut tight
You're so ooh, so ah, so cool
Said it's puts berries in my heart bread
I think back on that kiss
Do anything you can to dodge the busstop blues 
I wanna hold you close, I just never wanna hold you tight
Thunders getting louder and louder
My favorite vegatable
Everyone says now or never
And it feels like his new life can start
Oh dear
Lurking there beneath my feet
Needs a fireman to rescue it,
O comet come down
I hear a song makes me think of a girl I used to know
And I will wait to find
I don't need the answer, I already know
I'm in the mood to dance
We love everybody, but we do as we please
I've never felt this way before
I'll be there to say what up
Through someone else's eyes
Then in walk the mannered men
Keep your head up
Asked the reverend was the strip clubs cool
Or a simple song of hope
Took a trip on a houseboat, it was fun, you and me
I'm scared, I'm not coming down, no no
Oh, I love you Ken
They wanna wake up with you everyday They wanna wake up with you
Then I start to feel trapped in, people greet me, I'm polite
But like a phantom she crept across the floor and out the window
I packed my antihistamines and tupperware drums,
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
And all the swine at the cabaret lick their lips as they clap along
All the big kids going to school
Oh dear, it's been hardly three days
There's things you can say
Once you drove away
Shape it into an ear and then tell me your pain 
Feel sick after every meal I'd say
It's gone, gone, baby it's all gone
Wouldn't change your mind, non pas du tout
You're every line
'Cause they don't know how real love feels
Robert's got a quick hand
All my life I've longed for this afternoon
Let's bring up on the better times
Do you remember the time I knew a girl from Mars
I see the sadness in all your faces
Lights on, some distraction, so I won't move
See that was my old man and he said
I can't get enough of you, baby
Now I've lost it all and I don't feel a thing
Peel the candy crust of my body fake flowers
As happy as we can be
Oh, there are rocks
This is mine, you can't take it
A friend who was a foe
Barcelona  Like a jewel in the sun
We took our first pill when the music was shit
ABC's 's bring your friends along
Always aching
That's all I want, like winos want they good whiskey
Here comes the zoo
Sapphire and faded jeans, I hope you get your dreams,
You're my every thought yeah
I took my money, I bet my life
Baby, your ship has come in
The channel numbers change
Looks like the tide is going home
On the handsome fella with umbrella
We're never gonna get to the bottom while there's traffic around
The places I've been
Distant looks from your face, take me to another place and time
Clap your hands But I feel so lonely
So forget your head
'Cause America can, and America can't say no
Promise not to abandon you, please let me go
I will disguise myself as a sleeping pill
Sit back and wave through the daylight
I weigh three times my body
With your head hanging upside down
She moved so easily 
It's so far away but I've planned a date
An argument for consciousness
Pay the monkey back, back,
Is there a drum beat pull shapes,
Sometimes someone's saying "yes"
He's my friend, He's not my friend
I'm not trying to write a love song just a sad, pathetic moan
What's the matter with me
This is your pay back
And say I'm here now
So won't you please please please come back to me
I hit the radio dial and turn it up all the way
She wears a twoway, but I'm not quite sure what that means
Should have done it her way
You tell me guard my heart,
Can someone tell me how long
No, it will never stop
I've got the gift of one liners
I take you on a trip 
Yeah sometimes we're high and sometimes we're low
Sing it out loud, gonna get back honey
I think it's striking me out
Their prayers fall upon deaf ears,
It is the wind beneath your feet that makes you fly
For thinking big
Oh happy birthday, happy birthday
It's you to me  gentle face, overdue, worth the wait
Oh I love to hear those conkers fall
Here comes the zoo
And the answer's is not the one he was looking for
And say it's so much fun out here
I ain't gonna stop
Feel the air moving, moving, submit to the sound
And not recognize the aging street
Give it to me baby now
I believe I hear them say
I forgot to do my homework
Such a big day waiting for you
When the rest of my life is so hard
So filthy, dialed desire
Tell me 'cause I don't want you to hurt
Close your eyes and hold your terror close
You shouldn't've fallen in love with
Don't let go
Come on now, yeah, come on, now
Been a long time coming for the working man
Diamond ring, CHA CHA
Memories don't go away; I remember every day
But you can't be close enough unless I'm feeling your heart beat
Sleeping in a dreamhouse
It's been a couple months that I've been single, so
Said if I played the evil lover, can I trade you for your alibi 
He doesn't speak the language
And if God willing we will meet again, someday
Twisting burning, my thoughts turning, back to you again
Huddled up with fear and hate because they know their fate and it's a lot to put them through
And oh my god, I think it's happening
Just 'cause he can't hear what you say
Just looking for a place to stay
Well it just goes to show
Oh, for that I'd say it's worth it, just use a blade that's short and sharp on me
See how I would do, if I could do I'd do most anything spontaneously
I left my baby on the side of the road 
Say your goodbyes if you've got someone you can say goodbye to
Falls down and does not mend
Oh well, we really gonna party
That you're getting me to say I'm sorry
When the war ends, yeah
In the middle of the night I call your name
So stick with your instincts
I'm giving you warning, baby
Four people
Chad, come here, come here, come here
You say why, and I say I don't know
Furthest away from any condition
I can see you're new, awake
And spread around his advice
While she is here in my arms
I guess there's got to be a break in the monotony
It seems I'm too hip to keep tight lips
Just like the Stones and Manu Chao
And we'll go dancing, baby, then you'll see
Don't call it a trend 
So let's sink another drink
Whatever happened to our afternoons
When the sun goes down into the water
Keep my hands by my side
As I wake in bed
And signs of desire
Lover's bonds they hold so fast 
I got Prince singin' Hot Thing to me
Here I am still stumbling down a darkened street
Jumping out of someone's tent and I don't recongnize a face
Throw your partner behind a desk 
Lucky I'm in love with my best friend
It's right
Brave down the open road
Songs about the local news
But life's a slippery slope, regret's the steepest hill
We will be living for the love we have
A street cat got him by morning and I had to bury pieces of his body in our building's playground
I've got no energy
I'm a band in a show about a boy being buried alive
Use your eyes, the world goes and flutter by
They say patience is a virtue, but the doctor says she don't have long
Oh, I'm faking my own suicide
Yeah, she's kinda hot though
I have another glass of wine
I can't help but look, thinking that everyone doesn't get it
Yeah and you can tell them your story
I spend late nights trying to pick up love
And I've been channeling but I think we're alone
If I'm a spinster for the rest of my life
And still the wheel turning's all I'll be
I'll never let you down
It proved a rare change is, now I got that true predition
It's time to tell my story
Do ya need a little time Do ya love me 'cause I wanna know
Shakira, swing those hips like nun chucks
And I know, I know you are changed out
And you're really getting all you gave
Something we can see but not reach or be
And have the pleasure of saying what you mean
Open hearts, empty spaces, dusty roads to distant places
There's a bad reason
But when you go to meet God, you know you want to look nice
Oh I know that now, that's why I'm staying here
And Houston, we've got a problem
But, girl, I'm gettin' wise
I'm a child
You think you're clever but you're never saying nothing at all
Put your arms around me baby 
You'd be a work of art
But I can't make 'em stay
Until you came along; now there's one less thing wrong
Look straight ahead, nothing but blue sky
'Cause if this is what we've got,
The sun is rising up on the east side, a chance for everyone
That planet Earth turns slowly
Thunder and lightning will strike
Yeah if I lived in China, I'd have some Chinese children
Let's get up on this floor and do this for real Whoo
It's the trees of this day that I do battle with for the light
But really I'm not actually your friend
It couldn't do me any harm
This is a happy end 
So many ups and downs and nothing's changed
So pick up your battering ram
To come together
Never start static gots to get it off my chest
Make of the people we love
That clock up on the wall was tickin'
Just leap don't look
At the party at the club on a Saturday night
Marie was exciting, you could say inviting and they both took turns with me
Put a mistletoe upon your mother's blouse
And if you were an ocean, I'd learn to float
As they carried you away
I've gotta start to open my heart
In the middle of the bath I call your name
Bump into a person in the middle of the road
'Cause I'm still, here whoa oh oh oh
But she likes the way you sing
Yes, but, you're a girl
Why won't you believe in it, till it's gone
But just a minute too late
And where dreams are found
One day you'll be washing yourself with hand soap in a public bathroom
And we know we're not alone anymore
It's been a dream being with you
Shoulders ache for want of wings
I was nearly in, but then came the pushy friend,
Do, yeah
Cigarettes and lies
Then we'll wait for it to pass
I'm happy, I'm happy
We'll never feel bad anymore
Last night he flew to Baghdad
I say, we can dance, we can dance, everything's out of control Out of control
Goddamn, this business is really lame
Almost everybody died
I'll love the earth someday 
Rhythm bandits
Feel the bass in ya face
In this passenger seat, you put your eyes on me
My heart is beatin' like a jungle
This selfdefeating meeting of the minds is eating what was once so hard to find
Those pretty faces always made you
Oh we are reaching 
When I wake up in the mornin' love
And it takes a day to make you yawn, brother
There's really nothing much to it
Tracing the lines of my face for
Beautiful this time of year,
Don't wanna go on this way
Hoping for a frigid air to come passing by
I want the whole world to celebrate
Clothes of many colors lying on the bedside,
Is love x
We can dance, we can dance, everybody look at your hands Look at your hands, yeah
If you will soothe my worried looks 
Yeah we make a lot of noise
Come see, with me, come see
Dholna kadeh mere nal hass, mainu dil valli dass, nahin taan teri meri bass
Pass me a drink or maybe two
The ground opens and he climbs inside
I don't give a fuck about goin' home
It's all about the makeup and the dancing and the Oh
She danced close to me like I hoped she would
I can't stop, can't stop can't stop the beat
Hey, wouldcha say
Friends are people who are not strangers
Put it in your hands, take it, take it
I shook 'em up, the walls came crumbling
I don't get drum and bass
All through the ATL, come and ride wit' a G
Ha, we did it, we here now, y'all niggas can stop askin
The fox chases the rabbit round
I can't see the difference in it either way
Am I dimmer every day
Till everything's forgotten
I left my lady in the launderette
I hear the music baby
You took me to your rented motor car
By the dogs of LA
What you sow man is what you reap
We'll keep on moving anyway
Others only read of the love
So come on
There you are, see, it's the end of the film
Why don't we sleep all, sleep all day, sleep all, we sleep all day over
Jumpin' out the window
I'm too hot too hot, hot damn, hot damn
Where is the father, Son
Completely breathless
How can I get any rest now
It's so fine, it's sunshine
If you pull them all together
Don't even know
The bluff's a classic 'cause it always works
I'm here darling to enjoy the party 
Glad to see you comin' I got nothin' to hide
Today
We had our mindset I made a lot of mistakes
And take a second chance on me
I'm feeling a déjà vu
You'd better stop STOP
Oh, oh oh oh, yeah
And if I grow old, well, I know I'm gonna be
Every touch becomes infectious
There's nothing for the kids to do
It takes an axe sometimes
And other winter vehicles
When I am such a bad man
And comin' off the line when the light turns green
I just got a warning and I know and I know
What's a man without all the attention
Where everything's fine, if I can keep my mouth shut tight tight tight
Peeling away everything she had
Ride a white swan like the people of the Beltane
But I'm in love with Stacy's mom, ohho ohho
Hello partner, kiss your name byebye
You don't know how long I have been
My war paint is Sharpie ink and I'll show you how much my shit stinks
Staring up at freeway signs in dreams that make me sad
See I was born thinking under the sky 
Not so keen to show me anything,
And my stomachs got some tasty food
But till then this is all I can say
Stand in the place where you are
Over the hills the frequency's breaking down
Don't cut no corners when you're talking to me
It was hidden in the fall
Y aunque parezcas despistado con ese caminar pausado 
You're holding onto me
Nobody's ever gonna,
Friends make graphs together, la la la la
Out Of Nothing, The Need
On you I can depend
I suppose that I could hold it in
Keep my money in the ceiling, let my mama know I'm free
And wear these lucky socks until they fade away
Oh look at the lovers
Because we know you're stranger
'Cause out of all the people I've known
Tell me that you love me more
For letting you go
Don't play your games with me
I was feeling like champ then, in summer
Pass the hubcap please
When your heart is beating lighter
Come into my bed
Who's to say
What did he spend it all on
Oh I get by with a little help from my friends
I was just stumbling around, around
I know you'll mess up your hair
Pharoah on the microphone Sing all hail
But the streets are all safe
Chelsea was the one who's been abused
If you were the wood, I'd be the fire
You know you make my world light up
Whistle blowing love is dead 
He whispers his goodbye
Maybe I'm just lucky, 'cause it's hard to believe
Been holding it in for a while, 'ay
A pinata pops, this has gotta stop
Against my building's back door
But I'll know where several are
Daydreamer, we used to be half alive, now I'm alright
Getting angry doesn't solve anything
She's so far away
On my way, on my way
With words
The sun is blazing we are sweating you look lovely
'Cause she walks looks and drives like an ace now
Your life is your life gotta live like it's your life
I got something I think I really wanna do right now
so let's get out of here 
Love like yours will surely come my way
I will get by
But how long, babe, can you search for what's not lost
Straight in the picture pose, he's coming around to meet you
I guess I lose, but life goes on
I've got a cure for its crimes
That is running to the promised land
I'm sitting on my doorstep
Just to feel a little better about myself
Well, shouldn't you be fucking with somebody your age,
I'm dancing and singin' in the rain
They start in my toes
Adopt another lifestyle
I got some apples if you want 'em
The sound of our voices made us forget everything
If sweet Death should ever conquer me
I love you in the same way, there's chapel in a hospital
Oh baby refrain from breaking my heart
And my supplies in a magic pack
Waiting for the roads to be late
Always remember
You've tried before to leave me but you haven't got the nerve
Now I've been worrying about your feelings, yeah, they were worth protecting
Oh it really lifts my heart
More than you think, if the sun would come out and sing with me
Woahohoh, come on, ohohoh, it doesn't matter, woahohoh, everybody now, ohohoh
April, May, June and July we'll hang outside
And I'm leaving with goodbye
So I printed him a letter to be sent out to sea
Hey, bulldog
I spin around the door to make sure that it's locked
Wouldn't you know Wouldn't you know
And you haven't got a friend
Scatterlings and orphanages
Well they forgot
Tattooed on his arm
How when you're talking, that you touch
Singin', don't worry about a thing, worry about a thing, oh
And then crashing at the Wrights
Something that in my memory has been misplaced
It's a fiasco at your back door once again
Lift me up mama your love keeps lifting me
But the scenery's the same
Why would I get burned down Oh why would I
A man walks down the street
The high tide could take me so far away
Just slow enough to make you uncomfortable
Semiauto and Marlboros in the bottle, 'til I hit the lotto
Ah, ah, ah, is there anybody home
Your feet are going to be on the ground
'Round and around and around and around
Oh, everything is uncharted
You would probably die before you shot up  miles high, 
I'm having a good time having a good time
You make it easier when life gets hard
Wild card in sight, wild card in sight
Wrap this child in mercy  heal her
And as my mind begins to spread its wings
Long hair cloggin up the drain
So I'll take that train and ride
But you're still miles away
And only now I see the light
What's on your mind
Slow down and think of your heart
So ride it all and don�t forget you got to tell us your story
And a little bit too heavy on the thinking
And please, say to me
Someone who needs me Whoa, for once in my life
Some cheap red wine Some cheap red wine
I found what I'd been looking for in myself
You spend your whole life dropping nickels in the bucket, wakin' up at dawn
Are five kids better than one Who doesn't like to be gone
With a flaming eight ball
I really can't see where it ends
I'll take it back
But when you make demands
Who knows just what you'll find
And I can tell I'm her kind of guy
Then I saw her face
When we touch, don't ever let me go
Life is short but your here to flower
Mystery's a beautiful thing
But, we are okay, we are alright
You got that beep, that beep, that beep
Is a real trip
A rush of wind is gently playing with their wings
She's gonna tear your heart apart
Við syngjum öll saman
I simply cannot forget
I didn't want you around
Mourn the years before I got carried away
Follow if you wanna or just hang around
If she loves you, let her go
Maybe a handful of silver or a hundred bucks
Fold me, sue me, watch me going mad
We can pretend that they don't know our name
What did we ever do to these guys
Still I know them all well so see you later
Hey heart on the road again
It could all be a waste of time 
I never thought you knew
Where's the love Just give it up
The wilted flowers that I gave
You've been down but you been feeling itchy
And II, I wanna fill your cup cup cup cup
With the sun beating down
Yo I want to leave you with this line
And swiftly ran the other way
For all my pals who live in the oceans and the seas
Take my hand, don't let go, but please remember, hearts can grow
And I will wrap my arms around you
I'm gonna gather up a few of my friends
Cover your eyes, everyone is all the same
Upon the stairway to your room
Time's too short, right and wrong
Do the chicken payback,
Suddenly you started to move
It's time that we rocked three daunting nouns
If only some rain would fall on the houses and the boulevards
I know why, I know why 
She gets all the highlights wrapped in pearls
And I cried as cameras caught my eyes
Got stung all over
More words than I had ever heard
Wow, look at her
Don't get me started love
And then this one doesn't want to admit she's falling in love
Boom boom boom an a
In the Young Men's Wing at SloanKettering
'Cause I know the grass is greener but
You rubbed an ice cube on my chest
With an automatic weapon, don't nobody call a medic
Granted, there wasn't much for him to take
And we were in love
They say if you're not lonely alone, boy there is something wrong
To rise up from the dead and take up to the sky 
Most these niggas rappin' bout a block ain't never seen 'em
We had no money to speak of
She's pulling at me saying "Dad I need you
So hard to say goodbye
But I'll push all my inhibitions aside
When nobody understands
And I'll blame this world that I live in
Morning's first light
That old rusty spaceship wants to sail
She sees these visions, she feels emotion
We are reflections
Well, baby, I surrender to the strawberry ice cream
You stand on your own
These constant broken heartbeats sound like breakbeats
Et maintenant le voyage a la supermarche
And their lives seem complete
Felt a wave a rush of blood
As if you've forgotten of your own life, forgotten of your own face
Can't get no love without sacrifice
And all their inaction will tumble away with the days
To breathe again
There ain't nothing too high
I never ever had the heart to do
You're gonna say you love me too
To pull these old white sheets from my head
So that's how I learned the lesson
Take my hand and we will shine
If you could only see the love that you're wasting
Only my tears satisfy the real need of my heart
And everything is gonna be alright
There are miles of hay like I've never seen
She gives me money when I'm need
A collage of senselessness
Dream yourself along another day
Tu Mirada Me Tiene En Descontrol Mundial Ooh oh oh Daddy
Who knew Mind you, I never had to stand in line
Walk right up to the microphone
But I don't know her address; I wade downstairs
And they were a part of it
What if you could only speak the truth, what would you say
On an island way too difficult to be stuck in a daze
All you need is love, love
Something going on but I don't know where
I was free before I met you
They had me in mind oh yeah when they designed you
There's so many people I know, they're just tryna touch ya
And if like me you wanna take that chance
And so peaceful until
A space where we felt free
When your shutters open all the way
I mean what's the point,
Birds singing bells ringing
I never did what you said that I did when I was gone for so long
Sancho brought a message from the Fat Man
It seems I'm less afraid of life itself than of what you see
We are still learning
Oh, everything's right, said everything's right tonight
Don't do any good to say this isn't what I planned
And it's all wasted now 
One day my prayers are gonna be answered
And family in free verse On this road with Kerouac
They think I know shit 
Me and we'll always be together
I was a young man almost  right down to the day
You are a film for me to see
All the lovers I take
I'm counting the days since I began to live without you
I've gotta big, big, big heartbeat, yeah, I think you are the sweetest thing
There were people from the city having lunch in the park
You can take up all my time 'cause you're the only one
I'm so alone without you
Some kind of wonderful
How much I was in love with you
Ends extended
My feelings have not passed away
Like a bird in a cage
Filling me up with your rules Fool
"But it's much too late" you say
And my eyes they've got some vision
You you give me sound, smashing my styles
And let your love blaze like
But nothing happens every time I take one on the chin
It's so hard not to bite it
You have so many relationships in this life
He kept floating past my eyes
Dance to the sounds of iced tea being stirred
It made me very cold
And I know I'll see you there
Just close your eyes
From something Paul said
The ice we skate is gettin' pretty thin
Everyday would be a holiday from real
It's cold and heaven surround you from every direction
The picture was a masterpiece of comic timing
And can I skip, yeah, what I ordered
But now I'm complete
All summer long
Shut up about it, no one can bring you down now
But you never say them to me,
Are you ready to hit it running
No love in front of me
First choice on the haunted stars, now the one true loves,
Can you reach it does it make you wanna walk
I'll break your heart so you must ask
When every other part of life seemed locked behind shutters
People in love, their hearts get eaten
I'm a danger to myself, I've been starting fights
The more I see, the less I know
Feel the air moving, moving
A mnemonic game on the arc of a journey
No, no, no, no I never thought I did
She sees my plane in the ocean
I try to be kind
Jumping, jacking
Inlitterati lumen fidei
But when I look in your eyes
And the world wants to fight me
And the trees lean to lend, 
I should've been after you
In the page of the Lord
By the time I recognize this moment
Why can't we be friends
I stretched my hands out to the sky 
Beats something else, you know I never think about myself
I never forget you in my prayers
'Cause I'm on top of the world, 'ay
I found some kind of fairytale
Through looking back you may go blind
Close your eyes and hold your terror close
Gulf stream through the open door
Good time to make an annoucnement
Look into your heart and you'll find that the sky is yours
You've been right in front of me
Today could be the day you might make a change
'Cause you make me smile
Goddamn, I am surprised that I have survived
And I come alive
Treasure torn out paper from the corner of a page
I should know better than to
To save my soul from all these troubled times
Everyone else's goal's to get big headed
I'll be the waterwings that save you if you start drowning in
If it comes down, it's still about the sweet little things you say
I've got your letter I've got your letter, you've got my song
Have you ever made love to a beautiful girl
I got everything
Sleeping with a gun under my pillow
But wounds heal and tears dry and cracks they don't show
I'm living in a treehouse
She spends her days
You gotta take it in
Can you feel it
'Cause you make me feel wild
When we're looking for something
Well, they bite
And if I get caught
Give her a dollar and she'll make you smile
Nothing you can sing that can't be sung
Tired of feeling bad
The light that you seek just ain't in you today
There's something
Baby, I hope that you get a clue,
As long as I'm your girl
Oh, love come get me down
And I would gladly leave my hiding place
In the middle of a cloud I call your name
The cutrate mime walking through the dirty streets
But what you did, yeah
Just don't give away your selfrespect
Last night I ran into my old life
that all I wanna do is get off
She said I love the way you think but I hate the way you act
That you already knew that you was gonna finish last
A whole lotta spending money
I locked you out, you cut a hole in the wall
Had gone to sleep
Now spiders in my dreams
In the place we used to start
Half asleep we are calmly waiting through her night
Give me something to dream about
Why some are born
And everybody clap your hands and shout
He'll be coming home late, yeah, he's coming home late
She moves like an old gypsy woman but swears she's a girl
Once in a lifetime
But in the first moment of her waking up
Sports cars are thrilling
These bandages are anonymity
I've got a big, big, big heartbeat, yeah, I think you are the sweetest thing
'Cause my heart gets broken so easily
Yeah, I would have a show like Oprah, I would be the host of
My little tulip my Norge dear
I've been down so low people look at me and they know
And watch the Sunday gang in Harajuku
We be near heaven at a quarter to eleven
Hastily sold for nothing
Just then I see a twinkle twinkle in the old man's eye
What's the use in trying, all you get is pain
Cause everyone thinks that it goes away with age
The good with the bad 
Now I'm back on my beat
The blood keep flowing to your head
They travel in the air
Come fly with me
Let's rewind
The clocklike beat of the budgies heart
With lips and teeth to ask how my day went
And when we come yeah we sure do shine
Shelve tops is on
Boy won't you turn your game boy off
I didn't wanna know the things I knew       
And I need you to heal me when I'm sore 
And I can't believe you or read you, 'cause there pleasure in your preview  It's all in your eyes
Disco lights and a glint in the eye of
Ooh, woo, oh I finally get my feet back on the ground
There's so many things for us to do
Home, yes I am home
It's funny being funny,
Does the pain feel better
No don't kick it around 
I see a door, holes in the floor
I'll tell you all I know
It's so hard to look away
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah oh yeah
Now what's the matter with me
It is the air you breathe, the element, the fire
The times we never even thought to speak
Run, baby, run, forever we'll be
So I got nothing at all
Oh oh oh oh everybody, sing it right back, I like it like that
And if I was a tree growing tall and green
Yes, you know my name
You'll feel better
So please don't let go
And you're feeling so proud
I fell apart in your arms for the last time
Why who's got the power
Have you heard that sound before
I take it in but don't look down
I know
Drivin' away, leaving it all behind
Oh dancing with myself
I never wanted to be anybody's other half
Clap along if you know what happiness is to you, hey, hey
No, she won't stop making the crowd scream
Never wanna say I wish that I was there
Says he's got a fast boat, but it's just a fairy boat it ain't to faster than a goldfish
Rosewood from '
With the show"
I'm Jesse Jackson on the balcony when King got killed
Oh, the way that you're always surprised
I just want to be feeling free
Remember when your mother found us
The rain it started tapping
It's hard to look at me
My face blew up at such a casual sight
Fluid lines that soar like towers
Hey, boy, way that I move
Since I surrendered
So don't ask me how to get started, oh
When all of our troubles are gonna end 'cause
You know the miserable do love company
Let it burn, let it burn
Bottomed out in the long run
I think it always will
Rubber burnin,' turnin' corners, beatin' like a Congo
You're not a baby if you feel the world
I really want to come kick it with you
To your place, place, place
This is me at my greatest
Can I get get get to know knknow know you better better, baby Yeah
Waxing since thirteen  wisdom from a beauty queen
I'm on fire and now I think ready to bust a move
Beat of the song
Raindrops keep falling on my head
Is there trouble between the lines
Think of something, look, look following the crowd
And away you go now baby
And, if so, remind me not to go there, the weather affects my knee
I woke up on that sunny street 
And when we grow old, yeah
And make a home from a rented house, ohon
With our drunken hearts and our tired bones
I'd rather not, let's just say I'm starving myself
Don't kiss me goodnight
oh the calcium mines you buried deep in your chest
The more that I live on the inside there's nothing to give
I'm a hot air balloon that could go to space
We should see Never comprehending a race that's long gone by
We'll join in with the songs we know
Go, baby, go baby, go
But you're gonna say what you wanna say
We never did get famous,
Let's get rich and build a house on a mountain 
This is a lonely place This was a home of mine
Sheepdog standing in the rain
I got all I need
Ain't nobody's business
Come on, baby, let's get away ooh Baby, c'mon, now
Guess I'm a little bit shy
You know it saves me to think even for a little while
It's true, you're my love, whoaohohoh
It does flips and throws you over
My love is so good
And I don't care where the bus stops
And it don't, don't make sense
To things like feet
And getting fat
Everything I  describe
Intimacy becomes intensity
To the the ones you're with
Damaging my soul
And then crawled in my mouth
Mumbled words under my breath
I'm just trying to make you mine 
Going to work, don't want to go, feeling low down
And there'll be love in the bodies of the elephants too
You don't think that life's for us to talk about
Just in case they're wondering
And I didn't know it then but she put a spell on me
But baby, how we spoon like no one else 
I think how Bert Susanka made me drink
Indicate precisely what you mean to say
I'm crying in the corner at five
When you are sipping on the sweet nectar of your memories
"And we could all use a little change"
Me number
Could've made me forget
Nobody nobody nobody will ever know his longing
Just because I can
This one's goin' out to the strip joints
She say she got a man why she lookn' at me
Take all of your money give it all to charity
Do ya need a little time
I hate a lot of whites and I hate a lot of blacks
We can do anything we want to
Because you're sweet and lovely, girl, it's true
I can't stand in line at the store
I didn't think much of it till I took it apart,
Silver stars in your eyes, in your eye
That show the singer lost an eye
But you don't pull my strings because
Hear a phoebe sing his only song
Must be all that sleep I missed
And got in my Renault
Drug me with visions untrue
How well you can play when the pawn takes a queen now
Would you be my love, my love would you be mine
Whenever I'm lonely I'll shout out
All of the subatomic pieces come together and
Of the buses on the ground
And when you notice that your mind is fleeting
Do it all the time, I know that we should
Now that the dreams are all coming true
Trying to turn me off
And how I'm doing things my way;
We're really onto something special little girl,
You know me name
Now that you know who you are
All our senses come alive, so happy I could die
Angels again "How long till you can see her"
It's about time that you learn to share
Where I almost made out with the homecoming queen
He draws with his finger
It is the passion flowing right on through your veins
Spread the word and be like me
And your love next to mine
We play it goofy or we play it cool
Saying I'm one, no no these pictures of us,
You think your love is just a score
That make life better
I'll render services
There's a preacher down on th and farnam street
It may only be a wish away 
When I hit the flow the girls come snappin' at me They be snappin' baby
Every day we just
I used to be your girl
Can I say
Her skin is cinnamon
Oh, baby, I love your face Baby, I love your face
Splitting necks and calling it dichotomy
Woke up next to you in your bed
Away get carried on a reign of love
Then a nice man said he'd help her
Because it won't
Ppput my record on
It's a work of art our giant golden arch
When you look at it
She never waits too long
This is the way that we love And I'm wastin' everyday
Standing back
They'll be spitting in your eye
Nice day for a walk in the dark
You'd better run, better run, outrun my gun
I'm a girl's best friend 
We'll find out I'm told, my mother she told me so
So beat my head beat my head
 o'clock, Monday night and I'm waiting
So don't hold back, just have a good time
Still never get enough
I've got one hand on the steering wheel
Slap young waves on wooden bones
He's sleeping on the job
Let's sneak out of this party
Her phone is ringing straight to
I see you with your friendsyou don't wanna get embarrassed 'Barrassed
To lose your arm would surely upset your brain
The satisfaction of your love
Life's for living, yeah, that's our philosophy
I've got to take this opportunity before I miss it
She's said, she's a star,
Thinking bout tomorrow 
It's Monday bloody Monday
I'd fall to the bottom and I'd hide 'til the end of time
Where the horizon and the rooftops meet
Get off this situation and feel fine
I need to be loved
What's my boyfriend's going to do and do the shot and do the do
Do it good,
I'm spinning in circles I can't stop
And all the "Ello" and "Ow are 'u"
The reason I think I'm something special baby
We're a thousand miles from comfort, we have traveled land and sea 
Hit the ground
This room don't smell like you and me
Her dying cigarette in the rain
And half of what I didn't do could be different
To Bermuda, Bahama, come on pretty mama
He knows his lover lies south in the city
Drip drop a lovely dream,
The last that we got away with lies
Friends sing together, la la la la
Begging, begging you please 
And for a moment I don't even care
We're all tired and ready to breathe
Give her all the love she gives to me
Listen the night we met I fell in love with you
And that unspoken feeling of knowing
I'm in love, but its only temporary
You've seen the years roll on
You know it's time
If storms are breaking over great escapes
Playing games
She says he's a nice guy and I'd be impressed
And made her makeup run
But you know we're all tied, one to one
I'm always in love
If this was meant to be
Is the one where you told me you'd love me forever
Oh, illadvised, your desire
Someday spare change
Nothing you can make that can't be made
Maybe I'll ride
I don't think I'll ever see your face again
All my islands have sunk in the deep
I sing the blues and swallow them too
You look so cute writing out your own death letter
Let the beat control you
No more northern skies for her
How could we ever forget
And one day we'll get nostalgic for disaster
We're talking the way we used to talk,
And love love love all through our minds
But it feels so much better now that it's done
Out here in these streets, we're so young and all alone
Now I, I never been so amused
I don't care 'bout that
Then groan at the goodness but do you mean not every time
Rain is pouring, touchdown scoring 
The day turns to night
Many windows never locked
The more you give, the more you get
Right here in the place where I belong
Teacher gets annoyed 
Oh, here I go, you're moving way too slow
And in my room its gotta be at least a hundred
In the distance the desert sleeps
We're gonna make it through this war tonight
Don't ya feel that sunshine telling you to hold tight
It was all out of tune
Jump into lakes, the surface breaks
In the zone, where I think that I lost my phone
Dive straight in on your girlfriend
I hit the stage, go insane, then jump into that crowd
I've been going wrong
And my eyes are on you
Clouds come
Oh baby baby, I'll beg I'll beg
Cart off and sell my vegetables
Threw it out the window
Flies are in your pea soup baby
Can we please take this hour
They can make our shoes
let's get out of here
The girl's using me as a punching bag
Come into my heart
Started staring at the passengers and waving goodbye
Tonight we'll dance
Out on the road
Only told to stay away
deep in a mine, ohno
For my baby and for me, ha, ha, ha
He got where he was going at the age of sixty two
Your style, your voice, your points of view
This song was in my head and now it's in my mind
And I always get confused,
a touché mon cœur dans sa chemise à carreaux
And she was, like a starry night
Too much hogwash, not enough hearsay
List of your charms
C'mon, do it again
Oh, I know life is hard
And I make her smile like a drug for you
When I wasn't awake
Just different faces
When I was so heavy
To see what it feels like now
"And people make you nervous
Let loose, honey
You have a lovely singing voice
'Cause I've been waiting, I've been waiting, I've been waiting, yeah
Bring it on, here we are, win or lose, win or lose
Most beautiful girl I've ever seen
Why don't you just roll away
Coming up for air
The honey's stuck us by the hair
I been thinking reminiscing
Summer's on the way
you're deep in a mine
And I've loved you since I heard your first cries
Been too busy, but I don't wanna deal with you
Don't let your worries wash you away
Tangled inside of me
And I'm gone to the moon 
But we always yes we always we always have fun
Christ, I'm out of my mind
Couldn't figure what got in to me
But move
Why'd you have to get
The bass is pumping and now I believe
On a partially cloudy afternoon
I gotta go
Lace up your shoes
All you want to see is makebelieve, it's nothing
There is nothing stopping me
Just feel the thunder as it warms your face
He's sending me, maybe she's sending me, just to see me get irate
She's looking excellent, totally excellent
We lay on the bed there
I go to her when I'm feeling slack
And it's byebye, goodbye I tried Aaah
We saw the first signs of summer and springtime change,
Now it's coming back
My eyes on your eyes
She just can't stay home anymore
These lips will find strawberry wine
It ain't nobody's business
We'll be playin' and havin' fun
The little things that used to make us happy made us sad
All the things that flow through my mind
My head's been lying dormant like a sleepy little mouse
I'm seeing hoes sex in the studio bathroom
One fine day one fine day we'll fly away
Or was it in my head
Anything you said to me was lost in ether overseas
There's a boy with his head
I say soda soda, I'm a high roller
Okay, yeah
And if I start a commotion
They don't know nothing
I know that we can't save this town alone
It's not the chase that I love
Making up a mess of fun
Music is my hot hot sex
Scheiße man, ich hab noch keine, sammel weiter Pfandflaschen
Watch this fade away
Reminding you your love for me is more than six feet deep
Oh shit
And the dreams that you dare to dream
You look so neat
For my niggas in the Bridge, with the  dollar Panasonics and the blank 's
It's a risk, it's a risk, yeah
And I thought I would let you know
I hoped that you could understand
As sleek as a sheikh spinning 'round and 'round
I want to just hold you
You be the fighter of fires 
People tryna inherit the skill so they askin' me
Zak called his dad about layaway plans
Hair grows even after you're dead"
But we didn't mind
It's the one and the only place we control
Or scarlet begonias or a touch of the blues
When she says, "Let's go, I like the nightlife, baby"
Just need music and sun and laughter
You could get back down 'storian
You can ask for my money If you like you can have control
Come on and show
And follow our hearts to content, she said
Into the arms of 
Can you see it in your thoughts
They'll anger you then bat their eyes
Are those eyes overrated They make me want to give up on love
Chord shapes in air
I found his business card in the mud
I can pluck my own mustache
They can blind you with science
He's my friend, They're not my friends
If it is, then this might just work
Standing in line, I think you're pretty
When you act like a man who is cross with every woman he's never had
As we're sucking down that funny, funny weed
I say, hey momma, hey momma, close to you
Hooray, O'Malley, run
There is no way to return
I wanted to walk through the empty streets
Then I couldn't love but now I can
What do you do when the music stops
Get real drunk and ride our bikes
I know you're workin' for the CIA
Well, you just laughed it off, it was all okay
And the more I go inside 
Well, love is blind and you're far too kind
The repositioned light, the post atomic night
I still love you, the girl from Mars
'Cause I know I'm growing up to be a better man
Candy bars and chocolate chip cookies
Oh, see the lady I adore
I think I can make it now, the pain has gone
And I fell me into sleep
I just wanted to talk to you
Oh baby Don't stop me now I'm having a good time
Line after line I read on and on
I said, "Hey girls, you are beautiful"
But it was ruined by the sun shining through me
And I doorbell ditched you
Run until your lungs are sore until you find an open door
There are so many things I can do just like falling in love with you
No matter how things go
Chelsea, Chelsea, are you feeling me now
Your house,
It's better not to holla back
Kick your shoes to the floor and
Miles and sister
I wear your golden ring inside
Of gasoline or to be tied up and stoned
But just remember who you are
Desmond takes a trolley to the jeweler's store
Read my lips
Light up the sky with your prayers of gladness and rejoice for the darkness is gone
I'd travel 'round the world if you would let me
Same old thing happen every day
I lose your heart, and I'll lose my mind
Waves waves carrying them away
Now my feet won't touch the ground
Today its replenished
"Well, there's something I never told you about that night"
Won't be as bitter as the ones behind you
But I've found my friend
Oh what a world my parents gave me
Chrome on the freight line shines the same
It's kicked me down and left me for dead
The house is quiet now and everything inside, it seems to know she's gone
And they said, "Hey Nate, yeah, it�s been a while,
I just had somebody tell me I was introspective to a fault
When I arrived in my own set of clothes
C'mon we gotta get that shit
But uh oh, she came to my show
So come on, come on
And I just want to be a part of this
Behind the movie scenes
Nothin' else but us right now
I don�t need the stars in the night
When you smile
And Joey was an artist just living out a case
It's all a game of this or that, now versus them
But they only light the stage
See if the news was all okay"
Hey, would it be so bad if I stayed
Oh, have you ever been to heaven at night
She was tired of fighting and feeling frustrated
Deep in the heart, I'll seek and find it all
Remember that tanktop you bought me
What a gift a woman can bring
And I need you to help me blow my nose 
But I am sure they'll get along fine on their own 
Do you know what I mean
I will shout the same from on high
You can feel fire in the night lying here
'Cause it's getting so complicated
Mark the rhythms that I shook
With a torch and a Woman's Realm to keep you company tonight
In the most unexpected places, I see changes
Just without the leather
This must be fake, my lip starts to shake
But I never really thought it would feel this fine Yeah
Hey, remember the time when I found a human tooth
When your working is done
I might not have the power
So I can rock on
Let's get out before we melt away
Except for maybe when I think of how I felt that day
Got my hair, I got my head
Let's enjoy it while we can
Of familiar faces
But I would be up for being down with a ho,
On the typewriter ribbon, the shadow grows
Woo woo woo woo woo
Oh, and while you're away seed
Next day I feel so sad 
I wish that every kiss was neverending
Mothers see it coming around
She's got the devil in her heart
I just met this foot guy who's just my type
And having to say
Toys are not sentimental
Das hier ist sowas wie 'ne Warnung
Or on an island by myself
Will you be my American boy, American boy
So get up on the floor it's time for you to move your feet
Jane, I've seen the pain you've dealt
When I needed sunshine I got rain
Well maybe I'm a little bit slow
We were living for the love we had
Clap your hands if you want some more
Nothing to report
Well I don't know what I am living for
You sure know how to control me
Chocolate candy, Jesus Christ
I want to be your baby You'll always be my baby
I'll share this love I find with everyone
I'm waiting here with open arms
And everything's forgotten
Monday morning and it's time to go 
And in the first moment of her waking up
It's gotta be at least a hundred degrees
The winter is long in the city
Where bright lights and angels meet
And fur on the floor
You can find your way home on the 
Ooh ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
That float above me while I sleep
And my mother laughed the way some ladies do
Starts to give, every single day
I can't defend you truly
It ain't no big thing if you lose your faith
As long as anyone with hot blood can oh
You can wear my shoes
You'd be damned to be one of us, girl
Yes you will believe in love
But I'm not afraid to have an eloquent boy at my door
When you're with me
My flow's a dog down boy
On the table
And making love to your memory
Stuffed sailor up, up with eyeball sun
You lead a fairy tale existence
In all the history of human connection
Well, it's all right, sometimes you gotta be strong
I caught them barking at the moon
All of the time, now get out of my way
Santa Cruz and Trestle Inside, outside, USA
But we gotta put a guard outside
And find out where she got her wings
And she purrs like a kitten till the lake pipes roar
To see the sadness that's inside
To burst grin giggle bliss skip jump sing and shout
And he doesn't give a damn about me
You're an openminded lady, you've got it all
Stop crying like a child
Very gay, hip hooray
My My Time Flies A man underneath a tree
Come and ride with your boy, man Hey
Besame Cuando Estes Bailando   
Shake, shake, shake, Senora
Nothing good comes easily,
Out on the streets, where I grew up How I got over 
'Cause I, 'cause I was looking for, for an ending
Oh please, don't ask me how I've been
We'll pick it up, pack it up, put it in a bag
Won't you be good to me
that's why i wanted to make you this song 
To keep looking ahead at your future
Hey, boy, in your tree
Oh, been trying to let it go
Don't worry, you're not alone, that's just how we feel
We almost had a baby
If lies divide to the end, we've got to make it
I walk the other way, I don't wanna bother you with my sobriety
I thought we would have to break up the band
Love's sweet pain
And that's all right, I must confess
You know I'll wait forever
Off the darkness that creeps in sometimes
We can walk in straight lines
And the deep was dark
Woman says let's take a drive on south
You'll let me be your man
No excuse to be so callous
Lay down be still
Bear this child directly into misery
I'll be back at a quarter to 
And I never forget a face
And then I sit with you now, I can remember
And when you smiled all the kids fell apart here
The language of the frost lobs dead balloons over ruins today,
Out of the orange colored sky
Call me over, I trust we lay here, till we must
I'm balancing on one fine wire
With my bass down low
Oh, I just never smiled, but you have a glow, a glow from an inner sense I'll never know
Held each other to the breaking day
And there's one more thing
But the truth is I only have myself to blame
You're thinkin' it's the truth
I'm comfortable enough to feel your warmth
You came just one dream ago,
But I still remember when I saw you as a goddess
And wash this world away
There's a light inside of you
So tell everybody I'm on my way
Just leave the lilac print on the linen sheet
This is the part where you leave me
We get it almost every night
Still stuck on the line
That magic walk that's in your sky
Oh the unspeakable things
You're caught between the devil and the deep blue sea
Let's just talk together, you and me and me and you and if there's nothing much to say
Hands together
To see it come to and end
Singing the gospel in my mind
You can try to hide the sun
Should we pretend
Toss a couple milli in the air just for the heck of it
Yeah ayeah, you make amy dreams come true
To what I've got to say
You've come to the right man because
I knew you were wide awake
Hear the bells are ringing joyful and triumphant
Thinking once there was a power that you were wielding
'Cause it's not the fall that hurts
Gonna cry myself to sleep at night
And I never know where I stand
To the rock and roll to the boom boom beat
Woke up on the floor
I want to be like water and never have a doubt and
Oh I need your love, I need your love,
I am holdin' on
Es ist egal, was du isst
I just want to feel something today
Oh no let's go
Couldn't have been no more than one or two
Don't stop talkin'
I didn't like their schemes, I couldn't buy their rules
If you surround yourself with negative people
Without a care in the world
We're together dead and lonely
I bet you didn't even know
Girl you got to realize before it ever starts
Each quarter note, each marble step
You walked right in and brought the gift
We swim underwater, and our mouths  In tune
The way you move ain't fair, you know
Oh I, oh I, I'm gonna fix this world up for you
Workin' down the street
A daydream will last long into the night
So come on and save this one in a photograph
Oh I kiss you and I know
So hold my hand
The morning's on it's way, our friends all say goodbye
A sore sight
I don't mind, no
A test no man could be prepared for
But just when you think you've had enough and your dreams come true
So backwards the landscape you thought you knew, it starts unwinding
To hold you tight until you left me and fade
I'm in love with her and I feel fine
People say that when the moon is full and all the stars have gone to bed,
But things just get so crazy, living life gets hard to do 
You look at me, we kiss and then
But tell you too much conversation won't get you off
And I bet everybody here
I knew when we collided, you're the one I have decided
It's up to you, now make your move
Close your eyes, close your ears young man
'Cause you are the light
I'll move on
I'm trying to keep my back from the wall
And we don't care about the young folk
I know that every single night
And when the radical priest come to get me released
Ensured that we wouldn't sleep for long
I got a habit just to drive, gettin' head and I roam
I should be arrested
To call my own
Why do I always have to tell you  forget about the prescient signs, forget about the life we knew
Or Thursday watch the walls instead
If you've got a special interest
Well, I like to hip hop,
One foot in your bedroom, and one foot out the door
I need some time to define my mind,
Do ya, do ya, do ya want me Do ya love me 'cause I wanna know
We might be dead by tomorrow
In the thick of the evening when the dealing got rough
Well, they fly in the air as you comb your hair
The coolest kid in the neighborhood
Wondering blithely what the dinner bell will bring
But it's kinda cute
Remember it's for you, for helvede we are proud
Russell said I sounded like G, the nigga fronted
Wonderful songs of love
The world outside created just for you
The tender love and care
Today is a lovely day to run
Because before you pick up the phone you'll be dead
He says, Amen and Hallelujah
I can call you Betty
As I was walking 'round Grosvenor Square
Repeating history
But you will end up all alooone
The bluebirds fly
Tell you if you've got food on you're face
Stumbling over what to say
Doesn't mean I sad because I
Pushing through the topsoil,
And then I saw her face
Remember feelin'
I spent the winter on the verge of a total breakdown while living in Norway
And I don't wanna fall
Someday I'll wish upon a star
Yeah got my friends right to the end
I suppose it's the way the cookie crumbles
Oh, who will care, yeah
I'm looking for a nice way to say I'm out
I watched you get undressed
Get healthy, and all the things that you want
But there's people in the floorboards said the mouse
Found out you could, but too scared to try
You're so unreasonable
Nothing is wicked, everything's fun
The world's turning 'round for you 
Or are you slowly drowning me
With another guy
Your spirit's watching over me dear Yoko
And the only thing constant was the constant reminder he'd never change
Hello lamppost, what'cha knowin'
Are you out there where the rainy days
Oohoohooh
Ooh, I don't need you now, the seeds are sown
So the story goes, and so I've heard it said,
And I need someone new
So you claim you love me too,
You know we all shine on
However much you use me baby, come on use me more
If you hear him coming, won't you let me flee
To go back to where I was would just be wrong
Eyes bright, uptight, just girls
Where we roast all the dreams
But none of them worked out for me
And watch it slowly die
Baby, thank you for the second chances
But look here until then
But now I live in a house with a country gate
You can trust I've never felt it like I feel it now
Killed a flower in someone's garden, but I don't care,
Worryin' about the market place
You're just a momma's boy, momma's boy x
There was a loophole in my dreaming
Where are you
It's all right baby, it's all right baby girl
Cowgirl king of the rodeo
Know that I will always run to greet you
What religion or reason could drive a man to forsake his lover
Four letter words won't hold any sway uh uh
'Cause most kids give me credit for being down with it
I power on hard and I check my messages
The lights
Everybody gonna make it to the cemetery
I like her for her mind
And we both know my heart could be broken
And so I won't play a part in your mistake, no way
On the graveyards and dead seacaptains
Well I'm shaking my hips
And of thoughts unkind
Will you say goodbye before you leave
And you don't even know my name
But what am I gonna say,
You can try through skin and bone
Not way over in a bucket seat
We can get him started, yeah
I've gotta search hard for your clues
Reflect what is around my pool
It's just a little a lullaby to keep myself from crying myself to sleep at night
And when we've had a few more days When we've had a few more days
Goddamn right, it's a beautiful day 
Well I'm not happy, I'm in disgrace
Long as you let me in your bed
All I saw was a man that had a hat that had a pompom
Love experiments and face burning
I can hear it in the back of my mind
Buy a house, settle down, do our thing
A piece of mine is a lot to ask for
It's in the eyes of the beholder
Mommy and Daddy's got the best cocaine
Brown eyes and lungs are filled up with smoke
Like a tiny bobbing head
She met a boy and at the summer's end
Out through the open door
And I know, and I know
And when I'm withered
And I'll be gentle, be gentle, be gentle, be gentle with you
Say it's time that I try to move on that the life that we had is now gone
Feel real bad, then get over it
And far too early in the daytime,
And that's got to be the way it is
Nothing has changed, it's still the same
Oh I, you're better off without me
The place and the time where we knew everything could go wrong
Wipe the cobwebs away
Da doo dada da, yeah, we're happappy
And I'll live in a house with a bunch of people
And don't worry 'bout it girls 'cause I like it like
Shaking sticks, oh what a show, rushing joy from tip to toe
Still it's just that I don't feel like it much these days
Well, it's all right, even if they say you're wrong
This is the way you left me
The cork that bottles up your wine
I really got a good excuse to complain
Yes Jade is the girl of the hour
Sitting on a flagstone talking to a faceless girl
You sure look fine You sure look fine
I've forgotten what it feels like to feel normal
I really knew you
If we don't, nobody will
Meet me in the crowd, people, people
I am always right
A plot begins to take shape
Ba ba ba ba da ba, it was always
I'm around when your head is heavy
There's plenty there for everybody
So one thing led to another
And the twinkle in your eye
Take you with me if I can get up now, get up
That's all right, don't worry 'bout it honey
They didn't know that his faith was earthly bound
We can take a ride just you and me
Honey child, you make my day
And leave teardrops everywhere
I'm so aware of everything, I'm still aware of where I am
I wanna get better
I'm bustin' for the money so I get by 
What you have in mind
Buy everything
Timbaland
Some things in life are bad
I don't know where the bus stops next
Is it 'cause you're just like your mother Like your mother
Thursday's all but wasted now
From anything you do
And I'm still wondering who to be
Like a painting on a wall
Things will be okay
You want it you got it all
I can live in honesty
They were laughing and drinking and smoking and singing
And now I'm feeling high
And she's strung out on soda
Fire, move my body like a merrygoround
Don't change your name, keep it the same
You might lose your faith in Jesus,
Beneath the seven different reasons for satellites,
She said, "I'm with stupid"
Like authors and painters,
And so there's no need even going,
I can see you take the money 
And she stares at the fire all day, mumbling to herself
Good night, baby
But if there's trouble she's got the moves
Well, I go to bed
And the music's seeping through
It's a wonder this cold comfort
And get out from behind this plow
I have lost my mouth organ
I feel I've got a lot to prove
Come come come on
Invites us to be with her
Throw your hands in the air 'cause we'll shake it up tonight
I need a photoopportunity
But I'll be there, I'll wait by your side
I'm gonna put, put things in perspective
When I trip on my feet
He sometimes likes to spread it out around the floor
So vexed to find evidently there's still so much that hides
Makeup eaten up by crocodile tears
Blow steam in the face of the beast
I stand outside under broken leaves
I've known a lotta girls before
In December drinking horchata
The media are getting really good at lying,
And I can't control it you've got me all over the road
Baby's good to me, you know
I think I see you coming to town, just dragging you down
Feels like a big balloon
And as time goes by we get a little bit tired waking and baked another Marlboro mile wide
She took my arm
When I delivered newspapers they said I was too slow
Visions of pills that put you in a loving trance
Cleaning up the house again
Want to make sure that you never waste my time again
That gets to walk off with the girl
Another summer's passing by 
The last thing on your mind
Sitting in our dreamy daze by the water's edge
He drives her round the bend
I've landed
If your brother won't rock, then your sister will
They come in doing cartwheels
Und sich 'nen Teufel um die Bestäubungsfrage scheren
And the books are fried
You know I'm the girl that you should call
Well, how can I forget
It's just a dream
Won't you show me some, baby
Oh, you just gotta call on me
Romance has broke down
I've borrowed some tools to chisel you down with
I wonder if she's been naked in her room since I've been gone
Like you know
The river's ran dry just when it was needed
You've got your bad apples to ruin your bunch
You show me prejudice and greed
To get up and go
Like authors and painters
My heart cries out more, baby
My, my the cruelest lies are often told without a word
Things will never look the same
We gonna live like it's the end of the World
If you like them, yeah
Bad days good fortune, yeah, are things you find
Where did you go
You are always trying to keep it real
You say, I like what you say
Out of macaroni pieces
I'll be your winter coat, buttoned and zipped straight to the throat
The taste of scotch rich on my tongue
I think I've found my baby
And I, I'll drink all the time
The moon was shinin', on the lake that night
Battened down to fare the wind
Maybe I should've seen the signs
When I'm shaking my hips
And everyone will know me by a different name
Cigarettes and a six pack, he just got back
Our love goodbye
So many interesting effects
Falling asleep together holding your body, close to mine
Mashin' to the music, I can do anything
I don't believe this, I'm in love again
Hand me my nose ring
I could stand it if I just keep breathin' oh
And you walk wet streets, tryin' to remember
Those kids are making progress now
My momma told me don't lose you
It makes me wish I wasn't bashful
Tell me I look stunning and cadaverous
I speak a different language but I still hear your call
It just can lead back to her door
All I need is a hook now
Then you moved on Woah oh oh oh
There's no more keep it in the background
Why don't you give love
And I did the same
Of air
That my stinger always stays
Along with me
Is it OK if I speak to you today
I feel alright, I found a place that fits tight
Been wasting all my time
Writing letters on my wall
You make me happy, you make me happy, no
Thanks for the call
We just sold out all the floor seats
Togetherness ecstasy is what I need
OK I'm letting go
Catch my tears, with a kiss
Gotta let the feelings show
Was something that didn't suit youa lack of interest perhaps
I've been a gloomy Petrarch, with a quill as weepy as Dido
Set me free, baby
You are everything and more to me
The blue air is up there
This time I know nothings wrong
Closer to the sky 
Everyone you forgot
She said to me that she's so stressed out that it's soothing
No, never let you go
But everybody's pretending the sun won't ever come out
Away with the small ideas, I know I'm not the only one
I don�t fall in love, I don�t fall in love
Let's get down, we've been waiting a long time
No need to worry 'cause
From now on you know that I do
I've had too much to drink
It seems, for years and years
Blister on a turnpike, let me by
Meet her by the sugar mill after school 
Turntables in my eyes
Vanilla smile and a gorgeous strawberry kiss
It's gonna take me home to you
And always look on the bright side of life
Who You baby, you Baby, yeah
They mute up my mind
Islands and cities I have looked
And when I make up my mind
And everything looks worse in black and white
Residential neighborhood
Why don't you fly around my pretty little miss
So stomp your feet and clap your hands
So I try so hard to keep the rhythm of a train
 What do you say
I feel so caught up in a bud
Devil take your money
But my troops are bigger than yours
Parents little girl will be wondering
And for a moment I escape and I forget
And I'm as good as dead,
And watched the fires that were reaching
Sunday morning creeping like a nun
For every inch we get we need a mile more
And they showed me that it was lead
You must raise your prayer to a shout
And we fall hardest better worst than best
And another thing to live again
So stand in the place where you live
With a happy refrain
What did you see when you were there
When they say wake up
Everybody wants to go to Japan
I've got nothing to say but "It's okay"
Another big bang and you're down on the floor
I pray to God twice in the evenings
The light is just right, even if she falls in love
And you have nothing left to lose
Get away from the door
It's a mystery
And I need you to help me count my toes 
Wanna break the door down
You say aloud that you would have been my wife
And I don't wanna spend all of my life just waiting for you
It's the land of make believe, can't you see, can't you see
Now, we got something for dinner
If you know what I mean 
I just want to know how you've been
But it can do what it want whenever it wants and I don't mind
So I pulled up to the red light, sittin' here in my car
Warm beneath your gentle company
Because loving is the sweetest thing
Had it been another day
Is this an island that plots like a villain
Of these strangers in the pages
Oh there's nothing left just you and I,
Peasant child, you're into botany
Everything is ok we can try to make it
She lets me drive her car so I can score an eighth
Oh Carolina, happy belated
And her ways are high and steep
Don't be afraid of the man in the moon, because it's only me
I made history, honey and got "Please do it again"
'Cause I ain't got all night 
Let the painted horse on the carousel remain
Blue canary in the outlet by the light switch While you're at it
Lady, your kicks of silence cough into your room
I have been there through it all
For a tender glance, ohoho
That cried if we ever left his side
He was looking to the sky and
I'll take my chances
Happiness, how you get to find
Was it all a dream, cause your finally breaking free
Of the living people living their lives away
I was a lonely soul but that's the old me
Get it, get it 
You don't know what it's like to listen to your fears
Because once we hit the top there's no stopping us, No
En Descontroool Yeah ooh ooh
Of every head he's had the pleasure to know
Said that you couldn't stay and wait for me
Let's just pray for our fates and then give it a rest
And I keep on forgetting myself
Rattle the cage and slam that door
Yeah you give me exactly what I need
If all is grounded you should go make a mountain out of it
Kinda like this thing but there's something you should know 
It all went to my heart, yeah some rainbows in the dark
Well I've been doin' my homework all week long
Backseat on the 
I put a price on what you say
Life is "Oh my God, if I tell him, he'll tell her, and then she will know I like her"
Whatever chances you get
And the fairy lights
And the touch of your lips
Come back, come back,
You're the saddle of the world you don't get to know
Celebrate, infatuate, lock us up, yeah, incarcerate oh
Near our home
Is God playing evil tricks on me
Work, work, work if you
I'm not in love
Then I'll compliment him on his political etiquette
And you're right
The whole world bang to rights
I know you'll be the one who'll always remind me
Oh baby, do you wanna dance
And when you got no time
Run up at you hot footed, catch me if you can
You keep giving me signs that you think I wanna see
Hum hallelujah, hum hallelujah
I don't feel supersonic
Third time in a doorway
And we work hard for our living wage
I have seen the world
'Cause now I feel it all
Finger on the trigger, let me tell you, it is quite a scare
All the colorful days my friend
I could die in a hundred odd ways
And I will soon be put to rest now
And it's wonderful baby, baby, baby, baby, please
'Cause I know you're right here in mine
Anywhere your luck was right 
The most truly repellent techno music ever made
Crush high then I go and take some pills
We've got to keep our little click clicking at  BPM
With all your power 
It's moving through town as big as a train
You got a look in your eye
Where we are going to
Dreams of realities peace
To tell you the truth
Tell me where you need to go
Oh, I feel like a champion in the stadium
And I know it's late, I know it's cold
But you know the places I wanna go
All by myself, Waking up at twelve in my clothes again
Gotta get my feet back on the ground
My heart is bound to beat right out my untrimmed chest
She's a girl and you're a boy
The trick is just making yourself
I saw life turn into a TV show
You'll always be mine Mine
The way that she does it, I can't get enough
You tell me baby
Return to me
What the mama saw
We danced the junkies in the shadows of bad modern art
Gonna let it all roll right past me
Hey, glad girls only want to get you high
Autumn hanging down all the trees are draped like chandeliers
Moments live or moments die
A clean shave in the morning
No one will ever like you, you're not good at anything"
If you would pretty lady
Where is the wonderful me
Travelling at the speed of light
Unless I was holding Taiyeh chainRest In Peace
And should not confuse my foggy mirror
I didn't know I was broken till I wanted to change
You hold a candle in your heart
So just breathe it in
All my loving, All my loving
Meanwhile back
I could tell when you smile
Everyone's watching
If he were President now
I don't wanna drink,
He'll look around the room, he won't tell you his plan
when all I wanna do is get off
Soon as my eyes see tha sunshine
The bullet some kind of lord and king
I'm still afraid to get lost, in a city I might explore
But what use is that to you or me, baby
Now say you're mine
It won't stop, I won't come down, I keep stock
You can stand out, with a hand out, but nobody give a fuck
Right is right
And the guns shot above our heads over our heads
Do you need anybody
It's okay to lean over, lean over my way
Drank the tears from those who cried
Come on the fun is just begun
You go through all the pain and strife
So you share secrets with Lou, but we've got secrets too 
If you sell that soul, that's fine, alright
I was there when you were bad There when you were bad
Cuidado, cora,c~ao              	        Be careful, heart
I will take off all my clothes for you
When the stars are shining on you
No words
In your itsybitsy teenyweenie ridingupyourbutt bikini
Last night we had a rendezvous
It takes a thought to make a word
And the room is cold
'Cause baby I just wanna know
I got a question for you
Pressed up to the window
A little bag of cocaine
Of a man who is young and able
Life gets hard and I'm headed for the highway home, home
Shiny happy people holding hands
And I know this place like the back of my hands
I let my frailty take the wheel
People in love get special treatment
Why you do the things you do
Take it down, propeller, she winding, winding, wind
May I remind you that you don't live in poverty,
Yeah an' every place feels like a familiar town
Let it tear us apart
But I'm still asleep
Till the end of the day
And then night came, so we got into our sleeping bags
I'm this natural wonder, yeah
Like hot water  in my tea cup
Except the mouth
"Never let your fear decide your fate"
Who could say things that 
And the linens
To bend and to breathe on
But every time I look at you I just don't care
A pretty train crash to me and I can't care
Feel trapped in your own skin
Hush hush the world is quiet
In Penny Lane, there is a fireman with an hour glass
Redondo Beach, LA Inside, outside, USA
I'm gonna do it, gonna do it my way
All that seemed like luck
Your lovin' on the side
Timb are you on it
Oh but baby you can turn it on
Just where it will end
To the beatbox, spinning 'round
We finally had frontpage news
I cannot reach a pen for me to draw the line draw the line
Payback, payback the monkey
Come on, break it up
And let's love loud
So we'll live it for the weekend
Yeah, you get me
The past is gone, it's all been said
I'm as deep as the plot to a gay porn
It's gonna be everything you've ever dreamed
We are free
Next time, at a party
Well I think the time has come
I promise I've always been like this
Love is always hunted
They're stomping their feet
Maybe we can talk about it
Seems the more I gave the less I got
I backed my car into a cop car the other day
I'm walking down this road of mine, this road that I call home
And I will pray that those rocks
Nothin' seems to change
Then won't you stay the night
And besides it is gone
One day like this a year would see me right
And when they flashed your picture cross the screen
Descoontroooool Ooh ooh oooh
Skies are blue
Got something if you only, only, only stay
Mm I get high with a little help from my friends
You are the light by which I travel into this and that
If you want you should move away"
From this place on the mantle my heart was taken down
Should I tell you how bad I need you now
And I'm glad it's today 'cause now I am strong
A sacred night, where we'll watch the fireworks
Sun rising, still asleep
As long as anyone with hot blood can hot blood can
From the comet's cradle
When the conversation stops and we're facing our defeat
You'll know it's true
You know we can't cop to
Girl, I've got the feeling you're feeling something
You've got everything I need and nobody can please like you, you baby
Cause there is no point in standing in the past cause it's over
Them throwing stones
Who cares that it is shining
And my mystery my mystery
And there's nothing to prove
Safely walk to school without a sound
Everything will go, it's all right baby
I was never cool in school
And when they tell you they love ya
The TV man is too loud
I love hard with everything
I feel happy inside when I see your face
It's been a long time coming since I've seen your face
Who's that shadow holding me hostage
On our super lunar honeymoon
Happy, happy
Late nights, all entwined
Cuando se besen la luna y la arena
I've always put my cards upon the table
'Cause the best luck I had was you
Because we're what you want to solve all your problems for tonight
You got yourself a job cleaning hospital floors
Life, yeah that's city life, yeah that's city life, yeah that's city life
Clothes are made of rags and they don't even match
Like a silverblade
To the room where I'm staying, 
You're only brave till you're scared
Oh well, in five years time we could be walking 'round a zoo
The view behind the legs of dancers
Cradled by moonlight, I'm dreaming we'll be
That you don't make me wait, and never let me break
And down in the dirt, in her wandering
So start giving in, yeah you better get down
But don't react now, you can't go back now
I kick it like Adidas, flowin' sticky like adhesive
Is one long sleepless night
Don't you feel that hunger
Even when somebody knocks
Walks into the room
And it seems like it's always so hard
Music is my imaginary friend
But there's no point in listening
And you, you gots the mud
In a distant hellhole room
You know that boom boom pow
On the same greasy street
And some shoes on my feet
Life plays such silly games inside of me
I'm alive  and the sun rises up so high
You can feel your body changing
Or united nation, put it to your head
When I put my hand between your legs 
Strangers stopping strangers just to shake their hand
Just one more box of cheapo wine
The boxes and rings and get going
A little bit of Mary all night long
On the good days
And in a way I guess it was
Been practiced for millions of years
And feel it, feel it, feel it babe
Let's sing it to the world
Are you listening to a single word I've said
It's my turn
And if I lose my patience, oh yeah
We'll pour another round and come back to life
I'm fine here alone now without you
Things can only get, can only get
And you could say, "Your love to me,"
If I only knew
Forgiving, faced the seventh year
He picks up the mail from the slot
Whenever we kiss, I get a feeling like this
Next step into the stars
Has long been outgrown
Come on over, borrow my clover
He's the killer of retentative lies
I never had a dog that liked me some
Where finding love is a battle
Elmore James got nothin' on this, baby
But I don't care
She says that I cannot go
I'd like to return this spell
Two steps closer to the level I imagined 
This could really be a good life
I know you never felt romance
At the studio console, asked my man to the right
I could start over clean
Look in the mirror have no idea what happened in between
In a physical way
All the colors of this world will run together more than ever
Over to the field for tackle football 
I heard your heart say love, love, love
Let me stop to lock my top
And when I get off at Tennebrook Farm
And this will do me no good
A scenic world, where the sun sets are all
Good times around the corner
Everything ends
Ache in my leg from a broken seat
Don't do it if you're just trying to please me
Safe in a stone house by the sea
Tapping feet, wanna take the lead A trip back in time is all I need
Oh, we get together
I'll be the one who'll break my heart
That bends back from underneath your feet
You know I'd give you it all
The way you love me down
Even the songs you thought I'd never sing
In love with someone else
One to the front and one to the side
It carries on till you crawl
You give me feelings that I adore
I peeked to see if you were way back when
Into a blushing romantic
Little sips of the Hollywood bowl
Like everyone wants to say I love you to someone on the radio, radio
They got their own share of plate and a seat 
Now when you're movin' to the city
Just remember that the last laugh is on you
Breaking through the boundaries
Take what you need till your body is numb
Go baby, go baby, yeah we're looking at you
Drop it to the floor
But I'm taken by the hand to a blue pay phone
They swallowed it whole, they went for the gold for the gold
Do you hear the voice inside your head
But girl I apologize
I'll let them fight it out
Every inch of you spells out desire
I love you, ONO
Kitten, not everyone's keen on lighting candle  
But it's all right if you act like a turd
Trying to dry and to dry and to dry but no good
But when we broke up, I got back a part of me I really missed
Something like Voltron
'Cause it's all been sold
Blow that breeze on my face
I cry, mmmm, hello, little girl
Underneath the stairs
I feel so tired
See the signs and know their meaning
Sweedee, too good to miss
You're everywhere and nowhere, baby
Can you taste it any feeling that you got
She drinks tea
And I will keep you company for those days so long and black
And bad weather
When they made love he shared the burden of his mind
She goes out looking for
And a pillow for my head
Won't you understand 'Cause I don't wanna walk alone
Oh no then they moved us to the sky
I was thinking about singin' this song for you
I'm waxin' on I'm waxin' off I'm waxin' just because
There's a painter painting his masterpiece
Cause now I'm standing on my own
Spilling out across your room
My heart is beating madly for her
We're on to something good here
We're running through the aisles
With pills in my coat
It's the way my heart beats
When you wake up shouting "Idea"
Make a point to make no sense, well, here it comes
Lots of fun for everyone
Who once saved you your day
Lose our sense of direction
Look at the beat
Talking only me and you
Of this I'm fairly clear
Yeah, 'cause we can get down
Now I'm trying to get back
Stole and sold and ripped to part
Do you know what it's like to fall on the floor
You'll be strong and you'll turn me on
I been doing a good job of makin' 'em think
Why am I making this hard on myself
But if I show it, someone lock me away, because
I'm breathing deep before
If music is the victim then so am I 
Oh yeah you look at me
The meek shall inherit your love now
And that was back around '
We built our getaway up in a tree we found
I'm starting to feel 
It might be you and me oh we could be a team
I'm blinking in the light,
Wish you knew how much I loved your legs and your hair
You are the anchor that holds me
Going out the street again 
With every step we take, Kyoto to The Bay 
Is there trouble on the line
Beside a boy, you just don't know if he is up for
Well these days I'm spread so thin
Everybody dancin' in the moonlight
Or inside out
There was a girl that passed me by
Still, I only feel all right when the VU is flashing
This is a classic bluff because it always works on you
You creep into my mind
'Cause you're a momma's boy, momma's boy
Staring at the dark
Think of a place I would go
Even though it never lets you down
I am floating away floating away
I know that you did 'cause you said it and you wrote it down
I'm ready for this, you stop me falling
Wanna get your mitts in my oven
The tapestries turn
The world is in a crazy, hazy hue
Yes, I can tell that we are gonna be friends
Free, free to run and cry 
Cause there's someone behind every hand that you've made a connection
The higher you reach the harder you fall
So dear, oh dear
Gotta new set of friends, a new kind of business
Hawaiian notes, don't need no pounds
It's where your heart goes, 
It was worth it just to learn some sleight of hand
I'm keeping the rabbit, the bat, and the reindeer
Never knew when it wasn't there because
The lights go on
And if you do then you're my friend
If anything should happen, I guess I wish you well
Walking down a sunny street to the library
Hoping I could learn a bit about what is true and fake
Just my imagination
Someday you'll miss every single day we spent
And I grabbed your wrist and told you
And death's the final word
Soup of the day
Have you ever wondered if oceans can freeze
Live your life with arms wide open
You aren't looking hard enough
Saying we can't go, saying we don't know
Don't waste another day at all
And you know you love me and it shows
Like come here, we go right
Your gonna scream the pain away
He hasn't got the money
Not back for a day
You can try to hold the breeze
Who said "A Genii made me out of the earth's skin"
I liked you from the start
I'd come into your party
Don't give me no head rush in the morning
I'm just being honest
Seems fine, though it ain't no no no no
She's the midnight pick of the day, yeah
To the left and to the right, buildings towering to the sky
Will you wait until tomorrow Will you wait tomorrow
By surprise
Like cold lemonade
It's it's just the trials and tribulations you go through in life
Working at a nightclub that was called The Avenue
Your cold fronts and the rain don't matter
Give up acting unaware
Weakened knees call
Love love me
Happy to be that way
Headfirst the motor runs, the motor must run
And we looked at them eleven ways
'Cause your heart has a lack of color
And it's byebye, goodbye I tried
Well, it terrifies the life from out of me
I've been traveling abroad
If the elephants are reaching for our purses
You know nothing seems to fit, I couldn't see my way through the shit
Spend his day at the daybreak
Well pick me up with golden hand
Oh, why is your face so pale and white
You'll be my American boy
Excuse Me  Did I Do Something Wrong
We are diamonds taking shape
Because I didn't think about the message
Wait for me, wait for me, wait for me
When you look with your eyes
And let your love grow
Things can only get better
The last word on your breath
And the grass stains are wet on your new jeans
I feel like a ghost, I've got the skeleton face
'Cause I want to know everything about you
You cannot run or ever hide it away
To the city
Goodbyeeeeye
Colours and colours and colours of colours
To someone else,
But practice makes perfect
Ain't no rhythm on the street
I borrowed your suitcase and filled it with pearls and gold, 
Music is my dead end
'Cause I always have to steal my kisses from you
Oh, one day when you're looking back 
We must live while we can
Find your own direction 'cause there's sweetness in the air
To confront his own fears
Eh, eh, I wish he never looked at me that way
It's getting better all the time
Sometimes I need to be alone oh yeyeah
When its hot baby uh
Now everybody knows
Old dirt road Mushaboom, mushaboom
I was eating with a good friend
The rustling leaves and branches bend together
He never got far 
We've come so close yet so far away
Away away
So now you pour your heart out
You gonna shine, shine on, my friend
So I'll never feel alone in your arms
For one moment's eternity
And fish them from the sky, my darling, she and I
Known to act wild and make girls smile
And now it's been ten years
The sun's in my heart
We came here to rock the microphone 
And wouldn't it be nice to live together
I declare my room a scene
And they didn't know how to prove it
I see the bare moon
Ingen stoppar var chans
Anything you want is yours now
I'm in love, I'm in love
If you're small and on a search
Phony grabs with the manicured hands
And now I'm callin' out your name on this radio campaign
Before you blow their town away
Come on Barbie, let's go party
Such a danger so we gotta slide
And he came running out of the water
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah gee baby
It's  o'clock on a Friday morning,
Woke up this morning early before my family
Turn me into something faceless,
Tossed this in the river like I threw away my old heat
I know the reaper
Now those who knew my situation prolly thought a mirror shattered
God is with us everyday
When I hit the flow the girls come snappin' at me
But neither of them know that you are carryin' my baby
Who wants to have me just to love me
I get tired and upset
If you listen to your words, then he might like what you say
My mind was thugged, all laced and bugged, all twisted, wrong and beat
Could you first pull out a book and 
O my dear you're a threat to the bad we all see
And if I wait
And said to all those men as she said to me before
Call a taxi, pack the back seat
For so many nights now
I say soda, soda
And redesigned
Trying to keep myself away from you,
When there's a million things to learn they never teach you in school
I got your remedy for those who don't remember me
It ain't what you say, it's what you do
I knew that this was different from the start 
And now I know I'm at the end of my wits
Rabbit or a habit
I really, I really, I really remember when you drank my wine
She's got a boyfriend
My coke has got no ice in there
Pouring out of your mouth
Aha, shake
And I cried myself to sleep last night
Yes, tonight I have to
I never knew nothing so there's nothing to forget
You gave me love, babe
And threw him out that window, he went
In the living room
And in the flood of morning light
It's time to bring out the big, big, big, big, big, big balloons
The road outside my house is paved with good intentions
Some people like to call me Chuck
I'm beggin you please
Well, it's all right, the best you can do is forgive
Sais e minerais, evaporar
It's "Charles" and you are shit outta luck
We found the little man
'Cause nothing can hurt us
And her friends are all the same and they know it's not right
At Waiamea Bay Inside, outside, USA
I just wanna be your firecracker
In the suits that you got him, he looks more Italian
If I should call you up, invest a dime
And I whip my loving arms around you
You're on my mind, all the time We are not wasting this
Life sometimes seems to get the best of you
They have built a home sweet home home HOME
Come on like a freak show takes the stage
Until your breathing stops forever, forever
Oh, it is love
Oh, Thursday doesn't even start
So call me Mr Magic Man, I float on Cloud 
'Bout someone that you're never gonna get to touch
But we could spend the night together
Freeze outside for one quick smoke
Well, you were there when the wall came down
Ride wit' me nigga, let me show you where we kick it at
I was paralyzed
You left me for a drummer 'cause you said I couldn't sing
From your previous life
Your daddy
Feels like I'm dreaming but
Oh well, I look at you and say
Looking for a lover to climb inside
Alors défendezvous
Yeah, yeah
I was frightened, but I held fast
And I like to tiptoe 'round
The dog days are over
And we can act like we come from out of this world
The day is beautiful and so are you 
On my feet I wear two shoes for dancing
All the baggage and dreams
I'm holding it all tonight
You'll be true and be faithful too
What I have is right here
There's a sun coming over the horizon
I wanna get out and build my own home
Sick body part
Awaken from a slumber to a rollercoaster ride
As I want to scream with you
If I want to change the world, it's gotta start with me
Because I'm happy
Now you're away, you write home everyday
I guess you think it's funny now,
Better ways to say
Show me what you've got underneath
Where all the leaves have been swept and the flowers grow
Reign of love by the church we're waiting
And love's not just a flare on my sleeve
Above this dull apartment view
So come pick me up
I wanna make you happy, are you a good girl tonight
There's no turning back for us tonight
Look around, you see
But I really do believe that someday 
Would you be my love, my love could you be mine
I say soda soda, I'm a high rolla yo sir
And all I'm doing here is just waiting for you
This time around, well I'm not buying it
Blazing new trails
Please don't be a player hater
Too closely in the book
Me and you, get it Ain't nobody's business
It's gonna hurt but I'll have to say goodbye say goodbye
Easy going ways,
Since everything has changed
Hostility explodes in the mess, now your arm got blood all over the wall,
You're anything but classy
I know you're losing sleep over me
A little bit of knowledge will destroy you
The blood in my veins and the wind in my lungs
We could ride, we could ride
I will not hold it in
Her name is Nona, she's a rocker with a nose ring
Ya estas aqui y mi mente exploto, 
When it gets dark I tow your heart away
Someone above is looking with a tender eye
You'd think me rude, but I would just stand and stare
It blooms to spread love and joy faith and hope to people forlorn
'Cause my love has just left me
Yes, I understand I cannot live on this land
A dying cigarette in the rain
But I know that it's not you
I will play awhile here
I said, her skin is cinnamon, her skin is cinnamon
You paid to get in
Headed where the voices are
Go, go, baby don't go
Keep you trapped inside your room there all alone
Glow like fireflies
Today is a day I will remember
So Stand Up For the lololololololololololove Yeah
Then somethin' without warnin love
Except for cigarettes and wine
To make some dreams come true
Would send you my way
Fresh tears leaving nervous on me
Don't stop me now I'm having such a good time
Won herself a pass to some far off moon
And I know why
That was not it but I thought it
With blue skies ahead
Let's get into a coma just like the stars
As if to pray to the gods of the festival
It's too dark to discard the life I once knew
Desperate times, get desperate mesure
And the sky is a bluish grey
And don't it feel good
He said, "Well I hate that it's come to this
You know she tries, she tried and tried
I walk down the lane
We could dance till our feet turn red
I got the magic in me
We've taken adventures to new levels of fun
Wasn't alive back in the sixties
Trade your broken wings for mine
Don't play with me
We keep it rockin' till  am
All them tears gon' come and go
Body like a weapon that'll make you go boom
So baby don't hold back, go with the flow
Oh when you smile at me
I wanna kiss you on the mouth and tell you
But not you, I feel your faith is destroying the world
Tootootoodooroo
If you drink, if you heal
Cheering
Pour the cops a cup cause everybody's here tonight
We will be all right
The good, the bad and ugly too
Everyone watching us just turns away with disgust
There's too many clouds, not enough sun 
Let me know, boys, let me know
There's somethin' 'bout the way the street looks when it's just rained
'Cause we wasted all our free time alone
You never know what the night it may bring
When the street lights are far beyond you
'Cause my heart is yours
Well now there's no one to watch your TV
And we made a lovely three
I'm a little firefly
Heart stopped beating
It's a perfect day for doing the unstuck
And, I thought, These shoes just don't suit me
Easy way to tell one so
Ain't got no skirts, ain't got no sweater
Home, let me come home
Still wears the locket 'round her neck
The moment that you get there go baby
Now you return in a rain coat, riverboat
Desmond stays at home and does his pretty face
All things know, all things know I made a lot of mistakes
Still prepared for an attack
Would I still be into you 
Too afraid to open your eyes
They're not demands, they're just the plans
Just get me off of the boat for a little while
Snowmobile on the field where the gunners throw their weight around
I want a kiss that's as sharp as a knife
And even if time is passing me by a lot
How boring if it is
I'm dreaming you're out in the blue
Now some black paint
No wonder your heart feels it's flying, your head feels it's spinning 
Pulling back the covers, her heart will start to shudder when she realizes how deep it all went
We know where we just don't know when
Bears heavy on my mind
Words just aren't right
Can I fold you in fourteen ways to depend not defend
Oh yeah, but things just get so crazy, living life gets hard to do
Must have been the first time
Don't make that call, he'll put you down
Got my eyes on the controls
Here's a tulip to match your eyes
Yeah I could make you excited
Tell me, did you think we'd all dream the same
Baby, look at me with those eyes of grey
A chauffeurdriven dream, 
So come on everybody, let's rock this place
Oh yeah boy you can always count on me
I took this girl out last night and we left around twelve
And all of the things we had
Home sweet home, I've
'Cause you're so ooh Tootootoo, so ah Tootootoo, so cool Baby, you're so supersupremelybabadioh
When you wildin' out, runnin' 'round in these streets
We just can't stop it
Man, you ain't like anybody else
Because we know we can't be found
You're not the type 
I don't know where I'm going, I'm on my way
You lying man You'd be surprised who you see up in there man
You might really love it 
I like to marvel at the random beauty of a simple village girl
It's a lovely day, just got paid
You'll be my sympathetic lover and won't steal the covers
Always seems to know the way
I could deal with this nonstop spinning world
Two people synchronized
And we all want to talk and we do, we do
Shook her head to see him snoring in his sleep
No sense in cashing us now
Where did you go
So I'm sad and I feel lonely
I heard your lyrics, I feel your spirit
I hope that you see through your big yard and white picket fence
Grow ourselves new skin
Judging by the hole in the satellite picture
Nanny bakes fairy cakes
And all you need is a hunger to feed
I got legs on my chair and a head full of hair
We danced in Leeds with Brit Pop Haley
I know we are prisoners
She smokes a cigarette, yeah smokes a cigarette
A new day is rising
I didn't mean to frustrate you
'Cause music is the mantra unwinding your head
Declare myself of faith
And someone said it ain't my scene
'Cause it's kinda funny to me
Don't let me go
I want to be your friend
As I walk my feet on the cold concrete
And realised by the distance in your eyes
I'd rather stay here all the night with everyone who sings
We got carried away
Have a good time, 
Can't you see me wavin' I'm flaggin' a ride
Well tomorrow you're coming home
And I'm skipping breakfast
And watch this life pass me by
That we all, well we all, well we all are still family
She's good to me, oh yeah x
I listened in through hallways and thin doors 
I guess dreams do come true
We're leaving the house just for the day
Now I wish you all the luck
And people speak I hear them saying
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
There's no resting now
Flowers in the love of my arms
Above her dying mind were fossilfied memory imprints of her favorite day
Oh baby, it's bad too bad
Keep on lifting your love keeps lifting me
A text message she sent to me and her girlfriend, inviting us round for tea
Oh, honey, ah, sugar, sugar
From the crowds mouth is perfect
"Love is funny you will laugh
It's been a year and now we find
And feel the shine feel the shine
I'm lookin' at you
It's all in your mind"
I had the blankest year
I wanted to sleep forever
I'm here, I'm calling out your name
And the devil was a girl
And paradise stars
We're glad you're home
Climate change and debt, I still want you
The flowers on the blankets on your bedroom floor
In the most unexpected places
And the chair is a ladderback birch but his friends call him Karl
Sometimes I can't find my good habits
I'm walking on sunshine
There's a place I passed called OnceUponaTime,
Take it slow 'til your body's saying more baby
And I love my hash
She knows no time, she knows no bounds
But first thing in the morning I'd still wake up and I'd hear them say
We're on our way, way, way
I've been trapped by love
It's a shot in the dark but I'll make it,
Find something to hold on to or to let go
I go crazy when you walk in the room
Light bolts hover over you all day
No going back now
Straight from the Philly burbs, feel me pretty sure
She said to me that she's so happy it's depressing
Yeah, yeah
I'm talking Juice Crew, not what the word define
How could we ever forget OhOhWiOh
Holiday sun, OPQ
He's gonna change
Over the twilight you're listening for me
Confirm the terms of our love affair
Don't you take chances
And I'll say fuck Bush and fuck this war
Meet me at the house with all my heart
I wear a coat of feelings and they are loud
Well, I need you to tell me what to wear 
Don't let it fade
In cafés they look away
You seem to be sunk, life is no race
I always gave him wedgies 'cause I thought he worked too hard
Get yourself to the Butterfly Lounge
But you did, and you fell, hard on the ground 
It's all right, the camera's talking
I love you, I love you, I love you
Slept in all day 
Who's this man that's holding your hand
It goes over and over the same old lines
You gotta realize that
A brand new car
Kiss up and rub up and feel up on you
Like driving a padiddle with a burntout fuse 
Throw it away
Always golden, still the greatest
Oh darling, I was blind to let you go
But it sure ain't what we need
Ba, bada, baba, oohooh
Yo, I'm not rowdy but I bang niggas and I pop collas
I like to rock 'n' roll,
I was tired, out of gas
You're in harm's way
Sipping tea in the bar by the road side,
'Cause now I got your back
When I close my eyes you come and you take me
To when they lay my tomb to rest 
Maybe you could break my heart next summer
Then I think we'd see the beauty then
There's nothing like finding gold
And I could never tell as a kid
It tastes sweet
Spent the last two years getting to what's real
Waking up in the midday sun
And a breath is a melody
Was invoked on a Monday on earth
Messes with my mind
I wanna feel this way
Tryin' to trip me up, tryin' to wear me down
A little child
And put your feet back on higher ground
Oh oh everybody's making love
Yin yang yin yang yin yang ying yonana phone
Well, well, well you Ooh, ooh, ooh ooh ooh
Babass, bass down low
You were always on my mind
If we play our cards right we can be more than friends
'Cause I know you do
Come right back
The rats come out to take it over
I'm gonna watch you shine
When he gets to the crowded subway platform
Everything is closed, it's like a ruin
Until the day that I win against them
Like the orphan needs home once again
I don't know what it's called or how it goes
All the people I have left behind
It didn't have to daunt her
We spend all day getting sober
Hopelessly I feel like the window closes oh so quick
Pictures of your mama
The way you move ain't fair you know
I said, "You're holding back"
All he did was plug me in, I got the chargin'
And shake the foundations from the skies
There's nothing I want more and
Nobody paid much attention
Oh taking your advice and I'm looking on the bright side
She tells the same old story to everyone that she knows
It didn't used to be like this
The voyage to the corner of the globe
And he's taking her out 
When she was finished hanging out she was all alone
The smells of the city
I'll fall into it
I know you're making
Oh, you gentlemen and ladies
There is nothing to say but the things I know
Honey for your best man
Lighting fireworks in parking lots
So follow me I'll show you how
Ooh, ooh success ooh, ooh success
Uh, days of our lives
Oh, ooh, ooh
You can't say no to hope, can't say no to happiness
And I'm singing "oh oh" on a Friday night
Well, I don't want a thing to do with you kind
It really was a gas
But I still talk that caaash
You'll cover me in diamonds
Real hard meals wont you stay awhile baby
Imagine the rest, I was put to the test
It's bad enough we get along so well
She can break it up
And anything I said or do
His shoes will walk for miles
I heard the Eskimos remove obstructions with tongues, dear
Don't need no coffee in my cup
In me, and we would be forever together
Everyday I do this
Without you around I couldn't be
And the ones you'd like to be rid of
'Cause you have been selected
I could stand to do without
Hey, hey, hey, come and ride wit' me, nigga, let me show you where we kick it at
You can see it's all lies
Straight buzzin', Robitussin
Hello Seattle, I am a manta ray
Oh my heart is numb
You look like David Bowie
Suspicious for the winter with your
Join a local gang and get a cool nickname
Which played before you silent as a thought,
You know I have, I have a knack
Projects to' up, gang signs is thrown up
And as the surface breaks reflections fade
The birds all were quiet
And planting lilacs and buttercups, oh
She's mighty fine and says she's all mine
Feels like I've been standing right here for years
Oh, say can't you see  The chemistry
If I loved you
Is dying to take you away
I would surely still find
You would be happy not to change your mind
I been whored and I been gored
It's perfect, for a flying honeymoon  they say
Prom night, oscar night, got all that BS beat
You and me there's no one watching
Happy To bring me down, can't nothin'
This is the moment that we
And touch me in the dark
Facing the android's conundrum
Every minute I have needs to be made up, but how
I got love for them all, they'll
And still your heart
Fog rolling down behind the mountains
I know you wanna dance
I set her straight, it's not based on your life 
Let's go away for a while, you and I
I'm a victim of fact let's say I loved a girl
Maybe if we think and wish and hope and pray it might come true
When I found you I knew there was a chance that,
What have you lost Nothing
The end of the world
Who you were hanging with
Here she comes, wooh
And times before that I was cruel
Baby don't be unhappy
I'm looking up, you're looking down
, people think I'm something I'm not
I'm pacing, waiting anxiously
You staring at me
No time, 'cause I'm running late
Love bird, you flew into my window
Our love is still alive you never touch me
Every single one of our London cabbies played
Where there's a will, there's a way
We hit her on the head
You, you know, you know my name, baby Okay
Ninetynine percent an embarrassment 
You make me feel much better
And then while I'm away
Counterpoint
How do I get back there
Under these Northern skies
In case you need more from me
And I'll be dreaming of the day the dream died
I've been an evil tenor, I filled the innocent's doeeyes with glue
And you watched as I was sinking, waving sadly from the pier
We feel we've not made our true goal
You're a pro and it's no surprise
All you need are your kicks when you need 'em
I am sitting at the set of Cali sun
Just say hello to the ground
She wants a man that's got his game locked tight
Friends drink beer in the sun
Dance, dance, dance
While the girls lift clothes down the high street and they say,
You're my love, whoaohohoh
Give me your eyes
If you don't move and get a job
And all the time moves on and on
Girl, your love's so cheap
Yeah, girl just tell me what I want to hear
Your antarctic hair, off with the crown
From a negative and letting 'em annihilate me
Uh I can hear it calling
Start up the car with the sun
Oh yeah yeah, oh yeah yeah, oh yeah yeah
And I'm just looking at your garms
But did I know what I was talking about
It's the beginning of the end today
Now there's a whole lot of faking
That make you mine
I need you, ONO
Yeah, he'd better get out of my way
Have a good time 
We don't talk about it
Homeless, homeless
Your love is perfection
Do you remember when we first moved in together
That was put there to save and protect him
Like you were saying something
Fill my cup, put some liquor in it
Who's around when you can't be strong
Oh, great intentions
In concert tonight
It's Saturday Morning
'Cause you're there when to talk and you're there not to stop and you're with me
Sad minion of mine
Won't you come on over, baby
Then you just gotta try
Her tongue and said "This will all have to come undone"
Help me to the sun, hey I'm looking everywhere
I can't stop awondering
Girl I wanna be good to you,
Oh, the songs it spoke for me when I couldn't speak
Through the screen door kiss me kiss me like a queen
Out here in these streets, every man is for himself 
Don't expect the world with no work that's absurd
Dance all night to this DJ, ya luvva dance all night to this DJ
My My Time Flies A man wrote a symphony
When you look at me
Dance dance dance now the beat's really hot
Happy without you oh x
And I'm afraid I'm not gonna give you back any of those kilojoules
I hate Spin magazine 'cause they never ever plug me
Now there, is this song I wrote
That I been hanging down so low
Let you go baby
Where people like me are found by people like you
I stand up to the shadow that never leaves 
So much so how somewhere something
All of this world, is gonna see you shine
I wanna get satisfaction
A man can never dream these kind of things
Our little place
There must be enough love love love
But in directions, actions and words
'Cause you might get run over or you might get shot
I wish I was a yeti
I kept on falling short of something
A tone that was taken before
This weekend to relax and unwind
No one else, nothing else but you and I
Any way you want to
Forty hours television and prescription pills
You can't be dumb enough to dream so big
 I get "Byebye babybaby bye babybaby byebye"
All the ducks are swimming in the water
I'm stuck with
'Cause deep down I know
And I'm still asleep
Jackson, Mississippi
You know I'm really gonna, really gonna have it made, yeahhea
Oh, I'll be dreaming every night of you
You might be lucky if you try 
Soon I'll be feeling left for dead
In the place that you had it last,
Even though it was the middle of June
Saw the  and  Navi, on Sprees wit' a kit
You will know, cause it ain't hard to tell
We've got the ocean got the babes
And nothing's gonna bring me down
And you could be so much more than you've become
Anything goes so no time for closed minds
'Cause there's no place that I could be without you
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Just for me, oh yeah x
Just say the words, and we'll beat the birds
That's the way it goes
Keep your head above the meaning 
Dark canyon road, I was coy in the halfmoon
Out there amongst the waves and inside your lover's head
'Cause I've got nothing real, just empty space to fill
Hey, it's the right feeling
All our thoughts were coming in so clear beyond the myopic mirror
I know it seems like the same old guy
And get down on my knees
Oohwoowee, wild night is calling
I was lying on the grass of Sunday morning of last week
And our love's a lie
And I'll play the games that you want me to play
And is the base sweet pull shapes,
Shout out to the dreams you'll chase
Because your baby is so far away
Three in the morning saying
Because nobody's told her 'bout you
I've tried, but I don't know why
Let me feel you upside down, slide in, slide out
I'll be yours and you'll be mine
Man it's you to seen us this way we runaway with you x
I'm so in love with you, I'll be forever blue
So many things ignored
And I'll send all my loving to you
Hey friends we'll jump the turnstiles
So I went back to where I belong
And I am  pages through this notebook now
You said I wasn't cheap
By morning watered down again
I'm gonna be the man who's working hard for you
Beautiful colors that came from you
But ooh, Mr DJ, baby, can you meet me outside
Now I'm too good at letting go
Remember the way she loved the chase
Let us sway into the sunset
Oh I gotta know
Have you ever been to heaven at night
I've been waiting
I know if I put my mind to it
And the rest be sent to hell
I wouldn't let you leave me 'cause it's true
And we'll all float on alright
I just want to fly
Tear up the stairs and tear up the floors
Courageous boy, now you're a clown
I check my bed for bugs and spiders
Bodies in the sand
When electric hearts, electric hearts
And she loves him
I'm begging I'm begging I'm begging you please now
Well would you save all of your bottles if I promised a refund
But I love you anyway
No familiar scars
I'm just tryin' to chill with Miley at the hookah bar
You know, you know you know my name
As I picked up my matches and was closing the door
Say you're mine
Around
Every limb is empty, robbed of pleasant memories
That soak up all the sound
I need you more now than ever
Better off without you
You keep on saying the past is not even past you keep saying
Flicking through the TV
You're kissing your reflection
It's a long way now through the deadroads in our hometown
Didn't I tell you everything is possible in this déjà vu
Where I'll shut my eyes and where you should lie 
The time we waste
We been so long waiting
From movin' on with an Oregon girl
Of your mouth and mind
Big hits, big hats, yeah give me the ball 
The world record player's on a tour of Japan
He left a card, a bar of soap and a scrubbing brush next to a note
Enough to wrap tight in ricepaper string"
Burn down the street
Shake it, shshake it, shake it Okay
There is no other voice
You don't even know what side
Rome, Rome, many tears have fallen
Hell no no, whoa no, I won't let them take you, won't let them take you
When I was down
I know Professor Blumen makes you feel like a woman 
Ruby, we used to love you truly
That everything is on its way 
What have I been waiting for,
Take a shit where you sleep
I spread those maps out on my bedroom floor
The sun is up, I'm so fizzy I could burst
We get high in back seats of cars
You know my girl get the keys with the em's on it
Cold wind whipping through the windows
Through smeared mascara, I looked into your eyes and saw a light
I had a funny dream and you were wearing funny shoes
I just want to conversate with you but you keep on talking to your phone
Everything we've been through lately
Chinese food makes me sick
You know, you know me you know my name
Come on, baby, let's get away ooh
Her brothers her brother
And the wind catches your feet
Jackknife in your sweaty hands
But seconds coming back
But gold is just a trick of light
And fill you with songs of love
The sky is way bigger than I ever thought it could be
This night will never end
Am I awake or is this just a dream
The arguments and fights and money troubles seem so worthless
Says he's got a fast boat, talk about high speed
Shut up and dance with me
And ask you what you think because your thoughts and words are powerful
If you know it sing out
Big boy, come on around Big girl, you are beautiful
Don't close your eyes 'cause your future's ready to shine
He ain't never had shit, but he had that nine
Why do they gotta front
You know, I know that
I don't feel like I'm falling falling falling down
Here comes Mary
If you could watch everybody work while you just lay on your back 
A wish could be a bad thing,
But now you got to humor, all these fools
It's days and months before I see you again
Won't you come strap yourself to my side
You know how much this means
By the way she looked, I should've calmed down
I'm as nervous as you 'bout making it right
She lies on the border,
But it's alright
And in times before that, well, I was crazy
I'm weird 'cause I hate goodbyes
And though some days still take forever I can't disagree
I won't let my life go to waste
And we've felt how our hearts melt down
And if you try to hold on
But as it is I'll dream of her tonight
And with this gift I compose words
I remember way back, I mean, way back, ages
Just go ahead, let your hair down
Nothing is forever
For the loneliness you foster I suggest Paul Auster
In this city
Touch the fingers of my hand and tell me if it's me
So much style that it's wasting
One summer night's the only time we've known
Still your hands
The sweetly sleeping sweeping of the Seine
So don't stop me now
How do I get myself back to the place where you said
I will pretend to leave this world behind
Not much good to talk here ought to walk it
The beat The beat
Down your tools for a holiday
Tomorrow at breakfast you may prick up your ears
I think I see the future
You talk about life, you talk about death
And run in little circles till circles are
And you don't remember who you're talking to
I know it's dumb to say
Do you still recall it
Let's cut to it, my girl for lunch
Clouds are shrouding us in moments unforgettable 
C'mon get up and just follow the tempo
Along a path of river stone
So, always look on the bright side of death
What a glorious feeling
Every moment was so precious
Show some mercy today
If you wanna be comn' and makn' sweet love to me
Leaving his lover and his family behind
I stayed in last night
Baby, I don't need dollar bills to have fun tonight
I got stung
Not music I'm told to like
I'm gonna be the one who makes you stop and realise
Enough love to fill your empty heart
I duck these gold faces, post up feefifofum basis
Deep into the sea
We know, it's all about the way it comes out
I love you
Hello, little girl
Just today
Maestro, what are you doing
Hear voices I don't want to understand
Es ist egal, was du bist
And if I lived in Iceland, I'd still have Chinese children
Remind me the things last night I should have left unsaid
Can you help me hurl me the game, Oh Starlight Has what you need
Who came up through a steely sea
In all of the action will tumble away with the years
And we're thankful they're lending a hand
I don't know where to begin
Like remember when
She likes you Wednesday, but now it's Friday
It's time that we got this flaunting down
They'll break me
I am sick and I am tried of hearing
Free, yeah
I know, yeah we are still learning
I know it ain't right
And you know I'm fine
Anything to keep you away
The six o'clock alarm would never ring
I'm laughing at the sun
Promises and nothing else done
With another young man
Twenty grand, know it's a sin, but before me you show
The fear inside the hills we've climbed
But everything seemed different
I met her on the subway, she gave me that VIP card
They lose their ballads and their lipped mouths in the night
With a calculator and a ruler, baby
Don't stop me now I'm having a good time
Good Time, Good Time Don't stop me, don't stop me
That I've got so much 
And this I know for sure Uh
Cherry cokes under this moonlit summer sky
They said, do you remember where you saw her last
Of the life that's teeming in the dirt
All day and everyday 
I'm so aware of everything, but nothing seems for real
For tha money, you can get it too, it's all about yo ambition
'Cause the songbirds don't do singing on pavements
When I sail back home to you
Just boogie woogie with me
Now he got even with the photographers who
Tttttthings are never gonna be the way you want
A goodnight's rest on the floor,
I like where we are 
I go walking in my sleep
If you gotta run, run from hope
Of the tears from the years that we loved and we messed up
Just give me one more day one more day
I've got, so many secrets to show
We sure talked a lot 
Please tell my mother I'm down on my knees
But you don't know, you don't know
I had a drink the other day
The sun will shine till eternity
Her tiara digging deep in her head
You knew that I adored ya
Don't need anything
And no matter where you go
Everybody wanna dance now
I want to run and hide
Some crappy artwork that took too way way long to draw,
Bruno Mars
You got to weigh what you say to help you shape the way you play
But when she turns her back on the boy 
I keep writing songs that are all my own
And we can watch the sun
You say I don't want to pray no
When the summer's gone
You got everybody putting on a show 
Happy unites and feelings take flight
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off
Whatever gets you to the light, it's alright, it's alright
If you let a frown become your normality, yes
But I was right and you were wrong
It's setting the stars all on fire
As long as you're in front of me then I'll,
All you have to do is touch my hand
Woke up this morning
But believe it or not, you won't find it so hot
When I was seventeen, I followed my dream
Let's skim the back with a song with love
Taking time for the things you love
My trembling bed
Man I swear she's come here to fill us with power
Then that's just something that makes me more attracted to you You
And if I fall asleep
I wanna know where it's coming from
If you fall down
And I pull myself together
My great granddaddy fought in Gallipoli
So tired of living
You fall in love, zing, boom
Keeps the melodies inside me
Cause the filth took away my license
To groom my face in life and doom
Denoted by a scene unfair
Rebuild the void with flowers
To light up the room
Everybody in here has got it goin' on and I can't compete with that
For someone just like you
My friend
Tried to put mind over matter
And the sea's all right
And Jimmy Pop ain't no heiny hobbit gaybe
squint your eyes and no one dies or goes to jail
The tears this side of heaven
But the words wouldn't wait
When I was so thirsty
And we've all got something to say
Shut up and dance"
And if you like them, yeah
From what I heard with skin you'll win
Ease my mind And you say you belong to me, and ease my mind
We are old in your teenaged tyranny
Should I stay or should I go
Here is one we shout
I hear the music hold me tight now baby
Know my own electricity
Is still
I wanna get a flat I know I can afford it
Foundations ripped apart
Living in a dream
I know it's done for me
And I crash my car 'cause I wanna get carried away
Oh, baby, right or wrong
Unlock my body and move myself to dance
I know that you want to
Monday cycling
Not to accept eternal life
All my life I've been fall fall falling apart,
The friends that I have and the shoes we're not shining
Back mask, spinning wax, the record had a heart attack
Wide eyed, panic on the getaway
Wyclef extended his hand to me
The lights and sounds,
What I'm giving you is taking
Stand in the place where you live
But got it just don't get it
Up in my air balloon, air balloon, air balloon ha
You must get lonely No
Ba duba dop ba do, oh yeah
Ain't got the perfect smile, don't turn heads on my street
Joey never met a bike that he didn't wanna ride
The open summer breeze will sweep you through the hills
I sail above your inlets and interstates
Now I've looked in the mirror and the world's getting clearer
I won't give the chance to be my enemy
Baby let's get closer tonight
And that's where I'll stay
I always make mistakes at my expense
You might say
Just waiting for the perfect hideout
Life's your life
en un carro Yolanda
If you brought a big brown bag of them home
I have five clocks in my life
I'm down down down on the ground
Lady on the water with your jacket blue and strange
And it's mostly pretty nice, yeah it's mostly pretty alright
She's all I want and I've waited for so long
On a therapist's couch, with his face to the ground after fucking around countless nights
All these dreams inside of me
Then again I couldn't have 'cause
Ooh I feel like I'm gonna sweat
And I'll be waiting anxiously 
To have something above you
MIT Virtual Reality Equipment To Self
Breaking open skies of green earths
Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet fires in the street
I don't ever ever wanna be alone, oh Saint Jerome
Found a life worth living for someone else
Whenever you call
But soon they released me 'cause the cops were sad
Misfits, twilight zone
I love your iridescent sheen
You are a star I mean a starlet,
Move your feet
Everybody looking at you crazy Crazy
In a crazy, mixedup world
Oohoohoohooh
If it makes you feel good
I got my own kind of company
Playing cards, we all get to act sly
We're on a bender when it's  degrees
Some big thunder law forces me to eat shit
These trying times without losing our minds
And I only wish you someone who can do what I can't
So wait for me this time
Killing man
And I scramble down the stairwell with my baby, cradle and all
The love that's shining all around here
Let me put you in the magic position, darling
Spend your days asking why
When we drive in your car
What is happening, happening, happening and no feelings
Of his run down eighties car
You're the getaway car
You're my first want on the worst nights
I find it funny that you never even knew
Still waiting for someone at the station
Revolution has come
And I'll be dancing with myself
You know everybody wants one
'Cause I think you're too outta sight
I won't go sinking this houseboat, it's so hard to believe
All in the after hours of some Greenpoint bar, 
How nothing in the world seems to be
When something's wrong,
As I step into the night
I can feel a change in everything
An underground design
What goes on inside
För bredvid ditt namn står ett namn till
To do the things that will break his heart
Everybody's life rolls by
Tonight's the kind of night
Maybe I'll paint them in myself
Cigarette daydream
All summer
And you'll be saying, how did I get here
You see the way I am
Joan was quizzical, 
Each night I ask the stars up above 
Walked to your house on my lunch break, here it comes
You make my dreams
Have you heard the word is love 
Custommade for a daydreamin' boy
Oh it hurts to look in your eyes
Something glorious is about to happen
Let's get them dollars, Let's get this money
We'll have bizarre celebrations I'll play the Satyr in Cyprus, you the bride being stripped bare
I know you'll relive every moment
Away from everyone
And I wonder what the boy was thinking
We would sing and dance around
You might feel the pain
Who can't decide which book to read unless the paper sows the seed
Yo, bitch
Is all a tremulous heart requires
Ripping through my wicked world
Just that things got so complicateeh
From the people you despise
It takes two floors to make a story
But the world was wrong and I was forced to march in line
Gonna knock you off your feet
I remember, I remember the days
Oh yeah, oh yeah, what's that ya see
The way we might on movie night
And I spoke up with my new hands
Hello, goodbye, hello, goodbye
Flying across the country
And I had to get away from this here masquerade
Tried it out it's like nothing you ever seen
Wake up, I don't feel it
You can call me Al
In the summertime girls got it goin' on
Yes, you can build yourself around
I'll just unplug it for today
Time has gotten by on alibis and wine
Shouldn't need anyone
Melt me with your eyes
Get on your feet now baby dance
Look over my sandcastle, and there's a sight to see
So we're making a lot of noise
I kissed you on the face
It takes us back to a time when we didn't care, we didn't care
Just today
It's a risk, yeah
I'm touchin' folk, any time they try and Grand Hustle folk, I'm bustin' folk
Well you could get back down,
Can you put the bite back into the beast you've broke, and tied and tamed
Oh, baby, yes, it's true
And I've never went back trying to replace
You cannot move, so let me in
You can feel but you won't sing
Hey what's the matter
If our ever after ever had a chance to grow
The best day of my life
And the grease in the hair
Lit up the world as I fell asleep
Feeling kinda lonely
For once I can touch
And you say you belong to me, and ease my mind
Will it ever stop
Sometimes they make me sorry
This whole damn world
If you're single, but looking out
He's got the sun on his back
The clock up on the wall was tickin'
Somebody's fame and fortune
You can see she's a beautiful girl
Find yourself watching MASH
Of militant families
Grace in each face that is making the wastedest, brokenest ones fairly fly
I cannot fall in love
She don't love
Hey man, now I'm really living
We gonna chase the demons out of town
You let me down lightly, 
I've got a cupboard with cans of food
And the last one tore a picture
But nothing I could say could make you look up
Let the lovin', let the lovin' come back to me
You be a fighter of fires
You're a falling star
Not one seat belt on
My heart's not made for someone else
He taught me how to watch and fight and pray
Something in your eyes
Some hesitation to this life I give
If you snap it like a twig, glue it back with little sticks
Sing with me, sing with me, sing with me
And fall onto the floor
Give away a few Mercedes like, "Here lady, have this"
But I'm staring at you now 
The way my soul gets lost in you
Going to bed wondering if winter come early this year
Should quit their waiting on the divine
There is something I've been dying to do,
I suppose that's the way the cookie crumbles
It's hard to breathe
Let's do it together
If you were here we'd laugh about their vacant stares
I'm sleeping to dream about you 
It's quite romantic, I know, that's how I wanna feel today
Those who say the past is not dead
Dressed to the nines, with hair to match Shiny jewels, casino cash
With a ticktock rhythm, a bump for the drop
You're such a such a such a strange girl
Cherry Pez, Cold Crush, rock star Boogie
Give it to me bay don't you dare lose it
Of money
I go up to my room and there's girls on the ceiling
Just another ride and you
To buy the things it takes
When the only boy you know is your dad
I got everything they don't
Let the love tear us apart
I think I see you coming to town, dragging you down
Anyone you've loved once
Oh yeah, ayou make amy dreams come true
Oohdo your thing
Now I know, and I won't do that again
He and his oldest boy Blair
I've just seen a face
Here we are again
Packaged for sale
I felt like there was something missing in my daytoday life
I've got time for a chat
Melted away like I was free
The type of women make you never forget
And who makes me feel like smiling when the weary day is through
So close you can almost taste it
When the world was young
Too heavy we'll all float on alright
People are gonna ask, "Is it brilliant or plain"
Oh I will surround you
While my father was slaving, my mother explained it
You're the tops
Where the dreamers go, ohohohohoh
What could come when we realize
It's JuniorSenior time to show us you care, hey
But that ain't good enough for you
You make me wanna measure stars
The biggest fear running through my head
And we'd start the race behind
Everything you touch turns right
I wake up in a room and realize I'm insane again
I will be alright, I will be your light 
I'm feelin' like Bob Vila nailin' up your behind
It's a bright June afternoon, let's play in the park
'Cause we know that every night's gonna end some day
Come downdowndown, my love is calling
It's built on, built on words
We wait for the bell and we dream of somewhere else
And abstract from our lives
The first thing I remember when you came into my life
OK, bring it down, yeah, we gonna break out
We All have teeth that can bite underneath
Every time I fell on you yeah every time I fell
I've got a mild fascination for collectors
Give me a cigarette
Who am I without all your affection
So I keep calling at night Keep calling at night
And the lips that leak seem to know you best
Half dead and half numb
Lucky we're in love in every way
Tell me that you need me
I'm gonna keep well my vegetables
I saw that boy, standing there with a deal, and he said
And when I woke up on your kitchen floor
Streets filled with people
And all our friends are gone
Heal the song, sing along
In the morning all I could do was sing
Baggy jeans and a tight top, lemonade and Pernod
And I carried it in my head
Of staying out sleeping in and getting drunk with my friends
Lookin' great
It makes me slappy
Bounce bounce, baby, bounce back to me
There must be many ways to ask her to my room
Through the desert of truth
Where the animals sleep hidden in the gloom
We're changing in the light
A different city every night
Love to watch the colors fade
Had to let the world, let it bleed me dry
Well I met an old man dying on a train
I fall out of love with you
The ferry hatches Moline
And it comes as no surprise to me
Shake it, shake it
Keep dancin around to the joyful sound that the band plays
Ain't got no cash, ain't got no style
Got a lot of things to do 
They walk fast
But I feel much better
And allow myself with time
Let's just keep pretending to be friends, oho
Smudged funnies in a broken bottle
See me, sell  right with  creep
I'd buy bottles untold of the nectar of the vines
When I have myself a drink
You know I need my shepherd here tonight
Dansa till din rhythm Dansarens drottning blir ej besviken
Now once, I was downhearted
All my troubles, went away
God damn you shrubbery
I just ran into a few someone's today
Óró mo churaichín ó Those hungry lions with all their might and all their thirst
I'd do anything for you
I've got these feelings
Would you lock the door
Is It's too way , too real to believe be here or be
The girl next door who's famous for showing her chest
The Possum's spinning our hips
Watch it go and let the damage run
Back on my feet
CCovering only
She was too pat to open and too cool to bluff
I don't wanna be the reason,
C'en est assez de ces dédoublements
Your hair down to your legs and your legs down to the floor
No strings attached
Instrumental
Drowning, everything is drowning
If I pretend that nothin' ever went wrong
Now, it's a peaceful oasis
Hey I told you I'm an OG, never had cold feet
What you need it for
I will, I will 'cause I will, I will
Into the waves I stared
Oh yeah it burns
I hate lesbian feminists 'cause they're all so damn ugly
He met a girlie who was brave enough to say
And when I wake up in the mornin', I got's to hit a lick
And half a soul to go
You are broke all summer
I got da da da inside my head
And all of these spirit voices rule the night
But I can feel you crying,
My head is spinning all around
But feeling somehow inside opalescent
How I know your face
But all I wanna do is get off
People are people regardless of gender
Life in this town makes it hard to see
Don't it mean a thing
And this town is still making me sick, whoa oh
I stood stranded in the water
I know it's seasonal
See how the sun shines brightly
I get by
I was just going with the uh
'Cause our lips can touch
Trying to throw this away
It's pinned against her bedroom door for all the world to see and she says
Several times I have heard your demand
Sing rainwater, sea water
Boy, when you're with me
Strained to keep the shyness in
We're heading down to Half Moon Bay
And one time playing football I pulled the tendons in my leg
Careful, you'll hurt yourself 
When out of that orange colored view
Sometimes I'm naked and thank god sometimes you're naked, well, hello
I don't know if we're ready to take our train
And when you're tired and think the moon
Floating and fighting, like a kite on a string
Over numbers, unencumbered numbered words
Your mouth, it moves but fails to speak
The corner cafe
You'll be mine to hold each day
A little bit of gravity
There's times I ask myself why
Une brume et d'embrun
Be careful you might kill him
Oh no, my friends
Oh, I love you, all I love
Ooh, Tonight the stars are so bright
No where else to eat but your floor
My, my heart like a kick drum
They paint the grasses green
Don't get sucked in for a second
Oh, have you been patient
Friction sparks from metal made it look like bleeding
You're hurting my eyes
And ask her out because she'll most likely agree
If I get drunk, well, I know I'm gonna be
Landlord's knocking at my door 
Snapped me till it hurt
Is written in books from long ago
Here comes a feeling you thought you'd forgotten
Will you wait until tomorrow Will you wait until
To change you baby
The music's too loud and the noise from the crowd 
What we make of those people we love
But when the ads come
I'm getting rid of my phone, and I made it clear
I thought love was only true in fairy tales
When I say that something
I'm steppin' around in the desert of joy
There's no one else around 
Look all around, there's nothing but blue skies
We could have wild, wild parties in that big old lodge
Hear it in your rhythm
When all fires are fanned, when we're shucking our plans, when we're too weak to stand on our two feet
I think inside you would find something sweet
And every breath is a bomb
'Cause we can't hear a thing
I wonder if I'll get to say Wonder if I'll get to say
That do play my favourite songs
I got you
Can fall apart
Pack up and leave all our things behind
One moment I was tearing off your blouse,
I'm waiting for you to get out of your situation 
While it's still free
Is a cross that you bear when it's cold
Strange light shimmering over the sea tonight
Just lookin' and playing guitar
I know exactly what I'm doing
I'm happy
I won't let nobody sting me but you
Someday I will treat you fine 
I play centerfield for the home team
Surely there's some walls out there that you can go and spray
Summer in the city, and winters in Miami
Well I was young and I could not see
It's not a slow dance
Well, anyway, it's looking like a beautiful day
So sing while you still can
Make me real life hurricane
Ooh from head to my toes
Attack those around 'cause you're
The velvet, it rips in the city
On this night we breathe air
Beatin' my drum
Better get yourself together, darling
I'm on sunshine, baby, oh
It seems to me that it's spiralling outta control and it's inevitable
You've got your mother's cheekbones and your father's crooked smile
If he knew what I knew
If you hear us say "come USA"
Then the conversation stopped, and I looked down at my feet
Different trips, different trains
Black stone beach and a black death bottle
"You'd think the world was ending
Well I'm on the couch when you come back home
Dance dance dance right there on the spot
And we don't care about the old folks
Something gains its place now
Ain't got the x factor, I'm not what they expect
Wewewewegotta kick that gangster shit
If we dissolve without a trace
Like the cormorant in evening
And wrap yourself around me
I really got a good excuse
Love today
But she only cares when she so inclined 
And I know it's gonna be
I give smile a give a song
Should we take the chance
Your mama and your papa
The dog days are done
Just give me one more chance one more chance
I'd never, ever, let her get away
I got a degree
Why would you wanna break, would you wanna break a
But you don't stop, you keep climbing
He can't be bothered 'cause he's high on THC
Just by self tonight, all by myself
You'll never know I'm after you
I'll love a girl someday 
And I gave attention to the TV that was bleeding
Sun coming to shine on the occasion
So lay your head on me
I'm gonna soak up the sun
Who knew Mind you I never had to stand in line
I had to believe it cause that would
'Cause then she might be happy, and no longer lonely
They lock the devil in the basement, threw God up into the air
You give me ten thousand nights of thunder
I thought I was going to be sick 
Screaming "Big girls, you are beautiful"
Only your love makes house a home
I kissed you goodbye at the airport
Landslide, rocks are falling
Until that solid gold is in your hand
Shot for the money on the very same day
You don't know 'cause it just passes right through you
You never walk alone
'Cause my eyelashes catch my sweat
Looking like the winter bird
I know that it's always something 
Our rulers and idols get greedier and seedier
Hard working sound and vision
But you don't know
We'll find a way
Round the bend, all together now
So step on up to the plate get a date with Mraz
Feel what I feel today
Was there a second of time I looked around
Where all of my flowers grow
If I wanna fly I could fly for freedom Hey
You can't see my eyes
That we'd share after the stretch
My love is always on the grind
Four of fish and finger pies in summer
We hang around dans ton quartier
That the sky is such a sweet blue,
And I gave water to all I thought were thirsty
Stick and stones won't take his course
Ooh If this is what we've got
You remind me of a few of my famous friends
'Cause I don't wanna walk on my own anymore
I've gotta find out all the things
It's the way that's the best
I've got my own secrets though, say what
Mixed in with light, these are my favorites to dream in the night
My sisters and my brothers there for one another
The fire's burning, softly singing songs
Yes you are bugging me,
Singing songs of love to pass the time
That's hardly time to take a shower
Oh someday
I know it's up for me
We didn't know better
And have walked bitter streets alone
As our lights look down the road
Nothing to say but "What a day, how's your boy been"
"But it's not the same," you say
Know little girl that Denver Max will always be the only one
Onwards past never and still faster x
Now we're thinking of where we're gonna eat
But if you make an ugly woman your wife
If there's a letter, a letter for mee
Hey, if I smile with my teeth
Bottles poppin' till we can't stand
You'd think the world was ending
That I still won that rush
Couldn't cop to what I did
I feel the aura and I feel the atmosphere
C'mon do it again
I was walkin' along
Don't let go; I feel the music in you
Lets put on moonlight mile
When I fold the cold in my jetlag palm
When it comes to other men
'Cause wood grain makes all man made things seem so out of date
And this is my brain
Crossed his eyes
Yeah, you gave me wings and I used them
How in the world you gonna see
Girls hit your hallelujah woo
If you're seeking repair, 
Take me wanderin' through these streets
I know what I should get
So let's just sip it real slow
And you saw it in my eyes
That I can't get out; I can't figure out how
Slammed your fingers in the drawer
Listen to your voice
All sung by many other fellows
'Cause the reasons for your tears aren't worth crying
The lottery's got a rollover
Lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles
You get me through, ah
On the radio
Just taking it easy
And as far as I can tell there's nothing underneath your vneck tee
There'll be love love love wherever you go
And all the competition's overcome what may
No curses, writing bout our girlfriends
Your kisses make me blue
Kiss my petals and weave me through a dream
Hope for the best, plan for the worst and maybe wind up somewhere
Oh how does it feel to be you right now, dear
That says if you've got the money then I'm yours tonight
The deal between the legs of mankind
Then I met a man with a fist for a hand
Trying to get the girl all the bad guys want
And I just can't, can't get over you
Take off your skinny jeans
"We got a young brother that stands for something We got a young brother that believes in the all of us Brother Kendrick Lamar He's not a rapper, he's a writer, he's an author And if you read between the lines, we'll learn how to love one another But you can't do thatright onI said, you can't do that without loving yourself first "
Our Treblinka is alive with the glory of love
Now I'm falling down
You can sleep on the floor, 
The words you long to hear
Anything that say anymore
I wondered how fast is light speed
With the girls around
Out the blue or out of sight, it's alright, it's alright
Of all the blackouts I've caused you and me
You fell down the stairs into my arms
A movement with no leaders
You'll know, you'll know just what to do
I was up against the wall on the west mezzanine
Pretty soon you'll be an old bastard too
Reach for the bright side
She says, "I've got two tickets to Iron Maiden, baby
I hear you got some new clothes
Scatter my ashes on this place
All I know is the world looks beautiful, the world looks so damn beautiful
The aria is bleeding and the boyish voice is leaving
I'll never, ever, ever, ever, ever gonna let you go
A kicking in the nightshifts
We are here to take the blame
Late nights all alone with a test tube 
See the sky in front of you
How come we're so messed up
It's a difficulty and I'm bitin' on my tongue
You feel lonesome don't you
Honestly, everybody's stoked, I'm finally free
I love her
For this land is not yours or mine to have
Wearing an olive drab
Oh yeah, I hate you too
Two fools in love
But I've got a conscience too
Hey show some love,
Measure me in metered lines and one decisive stare
Oh no this is rising to the clouds
The morning sun here, you will see It's my oldest memory
Silver hours, silver hours
In a momentary lapse of emotion
Not a matter of choice, just a matter of time
Tonight, tonight there's a party on the rooftop, top of the world
And come morning
Gonna change his ways
I left my bag in Pasadena 
We get along Lord, but not today
There is no other one who can take your place
Well everybody twist
Sweet love, secret love
I replay in the back of my mind
Sweet damage
There are those who understand
 years asleep before we sleep forever
Cross the ocean way
I feel it all in the center of my heart
Don't wanna know
If I could do it again I'd climb more trees
Now I'm in need of some protection
We're breaking all the rules
You won't hand me the chair
It's a place that we call home
A song to you on the radio
Until I felt his breath at my neck
Of the leafless trees
I gotta go, gotta go,
Here we are on a perfect night
Prostitute fingers
I will learn to love
Suspend disbelief
And not the sadder times
Kids today are getting old too fast
Well hey, how's tricks man
One good day of the week
I wish she let me be 
calcium mines are buried deep in your chest 
Shed me from the universe, carry me from lies
Time for me to look at you
Celebrity parties, the red carpet mile
He said oh yes you can, just hold my hand, I think that that would help
Well, she should've went to school
The city's nitty gritty but it's so much fun
The drunk horn's so violent, all spinning out sounds
That's how you know that your best friend's all strung out
Oh, falling, yes, I am falling
The covers pulled up over your head
You've come to save my life again
We weren't particularly cool
I would've shot you down
Don't waste your time
'Cause I have lost my mouth organ
Óró mo churaichín ó I dragged you back a sleepyhead
But fine lines I don't see
What you get is exactly what you give
It ain't hard for me and dear JoJo to see
We're gonna be alright ooh, baby Ooh, ooh Ah, yeah ah yeah
I got the money but I need it for my dealer today"
And the moon is so full
You'll be there remembering your old toy boy
But I was far away
But now I live at the eye of the storm
What's a matter babe, are you feelin' blue Oh
Tropical island somewhere sunny every day
You've done everything to please
Saint Jerome, I don't ever ever wanna be alone
And the good one's were all wrong  
Where freedom makes the world go round
I know they'd never match my sweet imagination
Du blir de du blir vad du gor dig till
But I killed for love
With these tones misunderstood
Towel under the door, we smoke until the day's end
You see this woman woke me up at a quarter to three
I'm just working with what I've been given 
We'll always be this free
No one will ever miss you, so you know that you'll not be missed
You come and hold my hand, baby
Push my back against the wall
This man, makin' money,
But I know that you are mine to keep
Let's hit the limit of loss over lover's arms
There is a hole and I tried to fill it up with money
But feeling this way he's just playing a part
And all those doubts have drifted out of view
My heart is bbbbeating double time, yeah
The warm, red Sun gives up and sinks into the trees
They conspire trying to keep us apart
And surprised by the rain
But he couldn't understand why no one would go
I'm ringing all the warning bells
Vegas, New York, and DC, they all ride wit' a G
All the things that I relate to well,
'Cause what you've got is
Don't hide yourself inside till I'm old
But the quarry don't share his taste for Anne McCaffrey
But it's okay now
Rambling rose Mushaboom, mushaboom
I'll believe when the walls stop turning
Won't you tell me something good
Illinois in it ran from the Ronald Reagan Tollway
Sending me back down on memory lane
the timing andthe moment
Seen your eyes
It's so magical feeling, that no one's got a hold
Anywhere you are is where I want to be
Je voudrais être un monstre marin
Got brown skin, I'm a West Londoner,
This a number one champion sound
Chorus repeat until end
And you can't understand why all the other boys are going for the
It's a feel
When all you do is stay and play in your computer games
Pants have got to go
Whoa, brainstorm brainstorm
And if I ain't sellin' no records, I'm servin' them packs
Does it really matter
Is all I need, 
Got a taste so sweet I swear this beat
I've Got Baggage Too
Everybody lack confident, everybody lack confident
So the fortunate kids, yeah they left on their lights
Something that isn't so cruel
And wash all around you
I can shine my light on, too
And feel it for a minute
This is not the way
Understand that all I do
I remember us alone
Even though your skies are blue
And I can't make love in my grave
If I could be for just one little hour
I like the way you laugh when I tell a joke
Keep on lifting me your love keeps lifting me
'Cause I will be away from you,
And I wonder Louie  have you got room for me
She's got a choice
Your baby blues would flash and suddenly a spell was cast
Ride wit' me, nigga, let me show you where we kick it at
Don't you let me know
Young boy you done me bad, I went and did ya wrong 
To have a nice day
We'll make dreams come true
You act like there's nothing wrong, you laugh when I call on the phone
The only thing that I can do is hold it in, hold it in
Broke my heart to see
Out of the dark and into the light
'Cause I've been saving up for something we need, 
Won't you help me share my load
And you are infinitely invited
Another day in June, we'll pick  for football Pick  for football
Silly girl
Know you make me feel all right
Tuesday's fadin'
Good evening, and welcome to Slaggers, featuring Denis O'Bell
They dressed a like; his name was Ben
Like the summer sunshine pour you sweetness over me
Wearing the jacket I bought 
And lick your lips
Will I wait here on ya
Here's to all the pretty words
And could I bring it down
The girls are holding hands
From thinking all the time
The things we've written in it
Ne me quitte pas, mon cher
And how I wasn't there
I fall asleep with my friends around me
Just tryin' to get by
Ancient walls of whispers tumblin' down
Tied around her little finger
Is she outsidein
Every way, love's a little stronger
My discothèque Juliet, teenage dream
And there's a reason why I'm feelin' so high
Yeah, my name's on the wall but I'm happy
How can you laugh when you know I'm down
Now I've been hangin' around you for days
Disorder surrounds,
Trying to reach the things that I can't see
All the boys that she, that she had known before,
Covered with paint
Ballpoint pen, mines spinning like a whirlwind
I tell you friends, I adore her
Always travellin'
And do you ever wish to be unknown
So let's say, 
My legs are dangling off the edge
You're just a boy again
I could get used to this
Here comes the deputy head with the bark of a bulldog
And I can watch TV
She didn't care to hang around,
You've got heart, and you're going your own way
An ugly woman cooks meals on time
Well, I fell out of bed laced in spit and sweat
Her life revolves around all of the planets
Do you remember that"
There will be feasting and dancing in Jerusalem next year
Misty morning in the springtime
Then I met someone
Ping pong ping pong ping pong ping panana phone
I arrive through a window, I leave through a hole in the wall
'Cause the day you realize how amazing you are 
You got everything they don't, uh
But I can't find anything sweeter
I gotta have you, like abracadabra
Waste my days
You'll be with me next time I go outside
That we should build a city of tears
Fighting for her country's name
So far away from real
It's getting too hard to imagine 
And it's a lie that you've been given
Picture yourself when you're getting old
Over and over again you promise that it won't end
I think that this life is darker than the view
Chris Schwartz, RuffHouse, he was the best man
Baby won't you be mine
That was  now
So I just let go of what I know I don't know
You think you'll never get
'Cause I just wanna be your baby tonight
Do you know the game croquet
The stars were burning so bright 
If you've got someone who can't dress properly
And then I saw your face in the airplane window
And we know we're not along anymore
But you hit my heart with a harpoon
I left my homework in the launderette
Momma cat, Tommy cat, diapers on my clothes line
That's just the way that things turn out
You make amy dreams come true
Pay back the chicken back, back,
Remember back when we were young and still above
You're just like a flower, yeah, in the deep sunshine
You gave to me, all I know, I will stay here, I will not go
Put my old sadness to sleep on a shelf
Please say you'll never leave me
At the oberman
Don't stop me don't stop me
You break through them all
I'm standin' on top of the world, right where I wanna be
She got wonderful eyes and a risque mouth
Late nights and weekends our hearts only go so slowly on the local track
The song about the river
Of Desmond and Molly Jones ha ha ha ha
Or what happened in the end
Until the milk comes out, come on, coco girls
Moved out of the house so you moved next door
Highclass apartment
Uh huh I'm cutting your strings and keeping my smile
You know, you got me going now got me going
Walking on sunshine
Give it all you got
Remember you now you are gone
And say what you wanna say
To my motion fatigue, farewell
I need that engine's push
But that don't mean that we're not still family
You're all I think about, baby
And ain't nobody gonna tell us to go cause this is our show
I didn't know what to do
While you're getting restless
The boys say they want some gin and juice
I didn't think I'd find you
Oh I'm moved and I'm wigged
When they all catch up with you
Got love for the thug nigga's who get' it on tha ave
Of emptiness are moving to the sound
What a day for a daydreamin' boy
It's a street in a strange world
C'mon, can you count all the notches in your belt
With the collar up so you won't catch a cold
But they still stay the same
My dreams will match up with my pay
A little tyke, like to tease for fun Tease for fun
Keep like my daughter and a run away
And I think of you on cold winter mornings, darling
Two timing your state of mind, these feet got left behind 
The fields are throbbing fresh cut bruises
The phone is ringing when I get to my desk
Do you need it 
Ein kleines Rendezvous mit den Geistern
I need my baby, I need my baby
And when the light has let
My love is here to stay won't ever leave
And I never met a Toby that I didn't like
I know somewhere in some faraway galaxy
I am the only one just until you finish this year
Has come down,
You fell for me so I'll stay the same for you
Make these bitches wonder what he be in so much trouble for
She tells me all the time, you know
We end up together
Dairy Queens and Elevens
If I had to choose a moment in time
There's only one girl in the world for you
But I can only see it when you're here, here with me
I know you're beating my heart, you're beating my heart
Uptown funk you up hey
We don't need to drive
And to go back where I was would just be wrong
Don't care enough to write you a letter now that I'm doing better alone
And I get to kiss you baby
Make your wine of my worship of divinely strange refrain
Cause sad songs about now, well that would just feel wrong
Playing football with a can, Mr J lost his shoe
There's someone else in line
Skip to it, stretch to it, taking a twist
Just a little deuce coupe with a flat head mill
Could you be my love, my love ooh
Hey yeah
I don�t fall in love, I just fake it
I'll be yours, you'll be mine
Somebody's gotta care
She danced with me like I hoped she would
Turn up on your doorstep
We all get the slip sometimes every day
It's been this way for so long
Have you degraded or forgot us
And it called that calculation perfect love
Sleep tight, baby
I've got no one to blame
Óró mo churaichín ó They crowd your bedroom like some thoughts wearing thin
But she drifts so far away, I'm on her coast
Woo ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh~
Or give me the sensitive touch
And I can't beat the feeling
Eh, eh oh yeah, there's nothing else I can say
I was a doubter just like you
Instead as a way of getting us to move
But now it's here your happiness is real
We got supporters in this rock 'n' roll band
That I could leave this starcrossed world behind
These are the days we've been waiting for
This city's nitty gritty but it's so much fun
'Cause I've been waiting all my life
I'm going to die with a twinkle in my eye
And gone upon your quiet way
And the headiness howls
But I will forgive you, the yolk is in the middle
I'm looking up
All these reasons too hard to explain
And I will always love you, baby
To taking all your time
I'm in it to win it, sit back picture that
I know where to go but I don't know where to stand
Just don't ask for it back
I don't know where to go, can't do it alone
In the country
Break away this fear,
And I know, I know there is joy endowed"
He waves goodbye, to the town he grew up in
Are you gonna waste your time
Oh when he washed
You had to hide away for so long So long
Saturday morning and it's time to go 
Oceans rise and oceans fall
Yes I get by with a little help from my friends
Betty, I need you
Tudo o que quer me dar  Everything you want to give me
Then they can't aget awhat they want to steal
Let me watch night fall on the river
But say goodbye to you and meeee
Oh, I love
Little bit of love, little bit of love, little bit of love, little bit of love
I'm sad to see that you are sad
To all the people underground
To the rhythm of a steel drum band
And there's nothing you and I won't do
There's something on the line
One thing
Do you believe in magic
Stuck in my seat from the turbulence
Ring , ring , ring 
In my bed I watch TV
Cause your wrinkled eyes betray the joy with which you smile
In a prison yard at night
Home will always be here, unseen, outta sight
'Cause the girls playin' beer pong in the back
I'm getting it back with the rest of the leap year
I waited so long, there'll be no decency, no
It's just a sweet
And I just can't wait to be there
The colors
Under spell and the ghost of a man,
We always sleep with the dogs on the bed
I'd rather sit back,
And of course I can't forget all the beautiful colors on the day that we first met
Boy your love makes me feel like
Leaves you in the cold
Is there a letter in your bag for me
I don't get angry at the bills I have to pay
I'd like to wrap my arms around you like a flesh canopy
Far in the morning light
Now I'm walking on downtown in a town that is not my home
You didn't have to be so nice Be so nice
Cause love is the answer
We know we'll never solve
And love love love all over mine
There's no need for despair
Maybe one day you'll understand
But this was long before you and Jackie Geronimo
This will be a better year
Dance my way I gotta
And I, I keep stallin' and keepin' it together
From our hats to our feet
It's Lovely day, lovely day
Everybody on an old jet plane crossing their fingers and toes
I don't make the papers, I'm far from JLS
First line should it be about the hoes or the ice
But I'm gonna dance with three or four
Am I asleep or awake
I'm fine
Don't you know it's true what they say
Let the sun shine baby
And it did our thinking while we lived our lives
And pretty soon all my troubles will pass
Don't wanna know bout something that you don't understand,
Your heart is broken
Stacy's mom has got it going on
Sometimes I get my head in a dilly
And I know you're beating my heart, beating my heart
I wanna roll in the hay
We've got nowhere to run
He said "listen to me boys, this will be last one of these,
The one that is warmed by sunshine every day
I'm a fool, out of love
And the shapes of your hands do tell of such a rare variety
And I'll open my eyes and walk out the door Aaah
Leave a bad taste in your mouth like moldy liverwurst
While you hold on,
Be gentle with me
'Cause I talk of nothing but you girl
'Cause I've been too long a lonely man
The lair where I stuck my dirty beak
By moon
And my doctor she says that they're safe
We've been passing you around
Betray white water, delay dark forms
No need to fantasize Big girl, you are beautiful
Like the moons and the stars and the sun
It's morning
Good, good life
I feel better
Every sunshine hides a cancerous chime
And they're entwined between the night and sun beams
So if your business is running out
Slow down, you move too fast
And I feel better
Are gonna keep me from the cold
I was right
In spite of all the things I said, I always want you near
I think she reminds me of my mother,
Boy we're free, so what is fate to say
Oh, just one more chance
The first time staying out all night
And that's got to be the way it is
Even after all these years
You get me every time
But the right words don't come my way
I'm with Akinyele in the street, trying to get us a deal
She calls my name
Some day we're going to make it all right
It started with a low light
Oh, to fight is to defend
Hoy pensaste en mi y mi mente exploto 
I'm not sure who I've got in mind
Wonderin' Wonder why the girls don't look at me when I walk
It's gonna come I swear I swear I swear I swear that it is
Because of the things you told me, you told me
And they all go wild, but they walk instead
Boombox intones like a greek chorus
The bracelets and the beads
Tell me something, do you love him, does he love you too
So I can dream of you
They are just fossils now
'Cause he almost made off with a bunch of the drugs
The spattered colors of ecstatic fright
Where the shattered glass is lying always glittering
I miss the innocence I've known
I'll sit back and relax
Uh, and my band 'bout that money
I just want to sparkle for a moment
We'll wake up your mothers, we'll start a commotion
If you knew all the answers and could give it to the masses 
Heartbeat, and kisses so sweet,
Then bein' friends will do
Because you're just so rock 'n' roll"
'Cause last night he got a visit from the
'Cause my life has begun 
You growl, you howl, you show your teeth
But I've been waiting Waiting
And take off both your shoes"
When I'm feeling oriental I gotta rub my chin
A pretty girl is like a minstrel show
For ripzipping buttonpopping kiss and well
Let me take you away
I'll stop the world and melt with you I'll stop the world and melt with you
You ain't never gonna feel this way
Scary moment, lovin' every moment
I'm missing the moments as they pass
Tryna do the right thing 
I want to be like water
To live, to learn, to love in the major key
Saying, "Ho, have you ever said an honest word"
Hey, everything's right, said everything's right tonight
Just like the waves
Nigga come through flickin' and he had that shine
And if you start to warm, you could further break the ice
I pray that you'll be waiting right there for me
I used to think maybe you loved me, now, baby, I'm sure
And I'm going home,
I don't know how to find it
Society becomes jealousy
Hands they start to shake now
We've been talking on the phone for hours and hours
There's no such thing
Baddaboombaddabing, he the glorious king
We cut the legs off of our pants
Holding onto a package
Love the way you wear your curly hair
Found him on the couch one night cold and stiff
In the dark we are without her empress light
Tuesday, Wednesday, break my heart
Oh what a world we live in
Frightened cornered Gemini tactics and
In the back of my head
The moment that you stepped into the room you took my breath away
My cellular bananular phone
To win the war caused by pain pain
I can't change the world
In the twilight of these white nights
To Jupiter Ah, shit
Say the word I'm thinking of 
I am a vampire and I'm walking in the city
I keep my heart undone My heart undone
Hey, Madeline Hey, Madeline
You can close it off and turn it away
Back to school, ring the bell
All I know is work is easy when you don't stress out about deadlines
'Cause I've been here a million times before
Can't show me
I went there, I went there and I waited,
Yeah, the road gets harder
My hand moves away, you melt dry ice for days
We'll never feel bad anymore
Everybody gonna hit the ground
How many times our potential was anonymous
The sun is up, I'm so happy I could scream
Never mind I'll remember you this
Girl If you're wondering if I want you to I want you to
The fables and hands
But now I'm tired and I don't want to walk anymore
They say that song Spaceship gave my career a facelift
Some people cling to what they know
Looking for answers in the pouring rain
I said, "I'm gonna get that girl no matter what I do"
Sends him hurtling back to the mirror of all of his teenager thoughts and fears
When you thought you would break me
I used to go see on the landing in the summer
You do everything you can 'cause you're never gonna let it get 'em down
You've got no answers but you've got your concerns
Baby's got a praise like a lover, like a friend
Or down in London town to go, go
You crushed paper hearts
We got a whole big, fat world to see
Say it will always be like this
That you can't see air or time
And now my worries are gone
I'm beyond repair, let me be
Winter's cold is too much to handle
I'm just a little bit caught in the middle
I'm drunk by noon,
Or if your birthday fall between June and October
I never made you feel complete
Add up the sum of the slights and 
Inside they keep on
Well if I live for a million years
What you get is what you see
Whatever together
Simple lives we once left behind
They love ya like a one night stand
Baby you'd be saving mine
The motor in my head turns
All of the money that you owe"
You know who you are
I'm so tired of the way the world works
Taught me how to stand, dad
I'd like to give you everything that you deserve
We're gonna see the sunlight
They don't believe in lights, they don't believe it's a confusing situation
I think it should be funny, uhoh
Ooh, I'll be the one who'll break my heart
Was it all in my head
And faced with all the obvious she'll carry us
Just enough to mess my mind inside
You've got the wrong idea
"I've been hit, this is it, this is it, I've been hit"
'Cause I can't see through my tears anymore
Always sharp and cold, always beautiful
Australia's Narrabeen Inside, outside, USA
If I'd been out till quarter to three
Nothing more nothing less
And you say you belong to me
And I remember the time my balance was fine
There's nothing here to care about
It's only been a week
All my words unplanned
And they took it away from me
You roll the number and I'll buy the lumber
Do you feel lucky tonight Just go out in the night
Cause you don't talk to the water boy
Hamta minen din
Yeah, I need you to help and comb my hair 
 years off in this game, still nuttin changed, feel me feel me
But for me there's a devil and an angel's voice
I saw my friend when she's finished working
Those crazy fingers in your jelly jar
And saw you in the low light
Man, I feel like mold, it's prom night and I am lonely
So many days you passed me by
Still your mind
Just kickin' down the cobble stones
Aurélies Akzent ist ohne Frage sehr charmant
We let the movies play
Oh my, that's a big plan you've got there
'Cause I use mouthwash  Sometimes I floss;
Welcome in, welcome back, well come on let's go
Go catch her in the fast line
I've got no money, got no secrets
A drop top, flip flop, shine as the chrome glow
You took my heart and put it back together again
Run the lip off sunshine shore
And patience isn't worth the wait
You're the one for me, you make me so very happy
'Cause the future happened yesterday
Heart and mind, and soul in love
I been bummin' around this old town for way long
Hoping to take you away
And I was thinking just one night wont hurt
Or that city life is too frightening
Chances abound, we'd be standing our ground
Come into my world
Longer than the road
Get the feel
She's got Superman's smile
I'ma send this one out to the gentlemen's clubs
All our insides in, and that's when we'll explode
That's when you gave me a reason
I knew at least I might just have a chance
Hello we're back
And it's all about the days you spend
Someone get me out of here
That you wind up next to me
In the dark, for a while now
Go home and bury your love tonight
Traps will be sat by the people below
I'd hurt the ones I'd loved
That's why I love you so and that's why I can't be with you"
Oh, no I run while knowing
I gotta get someone to call my lover
Underneath your very eyes
I blame myself, feel my head explode from a night a gin
Waiting for the light to go
And forget our dreams
'Cause I've been having too much fun
Ooh, and just like the ocean Just like the ocean, baby lays right there behind me,
Is waiting to take you away
I've prepared a light show
I'm going to leave you like new 
They never knew, they never knew, what you're going through
She's good to me, oh, yeah x
Never stood on my own two feet
Your head is there to move you around, so stand
Please say she'll break,
Baby, I know you do that to all the girls  You know that I'm fragile
And I, I'm never letting you go, baby
Tempted fate and knowledge divine
To take your girl, and spend a bit of your cash for me
Take a look around, there's something happening
Wahwah Here come the sun
Like a lonely road, clear as day, alive
Who loved his daughter more than I love you
There's something underneath my bed
Things don't seem to go my way
Sleep, I sleep every day
And we can't hear what they say
Let the music smother me
Let's save our troubles for another day ooh Save it for another day
Systematically go and destroy,
Never wasn't was what it weren't
He feels lucky to have you here
No, none of it's true 'cause I never knew you
That tune
She was feeling yuletideburn
Brings out the best in me when you whistles
You know I loved you
You're giving eighty billion years of giggling
'Cause she'll never be mine
Oh, yes, wait a minute, Mr Postman
I like to keep them in a jar beside,
So what you gonna to do with all this stuff,
It's you who's got it all
Then I could, then I could, then I could show you how your money's spent
This is a black tie affair,
And awake in your mouth
I'm taking my time to make sure you stay
They don't say what they mean
It's just the way we feel Come on
And life makes love look hard
Nothing to fear, nothing to hide
We'll take a ride downtown
And I know it's hard when you're falling down
The rest of the summer was the best we ever had
With neon lights and nightopen bars
They say "Hear us out" in every town
I wanna talk to you
In the things that you threw
I know you're really in love with him, are you up to your knees
The angels in heaven look down where he lay
And I can swim, but I should fly
And their friends wanna talk music
Everybody's gonna love today
I couldn't care less about the dues you say I got
In a cap she looked much older
And I'll be kissing you
Life goes on the same, bury the pain
Falling, falling, falling, falling into the night
Yeah, love is an ocean of sweet emotion Sweet emotion
Yo respect it, the legacy'll never end
Don't play the game of time 
Covers and covers and covers in colours
Well, I'm on my way
I'm just winding you up, oh
Your head, come on, is dead and gone
Vaguely yes I seem to recall
Bang, bang, Maxwell's silver hammer
I put on my new black boots
Fill your heart with love today   
Without me at our home
I see my name in shining lights, yeah
The restless corpse is collapsing wind
Clap your hands Where's my milk and honey
You know that feeling you get
And I'm wastin' everyday
'Cause uptown funk gon' give it to you
We'd moved to the West Coast
Put on your dancing shoes
Don't hide the pleasures you've found in your rolling around
This ain't your home
I'd rather be cool than be loved
For the teenage boys
'Cause Lisa learned a lot from putting on a blindfold
Hey, I don't care if I'm wrong
If it's not over baby,
But I hear those voices at night sometimes
I'm on my feet, I'm on the floor, I'm good to go
But I can see them slipping through almost feel them slipping through
My problem with me is my problem with you
The letters on the pages that you memorize
Could it be anybody
Everyday Christmas, give Travie a wish list
And for a change he's not coming home
She tellin' the same old story to everyone that she knows
So out of date, that only you could understand
Some chimps are swinging from a vine
Throw those curtains wide  'Cause holy cow, I love your eyes
Talking 'bout the old style too
I must have turned bright red
I put my headphones on
Get it right
That's the way it is
And never know what could have been
So please
Justify your thesis certain that you need this
When love and understanding are the ultimate crimes
We might not sit in our rooms
Woke up cold one Tuesday
Babababass down low
All you want's one more Saturday
That we're nothing at all
Oh my sunshine
Feel the love and to your arms I fall
If you seek a pillow for your head
There's a gypsy's face make on my pillow
One day, left me for dead
Leaving town for sell to pal
Sweet love all night long
Take a good look; you're bound to see
Couldn't blame you 'cause I know I left you all alone
It comes back to you your gonna get what you deserve
C'mon and pick me up
You and I buy star maps and ding dong ditch a televangelist
The frightened babies poo
My neighbor digs the flavor, still he's moving to another town
By four we be high, thinking of the girl lost second
I believe the love you talk about with me
To the whole human race
"I sure do, you came jumping out after me"
Hear me shout
Turn around, go back and lose her pound for pound
I learnt my lesson
And you're the perfect thing to say
Wire up for the radio
We were walking up to strawberry swing
Instead of singalong, this song is monotone
We see the banker sitting waiting for a trim
I feel heaven in you, don't you know I feel heaven in you
Hey show some love
Baby, you're a hey rich man
Not going to mess around You are what you want
And through the dust the reels start turning
Said I don't think I know exactly what I'm doing
I can't wait until you fall asleep
Nothing you can do, but you can learn how to be you in time
Can you turn me off for just a second, please
Take a walk outside in the heavy weather
Last of the lost boys who've thrown in the towel
Is just a yellow lemontree
Let's go away, let's go away To stay, on a holiday, far away
It's sending the boys on the run in the time in the hot summer sun
Now it's my time of need
Feels so good to be
Imagine how the world could be
Oh, what a feeling come over me
I feel so guilty
With my boyfriend
Hey, hey you, yeah you gotta be leaving,
I am a child, it's too soon
I had this perfect dream
You look for leads, I follow clues 
Mon corps ne bouge plus quand j'entends ta voix
Swim to the biggest flower there
They ride in your suit
But out of my thumbs my little red baby runs
I almost had an accident, age 
What you need
Do you say goodbye
But you like it, so say "Thank you"
Baby, you're a rich man baby
All you need is love
Cause there is space
I won't live without it, I won't let it go
A punchbowl argument
Hey, all right now
Ooh ooh, I've been trapped by love
I need to believe
There was never a role for him
Granted, they never quite knew what they had
And the audience beside us
Better make up your mind, if you wanna get to the table on time
Now see how the colors blend
It's beating in my chest
Hold me in your arms I'm just a boy like you
For jetting round the world
Just say no more, use your eyes, the world goes and flutter by
Now play the record straight
'Cause love won't set you free
Sleep around if we like
Can we be happy
And a bottle full of lean and a model on a scheme, yup
I was born on the day the music died
Cut out their pictures and I chase that feeling
I'm gonna teach them all to work for liberty
What's that, boy
Let's go dance under the street lights
To make the room more natural
Confess the dreams
I said wow didi didi how those hips they shook
So we packed our things, made tracks,
Another place to face where I lace you at
Wind in the willow's playing "Tea for Two"
But girl I'm not your savior"
I miss yellow lines in my roads
Well when you hear the music and you can't sit still
Cynical when hurt was just me
Know with all of your heart you can't shame me 
Like the party going on in my house,
But it takes you years to know what love is
I plan to feed it with a heart
If I could make you my own, I have my days
At a weekend dance we like to show up last
Oh, what joy for every girl and boy
I reached out tried to love but I feel nothing
How are you today 
No, no, no, no, I never thought I did
I've barely been gone
I love you Amy
Well, if a leopard doesn't change it's spots
Type of girl to remain 
Tell me all about your day
Still in Love
Has got to give a mild holler to spend my dollars
And you will believe in love
When you needed an hour
Cause you got strange powers
Oh life, with your shoulders in the mirror
Fall falling falling again
Komm mit  Spartanern aus dem Leichenlager
Soon enough you will come down, come down
Somebody needs to know the time, glad that I'm here
Going backwards now
They say I'm all about the wordplay
The wrong pictures in the paper
There is only one thing x
My problems fell out of the back of my mind
Another day is done,
You know I won't touch my food unless they eat 
And you're a little bit right
You know me well enough to know that I'm not playing games
Illuminate the blackest nights
In body, in deep I saw you creeping
I been hanginaround this town on the corner
I don't want to hold her down
Sweetheart, bitterheart now I can't tell you apart
We didn't get wet, we didn't dare
Talking to the songbird yesterday
She wrote me a letter
Well, you got whatcha want and whatcha never knew
Say honey baby don't you know
And nothing but good times to share
Just purse your lips and whistle, that's the thing
This is a strange enough new play on words 
And the time to film a girl whilst you spitroast her
We could feel alive
you're deep in a mine, oooh
The whole world began to ring
High in the sky, the song that I'm singing
A cros comes down from the top left hand
It was for freedom
And that's the way to my heart
But I dream as I set to scrub all the floors, the walls
Baptized by the fire, I wade into the river
I shiver with the look you gave
And it hurts to see these companies be stealin' the life
Long blonde hair all over the place
I don't need no reason,
And everything you don't baby
The sky is blue, the trees are, too
In and out of love
I'll let you know
Boy you really got it goin' on
Fumbling 'round the back
If people try to put you down
Tell me 'cause I'd like to know
The turtle wished that it could fly 
Darling, go to sleep
The women and the men who dance when they're in love
Making love in the green grass
Baby, please don't let me go
Here, the future is ever so near
But I'll return to you
In peace
I wanna Kung Fu kick you in your Fourwheel drive
If I jumped from the top of the parachute"
C'mon can you count all the loves that didn�t last
It's a jungle gym
Sitting on a sofa with a sister or two
So far away from here
And a map was found with an X on it
I don't want to know
And it's magic if the music is groovy
You should thank him for every breath you blow
That there ain't nothing at all
Should I cash this check and trade in what I thought I knew
It's one thing that I plan to learn to do
Now I look at love like being stabbed in the heart
Sun is out while I'm walkin' home,
The music drags
Why does it always seem like I've never won
I must learn to deal with this disease
If someone's got a heart of glass
Oh until the dawn it brings
What did you want to see
Don't worry, be happy, be happy now
Seeking stars in its other side
So I took a look outside
I need to laugh
See you better act fast because supplies they never last
And it's you and me in the summertime
Neon black dirt in the garden
They were talking in the strawberry swing
Can't play no highschool dance,
They fly away as caskets close
See all the colors in the sky
I'm hanging around
It didn't change the way I feel
Makes your nighttimes warm and out of sight
You heard me on the radio about one year ago
And you wonder when you wake up will it be all right
We break into mobile homes
Though you've gone away this morning, you'll be back again tonight
She is the kind of a girl
Got me goin' around
The city looked wonderful that way
Waves in theta slipping into dreams
I sing my song and I'm a rocker
Well, there's a road with a distant glow
It makes you feel happy like an oldtime movie
Step right this way
I had a dream we were holding on and tomorrow has become today, become today
And carve the earth without my tools
But now's your chance to shine
I got me so down, I got me a headache
So where did you go Where did you go
Everything that happened
That's the place we always went
Were we just making time
Why would I mind
And I will find her in skies 
During my stressing I'm blinded to the lessons
Maybe you'll meet someone to know your life
He knows that he'll never come back
I don't know her name,
Is more than you'll say
We would hit the town on Friday night
And I'll make you shout
Meet you up at the Indian part of the town
'Cause baby you start
I know you've got a lot of good things happening up ahead
Ooh yeah, playing a new game
I can feel a storm brewing over nothing
Off the floor, where the other brothers leave it be
Please just stay over the weekend
So just listen to the reasons and the hints I've been giving
And falling from the seams, is a steeple swarmed in light
And it's sunny in the park
I left her with a heavy load 
Pppeople in the streets
You put yourself apart
Hey, let it drop
Let our dreams grow out together
She combs her hair
Who am I, we both don't know
Good Music save your soul
And time to compromise our lives just a little while
Let's go back to simplicity
I know it's not much, but it's okay
Yeah, it comes in waves, but it's hardest from the start
I jump before I get around you
'Cause I just rolled and I tumbled
And you know, it's Friday too
Still surprised to catch you
It's a new world, It's a new start
Love is all you need Yahoo
C'mon, c'mon wegotta kick that gangster shit
Ring, ring
So I'm standing here so lonely
Anticipate her, it's the great I Am
Show me that you're caring, you see my fascination
And our plastic swords stab our olive hearts
Well, it's all right, doing the best you can
Live my life without
Oohoohoohooh, ohoh
Don't worry talk they will
You cheated your fate now, we can't read your face
What happened to that father, who swore he'd stay
'Cause I'm lettin' off steam like a Chinese laundromat
I knew we were bound to be together
I'm dappled and drowsy and ready to sleep
Ain't nobody else
They say your pushing thirty
Two o'clock in the morning, something's on my mind
I got the hifi high and the lights down low
'Cause I swear it's getting better yeah
Yeah, it's safety dance
Now we'll parade around without game plans
Another partner must be found
You know I would, if I could I would do anything spontaneously
My money's in copper
I gotta get some soul I gotta get some feelin' 
'Cause she was never one to play by the rules
Herzlich willkommen im Nirvana
Got the sun we've got the waves
I've been hurting again, a cold black diamond
Oh, the moaning half tones
No time for thinking, don't even ask me
Hone in on the buzz in ways you could not
Is killing me right now Uh
It's all about the way that it unfurls 
And my band 'bout that money
She's everything I've been dreamin' of
When you had that accident in your car
I was frying on the bench slide in the park across the street
What if I led a different life, would you stay
'Cause fear is only in our heads
Óró mo churaichín ó Against the walls, against your rules, against your skin
We're gonna be alright, yeah We're gonna be alright, boy Ah, yeah, ah yeah
I Know one day you'll be old enough
You're so evil baby
You blinked and closed your eyes
Why can't they see a good time
I'm too drunk to light the bong
I miss you like the sun don't shine
Come in knowing everything
But it takes a lot of squinting
I feel like I will never learn
Writing fifty times "I must not be so, ohoh, oh"
'Cause, baby, I can love you, baby, I can love you
When I rang that doorbell forever
But there's no escaping your love, uh
You're the kind of person that I've always wanted to be with
He would never take a bullet for you
How do you do Welcome to the human race You're a mess
Before I fling it out into the ocean
I'm happy because I'm stupid
We'll send them up a message
But you'll find those lingering voices
Until we had a row, a kind of falling out
I'm in the mood for dancing, romancing
But she only cums when she's on top
Spread some love
And you say I'm such a cliche,
I could have read of your heart
I'd expect something in return
It all began with a god named Thor
'Cause you steal my soul when you leave
But we don't understand anyway
And let's mood the lights and finally make it right
I'm not feelin' so good
Yeah, always feel the pressure from home
Cause days don't get you far when you're young
Restaurant man
It doesn't get me down and I feel OK
I couldn't wait another second 
Just to feel like I'm a star, now I'm thanking the academy
My air hostess
We went walking through the hills
I'll come another day, 
You've got pollen on your nose
Time together isn't ever quite enough
Hit the door Hit the floor, it's the dawn of the day
Baby your magic is working
I'm not a child I know, we're not going steady
I'm juggling and my fears are on fire
Affirm my power to spend my dollars, to get us home, yeah
Why do the people in the country want to look like the people in the city
But please come down from that cloud you're sitting on
We used to climb but no one tries to go up that far now yeah
Now that my tralala's are dating
Varirnar brenndu, höldumst í hendur
I sat down on the street, took a look at myself
Under yellow moons
Thursday, I don't care about you
If you know this part right here, feel free to sing along
And though I'd love to be the guy
I think my mind is gone
To race away
I sleep in the afternoon and become the noise in the night
Keeping my head down 
The feeling of screaming out
Destination didn't even ask
Yes, I'm sure you're right
May we never go, go mental may we always stay, stay gentle
I'm leaving you tomorrow, but she already left, she already left
Your heart can list the all, happiness you know
Take your time you're gonna need some patience, girl
We're sinking
Now you know our names and you've been to the show
Now's the chance to choose what you'll regret
Where've you been
For heaven's sake, keep me awake so I won't be caught off guard
And the grass is so high
Picture yourself in the living room
But can you feel this magic in the air
I sold it to a man
Just a day, just an ordinary day
All I know is I'm in love
But there's nothing to be sad about
And I will never look down
And II, I wanna be you lover baby
And smile real wide for the papapapapaparazzi
So shout until your hear no more
Take the greenbelt to your house
Come take a ride jump in
And somehow it made sense
All the world would
Oh happy day,
You see, every time Ra didn't show
Final de semana
Spare me all the misery as I tear apart your life
Live like I'm still in the yard till I pop ya god
I'm in love with how you feel
Good, good, good
'Cause we'll never know unless we try it someday
Through water when
With automated smiles
Who can take a sunrise
When I scream out baby
And if I had to die today
Another sunny day, I met you up in the garden
That the devil is walking around
Your tear drops fade and then I saw
Nothing's gonna drag me down
You been workin' out
And the man in the sea's got a millionK
The horses are coming
I'll take off all my clothes for you
Black and on the ground
"Looks great"
Thought I was sleeping, it was just a dream
As we hit the front door
My heart is pounding loud, just like a timpani
I'm getting it out, whatever I've gotta keep in
Yeah, baby
Ash his heart onto the ground
The sun was out 'til midnight 
And the sunlight hurts my eyes
Never been alone as such
You see, you push it in the corners
And it ain't nobody's business No
This family sticks together
If the roles were reveresed, you could have seen me sneaking up
Brave another road
If I looked out of a
No you're not mine at all
Now you're jumping through their hoops
And it doesn't seem to mean anything
In the night light, we still shine bright
You don't need in reserve
We'll be like bugs when they break through a cocoon
Every summer we can rent a cottage in the Isle of Wight, if it's not too dear
Just my nightstand and my dresser
For a while"
Du genießt den Gang über brennende Kohlen
And we knew when we tried harder there would be another offer
Caught your hand inside the till
Let me take you on an escapade on an escapade, baby Take the escapade
La la la la, friends friends friends friends
Long live rock, come on and join the line
So now you know, so now you know
And I need someone
I find more missing every day
We're gonna be alright ah, yeah, ah yeah
We could be together if I stay bright eyed
There's something there and it�s showing
So I think I should get up and call you
Here is that rainbow I've been praying for
What you lose is what you know
Shuffle the cards and let's argue
Where the minority face the majority
Spread the word and you'll be free 
Oh man it's not fair
But say goodbye to everyone
C'mon people we're making it now if only you could be with us, oh
Darling, we will visit, you know you don't feel this way
Straight men
But my son, she'll only drive it away
Oh baby, I was blind to let you go
Will somebody wear me to the fair 
I got my tongue, got my chin
So never go away
This is what I always wanted,
My love, my love, my love, my love is
I'm going home,
If my dreams get real bizarre
I've got soulful days to counter evil ways
Really didn't think it could
I've got the table set
And you could get back down, you could get back down,
Only you can let it in
Hang up the phone
And Baby Lee I'm always watching from a distance
Happy to see how far I've come to the same place it began my dreams and imagination
I could never touch you, I think it would be wrong, oh
Dark years brought endless rain
Yes, that one in a million girls
And far away somebody read the letter
I know you'll quiver when fingers touch your side
And will you love again
Go on, do what you've got to do
Because here it comes in incredible yellows 
Nothing's gonna stop you know
I've been having a sweet dream
And holding back our tears
And now I'm having more fun
Things aren't always just what they seem
So long I been hungry for something else
Everybody's trying to be a billionaire
My mama said to me
To swim beneath or over outside till they're reading between the lines
Isolation I don't want to sit on the lemontree
'Cause I found some kind of fairytale
For sun kissed golden days
I'm just the same baby
And Brighton's lovely in the Fall
That turns out the lights
You're my every thought here, everything will
And there's two things I forgot
It's suds and soda, a brain decoder
"You'll all die in your cars,
From what I've heard with skin you'll win
I realize, to be happy
Is it true looks could kill Yeah, it's true looks could kill
Cause baby, all I see is, all I see is you
I got the concept and came to the conclusion
I can't stand it
No one's ever gonna take my life from me
We could start a little farm with little white bunnies
Now I've got these chores and I'm never going to hurt no one
Where I've been for the past few years or so
Where the words can't find you
Trying to come up for air
Bring it all back to you
This boy is cracking up
I know I don't know you,
We come down
So headphone tones do float me home, my chair was begging to come
We should get jerseys, 'cause we make a great team
I can't say, who do I believe
Can you hear the ocean roar
My prediction imma be on the top of the world
Nothing but road could ever give to me
Or put off, put off every old face
I want to repair your desire
I'm on fire and now I think I'm ready to bust a move
Of an eighteen year old who didn't know what loss was
JFK's head is a puzzle and your woman needs a muzzle
All right baby come in
Well I take two a day to make my brain behave
You're breaking up the girl
And all of your kind words amounting to naught but a token
Here's a picture of my mother, there's no one like she
Tried a little bit of moving on, it lasted way too long
When all I want to do is stay inside 
Stop by
But we're both just waiting for this Friday night
This ugly little box, no place for me and you
I keep calling your name Keep calling your name
Pay back the chicken back,
I will learn to live again, for now I'm breaking
If you want some more, come and get some more
Take it to the tippitytop
Why would I say my name Oh why would I
They didn't ask why I did it"
Is that I love you so
I want the waves to grow loud
I know she's the only one
Please please please
Smoked a cigarette, blew smoke rings in the face of Death
'Cause you're my air hostess
Just walk on by, don't turn around
Woo ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
You kneel to condition all the feelings that you feel
I realize this is my last chance
And the way they move and the way move and the way move their hands
We will not write a new one
My head like a bumdum
Looking at the world,
What's in your heart
You've still got a view of the summer sky
Let me through, paper in fist
'Cause she didn't have time
Early PM can't remember what time
This is my body
We want to feel ya hey
Hot love on a platter
I'm a little bit wrong
The kids fighting up the lane
I've got music on my radio
Followed where you walked, dad
So tell me darling, do you wish we'd fall in love
So go on and place your order now 
C'mon there you are
What turns water into wine
My moneys gonna find my hand one day and
If you had just looked once or twice
The greatest of men, sir
Since I don't have the time nor mind to figure out
So I fall to my knees
I have a girlfriend
Hello, hello 
And as things fell apart
Since I heard from that girlfriend of mine
I really really wanted you to come
I got a look at you
Baby, you just gotta make up your mind
We're solid gold
And when you're down, girl, you got to know this
It's been a long time, a very long time
Your poor family's name
How I know this place like the back of my hands
Or you're going to have to go with girls
Only a pound a word 
There's a story
Always past never and still faster
Leave the liberty in that broken bell today
No heart flutters in late spring
Oh what a lovely day to have a slice of humble pie
I was not looking for arty farty love
'Cause baby I gotta get through
And the pain that comes with it
It's all I need, all all I need
I promise I won't turn around and I won't let you down
The spider resumes the rhythm
Forget where they differ and get big picture
Today I said the time was right for me to follow you Today, said that the time was right to follow you
It's something that I can't live without
But I never thought I'd see you as I did
Oh and I know neither could you
Then we will always know
Will you still call for me when she falls asleep
Merry Christmas baby
Till all my skin was gone
Then she and the books and the oranges go back to her place
Sometimes I feel like I can't move on, nothing in life is turning me on
Of the living people breathing the air today
I understand when your girl is stressing you out
Of love
Damn right you, landed on my ear and then you crawled inside
Women with their nursing children
The party's done The cake's all gone The plates are clean 
We're hooking our
Look outside at the raincoats coming, say oh
And curves in all the right places
He's so far away from mountain lights
I'm a shooting star leaping through the sky
Ooh, there's no stopping us
Now, it's nothing but flowers
To our own fairy tale
The dog has not been fed in years
Who's that been sneakin' out the window
All I need is just to hear a song I know
I'm weak and you are my medicine
To the lonely beat
They come and watch us bleed
No way to say and there's nothying I can do"
If you stop, you'll end up somewhere
Cold hands, warm heart
And let's make tonight go down
Oh, that's all I've got to say
Hey lil lady
All I want is you, will you be my bride
Hey Julie, look what they're doing to me
Even at , you gotta start sometime
Clouds like bubbles in a sink, touching my face
But all I ever find my love
A brown box, moth balls and bowling shoes
You're a mystery
On the corner is a banker with a motorcar
I'm here to show everybody the light 
Feeling feelings unfurl
You're running back to me
That we're all in this together
'Cause if I fall
There could never be a father
Why do you bite the hand that feeds
I'll be the grapes fermented, bottled and served with the table set
I'm sure you don't remember me
We sold our clothes to the state
Hoo boy
So give your love to me
Two of us sending postcards
If you see a woman dressed in black
Been raining all night so everybody knows 
I'm kinda mixed up in this disco inferno
All night they're playing
And you're not just a lover
From my heart into your will
I couldn't turn it around
Now turn around, it's burning down
How to love or to let love go
Usually when things has gone this far
Play it to me, play it to me
The open sky
I walked all morning to lift my heart, 
In my bed I watch TV I'm drunk by noon,
Moats and boats and waterfalls
De mémoire de guitare
I'm old enough to know that people waiting on some big sign
It's okay to call Aaah
And life is going on in your mind
But for this moment I am fine 
Oh, I can feel my heart beating
Everybody knows you are a liar
And in every way, I know that you still want to stay
I love you
Gonna paint a sign
Hold the line
Hold me secure in flight
Because you made me think about the times
Won't you stick around
I'm quite alright
Changing your strut when you know I'm behind you
Hey, you were on my side
To cover up the pain in us
And the question that comes forward
You didn't even know my name
He's changing fashion, the way he dress
The city is further away, and I love that I, I can't stay
And you try a little harder each day to be
Mmm What are we waiting for
The moon is in the sky
And you gave half of it to me
No career plans 'cause you won't go far
Say you know my face like the back of your hands
I loved you then and I love you now, oh yeah
I'll never find, no I'll never find another way to say
This boy has broken down, yeah yeah hey
Daydreaming bed scenes in
We could let this love be the fading sky
'Cause I'm tryin' to get to Providence I lost my way
Selling subtleties, it sickens me 
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah down
Here we are, here we are,
To see you with another man
As she knows me
And it was time for all the wrong reasons
I don't regret it but I'm glad that we're through
Like it's nothing and the words are easy
I've got souvenirs but yesterday can't mean too much, 
The softest voice said to me all through last night
I'm the moment between the strikin' and the fire
It's Saturday and I won't be long
For once I have something
Make the voices sing
Leave everything behind
No doubling back now
Long hair cloggin' up the drain
Little girls doubledutch on the concrete
All the doubts I had have gone away
I hope I do my best
He knows that time can not endlessly go
I've terribly taken a turn for the worse now, I fear
Just like the song on the* radio said
Is love
It might seem crazy what I'm 'bout to say
Thinking oh, is it love
When you walk by every night
Why's everything so wrong
Must have disengaged every phase of the stage
And even when truth doesn't help with the sting
'Cause boy I feel that men are meant to be
So don't you tell me that you 'just don't get it'
You're like some kind of wonderful
And hoping something better comes tomorrow
'Cause when it's good
My exman brought his new girlfriend
Are you holding me down
Did you know she was flirting around 
Hell if Jesus had the power then so do I 
The dream maker's gonna make you mad
You know what I mean
Now I know I made a mistake
The tree by the river
And they'll be calling you baby
Comment ça va  Je ne sais pas 
Don't let it grow
I could stick around and get along with you 
Always look on the bright side of life
Government man spin his politics till they got you pinned
Hey windows down, chillin' with the radio on
'Cause you can't run and you can't hide
You give whatever it is I need
Headtripping on the sadness as it passes
Let it tear us apart
But he sleep all, sleep all day, sleep all, we sleep all day over
It's summer time fun, relax and stay young
In the morning brush my teeth
I'm having such a good time
Switch up the batteries 
Raindrops are falling on my head
I'm moved, man, I'm wigged
Now we cross the great divide
And if you find a new way
Dance, yeah let's dance, come on and dance
This bed is on fire with passionate love
And back and forth we sway like branches in a storm 
Home and away
I need some shit of my own, I need a throne
Quit fightin' while your husband
Alone, awake, and thinking of
When I'm with you I wanna stay there
Made my plans to conquer the country 
My eyes wide open, I'm in rapture
In the beginning I misunderstood 
Turn the TV off already, Curse the hours we have to keep
Seattle, ride wit' a G, Jersey, ride wit' a G
So Hannah let your roots grow
And can I wait for my devoter
Find someone, she's never coming back
It feels like poison
Just to be the man who walked a thousand miles
So with the combination of my gift with one liners
For a sweet summer night
You know I love it all the time
Things say 
With locked arms, making me nuder to everything
Do you remember where you saw her last
And that's the way I like it
I'm so glad you have a onetrack mind like me
I'm half drunk and I can't see straight
Don't get wise to everyone and everything
Flyin' down the street again
Watch the night turn into day
I keep taking everything to be a sign
I've barely been gone
I will learn to love again
I remember the time I knew a girl from Mars
This is our song now
And that's how they make you know, know
And dry up all your tears
Ohohohoho Honey, honey, sugar, sugar
I want the people in the country to wear flannel shirts
Walking free walking free in harmony in harmony
I was hypnotized
Ignore life if you want to babe,
Fun, fun, fun 'til her daddy takes the TBird away
I was feelin' on top of the world, and I just got a hunch
She's my uptown girl
What a good idea
Down to the river where they caught a wild alligator
Who really knows
And you lived in these clouds with lightning in your feet
So please try to understand that if I could, I'd call and I would be there
The perfect farm, it's from here From ya
And never come back
How far I gotta go to reach you
They frightened the babies and you know they've got two
I've been a bad, bad boy
And flash right through the scene
My left hand was wearing fake plastic teeth, all winter
Explain to me how you're so damn naive
Oh and we oh and we have been waiting for
Don't you try to call the cops little girl;
Some of us get covered up by the world
My thin skin trembling with these salty wounds
What made me behave that way
I had a lot to say
And break the rules
Who's living in that house
No matter what they come and they come, they won't leave me alone
And my dumb dreams
And I'm mentally slipping
Meeting a team from history
And like a bitch you already spent
And broke my heart to make things right
A new pair of boots and a chisel in your name
Sunday mornings, go for a ride
To something good, something good, something good
Be happy Look at me, I'm happy
Those words of wisdom I had prepared
Well, what you don't know doesn't hurt you
Right before your, right before your eyes
Flew into the sun
And everyone says 
And I needed his help
As long as I keep dancing
Show me your ocean red
So let that feelin' grab you deep inside
Hungry humans
This feeling that remains
I wouldn't call it a sophomore slump 
I guess I'm stuck in this mad mad world
Ev'rybody's gonna be happy
Worried 'bout no rainy weather
Once more 'round the sun dried
We stay together out of fear of dying alone
This could be the right time to change
You paint my fingers and you paint my toes
Good morning 
Slide up around the belly, face down on the mattress
I sit and meanwhile back
Everything's always better
Just let your love flow like a mountain stream
Finding a way from what's dark
Hold your head up, you silly girl
All seem so right
And I need to practice my dancin'
And from my house
Do you want to, come on
We've lost the plot
Nothing's the matter
The ABC's we all must face
Like a hula, hula hoop, hula, hula hoop, oh
Who finds the money
Me, I write the book that's sifting in the sand,
We got no money but we got hheart
I'm a Barbie girl in a Barbie world
Maybe somewhere down the road aways At the end of the line
And you're the sun that shines down upon me
Up from the basement to my best friend's farm
Till I hit the dance floor
Or a fucking fit of honesty
New shoes stuck to aging feet
Each heart to guide us
Creating in right now
Turn up my symphony, man
I've been a new sensation
Well I don't cry when my dog runs away
You're a game old boy, judging by the way you walk 
'Cause something
Did I ever tell you my uncle's monkey ran away from the zoo
Free your heart
Payback the donkey
stinking with charm 
Making the storm clouds cry
And the man that stood there next to me said "Everything is gonna be alright"
Than the person he'd become
We don't stand a chance 
Like guardian angels it's always near
Find yourself a big lady
Out run it
And everyone keeps laughing at those cars we are passing,
You know, you come from nothing, you're going back to nothing
We're walkin' into the forest
Every time my tears run dry
That just hurts you every day
Broken bluesy whisper sing to me tonight
And the world's alright with me
'Cause I'm dancing around in your world of play
Now we're here, with the lights turned low
And I never would've played with my conscience
And we find a country home
Oh in your eyes there's a sadness enough to kill the both of us
Eh, eh, oh yeah
And you don't know what's up the bend
Anything goes
Honestly
Skipping beats, blushing cheeks
'Cause somewhere along the line all the decades align
It's looking quiet as I jump in
For, for us to get, get down in the after hours
You can fill me up with what you've got
Any love worth living for
If you had done anything with anyone else
When time is on your side
You set me free, baby
I must've done something right
Left all them good ole presents
And to see it fall on your simple country dress
Take those things that cannot stick and 
Live your life until love is found
Remember the look upon her face
When a kid came along to offer a hand
But nothing is all right, all right
Say sucking too hard on your lollipop
A new level of growth he must confront himself
You know it really shouldn't be
Oh, I got a rocket
I am out here looking for you
A chip off a tooth
Transparent paper wings
So infact, real fast, we wrote this song
Oh, oh, one more drink and I should go,
If I locate the fear, talk you through the tangles, can you chase me till you my feet touch the ground And go dancing
Now, it's all covered with flowers
Late nights and early parades
Let the bugles play the sermon on the raid
When you're on a holiday
But I know I haven't yet
Prescriptions scripting a timeline
She says she remembers
You're so ooh You're so, so ah You're so, you're so Hey, hey, yeah
So wait here, wait up
Lost our world of make believe
Et on se prend la main comme des enfants
Quarter to two on the dancefloor,
To get me through till the end of May
Something tells me I'm into something, ah
I'm sick of slow rock, I'm sick of quick quips
Girl, you've been my best friend
You and me together
They drink lemonade and speak real slow
And threw them in the ocean
We are magnified
Oh, to hold you when you cry
I'm just being honest Hey ya
Waiting for the day it would be me and I could say
So, just stay with me, I will love you endlessly
Well he came back and
I wrote her a song
And I sing but my voice is breaking
Just like water takes the shape of where it's held
So just be gentle with me
Seein' stars I'm seein' stars
So long as they're around, 
Give yourself away
You wanna fly around the world,
Dansa for blanget Dansa till musiken
How come we're so alone
Ooh, ooh, don't tell me no
Threaten with the rep of their big boy brother
When I step into the party, all the ladies wanna know
And just enjoy the show, oh
Your tongue is twisted, your eyes are slit
We can dance, we can dance, we're doing it from wall to wall Wall to wall
You're better than money
I got so dizzy fell back into my bed
Well I don't wanna break before
A young girl's sighs
They say to me that God's do exist
Julio, get the stretch
Just say yes do it now 
Who appeared in quite poor health
I can't stop what you've begun
And there are faces on the six AM working crowds
But you're with him, now I'd do no good I should've fought him but instead I let him I let him take you
Last night the weekend caught us up
But with you by my side I can do anything
This boy is cracking up cracking up
An easy girl to kiss
Some kind of solitude is measured out in you
I know the bad's gotta fix itself
The palms of my sweaty hands
A foxtrot above my head
And we'll collect the moments one by one
Step out in a crazy world
We lied in so many words
And hold on to love
There is an empty space between the lines tonight
I don't beg, I don't borrow, I steal
If you knew my story word for word
No one gets high on themselves
Girl you're living in danger you're sleeping with strangers
You look away, you're speaking with your back turned
And everything you did to help advance at this
I'd rather waste my time with her
Oh say wouldn't it be nice to know right now that we'll be
And the fishes in the sea 
And lead is light as a feather
Hello, hello
But your mama thought there was somethin' wrong
I can't control my brain
Mama told me what I should know
Nothing there to prove
So now we're drowning in birthday cakes, well, here it comes
I've been waiting for you
Hey, who's worryin' 'bout 'cha, babe 
A habit hard to break
To deliver a painting for some silly reason
If it's jug band music or rhythm and blues
When the night feels my song
You're out with your friends
It hurts to see you dance so well
Well the sun one day will leave us all behind
And this town will be cold when it gets hit by a comet
Our lips can touch
So hot I can't stop staring
You let me get in dans ton lit
The moon pours down like mercury
And we will put the lonesome on the shelf 
And I really love the way you wear
As they try to teach me how to dance
There's plenty for the kids to do today
And I won't run for my life
I used to be cruel to my woman
Shaun has an ASBO, he's only fourteen, he's tired and he's bored with the local police
We put faith in our concerns
It's just that he was,
On a cool summer night
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
Lying in bed in the sunrise 
When I fall asleep
I dreamt you found me out in a field
I need my medicine
There's no need to look around
We don't need those diamond rings
And rockin' on the horsesized
Go baby, go go, yeah we're looking at you,
Grandchildren on your knee
Then that girl sure is me
The man was talking about you simultaneously
I wanna tell you something
Something more beautiful than is there
This shit's making me feel bad
He washed my sins away
In this day and age it's so easy to stress
And they're zipping white light beams
Cry your guts out till you got no more hey
Please take me away from here
I thought it was a bad cough
Life is like; I don't know why I do things like this
You're so alone today
But time is often on my side but I give it to you, oh boy
But then you told me you would move away
And I'm on a roll, don't you be late
You can't dance and stay uptight
Dear, dear friend
Living there to fill me with dread
The planet spins and we watch space pass
In our little place
Come on, come on, Come on spin a little tighter
And said, "This is all I really need to get by"
Try to treat me like a friend, get another late call
That I'm about to lose my mind, mind, mind
Feeling the love and I'll set it loose
I just wanna be happy, yeah
And I fall in love every day and I feel like a fool
Yes, I am always right
You bite, it's all right
When the moon glows yellow in the riptide
Yes like those forest lights
Kicking up a blaze, moving over like a storm
I didn't even want around
You I will Will rise Will rise Above above The room
I'm daydreamin
If I could tell the truth
And the beat we both stomp on the floor
Now you're a storyteller you might think you are without responsibility
One life, live free,
They remind me of the pickup truck out in front of your neighbor's house
It's automatic when I talk with old friends
We bluff our souls on canteen patios
The radio was playing "Crimson and Clover"
I have to put your picture down
It looked like a newlywed
Being with each other
And tonight he's not gonna come back home
You know how to get along
I fall on the floor and I laughing
Satisfaction's not to far away
Well I'd say don't throw it away if it's not working anymore
It's Friday night and I won't be long
I don't mind it when you whistles
I salute to the champions on the wall
Now how the hell do you ever expect that you'll get laid
When will I get my chance to burn the shoulders of
And Danville window sill
But it didn't make her happy
The rain was gone
Blowin' dro on 's, livin' how the song go
Today I said the time was right for me to follow you
But now I'm feeling afraid
I know you'll cover your eyes
I've been waiting for you, girl
But I was runnin' on my own two legs 
So shine the light on all of your friends
I bet you're saying to yourself
A little wiser now from what you showed me
I said, when I arrived in my own set of clothes
And if you are the ghost of Christmas past
It all comes back to you, you're bound to get what you deserve
I'm just trying to make you mine
We all got our stories but please tell meee
You know I should
I just want to get 'em wrong
Even days a week, every minute of the day
Yeah let's dance, c'mon and dance
Don't wave no goodbye Don't wave bye
I'm so sick of feeling sad
Someone else's door
I could show you the way
And now that I don't want for anything
You don't know what happened to that kid you raised
Ne me quitte pas mon cher
And she'll have fun, fun, fun
You could be the end of me
We feel a little pity but don't empathize
The more I try the less I care about it
Don't panic, panic, Mutya, just look ahead now >
Baggage  Wine
No, I wouldn't challenge your home
We made our way home on the bikes we had borrowed
As long as I got you 
I need some wheels to move you around
How do I reach fullfilment
Maybe it's just one wish away 
These walls won't fall,
Into a place, where thoughts can bloom
Where those nightmares had just been
But you stopped yourself and kissed me
'Cause I would make a hook and eye
But it doesn't make sense
If not ever I had known
You know you twist, little girl twist, little girl
It twists and turns in colorful subplots and sunburns and fake out endings
You didn't have to be so nice Didn't have to be so nice
Hey, remember that time when I would only read
I put my hands on a cellular phone
You won the race and got the gold,
Timbaland
I hit the light and I thought you might be here
You make fast living look just fine
But secretly I always want to see you cry
You could lose faith in music,
I can't tell night from day
I was bone white, dry, and scaly
Bande publique forty five
Do you know who I am
oh the calcium mines buried deep in your chest
The truth lied and now I wonder
I'm balancing on one fine wire
Can't get no sleep tonight, damn it feels so good tonight
Floating up into the sky
She's the one that keeps the dream alive
I'm so mad at you cause now you got me missing you
We belong together
That I wanna know
You said you loved me you know what you said
When everything is out
And someone falls in love
And totally removed
But yours would look better than mine, 'cause you're outta my league
You'll find a soul behind a thrill
If one of these two walls could speak
Stomach sick, dizzy head
And I am the peach in the starfish on the beach
You're kissing your elbow
Skinny kid, no, friends with bout everyone
Watch out for late phone calls
I always act a fool ow, ow
But let me get paid while I make you breakfast
You're the one, that's making me crazy
The record's playing for just me and you
I know I'm not the only one
Head into the city  well, I guess it can't hurt
And I will think of you now that we are apart
My side
We're making moves so blind
I polished off this bottle, now it's pushing me off
Leggy Blonde, goodbye, goodbye
We're gonna be alright Ah, ah, ah ah, yeah Hey
We'll be starting what you're searching for
We go on every dream in my, in my city, eh eh eh
I hear her playing the drums late at night
Around Of memories I've made
Runners, until the race is run
Take a deep breath and hold it in, hold it in
Now you've been sighted, oh, do you live till you die
And if we stay on our feet we'll make it in our own time
Well, the fall hit me hard 
I know we all have a similar dream
All the nights we stayed up talking
Aye yippey aye yeah
You've got nothing to lose
It's silent down here, maybe I want to get loud again
I'm your pole and all you're wearing is your shoes
My feelings I don't
And there's water in wine
We are bound and marching to an ever static distance
dans son retroviseur mais elle n�a jamais osé
Tomorrow is another day
It's a long way now through the deadroads to your house
Bring your dancing shoes and something to tie your hair Hair
Party like it's the end of the world
Can you hurl me the game, Oh Starlight Has what you need
in the calcium mines buried deep in your chest
But just a little helps, it gets me straight again
And you told me that I would forget you eventually
But we had to move on
Now I can't get out of bed
Chop the tree
Stomp your feet and clap your hands
In the broad daylight
No life
Thinking 'bout a way to get you off my mind
Avant de perdre prise et d'abandonner
Next I'm getting on the plane
Timbaland and JoJo
It's been a while since I felt like this
Yesterday I turned 
To ten million fireflies
One day baby, you'll realize that I know,
Have you ever seen the ending so nice
You know what they say
I'm losing sleep and it's gonna be keeping me up all night
Belting out sunlight, shimmering love
Alisten to awhat I say
There must be enough love to go round the world
And she cruised through the hamburger stand now
Spit gutter on a Premo beat, for the love of the street
O comet come, comet come down
The sun's got my shine
You don't mind the taking girl, but you don't know how to give
Silver moon's sparkling, so kiss me
Don't hide the treasures you've found in a hole in the ground
So my beer now taste so bitter
But I know you
Mystery trip
I'd like to watch them try
You've never been so nuts about a guy
They are smoke
We go riding on the abolition grain train
And nothing's gonna stop me but divine intervention
No sun is shining anymore
You get so high that you can't come down
If you think you know what happens next
Whole weekend recovery
And everybody knows
Bon jour, monsieur
Commit another atrocity,
There's a story in which my eyes shut
On an August day
If this nightmare can't be stopped
Oh yeah, there's nothing you can do
Before I've many a time
Shake it, shshake it
To kiss the ground
I'm done dreaming that we can fly
This is the most magnificent life has ever been
In your eyes
On a riptide, freak's ride
You headbutt me,
Can I, can I break your sentiment
We will be dimming the lights for this evening's entertainment Enjoy, enjoy, enjoy, enjoy
It's the word I'm thinking of 
And you looked so cute there, rainbow styling
We walk to school all by ourselves
The first two weeks turn into ten
I almost forgot to say something else
So you better get a record player, and a generator
But I know that I don't ever wanna leave
From all the bitches the one I wanna be is music
To Anything Taboo
Lady on the water, whip this wind into a flame
As I look around me
Well let them take you next
In search of something greater
Do ya, do ya, do ya love me Do ya love me 'cause I wanna know
But you know which way my pendulum's swinging
We all grow old, use your eyes, the world goes and flutter by
We're walking on sunshine
He might be nursing a broken heart
And we become silhouettes when our bodies finally go
We're the only ones who do
Why did I come home, 'cause I hate it here
Or just forget about your life
Or around the bonfire in Nailors' cove
There's a village I visit, that's Vaguely
And I die trying just to keep myself from kissing you
Hide behind your half smile
I wake up in a town that never sleeps 
To keep you by my side
Be good to be
There's a reason why we met and I'm glad that we did
I wanna hear my sound
Well I'm tired of hanging around
Our love does run, it's your reflection
Our son is losing his mind
Oh she's so southern so she feels the cold
Gone are the dark clouds that had me blind
But I never thought I did
All I wanna do is move on
I'm drivin' fast, I feel so fine
In the light, there's still stormin',
O'Malley, fun
A small story which never happened
In this very strange world 
Here it comes
In honesty 
Woo woo, you make amy dreams come true
And not to those who'd plan out his life
Not as smart as the words you spoke
Their hair was soft and long and the beach
Jump up and down and move it all around
Un p'tit air sur trois tours
We gotta
Talking bout, 'IIIIIII, I don't be going to the strip joints'
When I met you I didn't know what to do
Just one more time please
When I'm in your light
Just as long as you are free
We're a bull, your ears are just a china shop
All I can say is that my life is pretty plain
Amanaemonesia
Get down from your tree house sittin' in the sky
Maybe something's wrong with you
Through these lies
Don't look now but I lost my shoe
Bad boy rock, bad boy roll
And what it is you're saying today
There were moments I lived without lying on my side
I'm a bad muthafucka, I'm way too fuckin' co'l
I've seen your scars and kissed your crime, oh
Three days, she's found herself a friend
And now there's a place to go
My head it tends to stray away sometimes I can't see clear
Pincher crabs that pinch at your sandals
But she was young and dumb, she'd just turned twentyone
The clocks go back,
I know debris, it covers everything
It's the music that we choose
Is that what passes for vision these days
I was about mine, fantasize housebuying
You know my name and you know me number four
The light is the sign, that love will guide you home
To walk like your pappy
I know, I know
Fall in love with a girl like you
Back to the street where we began
And she should've played the part
I can't seem to get my head straight
Are better than the reasons you had lost
Enjoy it, it's your last chance anyhow
The better things to see in life
Forget about your sin
Shake down, you make me break, for goodness sake
Happy, happy, happy, happy Bring me down, the love is too high
That type of thinking can't get you nowhere Somebody, somewhere
It's suds and soda, a smile, decoder
Baby I just want you back and I want you to stay
And then go stealin' through the moonlit nights
The party's just begun
I knew you well, I knew you then 
Never knowing where, never knowing where
Sand ran through my fingers
Burning down the city
You wanna lose control
They had church candles wrapped in newspaper
Seven years of river walkways
One step back you're leaving it, now it's moving on
From fields of white flowers
We are racing to the break of dawn
The sun is shining down for lovers
The town's shut down, the people left with their bags
When we met that summer
Just to move around
Well, I've been thinking 'bout all the places 
Well, you ain't gonna tease no other
Get it, have it, bag it,
Are the people close to you
If you could find a reason, a reason to stay
'Cause they're done washed away
You love to run
Can I talk my shit again
What's the point of language
Mr Pleasant's okay
Ghost figures of past, present, future haunting the heart
To help my fellow man
Let's meet in Kristiana next summer
Perfect picture card scene, changing all that has been
Because there ain't no party like the party going on in my house
And I'm smiling for no reason
You might get away with it
Because you know that I will
Then I saw her face, now I'm a believer
It's my party dance if I want to
Voy pensando en ti cuando lejos estoy 
Burning up the homeland
Do it wrong or do it right, it's alright, it's alright
For the Earth, and materials, they may sound just right to me
We both need you here
They will come from me
And maybe I can meet you in the morning
Take you home, and then they'll rape you
Who'd gathered there to watch it topple
I've been poking a voodoo doll that you do not know I made
You have to put the death in everything
Oh, who can take tomorrow
Let's go around to other distant nations, now
Yet again I say
Always running through my head
But I know what I don't, don't want to rot in my room
And she's making a play, she can't go wrong
You won't forsake me, your mother won't hate me
You say yes, I say no
And if they don't dance
You do love me I decree it
And we talked a lot 
My music is where I'd like you to touch
Grant my last request and just let me hold you
I love in the rain
And when the sun is out
But to a writer, the truth is no big deal
Mr Postman, look and see
When I felt the way that I do right now, right now, right now
When the sun goes down
You dared to kiss the face of the night
Oh just remember the telephones
I've tried, but i don't know why
It's not a lot, it's just enough to matter
In summer the bushfires rage and rage
And life is nice, so nice
Please say
Have you seen a lady fairer
Now I'll tell you something for my heart beats for you deep inside
To the feel good hit of the Fall
When the world is on your shoulders
Your water's deep
Dah dah dah dap n deeh dap dah
You let your perfect nipple show
Fading out the light, softly say, Get it out my mind, any way
With a showing of hands, who's going back to the south
oder Hubschrauberpilot
I never knew a heart existed
Now I got this feeling
If you find yourself caught in love
It's the time it takes to blow away
We are strange in our world
Whoops, I think I've got too close
And her chest is full to bursting with thoughts of an evening
Ain't nobody gonna take your place
I wanna go there and I'm not scared
And nothing but good times to show
Jump into that water and see for yourself
Singing these words to everyone
Threw his bags on to the back
Oh, give us a drink
All I wanted was some evidence,
Our lives are fractions of a whole
Loved us in Nebraska how they cheered us in Mattane
But not with me
If I told you things I did before
Don't have to be ashamed of the car I drive At the end of the line
And all of the grief we never even knew
Right, now, it's something you created
Pass them forward with a foreword they won't mean a thing
She likes to sleep and I love to stay up all night
And he knows it's time for all the wrong reasons and time to end the pain
What about you I betcha been cryin'
And I'm afraid I won't get out alive
Well it's true, yes, but you won't get far telling me
What's with all that information, oh, don't give it away
To carve my own stone
There's always something to cry about
My badge, my witness means that I believed
You'd be the village joke
Never to be mine, no matter how I try
No one knows where they take us,
They got yesterday's heroes in last night's clothes 
There's a bitter cold chill in the air
To get across the sense of impending doom
Can really break it down
She's not like an ordinary person no she's not
I found my soldier girl
Taking a ride to another clime
I gotta let you know
I've just got to get myself over me, yeah
Back on the road again
Roll down the windows and open our mouths
Your ever ever after, yeah
Still got all the things that I woulda give her
Óró mo churaichín ó My beard grew down to the floor and out through the doors
You say it's what you need and hide your eyes when you're close to me
But out of my ears my little gray baby hears
Am I the one you're thinking of
With faith we would not fade away
And all those ugly days
And only so much you can control
Said if you want to get with me
I fell or you and nobody else
And if it's all the same to me you know it'll be different to you
Just forget it, it's the same old runaround
How the wind went and pulled me in and no
Milk and honey till we get our fill
Lovers all talk in the spits and tongues
'Cause I love her
Balleyes and their lipmouths in the night
If you believe a hand on your faith
They are the roots that will weave through the floor
It's gonna be everything and everything we're meant to be
I can only love you
And I blew that room away
We blaze away, oh
You're allowed to stare it out
Don't believe me just watch, uh
And paddle with both my arms
I always thought you were pretty like a whip
Moving on to better things
I'll sleep through the alarm head under pillow
We'll sing and dance to Mother Nature's songs
Yeah, no one will ever notice if I keep my mouth shut tight tight tight
We've been dancin round the moment now we're doin' it
I'm wondering how things could've been
Dancin' the night away it's like the party never ends
Believe in the magic of the young girl's soul
Now, talk to the man who's laying down by the door of a bank
A thousand miles from the tide
But uh oh, I love her because
And there's nothing that
Come back to me
And they said we would�ve seen you two years ago
More than anything 
But that's okay, that's okay
Sometimes it feels like I only dream in black and white
She says, "Dad, the wedding's still six months away but I need to practice my dancin'
Well I can't say there'll come another day where money and time will fall,
Somewhere backstage with Sean and Lars
Crawling out of the world she brought
And I will make sweet dandelion wine
If I start believing in you
It may get harder, cause you just restarted
My chest suggest I am a man
I sold you a thousand lines
I'll touch you once you make the first move
I wheeled around behind to my blind side
Cause the dead air is what makes me whole
Can I have some please of that whistles
For every time I feel lame
Searching for the words to say
Want a garden by the ocean tide
To the land that would be rediscovered
Plays something familiar
Yeah with you
After six hours of school I've had enough for the day
Singin', don't worry about a thing, oh no
You're so fragile tonight
When I'm around
I was talking to myself
Comes down to hope
It looked like a wedding cake
If you're gonna shake, shake, shake till the morning
Home is when I'm alone with you
We still think that we owe you some
Or let the paranoia haunt you Haunt you
Let me walk through the stinking alleys
You, you know my name 
Time, where did you go
And how I wish I was an ocean
Military wives whose tears drip down from ten little eyes
A different kind of tree"
The two drunk kids, trying to figure out which way was home
Won't somebody save me from you now
You think I look alright with these mascara tears
And the funkiest grooves,
When you wind up next to me
I was dancing to Michael Jackson, oh Silvia
Looking forward towards the next scene
And I had a drink the other day
My feelings have not fallen away
Hoping I could learn a bit 'bout how to give and take
"I'm bored" or "get away"
How you gonna find out what she had in mind
Nothing brings me down
Got me thinking just too much
Nice day for a walk in the park
Here's a hand to hold on to
You've been kicked around,
I've got the life
We're spending what we haven't made
Standing in the pouring rain
We'll come again
Everyday seems a little longer
I buy lead Nike shoes
That's what people say, mmhhmm
All right, all right, all right, all right
So you better run
Do you really love me tell me
I'm back, back in the New York Groove
Fate doesn't hang on a wrong or right choice
And it always grows back
Kick kick shuffle shuffle back to the beach with a
So I'm always sober
Maybe I should come down
You're inside
Hey, hey, gimme just a little break, hey, hey, ain't no more that I can take, hey, hey
Spilt their eyes on
And can I skip this thing I ordered
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off you got to
I know, I know, I know
Half of them won't know until you're gone
Hoping and praying you'll wait for me
Baby, let it all hang out
But you still took me home
She's in love with me and I feel fine, mmm
A chance lasts a finite time in the cool July night time
Life was good now death's all wrong
Lines thicker than ground
Underground, Underground
Like you know I do
You feel the heat
A girl named Cathy wants a little of my time
Town the line
Oh my soul has never had this feelin'
Yeah leave the cold behind
Jump in and go and we could drive for years
Soft and sentimental
Oh, short on money
This is not my life or maybe it is
They call me Jane
I been sitting in the darkness
The falcon calls
And we held our head up high
Sh sh shouldn't need anyone
I'm beginnin' to see a, er, point of light on the horizon
Government warning
I feel like dancing
His heart is full of perfect joy
And now the truth of it is, is I wanna be like you
Soft, yeah, I'll be all right
At first you might see this one bright beam of light
Our love is true
I just wanna burn up hard and bright
But I know when the stars are aligned you can
It was like Rockaway Beach in the month of June
But let's talk about it
Don't lose your faith in me
I feel good
Through the jungle of doubt
I just want your kiss
Until the birds had flown away
A merry Christams, honey
Sees the ocean fall and rise
Every Prince Charming lost charm after twelve
There's gonna come a time when the scene'll seem less sunny
When I am with you, there's no place I'd rather be 
With one hand off the side
Avert your eyes from all of this, we'll make it all back
I look at you, you look at me, we bite each other
I could show you a place
On the sea bed
I can see her eyes looking from the page of a magazine
I am your love
A man walks out of his apartment
Can't go mad, ain't got time
You sigh, look away
Let's call out all our fears right now
Well, some people try and treat me like a man 
Your books write themselves, they line up in row after row
Oh, her lips, they really thrill me
I know that may sound twisted
Tucked in the woods and out of sight
I never thought that I would get this far
All the blondes are fantasies
Never get tame Grownup and lame Yeah Yeah
A holiday
'Cause I'm gonna ride it till it hits the ground
Any traces of that other place
Livin' with the police right behind ya
Me, a family, a house, a family
Today I know I feel OK
So come on and hold my hand
What was a stinging's now a sharp pain in my chest
Our aim was to break it down to the bone
Qui vivent la guitare à la main, du soir au matin"
But I'd be fine wasting our time
Where will you carry me
Mundane Sundays, when I'm gone
Mons Venus, Crazy girls Know what I'm saying
Play a joyous tune
And out of town it huffs and puffs
I'll steal your honey like I stole your bike
I couldn't say what I was thinking
Rubbing on the lotion and rocking on the horsesized pills
Já, rifjast upp og núna man
Dad took off when you were four years old
One night doesn't mean the rest of my life
The world's turning 'round for you
Like an ice age, nice days are on your way
And make you feel alive and good
Let's get back to tearing this place a new floor
Vegetarian, can't stand to be wrong
The seesaw of love, its rickety bounce
Met you one summer and it all began
Surely not to live in pain and fear
In my mind I was waiting for change
Your thoughts I can't ignore
It was fun fun fun when we were drunk
On second thoughts I'd rather hang around and be there
How do you describe a feeling 
Choose it tonight
Slightly where the night gets colder
Crossing sandy dunes
Never dreamt of such sterile hands
That your love, your love
She just couldn't see things my way 
So you say, Yeah I'm all right
My Uncle John had a special friend
Once I had a love to show
That I swore I'd never play
And when the night has fallen,
Always been hip to the Bboy style
Please, point me in the right direction
Walking the way we used to walk,
The strong men, the children and even the cowards 
They forced their way inside
Pictured the look on my stepfather's face
Another road where maybe I
Junior high legs; blond hair gone brown
To go end lead a separate life
Still I would sing my song to me
Marea a todo aquel
It's what you need
You make it fine
The way you love me
I need your body on me
'Cause I can't get over you,
Stuck in the middle
I'm writing you to catch you up on places I've been
'Cause honestly, I just don't care
Run until your lungs are sore until you cannot feel it anymore
Blue babe, I said I'm blue, baby
Who's got the brains
You won't understand all this until you're
You can see that birds and worms do not agree
Sleep all, we sleep all day, sleep all, we sleep all day over
You've got to take what's due
Without having to say
We can dance, we can dance, everybody look at your hands Out of control
This place were we felt free
Can I be fallin' in love
I've got big big plans
I don't want to forget this and I don't want to be forgot
I'm so mad at you cause now you got me missing you
It's all good luck charms,
And a book on Presidents deceased
The mean little people are such a bore
Today's a day to celebrate
If there's one thing that I could never confess
A world of possibilities
Yes, do you believe what he says
It's not my business to talk about
And think about how things were right
Pitch black and baring its teeth
There are several days
Wonder how I'm managing to smile oh
How a life can move from the darkness
I don't think I'll ever feel the same again
Can you feel my love
It's crooked in the side
Trying to outrun your fear
I'll get the whole world to celebrate
Woooohwoooohooh
As I hear your voice
Wait there, I'll be right back
And what did you forget
You know I need you, girl,
She's got medals
Hey, there's nothing in my art
For every single ghost on that freeway, baby
It's suds and soda, a smile decoder
I'm faking my own suicide
You took care of your skin
"You should�ve seen me a couple of years ago,
Our lips blue from cotton candy
That you are all you're meant to be
All around I see raining
Gonna love you every single night
When I let go of your throatsweet throttle
And everything seems to be
Sweet thing, you know I'd fall in line
You can go up my crain girl
In the light that passes through me
But it almost feels okay
If this is what I call home, why does it feel so alone
Just let it go
The way back home always is the same
Girl you will believe in love
These rocks have always given
Tou get right down to the bottom of the barrel and float back on top
There was a game we used to play
One day some day you'll miss me
On our trip to England I noticed something obscene
Welcome fishies to my hook
I only wanna go where my wheels roll
Before they put us in a coffin I've got things to say
And I'm going to make this moment mine
It doesn't matter what you did
I lost the signal and put you away
Won't you take me to your home,
I heard the beat and I ain't know what to write
You've been looking up to him
But that's what you do to earn your daily wage
City fog and brave dialog converge on the frontier
We're really rolling
I don�t want no savior baby, I just wanna get it out
You won't be happy 'til the bottle's broken
Broke what you fixed you're so underground
Shout out, don't drown the sound
I leave tear stains on the ground
That girl is giving you the eye, and I and I and I
This must be rare
I was stuck I was stuck
My baby brother Alfie how I wish that you could see
Please don't despair my dear mon frère
Make out with all your dumb friends
If your romance is
Till the end of the day 
To grow, what to feel
Ambitions are already starting to fade
When you stepped out into the world to start your day
Everybody wants to go to Iraq
Upside down
Ya end up with no teeth, nigga you don't know me
That great stuff
So I dressed myself and left then
Give in, my friend
Oh yeah, you know it
No more runnin' 'round with the usual crewwho cares
Now you're shit out of luck, yeah
I remember feeling like a ship whose captain was too drunk to steer
He could use a fine tooth comb
I got a gnome in the backyard
And I had blood in my mouth when I spit
I want you to To fill my little world,
And you're forever talking on the phone
We'll break seeds, we'll grow
She fell in love
Your love
I don't understand your reasons
I'm regretting letting you fly
Oh yeah, you're my little girl
Life's too short to play it safe
Waiaiaiait, Mr Postman
How will I get there
Always so eager to pack my bags
That when you lose something like a golden diamond ring
Though I spend my days in conversation, please
I try to put it into words, but the words just sound like mistakes
God made love
Who watches over you Keep the nightlight on inside the birdhouse in your soul
Trying to catch your eye
I'll write you a letter that you'll keep
Let me tell you what they say, when I'm pullin' off my drawers
From a feelin' that is here to stay
It's fine by me if you never leave 
The feeling of letting go, I guess we'll never know
No sticks, no stones could break my bones like you can 
It's everything
After all that's what you're looking for
Into the milky way again
You were nowhere at home
That's right, now
And all your dreams have vanished
That's why we got more hits then a dealer at a Dead show
We will put this flesh into the ground again
All the things I wanna say 
Move along sad face your cover's blown
Baby, I feel so alone
Crumb by crumb in this big black forest
Now I'm gonna try this old microphone light
And that angelic voice you hear in the background
Take your dreams where nobody can find them
A string of frames that just goes on and on and on
Deer die with their eyes wide open, eyes wide open, eyes wide open
We're just dancing, we're just hugging,
Now you can endure the fear now you can endure the hell
Ach, Aurélie, in Deutschland braucht die Liebe Zeit
Eat it like it's gonna get away
I know there's a time and a place where you can call the shots but it's not here
Check it out, I'm rocking steady
I live in your tall trees, amongst your fearless leaves
Mastercard or Visa
You might really love it 
I sang a hymn to bring me peace
With the dawn I still go on dreaming of you
But lost to a slut with much bigger breastes
Scratch my name on your arm with a fountain pen
Clap along if you know what happiness is to you, ay ay ay
They'll tear us apart if you give them the chance
Look again, rock is dead, rock is dead, rock is dead
You swept my feet right off the ground, you're the love I found
For the price of a cup of tea
Just bend
How I needed you there
They kinda like to keep you in your place
And if we worked it out
Just when you think that you've got a hold
Early in the morning clouds are dropping on my head
DDDo you love me
You're so bitter; you think he's sweet
But it's half past noon
Cruising and boozin' and rockin' on the horsesized pills
Purpose is scaring me
Will you come and fetch me, girl
So I'm calling your ass up at like
Well I'm shrinking bones in the sun 
Oh, I swear, I know, I believe it, oh
The last word was meant to be
As I looked up into those eyes 
With red in our clothes
Focus looking forward the Colosseum
For you to get up
I'll take you up on a dare,
'Cause I know nothing ever falls apart
Never been lost in anyone, it's me they want
Empty loving makes me seasick
And watched the sun rise
I just want to be ok today
About the time they called me "Jacky"
Somebody say ih hih ih hih ih
Call the cops and arrest you this time
The sister is naughty
One last time let's go there, lay down beside me
I put the right foot in front of the left
Shape shifting city stretches and bends the night 
Underground
Un p'tit air et toujours
"But don't you understand
It's hard for me to show
That's when you gave me a call
Everybody, just hold hands
"This thing gave me writer's cramp"
Close our eyes, close our mouth
Left this city for a day,
Gotta be everything more
I look at my reflection in the mirror
And talking 'bout your eyes
That's okay, that's okay
You can work this out if you both try
It's just another pointless game we play
Why don't you walk out the door
It's family beaches that I desire
But when I'm in doubt, I open my mouth
May we never go, go mental may we always stay, stay gentle
Thirtytwo softly focused, brightly colored eyes
So it's over before beginning the good part
Now you can have your phone and eat it too
Tell the teacher we're surfin'
How come it takes some people so damn long
I'd like to shake you around and around
Never had a friend or wanted one
Your own history
You can wear my clothes
Baptize your tears and dry your eyes, oh
Alright, lift me up woman your love keeps lifting me
Turns my cartwheels into head stands
Down by the ocean, walk by and see
Looking like you're upside down
C'mon and on and on, on, on
I choose to lose my skin in the dirt
You touch my inner smile
I'm caught in excitement 
Who the hottest in the world right now
There's no way to convince you, girls
You make things all right when I'm feeling blue
We're all too busy working, entertaining ourselves
Summer, winter, scat and spring
Den enda regeln är att du ska ha sa jävla kul och du ska
On the way to Venus
Got to carry some stairs to get near enough
You gotta focus on to your ability
Oh, what's the use of making a bed
I'm in love with the ordinary
Still I can't say it
Bang, bang, a knock on the door
And finally Finally I have found a way to be
You make the whole world wanna dance
And turns out everybody claps, they don't believe in cabs
I wonder if you ever get to say what's on your mind
Get that, get that, get that, get that
Tonight, to the stars
Feels like the world's at stake 'cause
That's right
One day when I'm gone adieu and so long
I say hello
Do you know any more
And Sara told the friendly salesman that
There's a picture of you both sixteen years old just kissing
The rock candy's melted, only diamonds now remain
I can't beat the feeling
I wish that I could fly
If it's not now then tell me when would be the time that you would stand up and be a man
One fine day we'll fly away
Folks given up under the quivers and lines,
Don't worry baby
On the underground,
I'm a pretty impossible lady to be with
So, let go
I was sitting on the fence
You played me boogiewoogie I played you love songs
Come and get it, come and get it now
Some say, the river won't flow
I only see you when you're walking, walking to somewhere
I'm not too proud to say that I'm okay with
And she is constantly aware of all the changes that occur
We'll be lovers once again
And you're on fire, they're throwing punches
Hell is my heaven
Don't it feel like sunshine after all Don't it feel like sunshine after all
I'll never fall in love
Without you, I'm just miles away
See I'm looking to become not the prayer but the prayer
Damn man kick out the likeness
Just the way that we do
I see you asleep on a twin bed
What's the problem I don't know
The spaceman says, "Everybody look down
Waste my days Whoaoh, whoaoh
Down comes the reign of the telephone czar Aaah
And you say, and you say
It's how I do but not everybody knows it
Well you are the one
So please can you stop pulling my hair
Such ridiculous hate in the hot summer sweat
And just when you've labeled us one of your types
Now I'm happy in the head
'Cause into every life a little rain must fall
A little bit of you makes me your man
All the looks of love were staged
You are suave thanks to ribbons that opened sesame
I threw away my reputation
Blast off on success
Come on save this town
Floating over a sea of vodka
You got me running around in circles 
I wilt just like a fading flower
That'll stab you like a thousand knives
I was hoping that someday
It left my heart in a mess
I asked somebody "Could you send my letter away"
As if there were apartments smaller than mine
To a place you and I  Will call home
I knew that we'd arrived at a unified scene
Baby don't you know
Prove that you're rock steady
You're gettin' on my case like The Rockford Files
Is it the world or how I see me
Marmalade, we're making out, oh yeah
But I won't regret 'cause you can grow flowers
Any sex is personal 
He says, "Let's get crossed out and come to harm"
No, not built, but they say drink my milk
And when I held you I felt so fine
Pacific Palisades Inside, outside, USA
These things in life they just don't come for free
Real sugar
She broke my heart, I wanna be sedated
Coming down there to my heart
Oh yeah yeah yeah
Just like we're dear old friends, like she already knows me
But it makes no difference
I think I realized just in time, although my old self was hard to find
But your time's coming around
Driving slow on Sunday morning 
Time don't move
I say yes
But somebody's sending me stationary filled with chimpanzees
With my lover, she's counting the diamonds on rings
I'll meet you where the sun it always shines You're on my mind, all the time We are not wasting this
And then we'd be happy And then we'd be happy
Spitting hype things 
The big collector from the start
"'ere mum  got any mandies"
I saw something beautiful
The tree said "I wish I could be 
I remember when it poured and you sang to me in summer
It just ain't good enough
We laughed waiting for a train
And we'll have fun, fun, fun now that daddy took the TBird away
She comes in colours everywhere
And oh if you knew what it meant to me
I let my guard down
Óró mo churaichín ó They couldn't think of something to say the day you burst
You're past the point of holding up to your words,
Looking out
I say, "Baby, scoot over please"
It won't bow to your demands
Because tonight's the kind of night
There's just mareseatoats
Turned out just to make of me an honest man
But you only want what everybody else says you should want
Would life itself stay or follow me
Depende, cora,c~ao              	        It depends, heart
Grab your booty and you're on the run
Well, shake it, shake it, shake it, baby, now shake it up, baby
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah
I'd like to have company during thunderstorms
Careful you don't hurt yourself
When electric hearts
In fact the people they should
Aruba, Jamaica, ooh I wanna take you
Never guessed it got this good
Tropical iceland
On my own two feet
Then we could be heroes just for one day
You should stop treating me like I was just a child
Hand me down my pants and get me off this street
And says you broke another heart that was broken down
Words are found too close to the edge
You tell lies thinking I can't see
Took two showers a day and I dressed up like a princess
Oh, nothing real can be threatened
I've been awake for a while now
We sailed up a river wide as a sea
To look to better days
Oh no, oh no, you've got it all wrong
Take you with me if I can
Oh please, I bet everybody here is fake happy too
But these days I am a man, I'm not a boy
And no one ever signed our stupid country disco band,
With mountains, lakes and the human race
Well, baby, baby, baby down I'm really down
This dream was me and you
Outside of make believe
Oh, happiness is happening
And considered it odd
No I don't believe in the wasting of time,
We see the star of wonder
He says, Why am I short of attention
But I wish you'd let me be 
Urmanar er all till en afro paus så baby
The chorus girls in neon were his closest things to friends
Music is my greatgranddaughter
I say you're born rich 
Let the stormy clouds chase
Masking vapor trails from Mercury for a killer on Umbria,
And somehow happiness will find you
The competition show their teeth
That there's people out there in the black
No I won't sleep tonight
Seated on the floor
Be back again
Do ya, do ya dream about me
When I'm too busy getting down
Fade from your eyes
How did it drown our love
Second floorliving without a yard
Everybody needs a bosom
What you're here for, I don't need it
For you and me a crimson color tree
Whispering rude things in her ear,
But if you're not ready for love
Just pretend that things are mobile and will never stay put
Stolen rooms are the alloy of chrome
But darlin' I'll find a way
And all my friends deserted me because you painted me
Be an optimist instead
And find a handsome young mate for you to love
I wish you'd call but I know that you're out tonight
But not together
Until I told you it was just fireworks like the fourth of July
Long legs,
So there are these little pills I've been takin'
Out of mind, out of state
You know the camera don't lie
Who loves the wind
Is where you spend your daylight
And just because her only signal is mayday
I'd give to ya, world, and then
Just look through your window, look who sits outside
I'm trying to get a feeling from the city
I's the radio that tells me so
But that was then, we could pretend
She had an A body and a face to match
They'll judge it like they know about me and you
If I could be for an hour every day
Tonight can we be free to be who we really are
Sky is blue you say forever
You come and take the chance, baby
And so I will say,
"Oh no, what did I say"
Someday 
What I thought I would say
Hey this fire it's burnin'
I'm not gonna say you don't
Ser'a sujo, ser'a sonho         	        It will be dirty, it will
You need to get a job because the bills need to get paid
I hold you in my heart
The rest of your nights with the light on
He catches the moon looking down from the stars
I know what you want,
Is making me
You always thought she had a chance and it was somewhere hidden
Love goes ahead
Of all the numbers you end up calling mine
Nobody's business
To lose my way
I get up
Feelings sleeping in the field again
Be alone, I am beside you beside you
But I will give them all back to you
I'll stick around but just don't promise, nothing bindin' 
And she says won't you calm down
Tell me why I'm here dad
To friends it brings a happiness
As we exchange strangers and lies
Your inner mind 
We all wanna know how it ends
My eyesight's fading, my hearing's dim
With two cracks along both sides
By your side, oh
People are just people like you
And I don't know how you smell
Then I got high, Lord, I got high 
If you get murdered I'll avenge you're death
And look me in the eyes take off that stupid fitted cap
Subtle and grace, desperate for change
And the summertime will make you itch the mosquito bites
Did life bring you down here
Hey, girl, I said, ooh
'Cause I've got wheels 
The next man he might try to cheat you
And you have your own engaging style, you've got the knack to vivify
See my name's not Hoover and I don't give a damn
It was then we sealed to unlock never again
I'll be higher than the government
Follow the day and reach for the sun
And yeah it's sad that you think that we're all just scenesters
Whether or not our season will soon be done
There's no time to cry, happy, happy
He listened to his heart when he should have used his head
Two peas from the same pod, yes we are
Speed train
I hear the music
Just laid to waste
They get on from here
I'm gonna start a factory the size of a country
Would he take it all back what they've done
Just let me go
You'll always smile upon me when the seasons bad
So this ones goes out to the reds and yellows and blues
It's war zone baby do you want to survive
Come go with me, we've got it made ooh
More than a friend
I really want to start a conversation
And it's words may wound my soul
But it all coincides in some way
And washed it away down the kitchen sink
The streets won't be so plastic
Everybody's playing in the Heart of Gold Band, Heart of Gold Band
When I woke there was noone there
Where's it gonna get you, acting serious
I got some pictures on my phone
And leave without a trace
We're part
And I find that my heart is my home
Dear Dominique I wrote to tell you you're delightful
Somewhere back there I left my worries all behind
I know that you have the right words ohohoh, ohohoh
I don't wanna be right
How to get from point A to B
Yesterday's still a mess
You're lost in your mind
She needs a wild heart
Are summarised from the very start
Hey, read my lips
I'm playin' like shakin' under the coconut tree
But someone else, you see
We had a little dream
Or just a letter
Always be my boy Ooh
Inevitably, well it still exists, so pale and fine 
You heard the birds sing
That's what he's prepared to do
I might get hurt
The words from you ring on and on
Of the living people walking up and down the graves
Then I will never get away
Stayed all summer then went back home
But the rents are high and LA's easy
For all the other boys caught in your bleach job hair
Even though I know the river is wide
We're moving away
All the times when I stole a look from you
I'm amazed that I'm talkin' to you
Woahohoh, come on, ohohoh, all you party people
Devastator, in a negligee, does a strip tease while he sings this song
High off the ground from stair to skyscraper
And it's quite scary when you wake up in the same old clubs
She passed out before we even got to talk
We could talk if days weren't so fast
It just makes me sad whenever I see it
Says he's got a big boat, but it's just a fairy boat and that makes for a short, short ride
Can't heal the pain
'Cause this is my interpretation, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, gee, the way you kiss
I feel the need to go
Wouldn't want to change a thing
In your light, just when I'm in your light
In my hotel room
Lay your flowers at my door
So listen carefully
Is love
I got you on I got you on
Don't let me rush you please
On his lips a perfect smile
Here comes success
We've got to get away
You sat in the sun on a hot afternoon
We drank the ocean dry
Yeah, now I'm back at your door
Yeah if I lived in Ireland, if I lived in Ireland, uh huh
We'll wonder what it was about
But the worst stays in
It's a heart attack
And, make it sound so very nice
I want more fans, you want more stage
It turned out to be
He's never had so much fun
It tastes like metal in my mouth like rusty Listerine
And all this love, rainbow styling
Ooh, don't pull it's legs They're pulled
Have a drink, 
Missed my ride home, lost my iPhone
I know that she's a hottie but damn that girl could party
You need a guardian
Hide behind that baby face
You can try to swim the sea
It's a sure fine way to ruin my day
She's so pretty but she doesn't always act that way
You know that it ain't easy
To qualify her luck
However much I loved you, you will always love me more
If you can't dance 
Just say you do
His mom and dad both think he's a slob
You smote the demons
Oh girl, look at yourself
Well, maybe I'm in love Love
Don't you know you can't believe all that you've heard
But I don't care, 'cause right now you're mine
It was beautiful, slow dancing to tunes of Billie Holiday
Started having hiphop, pops didn't buy it
I'm having a ball
When I look at you, you look so bored
And we are homeless, homeless, homeless
Every single day of my life
And I'm back here quick as lightning 
Will the wind that blew her boat across the sea
These special moments do exist
Some days I can't hold it at all
Jeden Abend fragt sie sich
Love isn't borrowed, we aren't promised tomorrow
But his best work was his letters home
Ain't got no mother, ain't got no culture
And yes they know that it'll melt
And I don't believe he'll come back
So forget the day
Away with the small ideas I know I'm not the only one
I drive , miles an hour
I feel little things falling in today such a big day
And truly I don't think you'll find a happier man
I said that's the way we get by
I'm not your typical, stoned yearold,
I just want to feel today, feel today, feel today
K  I  A baby, let's get this started
But they only play for money, you better not run 
The same kind of pain that I had when I was seven
Always be my boy
Somewhere searching for your inner peace
And you couldn't really know 'cause it's in my toes
And will you call my phone out of regret
You know I wanted just to hold you
I woke up in a car
But I shut my eyes
Of course I'll put my arm around you
But that's the way I like it
Like it's something that needs repeating
Mercurially gilded by the sun
All I've ever known is true
Where are you I need someone to be my lover
Well I guess I've been in love before
And I won't be waiting for your call
Just sit back in and stop time
Our little place
Junkies on the corner always calling my name
The cornerstone, the baker Run for your life, for your friends, for ya
'Cause I'm just a teenage dirtbag, baby
Breaking off is misery
So up off the ground, our forefathers are nothing but dust now
How you've really changed me
Hallelujah here she comes
Picture book
In the pouring rain
Never did but I meant to, I, I, I give up
In this one horse town, I wanna stay right here
Everything good always would remain
I don't care where I'm gonna be
You'll never forget it
The craziest thing of all, over ten years have gone by
Closing your eyes the feeling so right
Wrap their arms and embrace the air I breathe
In the middle of the bath
Now I'm letting silence do the walking
Seeing double on a one last one night stand
You don't know how, you don't know how
Person 
Thank him for everything you know
Don't look down no no Go go underground
I don't know if Stu is keen to
We're all carried along
Looking out at the universe
Oh what a perfect world
The kids flip their lids when their heads hear that crazy sound
Throw all on your clothes, the second side of Surfer Rosa
And it won't be a pretty sight
And she's looking at me
From here to heart arrhythmias
I said to her, can it wait
View in there, a pitied pair
I take it back, fullblown attack 
I'll stay inside and find a pitch that sounds right
And take it all, take it all back
Rolling with the punches
I hope sweet Heaven has a place for me
Someday we'll meet beyond the limits of who we are and it'll be
That is, unless I'm getting found, and
To show me you understand
With your topic of conversation
Won't be steady, we'll never be ready
The day would surely have to break
I've been all around the world
You might think it's all in your head but you're not certain anymore
If we could both find a way
When you think you're right
Feeling as good as love, you could, you can
Hey yeah yeah
Because the blinds were shut
But if you pay me, I can play the fool
'Cause you were always made to want it all
How the music can free her whenever it starts
"I need to get myself away from this place"
You know you're some kind of wonderful
Wait for summertime
And carry you off eastward,
You're feelin' old
If you knew, if you saw, you'd have said it was the final straw
There's nothing left to talk about but there's plenty left to do
I wanna know just what to do
You gave me love babe, gave me love babe
So go, I know
And no I haven't got a clue
Lying through your teeth
You get me
Ya, It's a new day, In a new land
Dye my eyes and call me pretty
While a girl on the floor singing RIP
You've got a smile
Oh, you are beautiful
Mixed with Zach Galifianakis
Don't start without me, I just got in the club
Sleeping to dream about you 
Oh right now tell me where your heart is
Happy today
And you're on your own, you're in the street
I tried to hide behind tired eyes, I sigh
And you play it coy
Yea, a part of me 
The place is really jumping to the highwatt amps
And you'd swear those words couldn't heal, and
I got my finger on the trigger and you're in my way
One, and you hold me
Its only 'cause the sun shines once again
Oh, you, you are that girl in my dreams,
Life I love you, all is groovy
You get old, I have
It feels like gold
You keep telling yourself it's all right
To see you ruin our plans
Learn to forgive, learn to let go
But not for me, it shines for others
All the pretty girls on a Saturday night
I laugh at myself with the girl in bloom
But right then the clouds parted in the sky
This is the best thing that I've ever had for real
I think we've turned into a big mistake
Shake it shake it
Oh why For me I'm always looking for a way out
There's twenty girls for every single boy
I just wish that I could still
You could kick a drum but
Oh, you're tender and you're tired
Turntables in her eyes
And now all her friends
It left us looking like a bride
So don't change me and I won't change you
You keep on searchin'
I'd ask the world to dance
Normally I try to run and I might even want to hide
Wandering alone on the ridge of a coast
Då får man aja baja imse vimse spö för man är inne
Place to silent sleep now
And all you really see is your mom Oh
Won't you come around and play for me
Lookin' over crossed eyed
One piece of wood from Noah's Ark,
Right, left, right, c'mon
I hope you know
Well my eyes they look for better things
I thought I was smart, I thought I was right
Eleven different reasons for fists in fights,
Now the light shines on
Until a day when there was one
The footprints over the snow
I didn't know, 'cause you didn't say
Suntanned bodies and waves of sunshine
Going down a bumpy hillside
I got a story, it's almost finished
A boy is stabbed and his money is grabbed
Fufufun
From the fire
"Send your heart out for repair"
Yeah baby this is your day
To do the things that we say
'Cause I can't figure out just what's inside
Through your mom's kitchen chairs
Now you tell her that you love her and she cuts you slack
     ooooh
Some people think that we're running away
Getting into the swing, getting into the swing 
"It's a might big world
But you're a million miles away
Oh we'd stay up late playing cards
Oh I get high with a little help from my friends
From inside my soul
Nice day for your shop to get busy
I will live while I can
Now the city blocks out the sun that you know is rising
Come and ride with me, pimpin,' let me show you how we get it
Your crystal ball, you keep it hid
They can't wait to grow up so they can kiss some ass
And your heart is feeling lighter
And The world is made of energy
Running around again
I'm in love again
When I get older, losing my hair
There is nothing left to do
Without makeup, without clothes
Looking for a ticket to take me away from here
Soon the sky will clear
You leave for the city, well count me out
Always have to steal my kisses from you
When you show me your world, I just smiled
Nothing to believe in
To the ruby redwood tree
There is a part in every day when I lie to myself and say that it's okay
Now he's got the time
Someone above has seen me do alright
And you've seen me roll with you
And tennis on the sun
Pickin' it up but then I put it back down
Yes we always yes we always we always have fun
And the feeling goes but my hair keeps growing
Fix your mask, girl
Let's make a list of who we need
Some day one day you'll miss me
And fellas, you got to watch it
Are you perspiring from the irony
Lookin' shy, you caught my eye
Be the one with the loudest mouth
But I'm not asking for a storm
Sing it out loud and let yourself free x
Wonders how you manage to feed the rest
You're blushing red, your head can't hide those thoughts of dread
Whenever God shines his light on me
Sos to your ears, the only thing I ever feared was this day
Say it with a smile like it's meant to be
If it's not with you
Couldn't relax, couldn't sit back
You missed my eye, I wonder why, please do it again
It felt as if you'd returned
Do ya love me 'cause I wanna know
Pick me up at three, send me off to sea
Hallelujah Hallelujah here she comes
Yeah if I lived in Oakland, they'd still be Chinese children
When I worked in retail they said I was a slob
I hope you learned it notefornote, like good little children
Locust wind
All of his money is gone
Red pullover
Ohohoh, yeah
But before I go and hit the road
Perfect system I am fallin'
Or you'll never know 
And I believe this way can be the same for everyone
Under more stars than
This familiar environment
I'm on top of the world, 'ay
And hearts getting broken lead to people growing cold
Those days you were wearing that velvet dress
He looks around, around
Leave the novelist in his daydream tune
I wasn't feeling all right
It's just my party now
If you actin' menace I can pick another hoe
Killing it As long as I got you 
Red wax, it paints me unclear
Don't like it how she makes you laugh so much
Wednesday morning papers didn't come
Drop all I have and go with you
It's already in my mind
I put him right on the X mark
And all the letters are inside
Here today and gone tomorrow
Esanqoba phakathi e England
Sometimes living out your dreams,
The one with old wood creaking
All we need is a chance now
Well you don't relate to me, no girl
That we don't dare sing
Come go with me, we've got it made ooh Baby, c'mon, yeah
But I can see it in your eyes
Wake up where the clouds are far behind me
You could swap or lend me
Stay beside me, stay beside me 
We lie still on your bed, the room is lit only by the telly
Oh make no mistake my friend
Take a chance, take your shoes off, dance in the rain
There'll be Ma and Pa and Grandmama
Now he's back and he'll tell us what
Before I knew you baby,
Who's around when the days feel long
The way it begins
You look like the songs that I've heard my whole life coming true
First it wasn't easy, 
Pull out the stops got your attention
Stop dancing to the music
You're entering this town
You lucky, ho, a couple years ago I'd have probably cut your throat
Your tongue is withered it's heavier than lead
Tiny minded twotone suckers
To keep this boat afloat, there are things you can't afford to know
I see my name in shining lights, oh yeah
Today was the day
You're out of line, out of line tonight
Ooh baby, baby, dancing in the moonlight
Since I left you I found the world so new
Incidentally, this record is available in the foyer
Follow the shouting, I am longing for you
Oh I love you oh
It don't sit so pretty when it's looking straight at you in the eye 
We tore up the walls, we slept on couches
Attending to their jobs
And where's my mom, I wanna hold her tight
Yeah, I got busted
And you're holding on to me like an old love
Yes, all will come
They're done washed away
Of an ocean swimmer
Take a cue from anything you do
That when the sun comes up, there'll be nothing wrong,
I'm away with the fairies now
And the first time that we kissed
I took the morning to read the paper
It's gonna be ecstacy, this place was meant for me
Oh, we can beat them forever and ever
Darling I know I'll be found
No matter where we go
Then you go so change the weather
With my electric heart I then will find
Must be the season when those love rites shine
I almost wrote a song about you today
That makes you wanna grab your lover's hand
You may not notice now, what people talk about you
Well, it makes me happy to see you walkin' 
My broken house behind me and good things ahead
So, come on and be my light
And I love my friends
They'll split before they part
Oh yeah Oh yeah
Clouds of birds are covering her dark blue sky
And when you do, you'll know how it was meant to be
Standing here right now
And bite our thumbs at the acquaintances
People are hateful, and people are rude
For something new
See the cars on the 
My father was in the first part
Gonna love today
Who's to say what's impossible and can't be found
No witnesses
The world is our carpet now 
Moving in boredom but I'm sitting around
We danced with monsters through the night
Have a drink and shake some hands
Someone hold this child up to the light
And you know that
Spaß, ich bin harmlos'
So I walk right up to you
What have you become
Now the clock is striking one
This boy has broken down
I don't care Fingers through your hair,
Long as I know I have love I can make it
You are earth, I am water 
To have no regrets and be done with my life
Age fourteen, they got you down on your knees
You see you got magic
I cut my way out of control
You know, you know my name 
Is country music what your life is for
Or did I speak too soon
Old walks in the park
Afternoon delight
Something tells me that I'm fine
He's got a heart that will never melt
When you on the corners, there's too much drama 
And someone's beaten up
For when I'm a billionaire
But you're tearing her apart
Every single night ends up the same
I'm letting go of the thoughts
So go to your downtown and bring what you've brought back home
Sun is out and it feels like it's always gonna stay
So I can be the beacon of hope that you'd always expected
Everyday, I'm so happy, baby
Go put your last £ on the lottery
Lovin' is what I got, and remember that
Hear the signs and know they're speaking to you
I need you now, I need you
And I don't know how it gets better than this
Wake up in the morning, stumble on my life
I had to learn the hard way, I had to let her pass by, let her pass by
Can you tell me what's the point, man
Met my match today
Yeah, I feel again
Here we are, no one else
Come with us
But you know this as Class Historian
How things are gonna turn out now
And they bring all of their friends but I don't mind
And when we get there yes we're right on time
And it's a pretty good feelin, yeah it feels pretty good
From the park when Dakota ran and brought you there
Money got no hold on me
It's so unreal you know,
Before the highway road
Wednesday, play with me Thursday
Just a dream, just an ordinary dream
I got my mind set on you
Booming like a bass drum
Ooh Here I am, and in this city
Sucking the white light Indians
As we're really not together at all
I said fuck dancing all night but then that's just what we did
Now don't have me break this thing down for nothing
You take in everything with a certainty I envy
Just keep your eyes on me"
"Here I am to save the day"
We gave up before we gave it a chance,
To go back to where I was would just be wrong;
Distills each dream inside my head
People cry, people fight
An easy girl to miss when you're gone
Tttttttouch
Honestly, you did it to yourself
Yo, meet me at Suzy's Rendezvous
Mentiras son dividí contigo
I'm thinking you're the girl for me 
Nobody cares anyway
She's the night pick of the day, yeah
I love Paris in the rain
And you can still hear her bawl
I'm beside myself for the touch of your lips
Cut notches up and down the door
You are my candy girl
From all the junks the one I need more is music
Come here, oh, closer to touch, never enough
Heyla, heybahelloah cha cha cha
On finding a new planet and naming it right after her
Not sure how I got it, not a dollar in my pocket
Oh, oh, oh, oh, I feel fine now, oh, oh, oh, oh, I feel fine now
Yeah, that's all I gotta do
My dad is so cool
And said it was small 
Oh give it a rest, I could persuade you
I can feel a change of fortune
Why am I weary and why does my head feel so light
Stop dead in your tracks from her eyes
Get like me, get on the dance floor
There's no need to exaggerate
Baby don't pretend
He says don't think, don't talk
Life is a drink and love's a drug
Sometimes I don't speak right
To have come
You need attention, I can see you're sulking
I spoil them when I'm in love
Because I got my gods but in the end
But when you have your own children
And I never really loved you more
Weren't that funny
The men started working
I can play the guitar like a motherfucking riot, uh
I didn't know I was lonely till I saw your face
If you gave me a chance, I would take it 
As light as the birds
Every street you walk on
Why is my only amusement
I am a vampire and I'm looking in the city
I was holding on to her and she was gripping me tight, she was
To my breath or to my words
Saw the bright colors, bright future
"'Cause people are just people
I have everything right
I could tell she liked me from the way she stared way she stared
When you gonna see it doesn't matter if we're the only ones
I woke him up, broke the news, after everything was sewn
Come on, come on, come on, come on, baby now come on, baby
Would the real world even care
The end of December, what's going on
Instrumental Until End
You take your girl
In deep confusion, in great despair
Ooh I'm in the mood for dancing, romancing
Got love for the corporate playas that's ballin' rollin' jags
Mmm hmm, you make amy dreams come true
Shake it like a Polaroid picture
And coach look at me now
Will show in motions rendered by the night
Oh, love's gonna get you down
I get to be myself and I get to sing
Out for this girl
Can't seem to get where we're going
To wait for you, yeah
'Cause we're lovers, and that is a fact
But love don't die
I carried you till it got dark
And there are things you can't avoid, you have to face them when you're not prepared to face them
Right now my vision is gone, and magic's to blame
And I have found my feet,  weeks
Heaven don't fall on earth
Early in the morning, risin' to the street
The girocashier and baby maker
Some things work, but me
Lost in another world far away, never another word till today
I know a drugstore cowgirl
Someday I will treat you good 
She's driving away with the dim lights on
"Everybody needs a little Devastation"
So maybe one day I'll be happy
And of all the places that I've been
And when the money comes in for the work I do
If you want them raised right you I guess you start them young
Where the rivers unwind, the rivers unwind so easy 
The stitches of space that slowly come and go
Live while you can 
Uh I can hear you calling
'Cause you've got everybody thinking,
Jamais un simple hochement d'tête
But it's Chris that you kissed after school
On a tear, cautiously we advance, Anna Lee
In the most unexpected faces, I see changes
I think we can fly and swallow fire
But daylight is so close
Shake, shake, shake, Senora, shake your body line
Oh dance
Still photos and noisy arcades noisy arcades
I feel so lonely
In an index looked up WhereitWas
Dark clouds all around
When we all cried together
The water's gettin' warm, so you might as well swim
Everything is beautiful and you are the reason
In England people know me
Wire up a radio
Then I would know where I was going
Peace to fashion police, I wear my heart
Fought with kitchen knives and skewers
Waves of light are travelling
The kids are yelling "Play the song
Sadeyed destruction built around sand and sea
C'mon let's make up a dance 
'Cause I'm about to break it down,
Now all my moves are flawed
'Cause you wouldn't understand the suburbs
I guess maybe it's possible I might be playing it wrong
Watch your step along the arch of glass
The kids go sledding
When you're passing on your way
And the sun will come to shine on you again
That we have got something real good going on
And heavy rains descend
The grass is so tall
But when I hear those drums late at night
Everybody's screaming "hold it in, hold it in"
Not today
I placed you on a windowsill
Put on whatever makes you attractive
Ahahah, ne me quitte pas mon cher
When we're driving in the car
We want the new temptations woh oh, oooh
What you here for, I don't need it
Bring me down, break it down in the hot, hot desert
New names and numbers that I don't know
You make my heart go boomboomboom
Keeping dumb and built to beat
He said to only look up
When no one's in the dark room
I don't believe what they say
Sold you a thousand lines
You kept on dancing underneath the burning floor
Another sleepless night
These bees get me and I say Ow
She makes my head spin around
We goin' down town, oh yeah x
I didn't care, I just bummed from my friends
And I'll try to stay awake as long as I can,
But I don't get disapproving from my girl
I get pushed out of shape and it's hard to steer
And it was late in the evening 
Hey, get out of my mind
From the pouring rain
We are grown but cannot see
Now it seems too lovely to be true, but I know the best things always do
'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
Ever fallen in love with someone
I love the way you dress
Everybody will die
Watch you change your light bulb
Why don't you like me without making me try
You've been with all my friends
I know that better things are on the way
Trying to hit a Saturday nighter
I wore a dress
She's back, I can feel it in the air
A nice smile, a wet kiss
And do you dwell upon the thoughts that I occupy
How not to see my life
But still he'd rather have his time than a bob or two
And it's a perfect night for feeling melancholy
Magic, magic, magic
Stop bein' a bad joke
Rurururun
And if you're partial to the night sky
So as you pull me from the bed
I got someone waiting for me
When every morning longed to fall
Just your lower lip on the floor
Do ya, do ya, do ya, do ya love me Do ya love me 'cause I wanna know
Satisfy my needs
By living in the moment
I know I'm in love
I can get to my sleep, I can think that we just carried on
You're such a strange girl
And I dreamed we were dancing in the dark
Find ourselves a new place to haunt
So I hope there'll come a day when
We think we found the truth at last, when it escapes
The crowds keep me coming back
Try and do the things you want,
Won't you help me share my love
We are young, we are one
That was the only way I knew 'til I met you
Time of my life
'Cause I love you, no
Drivin' away, just drive away, leaving it all behind, driving away, yeah
Obligation or alarm
She plays it hard, she plays it tough
Always when we fight
They call me Stacey
There's a cow and an ostrich just waiting for you
Well it kind of makes me nervous
For your therapeutic smile
It's the time of year the water cleanses itself
Then we'll stay for a weekend
I put that record on just to make a sound
Down to the nigga's chasin' million, their dreams' servin' nickels
I'm living for the light
That I've been desdesperately alone
And I can't sleep
One day like this a year would see me right And only now I see the light
So I'll be hanging by the phone,
There she goes again with fishnets on
Come inside and pour a drink, here it comes
Freedom ring
And I walk the night
Mine's on the forty five
I'm carrying all the love of an orchestra
Anything you want in the world
I'm a flower in your hair, I'm a flower in your hair
Holds my hair back when I'm drunk and get sick 
But the tears from the heart of my love won't change
There ain't a cloud in the sky, no nothing
And you might be a little bit bruised 
There's no stopping curiosity
And I act like a child and I'm insecure
God takes care
We pitch a tent and have one sleeping bag
Oh, all this years will wash away and we'll be claimed but we'll have nothing more,
In a beautiful balloon
Oh just burn down the house
For the turn
She said she won't forget
We've never danced like this before
That'd be spent in sweet content, just dreaming away
No ates el flotador
And ponder on everything we say we trust 
Won't you take me where my feet feel happy in their own time
What did he say
'Til there's nothing at all Ah
Get the balance right on
You know you wanna go go baby
Unexplainable sightings in the sky
Nothing ever happens
You know and I know, a thing or two about loyalty 
Nothing really mattered when you called out my name
I didn't mean to hurt you
But you don't need to waste your time
'Cause I saw you walking down the hall
Maybe I should learn to shut my mouth
Won't be long till the truth comes out 
I know I stole your coat
Betty can't quit carving question marks in my wrist
Oh say I love you so
How could someone not miss you at all
Ooh there was the night we
All India Radio forty five
And then you can tell me 'bout your prison stay
Just give me the time and the place, and I'll be there Oh oh
Don't tell me 'cause you know I know it hurts
And makes it free
Can you, show me how we can escape
It changed her philosophy in '
Let the sun shine down from above
It's a matter of fact
Get down, get down, I want more
I grind for the top dollars, fight rotweilers
I found a driver here's a fiver
I need high heels just to stand up
Will you say,
Tell me that you feel this, and I won't give up
Feeling like roadkill
He said, "Harry, life is great
As you brush your shoes, stand before the mirror
And when she dances, oh brother
Over the crest of the last wave falling
Everything is turning grey
Well I know when you're around 'cause I know the sound
Today skies are painted colors of a cowboy's cliché
Everyone said, "Go ahead and ask her"
I could only afford one weekend
Oh I hope I'm not alone
And he said, "Oh, boy, you are so pretty,
Waking up on the bathroom floor
Is that a punishment
You can feel, but you won't sing
On such early flights
There was heat
We're waiting for the bright light to break through
And I kept it with golden things
Semicharmed kind of life, baby, baby
My life in shooshooshoo, shooshooshoo
The love that's shining all around you 
To warm  you and kiss you, my love
I got so saddened
All I gotta do
And claw my way back to town
Why don't we runaway baby,
So you better get to the table, get to the table on time"
Saw you hanging out with your eyes looking down 
I've been found out
Big girls, you are beautiful
"They're pricks," he says, "I didn't get a second chance,
And fall so deeply in love
Girl, you know that I'll be back again
Your beauty will last for a while
I like my beats fast
Little me is waiting, standing through the night
No one can tear it apart, yeah
And if you want some fun ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
Would you still say you needed me
Your children have grown
Can we get away
Creating a still photo of a scene
These days you might feel a shaft of light
Feeling without recosts,
But I'm alright though We're alright though
I used to be mad at the government
But nothing happened every time I tried
I'm starting to kink
A curious and enigmatic thing
I don't want to waste my time on simple little things
That makes you feel so new
Oh reckless, a boy wonder, so quiet, nose broken
I'll stop the world and melt with you
Why am I hanging around in the rain out here
And kissle me some more
Wherever you are
And girl you got that body
Let burn the cigarette somewhere
Fourteen cannibal kings
Like you don't know how it is
I just want you by my side
And I'm sorry I sound glad, but why always be so sad
On the blue sea I'll blend right in
'Cause now how could I forget what she left
Oh, I could hide 'neath the wings of the bluebird as she sings
Can you tell me what you see whenever you look around
And there exists a star on stage
One or two oohoohs
even in your own country 
Just leave the epic poem on its yellowed page
A whole new world to live in
A moment in time we can't replace
I know we said that we'd always be honest
And there are twisted days that I, take comfort
Any kind of frog, any kind of bear
Fighting in a foreign war so far away from my home
I hope they taste of me forever
We're segregating, consciences are fading
Give us the greens of summers
My feet run out of ground
And your life has come undone
I cast my memory back there, Lord
Just let me close my weary eyes
I'll find the things they say just can't be found
It's very funny 'cause I got your fuckin' money
I've never met a girl that likes to drink with horses, knows her Chinese ballet
Than the love from her mother
I left my baby on the side of the highway 
But other times I'd feel so bad that I could not get out of bed
Well c'mon everybody and let's get together tonight
You want more fans, I want more stage
And carried out
Oh, when I look to the shape of my heart
Everyone I know's been so good to me
When the fellas, talk to my girl I ain't with it 
And I feel like I do even more now that
I wouldn't have it any other way
But, when I let you down,
Oh it's good to know, tomorrow you are coming home
The canvas and the photographers are
So I, I am not into the idea of living without you
I try to be honest
I don't wanna risk losing everything
The fear and the yearning
I was in so deep but couldn't get out
Lives within your life
This heartache rots that which spills
We could have given up early when it was dark still, not light
Take a chance
To put the pin back in the grenade
We'll hold it to the wind to and see how long it lasts
So if you're ever feelin' down
'Cause she's the girl all the bad guys want There she goes again
My bright and brilliant spy
All the people life lurking in dominions of a hot Turk dish
Covered in skin, and not all of it you can see
I hope you can find the time
And he sees the children
I said I'm glad I have found you and I'm glad we're alive
And they will steal and they will fight
And don't you take this the wrong way
Change is on the cards, but this time it will be hard
Take me home good lord for heavens sake
I'm doing what I really like and getting paid for it
This was so because, because I watched all day
Don't worry, even if things end up a bit
Fight in the playgound, bully each other
We're talkin' 'about my baby
Checking out the latest books about outer space
So don't hold it
Sometimes I wanna cheat, but I don't
Talked out, let's have it talked out
'Cause I was in shooshooshoo, shooshooshoo
One day one woman asked him
And even with the lights out, we'll glow
Ooh, bangbang, prettypretty, bangbang
And stumbling through the street
Everybody's there
Walking free in harmony
But I chose to evolve and got myself from out the gutter
But I'm a prisoner of this moment with you in my arms
She's only one life away
And let come what may
You're so vicious baby
There is a map in my room on the wall of my room
I don't see no ring on these fingers
So with that being said
He doesn't have a thing to say
When I met you, I said my name was Rich
And in the migrant hotels
Happy just to be with you
In love with the electric sound
On a little road barely on the map
So wipe the tears from your eyes
You call this painting
When I wake up in the morning, love
It's really hot and a little bit sour, we're getting your strength to maximum power
To gaze down on the city below
It is the power that you know you got it well
Is your bed made, is your sweater on
And sometimes I wonder where'd that crush high go
Learning to counterfeit their disease
I know that the world is gonna smile again
I'm well within your aim
And if you're feeling me sing it out
I should be lying on that sunsoaked beach with her
Down at the Astoria the scene was changing
I drew them a heart
Well, you know I gotta get out
I run the risk of losing you
Oh, oh, yeah, oh
You won't hear me, still you endear me now, yeah
I don't get angry when my mom smokes pot
Lets you know you're home
But if you do it right it is sublime 
I'll have you time travelin', have your mind babblin'
The princess in her flower bed
Can I bring my friend to tea
The one who gets me there
To blow against the wind
Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day
Ever been to heaven at night to heaven at night
Can you feel it
I've got a feeder for you to perch on
All bananas make a split so do many more
So I thought I'd let you know
You'll always be my friend,
I saw a light at the end of the tunnel
The next thing I remember, I am walking down the street 
I'm only shy, here, when I want to be, my head between my cypress knees
When the papa found out, he began to shout
The call to arms you likened to a whisper
Even though they look tasteful
I wanna go there and never come back home, yeah
He turned to squeeze the lemon juice to rain
No more stripping in bars
I'll be the phonograph that plays your favorite
Let me take you on an escapade, let's go
And I hope you enjoyed it,
I'm on the rocky road
You can sit around and wait for the phone to ring At the end of the line
We give them the games we play, she said
Ain'tcha got no rhymes for me
So shake it, shake it
I love, I love, in the rain, oh, oh, oh
Starlight, can you give me the fame Star light
I gotta stop sipping on the sweet nectar
There's no one here to care
You simply seemed to take your place
Could make things matter that much
Well I'm sick of vanity plays
We got everything you need
See those tears clear as we separate
While you sleep in you car
And I don't breathe
Throw me a lifeline
Because a sun burns what I needed
th grade I think, feels like yesterday
These walls don't talk,
You look like a girl from Abercrombie and Fitch
I feel love, honestly
And we were drunk as shit
You are so good for me Just how I wanna be baby
Said pretend it's whales
One ocean to another
It's just a dream he keeps having ooh
Ablaze with wondrous things
Do it for the teenagers and do it for your mom
I need you like the dragonfly's wings need the wind
Cause broken legs can be replaced 
Can I tell you that you are the purple in me
Express yourself, come on,
Life indeed can be fun,
Pack up let's fly away
ih hih ih hih ih Yitho omanqoba ih hih ih hih ih
And feel those radio waves flow
There has been no one brighter than you
Sing, sing along, along any song you want to
Yeah it's something in you always ask for someone real
So have a nice day
Keep fishin' if you feel it's true
Sometimes it's painful in the light of the truth
As many fits into an army tent
As I look out
Hired a construction crew 'cause it's hell on the engine
In the middle of a shave I call your name
To everybody
On the street
Twist and shout my way out
Thrown down your ladder, make a room for me
Baby, please don't go to far
Can always get me cryin'
Nothing after that but you and me
Mystical forces are circling me, while perfect nostalgia is dating the enemy
Before I lose control
Rise over the Bering Strait
To habits that we think suck
I thought about my space, and I really got me down Got me down
And I only hope that he has faith in me
How I feel
Running around like a clown on purpose
It's a perfect day for kiss and swell
Daddy, I'm coming home
The last three years of wondering what I should do
When will I get my chance to make the lilacs bloom
Patient, loving, knowing you'd reach it
This June Erica and myself are gonna have a little baby
Like everything happens for a reason
Singing when you feel alone
I dreamed that you were on a train
That's why I'm asking you to wait, wait for me
You did this to me
I lie in my bed, totally still
Will I always be denied, I thought about it last night
Let her talk like me
Todo lo que todo lo que todo lo que sé repeated til end
You'll be the song of the last bird calling
Boy, you got me feeling so good
Have shattered its own pride
A way through all these damn street signs
But we're so happy
And tonight I have to leave it
And the way she said, "You missed a spot over there", ehhere ehhere spot over there
I'd choose this moment with you in my arms
Leave the cauliflower in the casserole today
But nobody knows the way
Ba do dah
One photo's worth a hundred grand
But I never loved no one the way that I love you
What Ifs hot on my trail
You Don't Say, These currents are still killing me
It didn't make me feel like shit
Nette Skelette wirken vital wenn sich dich holen
But until that day that we depart
Well it ain't about the money
I don't care 'cause I'm by myself
Is in dire need
Won't you be my head, and I'll be yours
And ease my mind
It's just like a funeral
You know me,
I got a Nikon camera
Don't look at me
You're looking at me unsure
Fills a void rewinding me
Well I saw fireworks from the freeway 
When I got up all the blood to my head
I know it sounds like the same old line
Not even once did you start to make sense to me
Sing along with us, deedee deedee dee
In a tiny, tiny southern Swedish country town
'Cause you're bad, bad news
Whenever you're around, yeah
All I can remember was the brake lights flashing,
I would babe sing 
And I'm really gonna spend it right
Just hiding from daylight, watching TV
You keep all your money in a big brown bag
The irony is they won't speak with me
I sit and wonder what it would be like if I'd never went away
Move to the city,
Into tiny parcels are you hoping it's tense, girl
You've gotta let the water drain in
The town is yours to take
And now he's someone else
I see the fur ground
Lightning, rain pouring down
It's standing in the light now 
When I was younger
A one way ticket to Mars
Just let my do my thing
Standing on sound
So do you want to go to the plage with me
Something new, than what we've got here
And let's just get right
And I'm on a roll so don't you be late
Come and get it if you really want it
And were winding up straight in your sneakers
I almost dropped out to move to LA
But I got you, baby
In the same city
I've got a cure for your crimes
Got to find a reason why my money's all gone
She puts her in her arms
So I will stay and clean the mess they left behind
Bangbang, bangbang
All the ways you devastate me
To the ballots and their brides
To lose my way but let me say
Remember when it rained all day
And feel it for a minute, babe
Now I wonder if I've been doing something wrong
And every evening when he gets home
Wild and free, you've got no place to be
So alone all the time and I lock myself away
Ooh Our friends all say goodbye
Lately you've been tanned
I'll tell you how to do it my way
You cross your heart and hope to die
Good, good, good, all right now
But I feel we won the lottery, that day
Looked at the pad and pen, fell, and jotted what I feel
She can finally be the person she wanted to be
I need you now at long last
He said, "Nas what the fans want is Illmatic, Stillmatic"
Oh home, let me come home
Leave the dead starlet on her pedestal
It's been fun but now I've got to go
It's at some motherfucking disco 
She said, "Be my photo bitch and I'll make you rich"
Got a few tears to dry
Should we make believe you remember me from a holiday delayed by a storm
There's a feeling that's come over me
You run around
I like girls that wear Abercrombie and Fitch
But when I lean in you just turn your head away
Summer's gone and it left me with a sunburn
See the moon alone
I danced to all your fucking soul
I, I, I like my beats fast
Long bird, short road
Yeah I was just following a Friday
C'mon girls this isn't funny
Losing her lover
I almost wish you would have loved me, too
Oh why For me I'm always waiting in shadows
Sink a fortune
Oh things are gonna happen naturally
I never knew where I belonged
What do you see when you turn out the light
We knocked another couple back
Track the beating with a chart
Well II, I wanna be your lover
"I like the nightlife, baby"
Oh I want to learn such simple things
With some rolypoly, little batfaced girl
'Cause I know we can make it if we try
Nothing could be further from the truth
If I had the chance I would show him all I am
To all the other boys caught in your bleach job hair
And let me know that you're mine let me know you're mine, ooh
Just remember
But all I saw was twenty miles of wilderness so I went
To find us a kingdom
Drinking champagne in it
I've been hoping your moping around the street again 
Man it was a miracle that nobody died
But we could be safer just for one day
If I buy those jeans I can look like Kate Moss
Now everybody wants to go to California
I've looked in the mirror
Do you wish upon a star
And there's nothing I can do
I let in the light
Breaking hearts to make the papers
I started thinking of you
And we are broken
The only thing I feel is pain
That flew right out from his hands
I know that God shines his light on me
Dark times Gotta let it go because I got my stash
I know the sound, of your heart
The pockets in the air
I love you so, baby, love me the most, baby
Doling out the garland to five 
And that twinkle in your eye
And it's hot and
Run a lot, do a lot, never be lazy boy
And showed me how to be a bigger man, dad
When I looked like a mess
It doesn't cost any money
I got my own brand of company
Taking heed for everyone
Home is where the heart is
Oh but baby you can turn it round
I'm gonna be the man who wakes up next to you
The world can be yours if you let your heart 
Over ten years have gone by
The solemn warmth you feel inside
Was the place to go
And the taste of sex couldn't be too soon
These are wild, wild, wild days we live in
Rollin' on, strollin' on
The wild night is calling
'Cause they'd fill the open air
So what if your friends think I'm crazy, well
The violence grows and it's designed,
Me hiding me head in the sand
Get your oars back in the water, kid
Gonna knock you 'round the head
But there's no number to call
Don't worry about a thing
Allure saw, never let you go
Ah my chest it beating proud
Were in love
There's no body next to mine to ooh
You're a parttime lover and a full time friend
And if you say goodbye 
Whether I'm right or wrong, I know that you're gone, I know ya feel me feel me
Book to shelf, and foot to shoe
Got my eyes, I got my nose
But it feels okay
So count the days till you give in
That would be my two feet
It's looking more blue than it is green
Mom and daddy says Sleep a lot, eat a lot, brush 'em like crazy
Lonesome and forsaken with no gratitude
And I hope you'll miss me too
An old maroon hot air balloon
In the middle of a shave
I got a man to stick it out
that was seen shooting from the window of your room, 
We would dance in your apartment
Got to love, got to love
With our grill in disguise, we've got more lives than I
It caused a mudslide on the banks of the operator
Cocktails and moonlit nights
The sooner you leave the sooner you're home
But I know, I know
Now I gots the balloons,
You know that it doesn't matter as long as we got each other
Friends laugh together, Ha Ha Ha Ha
Tell them I'm doing great;
I can see it clear as day
There's something in her face
Why don't you see it's beaming in the sunshine
And I've become just like a terrible mess
This song itself is living proof
Hommage à Venice
Cruising down the highway with my friends, top down
I'm just a little girl lost in the moment
You got no fear of the underdog,
I'm all dressed up in your words today
Did my heart break enough Break enough
But baby I don't need any of them
One wrong move and we're through
We're going to the country
And letting love blaze like, fire
Sleep a lot, eat a lot, brush 'em like crazy
This escapee was never gonna stay
In the smile of the child staring at the TV screen
I'm a wreck, I know
When the first cup of coffee tastes like washing up
While the birds were still singing 
Well, I've been dreaming ever since I've seen your heaven when you came my way
Now how am I supposed to know
A million miles from here where no one's ever been
So I'm stuck here watching TV
I want to be alone for a while
The prophets and their pawns have had another success
Know that I been waiting for so long
I know it sucks that daddy's done but try to think of what you want
I wish she'd let me be 
Girl you're out of your mind, you're my partner in crime
I can read you, you're my favourite book
Don't need computer or TV,
Your dad was silent, his eyes were fixed on what was on TV
Waving your powers around, the sun eclipse behind the cloud
Tell 'em violence has taken the wind out of my sail
I'm back, back in the New York Groove 
So bang your head against the wall
Do you want to make me sweeter
Give me what I need a
We'll keep on moving anyway
'Cause you might get run over and you might get shot
They call me her
But if you find it, and if you touch it
'Cause they need a new song
A walk on hayes
Said you hate the way they scrape their brakes all over town
This is a repetition of words, dancing needs a
Is there a hand to take hold of the scene
Because I'm afraid to try
'Cause it's all we hold on to
I was wrong about Bobby, I admit
Some kind of mysterious
Of many sons, many sons
Crowded floors and sleepless nights,
You gave me love then took it away
Making it useless
Then we'll take a long walk through the cornfield 
See the world unshown
If she wants me, yeah
Will you get over it this time
We can make the time stand still
Just because they can doesn't make it all right
The solar flares burned my arms 
Go on wasting my time
I believe in the faith that grows
Is a map of the world
I've been limping from tunnels since my original sin
Tell me, is it only me, do you feel the same
And the leaves on the trees they all call out your name
And in the sea there is a fish
And maybe when the night comes
My words get lost in the morning heat 
There's gonna come a time when she's gonna have to go
I, oh well I could live in this town
Vous connaissez mon jeu par cœur
It's mama calling my name
Knows no lines
I once used to be your girl
And honestly my phone's blowing up tonight
The ringmaster's Telecaster sings on an empty stage
My mind turns to a different point of view
The singalong songs will be our scriptures
I would give my life to make it okay, yeah
The minute that I saw your face
Standing solo in the sun
Give it to me baby don't you dare lose it
Don't come back anytime
That the one who falls from grace
Let's go around town
Just wait and see we might be made for this
And I know shine so lightly, so clearly blue
I'm never gonna stop the rain by complaining
Goddamn Europeans
The crust of the tan man imbibed by the sand
Now I'm lost in a daydream
Of anything at all
And then in a year or maybe not quite
Take a bite of my heart tonight
Will you find another boy to go and kiss and tell
Only happened in your mind
'Cause I need more time
Under cover stayin' dry and warm
I will let you be
Her moods are swinging on the swingset almost everyday
We might not have any money 
Come summertime, we're all the same age here
Kiss me here, touch me there, hanky panky
I told you I can't listen, baby, about the th time you were a lady, 
Just sit back and hold on, but hold on tight
And you'll feel better
Leaving him alone in the broad daylight
Nothing's on the television, on the networks
And it's not so pleasant after all, hey hey
But you did, and you fell, hard on the ground
Are shouting up through cracks in the pavement
You got everybody acting crazy
The beat goes on
She's out of my hands
I guess you had to be with me
Don't look back to that messedup scene
Hey I keep my head down but I keep on swingin'
Leave the grey macaw in his covered cage
Love don't come so easily
My parents got divorced
But the meteor men beg to differ
The person I knew I didn't really know
We are not what you think we are
Makes you feel like up and running 
And you're really gettin' all you gave
I think how burt sunzanka made me drink
So sing while you have time
Broad daylight
This is all pure fiction, you know that's right
Ooh, ooh, yeah
And so I stayed up all night 
Revolver's been turned over
You're my heaven, you're my spaceman in your shiny shiny suit
A pie in the face for being a sleepy bull toad
Saw you standin' there with a smile
Only thing that I can do is hold it in, hold it in
When I'm all steamed up
Meanwhile it's getting late at ten o'clock
I see your name on the walls again,
I wanna go back to the way it was
I got a selfdestructo bust 
Soon you will see how life itself 
I can get a record player, and a generator
I keep seeing this picture of you
But maybe, I'm ready, I'm falling into you
Don't want to be spun around
It becomes a progression I won't let regret manifest
Look at me now, I'm falling
Now this romantic duel is into the streets, bon appetit, you've eaten me alive
I'm happy if you're happy but it breaks my heart,
Travel the seaside Michigan
There's something about you and you don't even know it
And I will love your heart with mine, with mine
All of the babies they can feel the world
And I know that I'm never alone
Celebrity minds, they're humbly taken by surprise
Making love in the afternoon
I'm liking this American Boy, American boy
I believe we'll be fine
I'm singin' and dancing in the rain
This boy's life among the electrical lights
Feel like it don't make sense
I'm infatuated by your moves
Buzzin' in my head
Es ist egal, was du fährst
All the wind blows and the angels sing
I'll change it to white 
Hah my girl is a queen
I like to watch them play
So put me in a cage and lock me away
If we come, come together
In his dad's closet with a box of fun things
Why won't you wrap your life around
You're not homecoming king
So take a breath and calm down
And feel for a minute
Always let it get to my head
And with you, you, you 
Lying on the bed
Music is where I meet my friends
What's the point in going 'round
What we're doin' when a fatboy's slippin'
It's gonna be all right
Chasing the rabbit
But not so cool man if you care
Just don't lose what you know
The love that is left turns quickly to hate
I'll be here after midnight, wearing my beliquent frown
Real sugar, that's what I want and what I need
Shake it, shake it
But there is no chance I'm going to do it again
Heyo hey we are the second, you're minutes behind
On cracks and close my eyes
Well all those times they come and go
Still you want me all the time
The empty promise makers said, here it comes
You said, "Blackie's dead Blackie's dead," and then run the other way
Spray painted bricks and dead firewood
And they don't know why
Junk of the heart, there's junk in my mind
Burnt down to the ground
It's been done before
Cause you are the only one I love
On things we never said
You better get yourself together
And I can't hold what's in my hand
It was in a dream, it was in a dream
And you put my feet back on the ground
And lose it with your static
A thousand years go by
Don't tell me 'cause you think I don't know shit about the way you feel
Now words can never make up for what you do
That touches you and takes you far from faith
Found your bottle, found your heart
That's the way it seemed
Just turn around
'Cause I'm wearing my brand new shoes
Wigwam frightened of the dark
Is taking my hand and we're walking and talking
A world where fear will always win
I want you here with me forever
On the hook, so toss me over and cast the line we'll all try
Let me assure you, friend
Hanging on to the one you love
And then Cathy showed up and we hung out
Just when you get on a roll
In Camden road in a second floor flat with
And I'll be stranded out at sea
Just relax and greener grass will grow here for a change
And you know I don't exaggerate
And round, around, around, around, around, around
All right in a sort of a limited way
And I heard the jungle breathing in the bamboo
When I wiped the tears from my eyes
I used to change my style like I changed my mind
Someone who needs me Oh, I'm in love baby
Sara spelled without an 'h' was getting bored
I'm stuck in the crossfire
Try and test that, you're bound to get served
Voila mon passport
Love will fall around my door
But if I told you the truth
Maybe you will look into my eyes
Paint a picture with my hands 
I wanna be someone new,
I'm gonna be round my vegetables
Girl, I say, if only life would lean our way,
I died and was reborn again today
It's your life, it's your world
She said I can be a monkey, I can be a tiger
And we'll stay here until someone falls in their own snare,
Be the fool, I don't know where the sunbeams end and the starlights begin, it's all a mystery
So time be a river rolling into nowhere
You look like the songs, oh oh oh oh
Deep down inside we wanna believe they still do 
The one who let you down
Please don't lose hold of me out there
Throw my hands up to the sky, let the music take me
Never knowing what you'll find
andahalf years old
Would you become my queen
'Cause some other time is right around the clock 
Never thought I'd have an admirer from overseas
You're breaking into separate parts
You got it
Laughing and a running, hey hey hey
Get that, get that get that get that get that get that get that get that get that
Than tonight
Coming clear beneath the clouds
Leave the whimpering dog in his cold kennel
Ah, Ringo good evening, Ringo
And as the doors fly open even the promoter smiles
We say
'Cause I'm better off never knowing
Really nothing to feel bad about
With roses round the door
Covenant with the imitation
Listen to Iron Maiden, baby, with me
Someday I'm gonna draw from the left side of my brain
Lucked out, found my favorite record
Now I see the vision through your eyes
To put your troubles aside
Oh come on and love it 
Big wave
At playtime we will throw the ball
Un p'tit air et le jour
And now I'm wondering what is fake and what is real
But it's a different tune that's stuck in my head
It's been a year or more since they shipped me to this foreign shore
The sun is getting dim
And I thank the sun for shining your light
I must admit it took a while
I take it out on my good friends
Well, look at the kid from school
Or the grace of your eyes that can see good in me
Coming Oh it's coming around again
Crazy in love
I know you think you're oh so clever,
I'll never get to share another cup of tea with you
Ask me what I did with my life 
This love I pray that I can keep
Holding the flowers he picked from the ridge
I've been trapped by love
I got, I got, I got, I got
Some color on monochrome
I'm a gallery of broken hearts
And nothing's going to bring me down
I said, sucking too hard on your lollipop
It's only one more day
There's got to be something else
Twisting, turning bodies burning look up from where they lie
He is a fool to assume, you'd spare a thought
So goes the backing track of all the sighs we'd ever sighed
But as the words are leaving his lips
That girl's my life, I tell ya
Will you break and take all the worlds from my mouth
And I've been climbing ladders through time 
I see forest, a treasure chest full of labyrinth
A speech to please the poles
But you'll turn into something
But the press let the story leak
But being myself is something I do well
When I was two and a half,
Soft kiss and wine what a pretty friend of mine
At least be confused about right and wrong,
And now I see you perfectly behind closed eyes
The changes that come when
Once I get up I feel better
Come and stroke the air
I was in love with the place
And I've been shamed with no words to find
You can love
You really know how to dance
But I've also had the feeling Yes
And get me home for tea 
Says she lives for me
Something of an anomaly
"Death campaigns are a fucking gold mine"
Oh, yeah
Till the next show in the next town
You could be waiting for your life to begin
Nobody nobody nobody will ever know her longing
I know I have given you hell
My mind takes me back there, oh, so quick
Send me on my way
I ain't gonna live that way
Showed me how to love again
You don't see me fly into the red  one more you're nuts
I believe the world is burning to the ground
Attractive day in the rubble of the night from before
'Cause they are free of thoughts unpure
Cheers to the the nerve it takes to forget who we are
Cars have run on gasoline
For a chance to dance with stars
And if love is just a game then how come it's no fun
Hey, Alabama, Mississippi, come and ride wit' a G
Than I've ever been lifted before
Hollywood blues
When your word comes up
What are you doing now
I heard he wrote you a song
You can keep it inside
And when it's blue it means you should call her up immediately
Moving forward using all my breath
An open tab when your judgment's on the brink
On my head the water pours
Gotta let me in, hey, hey, hey
We'll spend some time forever
I remember those two letters
You said, "Look at me", and looked away
And on the subway
I've got time to spare so
Who opens the gates to this unruly garden
It's haunting every breath we take
Teenage dreams in a teenage circus
You say goodbye and I say hello
And I want something else to get me through this life, baby
They have the nerve to let their weapon shine
Don't say hold on 
I got your days I got your days
Behind my back, you're supposed to be a friend
My feet were lead
Imagine if the friend that you thought you knew wasn't really true
I remember thinkin'
Baby says she's mine, you know
The beautiful ones are always crazy 
No sweet melody the sound of spit
I just have to look at you
Won't you give me some, baby
Boredom murders the heart of our age while sanguinary creeps take the stage
If the melody's timeless it won't let you down
And I know I should be home
They beat themselves on the backs with chains
He is the coolest dad in dad school
I wish you were here my dear Yoko
Don't know if I can
A roller coaster ride
Bombs outside, such a small forest laughing at me
The colors of the evening stars
With the burning flesh of men
Wear my shoes
Down your way
There may come a day
Oh, I, I swear the world better prepare
Silver hammer man
But I have, I just hate the band
Maybe we should just stay friends
The rumble of your water would be my call
Sa fete med micken backsimoodsbrad
We'll be waiting some are praying
Whatcha waiting, whatcha waiting for
Are the words that grew to hit my spots
And all the people on the island they already know why they sing
You've bought yourself a second chance
I won't let sorrow hurt me
'Cause I just can't wait till you write me you're coming around
Hey girl, you've got a smart way
I'm walking on sunshine, whoa
Cute in a stupid ass way
I'll say okay if you insist
Under the powers of an evil doctor rocket science monster with capabilities to destroy the entire universe
Ooh yeah
To the actual size of everything
Hanginaround this town on the corner
I've gotta take in the starlight before it disappears
That your love, that your love can heal
While the lights are out
My shell may suddenly burst out will come birds
Desmond says to Molly, "Girl, I like your face"
'Cause I broke the skies that shined above
Clap along if you know what happiness is to you
Last night I met a new girl in the neighborhood, whoa yeah
Leave the paperwork for other days, just go
We'll come again 
You better watch out Cupid
So old that it feels like it is ending
Get a strange look from a girl who looked uptight
And the only thing constant was the constant reminder they'd never change
And in this crazy life
Fell deep in love, but now we ain't speakin'
She loves to weave them in her hair
Lord knows that I got mic control
Just let it go, don't let it bring you down now
Well he used to be somebody
People say men are just like kids
She goes to the mirror to put on her stuff
All the sentimental memories you own
With green removed
I don't care if Monday's black
If love is just a game how come I've never won
We need a holiday
It cannot wait, I'm yours
Watch out for flying glass
I took the bus to streets that I could walk down
Yeah, sing it 'cause we're all
Sip after sip, yeah I swear I can feel it
All of your love,
Dance, yeah
I keep feeling the lights
Your mother should know knoow
Dwelling in this happiness, your gift of purity
And everything in between
Don't worry, be happy
Making love to you was never second best
We'll take you apart, we'll swallow the ocean
Some chimps who love cats
Mood ring, oh mood ring
I tried to be chill but you're so hot that I melted
What's the matter matter
What do you know This house is falling apart
Goodness gracious I can't seem to stop
'Cause they're just girls breaking hearts,
In tha sixhundred, blunted, wit' a pocket full of hundred's and Visa's
And send you reelin' where your love can't hide
I grabbed some frozen strawberries so I could ice your bruising knees
I'm holdin' her down, holdin' her down
How I hope that you're happy
And me I gots the snail,
With fear and fascination on what was here
I want the world to see you be with me
Don't ever want to pay for anything anymore, boy
Pig out and dream a new
I'm dreaming of sleeping next to you
Someday we'll meet beyond the land that you call miles away
I did once before, but this is pretty bad
Waiting for another to come inside
But Miss Black Eyeliner, You'd look finer, with each day in hiding, oh yeah
A chimp in black, like a goth
Work all day all night tryin' to get fly
Does it mean you're good at putting things on paper
Please don't lose your faith in me
Hey, there's nothing on earth that can save us
Seven days of torture, seven days of bitter
No sleep, no chance, no need forget about it
Put a penny in the slot and make an artificial light shine
It's gonna hit you with a big wave
Huarache sandals too
But my birdheart's turning cold
Try to take the easy way out
Gonna try, try, try 'til the morning
Maryanne, do you remember 
Doesn't really count with your panties on
I cccan't control the feet
'Cause I don't care if I ever talk to you again
Hey lover, do you remember when
Neither will move till it's over
C'mon baby
I hope that someday I'll see without these frames
If you come down we'll go to town
So I just lay back and laugh at the sun
When I saw the reflection in the mirror
We replay it in the back of our minds
From your lips, a precipice 
And maybe I'll come back for you
And it's sunning, we're still running
And I needed you to happen, yeah
How can a body contain something so great
And I know I
But I remember all the times and all the words we said
I check my head, it's getting tighter
There's nothing threatening controlling me
Maybe I'll never die, I'll just keep growing younger with you, and you'll grow younger, too
When I come home When I come home, oh, I know I'm gonna be
Then you get high 
Now some people ride the cat when asleep or when awake,
On the leaves of a banyan tree
You want to put your trust in some solid thing
Where would I be without you
'Cause you're as old as you feel you are
And there are little more than pictures of how I see you in an Xray machine
I can't see the landscape
Don't tell me baby you gotta go
And I love you sounds fake
Spend a lazy Sunday in my arms
Everything within my hands
Ah, so mundane and incomplete
I got nothing to do
And I won't say a word of its true if it's not true
To the remains of the ChairoPlanes
Only nothing's for free
From a book of old psalms
The little target cutie
When I fall in love
Me, I ride the wave of never gonna drown,
It don't make me feel bad that we're still friends
All my loving I will send to you
Making me believe it
Better hope I don't blink
You're lookin' at me positivity
The weekend we were in love
I know tomorrow you'll find better things
Lying like a flower with no more time
I'm glad that you are waiting with me
I've been heading home
I tried to do headstands for you
I said, Hey, I put some new shoes on, and everybody's smiling
Ride wit' a G, come and ride wit' a G
And I shouldn't have wasted those days
A sign that I've been caught
Suddenly came the dawn from the night, suddenly I was born into light
In the streetlight dawn
Now we're stayin' alive
My time will fade away
You I see Will see my dream Your dream for real Come true
Waiting for nothing but our beating hearts, going far
Do you feel alive
I'm just comin' here to come down
But with your little, middle, index and ring fingers
Hello, mister
I love with caution and trust, alone
Which tagged me a naïve son
The wind it has no pattern,
So I call your name, cross my fingers
Dragons have been bled
'Cause I know you're the only one
You're every word
It's growing silently to be a life
I let it wet my lips
Momma turned her back on me
There's so much beauty it could make you cry
I can't be bothered to get you alone in this world
And now she flies alone
Cause you forgot
Reality is a lovely place
All by myself, waking up at twelve I'm my clothes again
Don't try and tell me you've been thinking of us
Shake and wiggle to a hip hop song
But once you turn the car none of that shit even matter
How it all comes to an end only to begin again 
Please don't make me face my generation alone
And leaving me with more than I want
May as well polaroid her with the way I stare
Is raining from the sky
In my mind sayin', "it's gonna be all right"
You're my picture on the wall
I won't put white into your hair
All crop tops and testosterone passion
My ears fill with the sound of your arching
Any sex is personal
Should we pretend that it's the end
I missed the ark but I could've sworn you'd wait for me
It's a long open road
Everybody's in a play
I lost my edge on things when I lost my head
I've gotta get you out of my head  get out
Guten morgen, guten morgen, good morning Hey
But my guitar is out of tune
I put the needle on the record and play that song again
And it's so funny, so funny to see
Says he don't care anymore
It was the middle of summer in Texas
All my life, I've been waiting
The sky move, the ocean shimmer
Until you know how it feels to die
You won't hear me, still you endear me now
Sing me to sleep tonight and awake
And last, but not, least grant somebody their last wish
But hearts break and hells a place that everyone knows
When we touch I get a
Whoa, whoa, yeah, yeah
I prefer to give the inhabitants a say the inhabitants a say
North of the river all the streets are the same
These tricks that I'll attempt will blow your mind
In an aeroplane high above the place
Saturday morning
I love
Tropical drink melting in your hand
Waking up to the green of your eyes
So your ex's got a mansion, where you kick it on the hill
And all the mailboxes have been emptied
If you know it sing it out
Well, it seems like she can be anything
And there are those we know who'd have us five miles off the track
The goddess really smiled upon our love dear Yoko
And waiting for some high times to come again
You can give me a call whenever you like to
He's mine
Will decant the excess salt from the sea 
Racist dreams
You slept better in a sleeping train in a shed in a station
Now in the dirt where I put my feet, and in the trunk of my body
When I get in from my work
And you won't make a sound or be nervous around piles of pictures
And if by castle ship should stray
I'd pay to visit you on rainy Sundays
It just isn't the same on radio 
Unless I was aboard a jet plane
Let it always be this way
After all we go through the endless crime
I take a driving pill and head to my car
Ruby red slippers and a bunch of trees
We won't stop until somebody calls the cops
And no, this won't be a sad song
What a ride
I'm a little out of tune
If wishes were trees, the trees would be falling
Even if things get heavy, we'll all float on alright
I'll believe when I see the view
Guess I lose but life goes on
Whoaoaoooh
If you listen to your words, he might like what you say
From a tree
You blow a fuse, zing, boom
Baby, baby, baby,
But green is blue, and so are you, 
Getting nowhere, sleeping somewhere 
She fell in love with another
The life pulls in all direction
You just say those words, and we'll beat those birds
I swear I love you
The dance of the cosmos shows, as above, so below
But they read none of the part in the hallmark card where they read about the dreams
I've seen a lot of joy and I've seen a lot of pain
Oh, I'm having so much fun
Right back at ya, it's the world's most talented record label
The sounds of bells are ringing out
I ain't playing games
Then I look at you
From now on fly as high as I want
So the room must listen to me
Sometimes he forgets that you're even there
Wanna get a lick of this lovin'
Are you quick to kiss
But it's alright now
We shared a cigarette somewhere
One look and I yelled "timber"
Singing, someday it'll bring me back to you, yeah
And take on hippie names, I'd be Snowphish, you'd be Sunny
That you and I will walk together again
Says it's gonna heal it but, you won't make the call
Well, it's all right all right, we're going to the end of the line
Time to think of something new
To finally talk to a girl a little cooler than me
Was there anything else
oh the silver bridge wearing nothing but a onesie and a veil      
You're alone, alone to stay
My phone number, the way I dance
Better than fine
I thought, "I'll just step aside and that the time would prove you wrong"
The stakes are high, the water's rough
This city, is sitting
Jealousy lay all your spells to bed
I got my personal health to deal with
What part of no
Maxwell stands alone 
Without your love, I'd be nowhere at all
You said if you're never coming back you have to go
And so we cannot know ourselves or what we'd really do 
And when tomorrow's too much
And on our hands, our wrinkles understand we never really wanted more
As I attempt to unravel the web by traversing and rehearsing and perversing along the doubtladen extension chord thread of my life
Where did you go now
I change it all the time
When it was back in the day, back when things were way different
She's got a heart that will never melt
In the basement of words we knew, there were more of us
And on his journey and his travels on the way
And I got a different angle like a parallelogram
To take a second look
Hits her over the head, doesn't care if she's dead
Lookin' at the sky Wonderin' if there's clouds and stuff in hell
But now you got to make it on your own
And you're my girl I like your style just imagine all the time we could kill
I'd wait all night
As you know, I've never been a confident man
Watch your step
Any way you've got to
He's a Spanish fly who bucks like a stallion
So I just did me some talking to the sun
Didn't get nowhere, switched up diet
Looking back, you shouldn't have fought it
You know we all sometimes, say things we don't mean
You know what I'm sayin', you know how it go
It's gonna be all right ah huh yeah
I feel alive, I feel the love, I feel the love that's really real
I won't forget to lock the door
And I keep on forgetting myself where did you go
Now the record always spins on the trails we blaze
Nothing but gospel in my mind
Everybody gonna stamp their feet
So I go driving all around and I'm denying all the sounds that hit my ear
She got to know his mind intimately,
'Cause I think this whole life is just overrated
Under lamp light glow
Your sweet moonbeam
Coming towards her, stuck still, no turning back
And it feels so down
She's been living in her white bread world oh
We want to give you the bbbeat beat back
'Cause every other song's telling me that this time is about our love
I have done all I can do in this town
It's not the same honey, with you not around
I'll end up far so far away
oh the silver bridge wearing nothing but a onesie and a veil
You whisper half thoughts to me
Don't need a watch to waste your time, oh no, oh no
And lifeless and black
That right now is all that matters
I need you to be here with me
I might be accustomed to walk
Everything you know
It's crooked on the sides
Everybody's gone surfin'
And we'll play helicopter in the sand
My My Time Flies Four guys across Abbey Road
Things that we did
A pair of frozen hands to hold,
That was my old man and he said
I wouldn't be offended
Where you will sit and contemplate your day
Arriving at the door
His inability to hold an erection on high holy days
And as he speaks his last line, a thought falls from his mind, and I pick it up right through the TV
What has it changed for you
Every hello is goodbye
She said don't I know you 
What do I do when my love is away
Yeah that's where mine go
And you are the dreamer, and we are the dream
You gotta stop sipping on the sweet nectar of your memories"
When the walls begin to creep in
Together, like we were something more
Of doubt in my mind
And asked what the damage was
Never saw a kid behave like this
Sometimes you're quiet and sometimes I'm quiet, Hallelujah
I'm sure you always knew what you had to do
Before the day begins make it on over now
'Cause now you got me missing you
It's a comforting feeling
But I was crazy about you then and now
Steady my heart, it's beating faster
Throw your hands to the sky like your flying
Running around before it corners you
It's in your head it might look grenner
I thumb through the pictures
Let's turn on each other
'Cause I thought I'd be living my dream
A small boy from a poor house
For my love vibration
All seemed to vanish into thin air
It's okay, as long as I got you, baby 
Did it break enough Break enough
C'est ci, baby
I got to find me a way to flow
Then we've got nothing to lose
Where the light bends at the cracks
Our cup overflows
Cause all they say is kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss
Where all the constellations shine to pave the way
I loved you from the moment I saw you
It's getting cold, I'll catch the bus
And for some reason I think that I attributed this story
Hold on, hold on
In the shade, there's still warmin'
Baby let's blast off
Hey, remember that time when my favorite colors was
We should know better I made a pilgrimage to save this human's race
Always my first choice
His back it might brake
A song about
Their jewlry is thrown into the air
No shit, I was cool, I had plenty fun
All you guards that I got out past
The happy hooded bluebells bow
Well you know we all sometimes, say things we don't mean
To break some fragile backs 
Bababass, bass down low
It's a little too late 'cause I'm already gone
Don't mind all my friends, I know they're all crazy,
All rejoice is all we are when in her hands
I've got songs in my blood
Yeah, that's where mine go
I think that this might be the day to 
Standing there with your smile blinding your eyes from seeing
In suspended animation, we ain't tryin' to go nowhere
I suppose that's just the way the cookie crumbles
At your Christmas party, I hold your hair when you vomit
I've done everything I can
I flow some round in my bedroom turn around see myself in the mirror
All mine
Das wird dir gut tun
And I probably forgot to tell you this 
Come next in the logic's line
I'll be there waiting right behind
Wheeling, dealing, joking things will change, girl
I say, we can go where we want to
San Onofre and Sunset Inside, outside, USA
If you're down with P
My My Time Flies A rap on a rhapsody
Figures fly past through space, faces shine with shattered light 
And the first one tore a picture
I went walking with my mama one day
Brama, am I shallow cause all my clothes designer
Drank the dark wine of the New York night
Sangamon River, it overflowed
Stormy weather is so I do not
When you are away
Step out in front of me baby
Moats and boats, and waterfalls
I'm falling all over myself
I count the days, the Great Frontier
In the summertime when the weather is high
Though I did release you
I've been asleep for a while now
If I go to Gloucester you know I will
Edmonton's just a four night bike ride outta town
Five cold years before I
But I tore it all up and then I threw it away
All I wanna do is get off
I promise, sugar, I wasn't trying to steal
Yeah we're feeling so good
We make the dirt go flying
It's you and me and were runnin' this town
From this person
Being played on a grand piano
Playing KISS covers, beautiful and stoned
You gotta 
When I'm with you baby, oh
So what if I see the sunshine 
In the most unexpected places
Oh, I really love it here
You're going to have to change
Oh, I'll do anything for you
Martha, my love
But I've been singing all night
That all this shit our President has got us in will go away
Oh, somewhere over the rainbow bluebirds fly
The hills are his in all embrace
I say, hey poppa, hey poppa, close to you
No nothing can change us, no nothing can keep us from falling, from falling
Free the mayhem in your mind, release the need inside of you You're gonna suffer
So much dissing at the side and
Light a candle, curse the glare
With the sound of your world
But I just plan to live the rest of my life
I have gotta save my baby from a mess this world has made
Hey, remember that month when I only ate
'Cause you're bringing me in
Even though happiness writes white
Wouldn't it be a lovely headline
Look, I used to cook before I had the game took
That was our fifth song,
I am glowing from within
You can cough in his face
But where have you gone, where have you gone, I'll never know
Wherever I lay my head
Opinions were like kittens, I was giving 'em away
The courage to let them down is something I've still got
Oh, please believe I said
How could you forget what we had,
In our bed
Give me your heart and I'll love you till Tuesday
Listened when you talked, dad
It gives a sign
We've been conditioned 
Grass grows green, could you step away from the screen
I got no ifs ands ors no wits or what's about it
So baby open your mind while I close the door
But that's okay
I'll surrender, 
Uh, and Jon Brion on the keys right now
Like I did for you
And I'm running late
And were there more than  hours in a day
I am riding all alone, I am running all alone
And he asks us what we have done for our souls lately
That would burn away right on cue
I'm lightnin' on my feet
I used to think that I knew the big time
So it's here I stand
You better come back to Earth again
While you're making up stories trying to make it ok,
I wanna know if you'll
And kiss my thighs
And there's a little boy in, her arms
The kind of voices she would soon learn to deny
Neon black whip, war gang hiss;
Faster we'll divide all the sense
You are amazing
His only catch all day
Then the sweetness in the air
Damn diggity dog
Into a torch and hope that it stears you home
We together, I remember
Two sips from the cup of human kindness
It's just because I'm crazy in love
So I missed a million miles of fun
And I don't want to spend my whole life just awaiting for you
So Don't Say, These currents are still killing me
He's not the dumbest angry, young nitwit
Of lonely creatures singing for the summer rain
Oh, yeah, now
And I think that I can get used to that
Hip hip
I've been hit with your charm
Would be its offering 
I see your colours, and I'm dying of thirst
Even if it's just one hour
And all the morning glows anew
Don't bring me down wit'cha baby, no
My words are my faith, to hell with our good name
I could sing about how love is a losing battle
We're shining bright and I want you, I want you to know
I know
Ooh I feel so good tonight
I've been crying for so long
And the inside jukebox roars out just like thunder
Like Billy D said he's feelin' me
She told me about the winds from Santa Ana
I'm in heaven
The next day came but not a beam of light
Form a line to the throne
You calling her a hooker He without sin cast the first stone
Where once was pity
I never knew you
Little footsteps through my sleep and
Mm, yeah
After all this waiting such a big day
Shut the bedroom window in the morning 
But I don't need to go to that spot
She'll never know that I'm the best that she'll never have
Just to cure it 'cause I can't ignore it if it's love love
And the four right chords can make me cry
I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the mirror
I'll meet you tomorrow, sort of late at night
I feel the weight of it all, can't brace myself for the fall
It makes my life complete
With an uptown girl uptown girl
I used to change my accent, change my stance
It's got leather seats
And when I asked her before, she said she's holding it out
And I feel fantastic
And then you're kicking me out again
The walls the walls are coming down, the here and now is coming round
Oh, awake, my lady on the water, share my bread and share my drink
I want you to understand
And singing his songs
Still my life is heaven sent
I couldn't care anymore
Spread your arms and fly
Beat out a pulse on his head
Dadada dundiddle undiddle undiddle uh dada
And I ain't got no season pass
Tell me what you really feel
I feel like I can't take too much longer
I have a love for this world
I try but I can't let go of it
How's it gonna feel until I catch you
Me dicen que paseabas
This rage will lead us through the burning plains
To my wall like Danielsan does
You were working on the inside
So now I'm fallin', fallin' into the sublime
Kinda love you got knock me off my feet
Too all the people underground
And when you come back home
Brush my hair
Just say hello to the ground
Got to find the reason why my money's all gone
I wish that I could break and bend like the world does
And just one thing
Oh I love the curling of your hair
Come on board, it's a curious sight
Meant for someone else but not for me
We all start in the streams
That's right I will show it
Not today no, no
An attic in a basement
And we're back at the end
And I can't hide the tears in my eyes
And feel united oh oh oh x
And I'll really get into it
If you're ever really gunna know
I want to know everything about you
But summer's free
We hit the streets with all we had
And try to look impressed
This world's trying to swallow me
And why I'm breathing in
Run from your cover, run to the other side of your head and I'll stand right by you
But other girls were never quite like this
With his hands clenched tight 
Work it out baby
All things know, all things know
And before evenin' falls I may find myself there too, singin'
Don't you know that I can't live without you, without you
At the spiral with lila
So what do you say hey hey
Is that you on the train
But then I woke from the dream to realize I was alone
With crosswords and Sudoku
Wake up it's a beautiful morning It's a beautiful morning
I can hear music
While working for a common 'cause I only got a kamikaze state of mind
And I'm too scared to pick up the phone
That it won't and it won't because it can't
Come and get it, such a big day come and get it now
I never wanna do you no harm,
The view won't let you down
There's an underwater Ferris wheel where I found the missing link to this island chain
It was pressed on white
Back when my pops was a boy, ya know
I'm a child yeah 
You can hide the money, I'll mark an X,
Ain't got no place to lay your head
Show them what you got, whoa
And my veins keep throbbing when I'm out on display
And I wish that you could give up this game
It's still early morning
Chinesespeaking girlfriend, big brown eyes
Love the way it falls about your face
Of better nights and better days
This life is a beautiful one,
You'll probably tell me everything you think, here it comes
Well, he's just a man
The feelings that I feel when I feel
She'll get what she wants
Get right down to the bottom of the barrel and float back on top
Everybody knows the way the eye goes
When you've got bigger plans that no one else understands
Momadisay momadiyah
Ohoh, ohoh everybody 
But you, obviously, you didn't want to stick around
Doing things, getting better
Every wonder why they kill the weak ones, baby
I need someone to take
Long live rock
If her daddy's rich, take her out for a meal
Ice cream and a bottle of ten dollar wine
Your head was taller than the trees
I sure know what it is like to be alone
Well, open up your mind and see like me
I lie down like a tired dog
Sing it out loud and let yourself free
I was running from the things that you'd say
Somebody told me that nothing is for sure
Through the door, someone says,
Just 'cause watching them copulate is very funny
Lala, how the life goes on
She gave a smile but I was shy and looked down so down
Oh Great Goodman, King of Swingers Given what you lost are you better off
Bandages, bandages have advantages too
We carry the mail
All I know is the wine lasts longer when you don't gotta share it with someone
Glimmering, Glistening, banishing the darkest night
I've got a mild fascination for collectors
And make it known we're on par for the evening
Every night I see you standing on the corner
It's the way I see
Have you ever been to heaven at night
You could be the end of me
Your world can change forever
Would you have them all if there were enough hours in the night
Moonlight sleeping on a midnight lake
That you are the one thing that I've got
Hideaway
Like a satellite or star
And I, I'm never letting you go baby
All the girls I've known are crying ohohoh, ohohoh
When I'm so far away
That's when I'd get knocked down
You get all my lovin'
You do it for the money
Listen to the beat beat beat
Come on let's go get it on
With a girl I dreamed oh yeah 
A deer, a deer, dear, a deer, a deer, my dear
Staying on the turning away
Sweet, sweet fantasy baby
Leave your boy so far from home
You're too wonderful to die
I'm feeling better ever since you know me
It's one way, now on Wythe
From a fountain to a river to the seven seas
And this one thing's sure I made no apologies
I need to know
Why don't you meet me on the dancefloor
How often have you been there
Hold music hold music hold
The gangs are out
Turn on the radio, clean the windows
Oh, kiss me like a final meal
And I've got designs on lighting you up
I got it
My garden's a secret compartment
'Cause when you're worried, your face will frown
You're all about to lie down for your cause
Whispered in my ear the things I'd like
No need to leave
Your girlfriend says you better not,
And umbrella does no good
My brain is burning then I want it all
Oh, next light bust a right
The Earth is heating up, I still want you
Every morning keeps returning at my window
I won't go until you come outside
Down a long road I stumbled
In a different light than I did before
And all that I can see is just another lemontree
You can be the word I, can be the rhyme
The romance is over
To glue her brain and stick it back together
We'll ride on
And I can't understand what I'm after
You took my heart
Finding you, a voice is found on a missing page
And disappear again into a summer's bliss
That just might change your mind
Beneath the shady tree
Is alive and well without you she's said
Ain't nothing in the world like our love dear Yoko
Ready or not, I think I'll give this a shot
Exhale the stress so you don't come unglued
Across the border to a new land,
It feels small but I won't get sad about it
Yeah You'll alway now you got someone
You feel your tree is breaking
Staring at the stars on your ceiling
Nothing seems to fit
Hunting you down Bringing you round
Come on and lead the way
I'm stuck with two
If I lay my head down on you
I'm so happy that I fell in love
Tell everybody I'm on my way
But it's so hard when you're shallow as a shower
Now the house is empty and my folks are gone
I'm known to go a little too fast a little too fast
And there's something
We will never part
Fast lives we're stuck in the undertow
I must admit you smell like fruity nuts and good grains but could you show my purple gaze
But what would Frank Lloyd Wright say
It's not a threat to nobody
To all the punk ass fucks that just want to talk shit
Dress falls down at the aftershow
It seems like years since it's been here
When the fellas, talk to my girl I ain't with it
I had a golden ring
With the wisdom that my father gave me
If I'm wrong makes nothing right about yourself
I want someone to carry me
Sky is grey bit more than ever
And there's a reason for the candle lights
I'm here right beside you
Somebody misses you when you're away
We're always happy
You got me goin' crazy
And buy her a round
Give it time, it's worth the ride
So rent a car or take the bus
You'll never leave me and you know it's true
Do you see me, baby
It's like a picture of a loved one in disguise
We had our mindset
I've come to greet you
Then you should share it round
It's been a while,
A track fiend and the saw dust
I'm kissing your lips and running fingers through your hair
Please say she'll change
And we're all in this together
Das wird dir gut tun
I'll come back for another year
I found a switch
Sorry that you feel that way
Whenever we kiss, I get a feelin' like this
And the feeling's all right
But I fear I'm getting
Maybe a diamond ring
Wanted more Springsteen, Earth, Wind, Fire
Then can we become love's persona
You say stop
The bells are ringing out
You warned us If you came back and we still on the corners,
Strong wind destroy our home
And sometimes wish your room
You'll see it's all a show
I just get better with time
With every step we take, Kyoto to The Bay
Your going to scream along to every song we sing to you
You quiver like a candle on fire
You said I never ever thought that I'd be messing 'round
Taught me how to watch
Joey call me on the phone
Sacrificed his life to bring us both eye to eye
Says he got a big boat but it's just a fairy boat and that makes for a short, short ride
It's been undeniably dear to me, I don't know why
Dressed me up in women's clothes
I don't live in poverty, I got a little bit of money and I've got a healthy body
Never make a pretty woman your wife
Still not workin'  to 
You can't change my perceptions just from dots to dots
And now the trip to the supermarket
So why don't we, sleep all, we sleep all day, sleep all, we sleep all day over and over
Well, then you're friends with me
Couldn't keep your love from me
Sometimes I can be up like that, when I don't cross myself with you
Look at you shaking you can't find his plight
Gonna live like it's the end of the world
I said how tiny we are Girl how tiny we are
The things I do for you
Left with nothing but a picture
Disarmed by your charm,
Nothing new to say
When I was stronger
And you'll make me smile by really getting into the swing 
All the dough you promised your friends
And hear your favorite songs
I'm about to break it down,
I tried to change a tire but I'm not that way inclined
No traces of civilized living eating the earth
What can I do to be happy
I'll take my friends' advice this time
But it was you who cleaned up my messes
Right now masquerade, master the merry go round
The phonebook's been ripped off
Twisting the steering reins
Oh land I can see for miles
Always look on the light side of life
Tell me baby I'm your lover man
I can tell that we are gonna be friends
How's your father, how's your mother 
When we're good and ready
I kiss you on the brain in the shadow of a train
When you're standing on the crossroads
Smile, smile, yeyeah
In your life, expect some trouble
Helps me get over it, over it Helps me get over it, over it
The stars align
Talkin' 'about my baby
And down Doheny Way Inside, outside, USA
We should spend the night in a small hotel like this
Every time her temper flares
Today we show our flaws
Now momma feels guilt, yea momma feels pain
Your nerves gather with the altitude
I have worries to give to the sea
From his head to his toes, by a criminal, but with a sensitive soul, with a set of raccoon eyes
She's all I want and I've waited for so long waited and waited
Because I know this time
But I love you, yes I love you
For nobody but you 
I am too a spirit and a walker
Hey king, what's your first order of business
It's now wonderful to see beautiful views
Said, mamamamamamamamamamamamoney, oh
Every silver lining's got a
I'd ask my friends to come and see
Still I try to be good to you,
See through this point of view
Hey, that's what they say
Where you will look for me
So we're taking you down with the scissor, paper, rock again
But your love, would not care for my love
Tell me that you've got me and you're never gonna leave
Two souls, one heart
When sky cracks open and the thunder comes
Having a good time
You say you've seen seven wonders
On such beautiful days
Don't let the sun catch you cryin'
I'll let you borrow my four leaf clover
So I heard it's no good to run
Don't wave no goodbye
Just follow the day
Cause something was lost then
No happy ending
Too far from the floor this time
Every location is mine
I want all the world to see
When somethin' comes up to me, he don't even try
One foot boy
That are to blame 
So just sit back relax
I'm an ocean
What would you give me for a trip behind your steering wheel
When all the pretty girls can't measure to you
It's a little onesided but that's all right
And he knows it's time to make a change here and time to get away
'Cause when I'm here I'm always something
Underneath the power of the light
You, more than anyone, deserve to be happy 
Buy all of the things I never had
She's the only rocketeer in the whole damn place
Now I remember watching that old tree burn down
Listen to Iron Maiden, baby, with me, ooh
Gotta cut these ropes around my hands,
I got up to wash my face
As you go into my head
The simple life sure looks good
Trojan Records forty five
And I dreamt through the rainy night
Is it a woman that you see
Match the curtains and the floors
I got my arms, got my hands
of TVC as it sings you goodnight 
You're doin' fine
You're feeling instead of being
You had to find it I made a lot of mistakes
I don't believe in no heaven I just hope that I'm wrong
Yeah, we'll be alright though We're alright though
Don't get maudlin on me 'cause I'm not fit for it
And above the clouds she said to herself
Ways of calculating, ways of catapulting you and me
Sometimes you have to wait until it passes by
It's the only way we think to get ahead 
I just wanna be your girl, whoa yeah
I'll be excited for a week, but then excitement starts to fade
Memories just keep ringing bells
The neighbors can't complain, 'cause I've got my headphones on
Let me get to know you better to make me less attracted
To be needed by someone
With your feet up in the clouds
Oh little brother please refrain from doing that
But this feels so unnatural, Peter Gabriel
I got a feeling within
We cruised out to the other side
I'm so hard for a rich girl
I know this ain't the way I planned it
She's getting tired of her high class toys high class toys
And when I raise, raise my hands up high
Only shooting stars break the mold
On my own face
They want to see your sun shine
Learn to spit up towards the stars
Feeling that sunshine
Catch the train out to what you're tryin' to do
Somehow I know I'll be strong
Go take a step outside see what's shaking in the real world
Tracing the lines in my face for
She's been living in her white bread world white bread world
Get your green green tambourine, let's play in the park
But we're alright though
'Cause she'll never be mine
All of these spirit voices rule the night
No, you've never left my mind
But we're alright
What have we become America
Da dadada da da dadada
Smile when you feel the sunlight
Don't stop me now, I'm having such a good time
This ain't a greater plan to break your heart over me
Gggget, get a lick of this lovin'
I cried picking up pride
That when I tell you that I love you, oh
I will not waste my days
I see the stars coming down there
Instead Of A Them
And even one lost guy from Arizona
Keep the nightlight on inside the birdhouse in your soul
And I don't know how a man decides what's right for his own life, it's all a mystery
Starting to feel the kicking here at last
Sssssomeone's gonna ask you what it's all about
Look the other way,
The chilly wind whipped my both cheeks hard
'Cause you thought it was cute
As he asked, if I would come along
As the days that you hurried and months when it all seemed wrong
To illustrate my homelessness
A stranger's face is seen  but was he on our team 
When we're driving in our cars, we will sing
We've become material
Just last night I woke from some unconscionable dream
Well I don't wanna wait no more
Good morning, good morning, good
September, as far as she remembers
Mistaken for magic
You know that we're all tied, and it's tied at one
That if one day in paradise
Do it 'til the ground looks far away
Remember when the days were long
The water feels nice, dive deep down under
"I wish I had hands 
Don't let the stars get you down
Escapade We'll have a good time
Now you're certain enough near a man free
When you look me in the eyes
In view of wan wordless crowds that chase waifs to spires with fiery plumes,
I'll never leave this you know
Adding scars to my heart
It's this one thing that caught me slippin' oh no
Then how come all the other unicorns are dead
Oh, that's a slowrolling country caravan
Starsky and Hutch chimps
If I could be for only an hour
G, ooh, I'm going diagonal
And there's a light inside of you
Darling, all of these awkward jump start stalling conversations
Or there's a chill because it's showing through your clothing
But then you're standing in my doorway 
Won't you stop teasing me
With the winter coming on, and the attic cold
The hedge shake, the last living rose
Everything is out I gotta
I'm not doing it right
They take shape and they tend
The wings are wide, the wings are wide
I have too many stories
It might seem like a dream
I've got to show, show, show you
Try to keep it down, six feet in the ground
He'd say
I really remind you of money
I would have liked you anyway
Hey, remember that other time when you OD'ed
I'd chase you for a day
Laughing, dancing, in the blackness of magic
Hey there baby
I could talk to you for days
And then you stop
You'd go way back when
Laugh or cry, well we need to try, get off the line, time to fly
It's a supernatural delight
to be a spot against the sky's colossal gloom 
You've got the spark I've been lookin' for
Got my friends, got the sunshine above
Pay the monkey back,
Yeah yeah Is enough to love you baby
And the troubles within me
And we'll have fun fun fun now that daddy took the TBird away
One step back you're leaving it, jumping at the wall
How does she know who I am
Let you off the hook like my man Mr Lipit
And all those little lambs from my dreams
When I get rubber in all four gears
The way your hair swings over your eyes
She's taking an elementary class in kung fu
Darling you'd come home
Bursting with Jews
Friends borrow money, never pay It back
When I have, drifted off in sleep
Girl dresses like a kid for fun Kid for fun
See the eyes fare in the dark
I couldn't tell the truth
When I came to, my kneecaps were off and they were soft, I had jellybones
You wear your heart on your sleeve
The mood rings
It's the first kiss, it's flawless, really somethin'
Let your legs loll on the lino
Watching what I don't know
But now I see right through 'em like a crystal ball
When you're happy like a fool
I'm sitting on the edge with my two best friends
Well, I would like to hold my little hand
I see your stars begin to shine
So I put a bullet where I shoulda put a helmet
Not the end, not the end
But we can say we really try
I be rollin' on up
Every move you make
It's just the way we feel Yeah
I'll put a bullet in my head
Making up all kinds of ways
Heartache, heartbreak, all over town
Butterfly, you messed me up, you make my heart double beat and
How are you feeling
And since you are my friend
Eating pbj's and watching the church channel nightly
And as he spoke, he spoke ordinary words
Gotta get that money man
There she was standing peacefully
Broad daylight, in the broad day
Put two and two together and a little bad weather
You took your love babe, took your love babe
Thursday, it's more than I can stand
And I left a little something to help the time go by
What's a matter babe, are you feelin' sick
I asked but nobody knows
They'll jack your money
Now you know it's true, why don't you leave me here
Let me love grow good for you
Since my heart is golden
Circumnavigate this body of wonder and uncertainty
He looked just like all the cool kids
That special touch
On the th floor overlooking Tokyo
Yeah all we need so here we go
Fly away
I crawl around behind you in the shadows place
I want you by my side
It's long, wrong way to go
Now I found someone I really miss
My girlfriend's bitchin' 'cause I always sleep in
You're well acquainted with the So o oHo
Makes the world taste good
Right about that time is when I come back to life
Its no way to be
I don't even know how I got here
But can't stand to see me walk out the door Ah
Hosted by the ladies who lookin' for somethin' to rub
Right in the prescription line
Let's fly let's fly
When there's so many beautiful reasons I have to be happy
So just get off my case
What's a girl to do with friends like this
That type of thinking can't get you nowhere 
Knowing things I know I cannot be, not now
Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me
Nobody does it anymore
Rollerskates, them lines
Love the way that you move
We're on our way, way, way 
The postman
She says "Hey
This liberty wind in my face
And wine on my breath
Oh, Susannah's still alive
And drowning in the pools of other lives
Wait here, stay here
I went and cut my hair
Some kind of mysterious Give me one shot at the night
Don't give up, let's go forget about yourself
Try to change your mind
First dancer takes the floor
She's in love with me and I feel fine
While I'll forgive you of anything
Is coming back to take me home
Uptown funk you up come on
You might have moved on but girl you should know
The night is still and cold but this desert can turn
It's so shocking
I sit and think about the day that you're gonna die
I shall take this unbound train and flow away
It's just the radioohohoh
Turns out I saw them a couple of days ago
I can see that in the back of my mind
The view is the prophet
You was staring at me like to say I was Ginger
It rings like all through the daylight
Touchdown turnaround play by play keep the score
That will set your soul apart
But, girl, I just can't buy
If you've got the money
Can't you live and be thankful you're here
And descend inside of you
Be gone your olden ways, be gone
I cannot fall in love
The cats are out to play, to play
Who's around when you're losing your mind
Gonna write a song so she can see
And I bought a restaurant for his son named Alice
We'll fly our flag right up up out of your sky
On our way back home
I was rolling lowly
All the clothes hit the floor
Your love
Complains about the world
She will still moan, "Keep your hands to yourself"
And not recognize the aging street, and
I left LA without telling anyone 
Take back what they've taken if you wanna play it safe
A fire, I can warm my hands 
Mind waves rolling through, carry me far into the tide
And we always lack suspense
Had you stuck around or come out to a show
It's drinking away the summer days
Let the fun begin, hey
Like a ferris wheel, full of bluegreen eyes
So I get bored and I shout
And I will ask you to open my door from your side
He feels the
Maxwell Edison, majoring in medicine 
To know what it means
But you could be waiting for your life to begin
I've never been so lost
And the way they make me feel
I don't care where you move I don't care if it's far
Uh, they can't do what we do baby
And not feel bad about it for days and days and days
Can deal with this open relations
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet
It's getting better since you've been mine
Lamplight makes the shadows play
And I fret so much about her loving 
Sans m'en faire, je vais t'assurer
She runs through the valley of death and of sleeping
Yes I do now I want you back
And you can take all the things
Look up the number
Happy without you oh
Oh oh, the ancient commonsense of things
Begging you baby
And your ties are made of things that shouldn't make ties
Angels "how long till you can see her"
I just can't get enough of you
Welcome to your barbeque
Keeps on running through my head
Now my dream is slowly coming true
a calcium mine
I know it's rough when all you have is my word
That when I see my washing
I'm stuck with you
You and me always, and forever
I'd hand the skies to you
Tu m'as dit "J'ai rendezvous dans un soussol avec des fous
You got me up so high, yeah heyey
And He'll rejoice in things we say
Ooh ooh ooh, Ooh ooh ooh
You better get real, real, real and realise that the situation is going nowhere
Good time to roll on
Fall off the deep end
Forget about me when I'm on that plane"
Waiting for, waiting for, waiting for, waiting
Workin' all day for a mean little man
Singing songs from the balcony as the city crumbles
I guess what I'll be saying is there ain't no better reason
And that's why every time I roll the dice I always come undone
I walk down every evening and I stand on the shore
And see the sun come up
Ain't nobody's business Nobody
But baby, I'm the one who has the key
Coming around
My fingers keep on clickin' to the beatin' of my heart
To The Stage
Which has not only hit me in the face
You're my love come get lost with me
But I can't lie here beside you, beside you
Boys had better beware
It's the place that I know well
Our breath rose in the cold
Ooooohhoohooooh oohoohoohoohoohoohooh
I'm not sure, quite, why we work all day
If you leap awake in the mirror of a bad dream
I'm freaking out
I paid my, I paid my, I paid my money to the welfare line
I was a lonely soul but that's the old me
I'd go the whole wide world just to find her
I'd come all over your party, but I'm soft
Don't stop don't stop don't stop the beat
Two, four, six, eight, I run and hide
Turn your heartache right into joy
And then we hide from light 
That's some kind of wonderful
And he started the investigation
But he smart, he plotted a plan for Polygram
I feel my heart beating
Disappointment was my closest friend
Gentleness clears the soul
Never grumbles or fusses, always treats me right
I forget why I'm breathing out
I don't care what they're sayin'
And Ill stare off through the darkness
Damn, your dad's basement feels like '
And got out of bed
Can't stop, won't stop groovin'
Big boy, come on 'round Big girl, you are beautiful
You're hangin' 'round, yeah, you're there too
I've forgotten what to do
So I could scatter all my notebooks on the prep school lawn
If something in the deli aisle makes you cry
Zero gee and I feel fine
Courtney Love and Marilyn Manson
Listen closely to the words I say
To show you that I love you
Be my head, and I'll be yours x
I feel the impact
Sometimes you make me feel so high
This one for them hood girls
I never miss a beat, ah
Oh, like dreamers do,
Leave the old town drunk on his wooden stool
You could be this happy
Well it all keeps spinning spinning round and round and
This boy has broke down, yeah yeah yeah
You made my frown turn upside down
That can't be, this has been
Knocking the aeroplanes down with stones
Our time's just begun, oh yeah
Why you never sleep
Mr Pleasant is good
He's got the sun on his back Just go out, it's alright
I gotta keep trying anyhow
Touchdown turnaround everything is safe and sound
A comfortable three feet deep
A new challenge awaits
Can make their livings on a trick 
There's never been a reason for
My friend you must be careful
All the colors of the street signs 
And I can read what you think, yeah
Then you know who you are
I can see the day unfold in front of me
Hoping I would see the world with both my eyes
A popular gauge will measure the rage of the new PostModern Age
Do you need it
Somehow that was my fault
The stars in the sky, illuminate below
Drinking stolen gin from the rich people's bar next door
You can show me the work that you've done, your fears have been disguising,
Bright bright sunshining day
Waking up warm in your arms and without a care
It's too small for people
That you give me no reason, you know you're making me work so hard
And baby, even on our worst nights
I want my money back
The consumers king
I'd like to bear witness to
I want you here inside me,
Take the map and point to anywhere
You went into the kitchen cupboard
And miles of thread
Thank goodness for the good souls
We don't get down
So make a move make a move
So let the people talk
Where there are freckles I would die for
I heard you turned a new leaf
And brought 'em all together for one night
So please Please
Just left to move
You got my heart beat pumping
You'll never do the things you want
Real sugar, sweet as a sweet can be
For two years
Feel your magic touch
Already, we'll all float on okay
Dirty dancing in the moonlight
Oh, and sometimes I wonder
I could be that happy
Wish someone done me wrong 
Once in a while you get shown the light
And take the butcher's knife through my words again
Is something that I can't deny
Oh, you're never coming back
Show me all the rules girl,
Is the glory of a boy
In a minute it will all be coming down
Of Paris in the hot August heat
Understanding all of my weakness
I never say anything at all
Just like it's done for years and years
So much pain
When the dream lights are coming on
Find an ocean, sell your soul
One waving out the window
Big money,
I know I'm gonna pay for this
You know I'm not the little boy that I used to be
What's been said has to stay between us
And the people in my head still visit me sometimes
This means you really love me
But don't worry, be happy
I won't let you down
As I recall, you were looking out of place
Four days, she's back with me again
Seen whilst I was lost, I found this
The nightingales are singing loud
Those raindrops are falling on my head, they keep fallin'
We've surfed and danced and all the faces 
I'll get it on with you
And when I touch you, I feel happy inside
But you call me when you're bored and you're playing with yourself
You get to the next one
I used the light to guide me home
I came to this strange world 
True love breathes salvation back into me
Well, it's a brimful of Asha on the forty five
Oh, oh, serious as a heart attack
"There's no time for looking down
The old bastard had a paradigm arrest
But it's makin' a stop on April first
But fair is fair, if my segments get separated
Then someone said with a cold hearted chest, "You're a mess"
I put back on my overshoes
Wasn't always gonna be this way,
And I will kick and beat my wrists together
With your ear to a seashell
Butterfly, baby, you've got it all
Oh yeah 
My hands tied up around these words
You're not around this old town
I can feel again
Down to the corner
We're taking our turn with the kids that don't learn
Until I found your hands
Calls her on the phone 
I've been so damned sad
It's like I got this music
Two steps to the finish line 
I've got to know, know, know you
My little brother's in his bedroom smoking weed
They've all got loaded guns
No doubling back
I can't let go
Sure you were swift when the handsome Greek boys dropped by with gifts
She said "That's when the feeling hits
Oh say please do not go
He's teaching mamas and papas how to be a little cool
Love, love, love
The mutual conclusion was I'm not worth knowing because I'm probably dead
In every way, I've changed since then
Vaten voir quelque part
So you did
If you ever step on my patch
It's my party, dance if I want to
A new day comes you'll wake unfold
There's a one foot boy eleven stone
She's only one breath away
But I promise you that I will always try
Meet me on the corner, we'll start again
Love's what I got don't start a riot
I don't care if I'm alone here singing songs to myself
To stop our clever busyness and let go and dance
I'll need a volunteer, how about you, with the eyes
I've gotta get outdoors while the weathers still here
Walking through the terminal
I'd bottle it up and save it
Off the mountainside
Well, then the search is through
Don't be afraid, it's only me, hoping for a little romance
I feel your warmth, you let me in
Gotta go to work before it gets too late
I'm known to go a little too fast
Fun, fun now that daddy took the TBird away
That everyday he finds, just what he's lookin' for
They give us those nice bright colors
When the dream lights are turning on
Something like a sunset
And if somebody's going to fake it
We can't rewind, we're locked in time
Together we will follow
Come on and show,
Hot topic
Swap around a little stall
My own little world is what I deserve
When you can't dream well, what's life mean
Lookin' at the sky
Don't bring everybody down like this
And over to a table at the gratitude cafe
I'm begging you please to come home
Would it take some hailing Mary's so full of grace to get my sound to you
To let you trouble me
Well it finally begins, oh just around the block
And something happens to me
Jump in the line, rock your body in time Whoa
Water pouring from her eyes
Yeah, something that I want to let you know
And you could say "Your love to me",
The moon was sagging in the sky as I held her face to mine,
I realized you got the car keys still
Lie, I know there's a reason for superstar
We been holding it so long the wait was killing me
When you come I feelin' better
This song is for all the ones who's singing out loud
'Cause I really don't care
I can't even talk, still stuttering
Trete hinein, du bist herzlich willkommen
You're the key for winding up my heart
To put in my songs of love 
Till you swear to take me home
And I say
You are just another white boy
I hold my breath and wonder when it'll happen
Fumbling 'round in the dark with a flashlight
And I take the world
Where is the book
I am trying to say
I know, I know, I know, I know 
I'm gonna spend it in the dust 
All I need, all all I need
Boredom strangles the life from the printed page
On an unfamiliar building on the rooftop where we lay
I'm a traditional man 
Some people ride a cat for riding a cat's sake
And had you gone, you knew in time
Up in my lonely room my room
Like this city is on fire tonight
Is it just me or is everyone, hiding out between the lights
Or pick up the phone
Higher education making a sense
I got money in the meter and a two bar heater
Now Sukie saw the beauty but she wasn't wet behind the ears
I still got all my love to give,
Anywhere you wanted to be someone else was talking to me
Find your mirror go and look inside
And all that glitters is gold
You'll alway know you got someone
Yeah the way I make myself
I ain't scared uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh
I'm love tornado struck
He lives on my block and he drives an IROC
And there was a month
Built on words, built on work 
If you want to be the one that he's thinking of
Just jacks, jokers, and a queen of hearts
Of idle days
Yeah, you are the fortunate
Found eighteen reasons I can't pick up on the phone
My favorite record is playing again
And solidarity, on the razor's edge, boy, what You're a big puncher now, right
I've let you go,
It's such a feeling that my love 
Even if I could have kissed
But anytime you look at me
Those smokestacks were making clouds for the sky
So shine forever
You will be the world to me and I will always be
To fix the world up for you
Climb up the fire escape
Hey, hey, what'd you say
When skies are grey, when skies are blue
With all the years I've wasted on you
I go to the places where we used to
Find a partner 
Some cats didn't make it alive
I have something that I love longlong
Or should we wait and see 
They walk in new shoes
I been less and I been more
For her rooftop, our last stop
Or the grace in your eyes overcomes any fall
I'll go along with all she needs 
'Cause I'm sleeping in the back of a taxi
She says how she's so much better than you,
Watch your step along the arch of
Hoping for stormy weather
Sans tricher, je vous le promets
They got a ticket to the show
Now you got a bone to pick with me
Made her look a little like a military man
That at least tells the rest of the drawing, king
She's a super human girl,
Wouldn't want to waste a thing
That I was a billboard
Hazing loveless fall into
When we peer to the great unknown
I would like to hold your hand
Fall falling  falling again
There's always something in the air
I see no reason
Dreams become a screamer
Don't say slow 
"What kind of life do you dream of You're allergic to love"
And I know that my heart is my home
Where, where is the town
Yeah I'll stick around, I'll be right beside you
Yeah, clap your hands Are you up to something
But there's one thing I know
But oh there comes a tide
Don't understand how one can watch so much TV
Staring at the ceiling here tonight
Come battle two swords with a stick
Such a cruel world
Safety pins holding up the things
And then we gon' swing by Simpson Road, you know what I'm sayin'
Sergeant sends a letter to five
Cannot all creation call it celebration
And I feared the best and loved the worst
But, baby, what you want I just don't got it
Hang with the rats and smoke cigars, have a break with Frank and count the stars
All painting gorgeous time
All I know is sometimes things can be hard
Your mother should know your mother should
I don't believe that anything can recreate your youth
Life is ill, again life's a movie
If you break a kitten's neck, you must shake it's body and check
God damn you movie star, can't you just play a minute more
O comet come down
And I want all the world to see we've met
Don't you know we'll both fall to pieces too
Wish I knew how you do it to me 
Do ya feel it's in your bones
You're taking everything off
Remaining in our lives together
I was broken but fine
I took the road that brought me to your home town
I do love my Ma and Pa
I say my legs they're wearing baggy pants
Free like whatever we dream about
I'm so glad I've finally found you
Feels like I'm always losing
I hope to God you feel the way I feel
Underwater breathing burns your lungs and breaks your back
Nothing left to lose
We have lost our way 
But later you'll pretend you did and you'll mean it
Awakened to cheers after years on the fault line
We got it all right here
Told me, why, I was
The sound of the crash, and gasping for air
If you had just looked once or twice Once or twice
Oh well, a touch of grey
But I'm no wiser than the fool that I was before
But the lights are so bright that they blind you
Fill your life with something else baby
That's the way we get by
There's a wideeyed boy with a red balloon
Mr Pleasant is kind
They are like emeralds
 gold, CHA CHA
My feet they're paying tribute to
You shine a light on head and heart,
'Cause sharing some meals is something
Trying to act like you just don't care
And when the leaves return
We started out friends, said that you're the kind of man takes every girl for a fool
As you sit down to pray into the river I will wade
I squandered my daydreams
I could be anything you like
Get it, get it, 
Call me Willy Whistle 'cause I can't speak, baby
What a thing to do
Pick it up with the band on the Ronald Reagan Tollway
They say we're losers and we're alright with that
Distract me so I stay inside
You can have a rabbit or a rib
And maybe I should say "What's up"
My mother jumps the gun
Don't touch me
With your lover
And it feels like I'm somewhere
You make me laugh one thousand ways
Any fool can think up words that rhyme
And no one will ever know it if I keep my mouth shut tight tight tight
If you've got the patience, celebrate the ancients
It's you and me tonight
And you'll remember these
You got so much love in you
And I'm free from the world
Here's an evening dark with shame
Tomorrow I was nothing, yesterday I'll be
You know what they say
If you've got things on your mind
That I'm growing up to be a better man, dad
Oh, it seems like she can be anything
And that was all I had to say
Round and round your loving winds me up
Like"how can he save some summer night,
So you'll always know
Used to hang with the devil in the broad daylight
We've got strangers stopping by
You know I'm not giving up
"Don't you dare look back
There's something in the air you can't deny
Ah, la, la, la, love
I know that you are almost in love with me
It's not perfection, yeah
And kiss you on the mouth
Using their Fifteen pristine, moderate, liberal minds
K  I  A I'm in love
Barbara Eden in the bottle and now I'm gonna guzzle
I'm Busy Bee but I'm taking it easy
I'll be playing basketball with the President, dunkin' on his delegates
Yes I I know it
And I know she likes it
The Rhumb Line is waiting there too
When that light's gonna shine
What's the glue that holds us in
It's funny
It is the soundtrack of your everflowing life
I tell you my reasons, you don't tell me your inside jokes
I don't need nothing
And the way they get loved and the way they get loved
Yeah Ha Nah I don't fucking think so
But I know that I just wanna look some more
Everybody fades away;
And do you ever feel things here aren't right
I took out the message and put the bottle down
Like Jack and Jill but with heroin
Till they know where they stand once they've reached the end
'Cause your daddy thinks I'm lazy your mama thinks I'm crazy
'Cause I told you a thousand times
Payback the donkey, payback
Don't get upset, and now it's just the beginning
Someday we'll meet beyond the time and the bars and it'll be
We wanna see you shaking coconuts
In uniform lines
Forget all those places that you've never really been
Fall in love to Down on the Street
We can walk the road, kicking up the dust
Too late, too late, run for cover
Drum the beat of a heart I can't defeat
Then you'd better get out of his way
I sometimes lose myself in me
He found an island off the coast of Mexico
My heart plays a rhythm in my head
The only girl to take it seriously
This is the island of the honest man
Come and get it 
Really do come true
The new year is out here
And it's alright
I can't remember half an hour since a quarter to four
Wandering, waking in an empty wood
You always get me feeling better
You don't know how to stab a nigga dead, keep a clean hand
Blow a kiss and change the world, yeah
Singin' late in the evening
Seems to be no reason at all
There's a girl with Cherry Chapstick on
Your love is there for me
We don't care
You didn't know I'm in a band
Ah, just turn around
I was dressed for winter
You're walking down that Pensacola beach
From all the drugs the one I like more is music
It's a matter of getting deeper in
If you say, I'm always yours,
Come on and raise your voice
Always right behind you
Now all those clouds have nothing left to do
And when you notice all your stars are in line
I took a book and went into the forest
Think I'm glass I think I'm breaking it
But now they've brought you away from me
If you're lost and you look, you will find me
Hey you, put your lips up close
I'd sing the song that I sang then
Got my neck, got my boobs
I drive you face the window
When you're holding me
Gravity has a way of pinning us to the ground
There ain't nothin' that I need
Oh my god just please don't ever let me go
All the things that come to you
Love is hard but that's all right
The fact is, it's you who've got it all to make my day
We are lying in the sun, when we're done finding a towel
It's you and me tonight
Make it like your birthday every day
And in every way, I know you still want to stay
You stopped laughing and you asked me,
I want someone provocative and talkative
Because you tore down the walls that the world that has put inside my head
But I'd like to skip the small talk and romance, girl
Like a kitten up a tree
Oh God, cause now you got me missing you
You say, baby, I only want to make you happy
Uhhuh, goddamn right, it's a beautiful day 
Everyone around, love them, love them
Aprender a dar foi o que ganhei
All my loving, darling I'll be true
You're only good when you're on your back
You said I lied since the day we met
Where we used to say
And the stormy nights
Cause his father's not the man he'd like to grow up to be
Shake your coconuts, coco boys
I'll be a lighter of fires 
In a late basement seance that brought us to tears
Would you please just let me go now
I didn't know what I would find there
And they know it now but no one makes a sound
No you can't, but you don't know
The picture was an old collage of something classical
I'll join 'em talking 'bout the people everybody talk about
You'll have to shout even louder
Sometimes you hear me when others they can't hear me, Hallelujah
Do you believe like I believe Do you believe in magic
Thursday night your stockings needed mending
Ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me
Oh remember sitting on that beach
And even though I know I'm here, I know I'm going
I gave you a sign
You're the kind of guy that blows my mind
We are strange in our worlds
Under the sun
Like a real big thing, again
I can see your face on the wall, I hear your voice and I call
I said it that's the way it is
Maybe you got something to prove
If you spend every day wishing for the next to come
The rich get money but never what they want
And now I spend my time
She is thinking before she speaks
By the way you smell I can tell that you're fifteen
Because tonight we're singing these here songs to everyone
He said "We're going wrong, we've all become the same
Always made the front page,
You're just a storyteller
Well, I know flirting is nothing
So I can finally find out what I've been looking for
She went and joined the army,
You make me go out my own mind
And when you see me, don't hate, that I rolled up
Time is not the constant my friend,
It's not my imagination My imagination
Don't you know that you really upset her
She had the grace of an eel, sleek and stark
Shiny happy people laughing
I'm standing in Brooklyn just waiting for something to happen
To put in my songs of love
Whatever it is it's alright
Make its way across your face
And in my room
When the stars are shining brighter
El maximo lider, comandando en la brea
That kind of soft, that kind of silly
But I can't feel it right now
Where you never knew you'd go
She's lost his trust and so she must know all is lost
I never tried to hold you tight until you left me and fade
My gut knots up, my heart bursts like
But I still see clearly when I see you smiling
Cause you got a lot to tell me
And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer
Board your ship that's going nowhere
I danced around your folk and soul
In history in history yeah
I am defeated and I gladly wear the crown
And with no lifesaver you try your best to float
No need to keep stressing from our everyday life on our minds
I know it's stupid to dream
I say I don't want to pray no
A lovely day
I said, the tragedy is how you're going to spend
So we should party
It's like no other feeling she says
It's easy if you do not run
How the wind went and pulled you into the hurricane
Waiting for everyone else around to agree might take too long
'Cause they're gonna wash away
Oh no they shout
Or like all my dance heroes would if they existed
I stopped eating and sleeping
In five years time, you might just prove me wrong
Armed with this small butterfly net
One, a bit right then we got two
"High school never stops"
My friends say I'm crazy, and I agree
You can see through, you can see the way
To smell and pretend
I send you flowers but you don't care
When I complete your song
Be my holiday, yeah
Oh blissful bleed, I came out peaking and leaked out like a wet clown
Maestro, as you paint this picture would you
Bright as ever
I'm not your baby and I'll never be
We're going home
I'm in love and it's a sunny day
And then Someday
Call your office on the phone
And you're dancing
We're on an island on the fourth of July
Come and get it if you really need it
What you've got to say
There's volumes in the forest, no one reads out loud
We want the new temptations woh oh, ooooh
I know you're looking for salvation in the secular age,
I felt the darkness of the black metal bands
You have a hammer baby we can break down the wall
You lost your focus but I got a plan for it
You take a lover for a dirty weekend, that's ok
It takes a toll to make you care
And you cry with emotion listening to a bandoneón 
I get two loves in my life
If you'll be my bodyguard Oohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohooh
And the colors are going to be 
Plus you're the best kisser that I've ever known
But the moment we had, I felt bad
Oh, Susannah's bedraggled but she 
Around the clock You are You are
My name is Denver Max, I eat heart attacks
But I know you're still the one
Please come and see me again, I never felt more alone
Now she doesn't feel lonely but she'd just as soon
I would have liked you anyway Would have liked you anyway
'Cause that's the way I like it
Time, time of my life
Gonna cry, yeah yeah
Feeling warm in your sand
May come our way
So I should have realised a lot of things before
BBBButtery eyes, if only cries could come from those eyes, oh
Oh happy birthday, little Lisa
But no one sees me when I crawl back underneath
If you really want to stop it then burn your sperm
Will the whole world be warm as this
So give in to the rivers wind
The rest is out in the cold
Not sure if you mind if I dance with you
They tell us we should really stop
That I'm your man
But I've got my doubts and what if I'm right
Is this band makin' money, I don't know
And they put you in the ground
I love myself
She will be sweet on me, just like a mystery
Diamonds di di di di di uh 
From Falsterbo to Kiruna, from Göteborg to Djursholm
I'm flipping with a coin that's got a tail on either side
Seconds in a day
I just say I'm in it for the long run
Moving forward through the flaming doors
I'm gonna need a forklift, 'cause all the baggage weighs a ton baggage weighs a ton
She spits me out in her surly blood rivers
And all our troubles will be gone
That it's a winding spiral case
And you knew all the best moves,
I've been talking to myself
The porch light is so bright
Caressing her warm brown skin
So you better start winding it up because the party's almost over
Our hearts in our
But I never heard you callin' from the sun
I had forgiven you for tricking me again
And as the howling winds subsided, the locals ran out, all waving their hands and singing
I got attention, I had a pen
I never have a bad thing to report
And it may not be photoop
And I love to give my blood sweat and tears to the mic
I love her and she's loving me
I'd rather tell you about how I'm feeling, boy,
oh arm in arm with all the harmless sociopaths
My ears fill with the sound of descent
I'm getting carried up by the wind
I really love what you've done with your hair oh yeah
Just forget it, it's the same old runaround,
I did me very best to impress him
Ooh baby, yeah
I must be looking for something
Spend my nights and days before
'Cause you are your own destiny
There's a land that I've heard of
Get out of the office and into the springtime
Bounce bounce, baby Bounce bounce, baby
I've been wasting time
And it says my heart's never in tune
And my body became so light
Friday, Friday several times throughout the song
I gotta
Your pointless life will end
I called ya, I called ya, I called ya but you did not look around, yeah, yeah
The chauffeur's leering from the cheerless mezzanine 
All the subways around create a great sound
Imagine how I'd feel to be called a promotionalist, a mitt man, an emotionalist
And all the dreams that I awake to read like ghostly paintings
But I've been unfaithful
You and me gonna touch the sky
Fade off miles
Such a big day
Like a story told
I just can't stop it
Been thinkin' 'bout the way you treat me right, yeah
I'm in love I'm in love
Way, way, way, way too long
Now when it came to bells and whistles, Jackie did not lack
Your bleedin' heart's at my command
Let the music play
Ooh baby, baby
Big girl, you are beautiful
They remind me of when we were in school,
We found a new kind of dance in a magazine
Get the memo I'm cutting the strings Geppetto
You're thinking that it's me you're fooling
Tell the promoter we need more seats
Spray paint verses on a cold blue wall
I gotta figure out what I'm finna wear
Who loves the rain
I want to see the wounded moon
She got my heart again
That stretches out ahead
Holy rollers roll
Tonight I might sleep in the car,
When there's no one watching
Adversity, we get around it
Keep the rhythm through the night
And you've got
How I, I am not into the idea of living without you
I feel like I'm losing the fight
And if it's not a big thing,
You have a fancy ride
As the temperature rises all around
Should've read the writing on the wall
They all go wild, but they walk instead
And lovers try
Oh tonight's the kind of night
Take a chance with the woman that lets you
That everything good always would remain 
Woke up this morning feelin' fine
I know I've got to try
And you gave me wings and I used them
Six sorry years and now the gloves are off
And love for the fine stripper's who get it poppin' ass
The kids love them anyway, it don't make sense
You and me always
How did it come to be
End up happy
There's no belief, no salt in the sea
I'd rather dance, I'd rather dance than talk with you  
Oh don't believe all of your golden memories
The dressing rooms are grey
Building walls and an old pay phone
And dreadlocks in her hair
But getting used to this is hard
And touch my inner smile
A skunk that scratches and is leather a sign from up on high
You're so restless, you're gonna end up alone
Very simple and dumb, like I always have done
They steal the money from your pockets almost viciously 
I cut class in school, yeah
But I won't change you honey, you're for keeps
There ain't no stopping us now
Well, it's all right, even if you're old and gray
I'm legless at sea
And I'll be at your side forever more
'Cause all you really need are a few good friends
Billy the bookcase says hello
I will leave the wallpaper life and run away to the Foreign Legion
If only I could always feel just as I do right now
They get me nowhere
You know you twist so fine twist so fine
I know you'll do things you would never dare
Stumbling ahead of me
All I wanna know is do you wanna come with me
A clothespin hanging on the line
Just sign on the dotted line 
You'll be wailing when they sell your soul to the repo man
Better believe that it's gonna be the biggest night of the year
Sing on and on and on through the town
Better tell them while they're here 'cause
Yeah, wouldn't you like to come with me
Any kind of creature she wants to be
Place next to the ocean
Baby's got a worship like a river on the cusp
And the storm that you've been hiding from will end
There's no place that I could be without you
Tie you to your feet and watch you drown
Cause' you don't understand
To a little standing place
Well open up your mind and see like me
But you left one too many times
And as they pull me from the wreckage,
A trapeze is a bird cage and even if it's empty, it definitely fits the room
"I love you"
Don't you know I'm in love with an uptown girl
Making the best of what was mine
I'm counting up the minutes till I get alone
Hopelessly I'm taking a mental picture of you now
Reading fashion mags to look at the girls
Let me in your love, that's all that I want
I don't know where it is
Guiding you, a voice is coming from behind the stage
Mulling it all over in my head
I don't need an alibi or for you to realize
Patterns reformed just like child actors"
Let the sun illuminate the words
Pocket that rug you'll ride the groove
All I'd want is you to be my sweet honey bee
So come on make your move and free me
Eu já lavei o meu carro, regulei o som
Well you keep it warm at night
Forget what I said, you're only good in bed or on your knees
And I followed the sound of music
This road is finally standing up to the sky
Dansa fran botten for att na toppen
I don't say much at all, but I bring up your name
I reach out trying to love but I feel nothing
My joy will be complete 
Even when it's hot outside
The renegade feelin' satisfied
The heavy hitters and the chichi music
I can humiliate myself to your face
Diamonds
I thought I recognized your face amongst all of those strangers
Dodging holes and telephone poles through the dash
You know baby that's all you're really gonna get
There's a way
Love you more than you know
To sing the world goodbye
And no one back at home
There's a whole lot of walking to do
Waiting for the end
Not falsified to say that I found god, so 
And an eerieness surrounded
It's all that I got
How did it come to this
Where they speak no word of truth
I'm around when your day's gone all wrong
My way with words
But some things never change
Look at, look at, look at what we're doing
Worse things happen at sea, you know
Memory has become pain
You don't get me
Don't you understand I've told you before
Cheer up you old bugger, c'mon give us a grin
Gu'fanden do we care
I know there's a light inside 'cause
And it can its way to the top
You can sleep here on the floor
But I don't mind
You show me how
You're such a delicate boy,
Long before I knew
Hey there sister wife
You love to win, I dare to lose 
You might be lucky if you try
It's halfpast the moonlight
Feels so good you're coming home soon
Knowing ahead, there comes a fork in the road
But everyone I ever cared about remained
Everytime I make the round I turn around
Because you act so tough, I totally lost control
If you love somebody
You've got a strange infatuation with a love that's in the air
I shall always want you until my love runs dry
And still be friends, still be my friend
I'll be dreaming every night of you
And night falls
Lovers, keep on the road you're on
And I never knew her real name
And I know that you and me
Whoo~ ooh~
Echoes who don't answer back
I go extra miles to show
That's the reason
But I'll buy you brand new shoes if you cross to my side
I'm wastin my time
If I looked all over the world
To be thinking about that
But her destiny got us so intertwined 
Killed the vibe and took my perfect ten away
With my toes dangling into the sea
We let the runners win
No matter where you are
Pay the chicken back, back,
I still think of you
How can a flower bloom in
The lips I am missing
With the record selection
The sleeping in minor, the gold leaf, the tire
And People are people, regardless of skin
You my brown eyed girl
Sits beside a stinging nettle
This girl listens to the band play
I was feeling like a champ then, in summer
I say high, you say low
Then again it just depends on
Who threw his arms around me
And the Sublime style's still straight from Long Beach
You know that it's true
Between you and me, it's no surprise
Thursday, I don't care 'bout you
We'll be riding horses all the way
Drove up in my bone Camaro thinking only about you
We gonna party like, like it's 
Numbers, letters, learn to spell
Go tell sis I'm out the door
Oh yeah, well, well you Ooh, ooh, ooh ooh ooh
I was looking for a holy ghost
And you will know from this
You're just talkin'
In the strangest of places if you look at it right
That you were sat behind my back, didn't need to turn 'round
Strike while it's hot
I don't wanna change you, I just wanna see you
Who puts me in the magic position, darling now
Singing to the ones you love
All the misinterpretations that define me and you
On the front lobe of my leftside brains 
That should turn into something
Yeah, your name's on the wall but you're happy
I love you, baby
If you work all day you keep the rhythm through the night
Never start no static I just get it off my chest
So from my personal point of view
But I would never kiss your lips
Headed west to get the best of what we all knew then
Doing the garden, digging the weeds
Circles of street lights
Can't feel no pavement right under my feet under my feet
I will always keep your gaze
The happy phantom has no right to bitch
And then on the way home, it always seems like a good idea to go paddling in the fountain, and that's because it IS a good idea
Tomorrow the Jehovah's will come by
Well, I feel just like a child 
To call the shots and name the price honey
No candy in your till
Then he cracks that smile
At ten, I shaved my head and tried to be a monk
I try to do what is right,
I need some time in the countryside,
Try my fruit and taste my seed
I was floating, did it go to my head
And I won't delete it He won't delete it, woahohoh
But I'm looking for hills to roll, 
Dddon't stop the beat
This little story keeps repeating itself
And think of all the things I'm going to do
But I wrote the book too well
And watching you burn for me
And let your love show and you'll know what I mean
Measuring all my shadows by old star shifting to red
For homes that she had loved
That all of the world and all of it's powers
Somewhere in the wasteland of your head
Well you got so scared
Say you're true, say to me c'est la vie
The girl with the curls and the sweet pink ribbon in her hair
They say we look pretty good together,
Wishing all the things could still be the same 
That life is my bass synth, I feel the attack now
And two shapes in the dark across the way
You hold me right here right now
And they way they stand
Divine is what's in your mind
Song from the mouth of the river
There's a lot to be said and to be done today
She likes to leave you hanging on a word
When you're hurting somebody
And we're taking calls
Tell lies, tell diggory lies, tell chiggery lies, until you're lying in his bed
Or I'll fall through
Take me above your light Hello Seattle, I am a mountaineer
This Monday morning walk
In the light that passes though me
Ah shake it shake it
I lit a match, then let it catch
Now you're really livin' what this life is all about
When you turn to me and say
I never thought that you'd find out I did it
Nothing could be further from the cold hard truth
From Jamaica to the world
From dreams I've had, the dream is all I have
I'm gonna call the police
lies beneath the ocean waves
See, see, when I rhyme I flow on the beat like piddadowdow
A new hell he must conquer and destroy
You'll never know if you don't go Go
Or lick a rock, or both"
And in the new land a sand storm roars,
Only just a friend the love story begins
Where do we go, do we say,
In proud array standing by the bathing
To the childlike man
Oh, somewhere over the rainbow
The gentle beat of a tambourine
Oh you slay me baby
This is the way
So when you gonna phone me
Don't ever let it show"
So pick up your pace and go away from here
I feel like I oughta thank somebody
When you return to me
There's cheating on your lips
And everything is going
It needs to be defrosted"
For me to see that  this was something
I don't wanna be right, right
It is an empty fear inside you
I know that I really can do it
'Cause, here's proof, we have suntans
I'm a shooting star dancing through the sky
I can't get out of my bed
Work is over but I can't stay to work late
Racetrack season pass
It's really good to see you rocking out and having fun
I love you so much
Everybody gonna feel alright
I don't feel like I'm fallin'
Byebye feeling
Everything you do now
Can you wait for the sidewalk
Everybody let's go have some fun
"High school never ends"
Throw away the ones that make you feel bad
Or the planet for a clear blue skyway, oh
No one but you, you babynobody but you
I'll keep tossing rocks at your window
I wanna hold you but you're out of reach
Oh boy, find out what's up with me
If you were the winter, I know I'd be the snow
Verschwommene Bilder wirken wie Nervengift
It's time for tea and Meet the Wife
It's been so long since I made you cry
But you will believe in love
I know that you'll feel better
There was a time I was down, down
Life is way too short to take it slow
And you threw it away
All the good things that you've found to yourself
We'd stand staring in awe
Where fire and ice collide
When I saw you getting down, well, I hope it was you
So he sits and lets the current take him
Pilling up, filling up, taking up My little 
Who are faceless and born without names
Freaky dicky star speckles and pink butterflies
And let it flow out from within
I like the way you dress
Is it all like I was hoping now
They don't mind it if you're told where I'm from
Not that I don't care about you
But I own a photograph
Say what you want, what you say, say anything
If there's something inside that you wanna say 
All the dancers left but I can't dance
Mmhm, you're my little girl
Hit the dance floor
I'm gonna be the man who's coming home with you
I'll write you harmony in C
The sun came out and brought you through
It's all right
At the mountains at the birds at the ocean at the trees
Your heart may long for love that is more near
What are you gonna do
I can feel my dreams when I'm in my city, eh eh eh
Crimson and clover
And it is the one thing I'd almost forgot 
It's the bough we break to blow
And finally we rested
I thought "this one knows better than I do"
Well, I didn't mean to do it
Yeah, I'm sure you're right
This time it's not personal
The work is too important and we're no longer young, after all
This is the orchestra, the rhythm and the drum
'Cause I've been waiting for
It's no surprise that we get so much done
"When we're so far from right, when we're losing the fight, when we are letting the light weaken its beam
Let's all get up and dance to a song
There's a party on the rooftop, top of the world
We don't notice anything
Have a seat at the bar
That maybe we should wait
La la la, it doesn't matter
Our hearts beat in slow motion
Singin', don't worry about a thing, I won't worry
Under the open sky oh my, baby I'm trying
She makes my head
I keep a rabbit's tail
Stay by my side Stay by my side
I didn't even let her sneak a touch
Cause girl we're good together, oh
When you go into the place
And I know you're near me
I ain't got cash
For the record label puts me on the shelf up in the freezer
You'd better know
And you're not a man who can understand anyone but you
Oh yes I can make it now the pain is gone
She just wants to be accepted in this place 
Oh show me you love me Do ya love me 'cause I wanna know
You really should revise your dress sense before you walk on by
She will not let you be
And I was just walking on one fine wire
Said it's berries in my heart bread
The trendsetters make things better
And I lose all control
The highways and cars
I don't want to spend night after night with you
This is the journey of the man on the moon
Shake your coconuts, come on, coco boys
I won't stop till I am under your skin
But you gave me wings and I used them
Yes, I'm sure you're right
Got to love, well we got to love, yeah
The bass drum is quick
Complete with deceit,
Caring without pretense, a picnic on the hillside,
We always have the rhythm here,
'Cause I'm a huskin' a huskin' a huskin' your corn
Kiss kiss
I got to start to thinking, and seeing things so clear
'Cause I'm a man, not a boy
I know you sing my bling bling Check out the karats
Now what was the question
And it ain't nobody's business
Soft speak with a mean streak
A holiday in August
So true, in a serious face
But wont you tell me that your loves from the heart
We can take tonight,
And bend your back and ask those hips if I can touch
From ten thousand lightning bugs
Written in the sand
I tried to kick the ball but my tennie flew right off
Oh, I wanted you to move
And my girlfriend went and cheated on me
I was happy saying I had a love that wouldn't last
There's nothing I could say or do
Everything was ready but he had to run away
She was sunbeam wrapped in lies
Óró mo churaichín ó Of your eyes, but you're disguised like a sleepyhead 
Slides inside sandy river before the day is through
Well I promise you you'll have your fun fun
Lost in the endless sound
Complete your name in accents I can't place
But there's evil in my head
The way to my heart
You'll be the one that I'll love for ever more
I'm on sunshine baby yeah
Let the song be sung to teach us
I just wanted to prove wrong the people in my head
We're struck by the still of the moon
Yeah, I know sometimes we all wanna give in
You were going to a dance
And then I'm back coming at you with a biggity bop
Then every little thing is gonna be alright
'Cause I don't mind it when you whistles
So I'll just live on wine and water my vines
Well yeah
And I got stripped of my soul, standing in my shoes
Come on down to the disco, all right, right right right
If I knew the way to the ornamental tree
You gotta be brave
Gonna drink my hardearned pay woo hoo
Or you could return to me
But stole it back now forever in debt
Twits and jerks they do the boogie
Hey girl come with me and let yourself go
So won't you look my palm over
I was unaware that she liked to act so kind
The bad rich, God's flying in for your trial
You've got no reason to be scared
Weil er dabei von Fußball spricht
Nice day for a drive through the city
Hush little baby don't say a word
Like a disco ball
You're repeating me lines that you think I wanna hear
Pitch black in my room I need some
Neon black cocks rot into poison wine
You're bundled up now, wait 'til you get older
Left, right, left, c'mon
There ain't nothin' please me more than you
I sit back and just groove the day away
Then play along and catch a cold
Blow smoke and hold our breath for as long as it takes
You can't hurry love
I like to hit the town on Friday night
I ain't ever gonna stop
Yeah we all think we're right but we're wrong, we're wrong
Listening for things I cannot see
And know I could choose to let it grow
Disappointment haunted all my dreams
Sometimes it feels like life has no meaning
Leave the garden tools in the rusted shed
Yeah, still you endear me now
Your coffee sure is getting colder
You are staying with your friends tonight
The luck was all before him
On everybody's stereo
Come on, baby, let's get away ooh Baby, c'mon now
Till neighbors would knock on your door
Standing by a parking meter
Of your Hollywood song
Now face west
Sing it to the world
Who was kissing foreign fishes
Happiness, how do you get to be
But you should know by now
And if I knew what we'd go through 
I wrote some songs 'cause I love her
C'mon
When I was a barista they said I made lousy foam
Come carry me home
'Cause there's a million things to be
Still I think I'm doing fine I'm doing fine
Then take a baton, girl, you better run with it
Until I find what it is that I've been looking for
To More Than One Dimension
From morning, till the end of the day 
From this pain I just can't disguise can't disguise
You'll never know what went well
Calm that wicked wind,
Everybody's dancin' in the moonlight
She was in the habit of reapplying makeup
Get the cool shoeshine
Accidents and stars for everyone
And then I wonder if you already know
It really kicks, yeah
My little blue baby sung
Street lights glisten on the boulevard
"Can I take you out to the pictures, Joohohoan"
Didn't even know
But you just laugh because you don't understand
Clang, clang, Maxwell's silver hammer
Wishing for the time of my life
Walk on the water with a friend
The youngest was the shielded
Doesn't that make you shiver; the way things could've gone
The ships the ships are coming in, the great ideas are wearing thin
And when I take these winds to home
And spread these words around
Just like a king
Chickenmobile with your rooster tail
Lost control when I panicked at the acid test
Then you said Stop it Ça suffit 
You You You, you, ooh ooh ooh, you
My mouth it's got a great big smile
Please don't lose hold of me, out there
You look a little better, each day to me
And after having spent the day together
I can't feel
Let the beat control your body,
Come on, come on, I wanna hear you whisper
'Cause I just can't get enough
« J�adore vraiment ton style, comment tu t�habilles »
Make you feel, make you feel better
Do you want to go to the plage with me
Will decant the excess salt from the sea
Oh I keep feeling older
What do you want from me and my scars
But it's ok with me
It's a touchy subject
It's some kind
You got it, you're wow wow wow wow
It wasn't 'til I looked into the mirror     
Taste where we are, play the music loud
And I hate what I've become
Been getting some extra help from a special band
I'll get real high
All the people above us
And hang it up so you can tear me down
You get older, and it's over
Now I'm so bombed out by your paradigm kisses
They want us to fight, but we just wanna get high
Especially when she came and spread her wings
There's nothing left but shadows on the wall
I'm the scarecrow in disguise
Oh, did I give them all
Goodnight, goodbye
Ooh We're shining bright and I want you, I want you to know
To spend my time missing you
Shake it, shshake it Oh oh
Scare up your letters
If ever there's a girl
What you done with your time
And you drag your feet
And everything was my fault
Abrígame en tu sol
You pin both the wings on us
And the world is synchronicity
I still love you, the girl from
Why you gotta act like you know when you don't know
Huh all right
Away from here
Come and get your share
For anything that uses my back
Honestly, you can try
Mondays I sleep away
Happy new year, ha
I wish I was a sea monster
When you've fallen in love
But it's a funny way for you to tell me
If you fled a million miles
Would sing my childhood song to me
'Cause you're my everything
Want to go for a ride
I'm floating around in ecstasy
I know that now, that's why I'm staying here
If you stay for a weekend
The sky caves in
Let's close our eyes and not our minds 
Shining down on your face
Your last stroll down the block was in the trunk of a car
All these people  they look so, they look so happy to me
And shotgun the seat that beats beats
Light me up that cigarette, and I'll strap shoes on my feet Dee dee dee dee dee
Nhliziyo yami somandla angibulele mama
'Cause you smile with your eyes
Back at the end all over again
And says I never ever thought that you'd be messing 'round
I guess we'll never know why sparrows love the snow
I'm starting to drift away
The sound of all these passersby mixed in with the bus andmotorcar
The unavoidable kiss, with a minty fresh deathbreath 
Let's drive to Brighton on the weekend
He'll be bringing them in to let them out and play
You feel it, you want it, the way I want you babe
Some are lost
And shopping for breakfast to be eaten all alone
"Halle, halle, hallelujah
Shake it, shake it Oh oh
We're gonna to feel the rush coming over us tonight
So my sister went kissing a mapleskinned boy
I'll do everything I can
Vous êtes mon jouet
She was a working girl
All poor people from all over
'Cause uptown funk gon' give it to you
Baby, come on
Here we are, livin' the dream
Coming to take you away
Welcome to the rhythm of the night
The cat wished that it was a bee
No playtime locked away
I've waited for a long time
Where the boys go with boys and the girls with girls
He steps right into somebody's fat loogie
Sometimes, the feeling is right,
Let's think about all those nights on Luckie St
I just want you closer is that all right,
And we will run, we will, we will crawl
I declare myself
It's the word, love
All I want to know is
Tuesdays I lay awake
And being by your side is the only thing on my mind So
C'mon we gotta kick thatthat gangster shit
We keep it boiling hot
Just bring your savings and a bottle of wine
With everything considered they forget my name ame, ame, ame
Hold fast to myself, make these good feelings stay
And fight back the undertow
Use your life, you'll know you are
We lost a singer to her clothes
Yes I admit it's getting better Better
But I remember one clear feel
Into the depths of the salt mine
Every time I caught you look
But it's not supposed to feel this good
'Cause I need you to make me take my nap 
Still we can make it better throwing all your cares away
And the talent we got will shake you down to the bone
Lets just bend the invitation
Heyla, heybahelloah cha uhcha uhcha
No offense to you, don't waste your time
Down your dark basement stairs
Ginsberg, Dylan, Cunningham And Cage
She drives a little white car to the seminar on Modern Romance
Break a promise to your mother
Though we know we were wrong, we can't give up the fight
A cette table
So unhappy
Same old faces make me shudder
I got me so down, I got me a headache Headache
You've got so much to live for, little sister
The East Coast kids, man, we just don't know
Honey, I was wasting away in a room
With a little bit of money we could buy us a car
In his breath on the glass
Last night everything was right
Oh, you make me feel
Calm your ears baby
See it's not what you look like, when you doing what you doing
Someone who believes in all the things I'm thinking
And now the sky is such a sweet blue,
Load the box and ill pump that shit
All of his money is gone
And if it wasn't Fall outside, it was in
But for three whole years to end like this
Why can't I shake this mess
Everybody knows you're a liar
I know this wont last, in the past I can't stay
To get a little closer to you
Up in my air balloon, air balloon, air balloon, air balloon ha
There was people that she knew, at least she thought she did
Yeah, it's been fun but now I've got to go
I been bummin' around this old town for way
It's just the bureaucrats that won't give me a mortgage
And forgetting the rain
If memory serves me right
Barefoot, naked, don't you let me go
But you have never ever felt it like you feel it right now
Monday, you can fall apart
In the middle of a cloud
It's better than being good
I have dreams of orca whales and owls
Well out of my ears my little black baby hears
To live the rest of our life
You are now the king, and you will be a truly great king
The thoughts you bring and the songs you sing
But once I stopped trying I fell for you
Won't somebody stop me
She's crawlin' out her window 'cause her daddy just don't care
And then you caught my eye
Flashing light, oh what a night
So uhoh Spaghettios I forgot to hide away the body
Just doing nothing
This world keeps spinning
I wanna make you feel alive at night
We gonna, we gonna, we gonna end up in the morning
I'll make the moves up as I go moves up as I go
All you need is love All together now
When I'm swallowed up in feelings
What happened to just messing around
And there's so much you could learn but you don't want to know,
Who would've known the storm of my past times,
I miss you when you're away
We can talk, we can sing
Sail the ship
I feel again
And in a roundabout way we can disappear towards the coast
Going back to where I've been
You'd better run, better run, faster than my bullet
But wait, the babies haven't been born, oh
Hey, I can't stop my feet
I'm not listening when you say goodbye
Dates before it needed blue
To an island where we'll meet
Each day
'Cause the dirt feels good when you're underground
I've been heading home
That better things are coming my way way
Lose your heart, I lose my mind
No sense, hiding away when you're already gone, I want you to stay
Mean much more to me than anything
But never made another sound of fear
I plan to beat it with a heart
You felt the weight of the world fall off your shoulder
Oh babe, I said oh lord, babe
Girl, can you give me a reason
You are gone
A pretty girl is like a violent crime 
With only the wind whispering
Because I have been sleeping badly lately
Dressed in all your fancy clothes
And how my heart's about to burst
And everybody's saying
My feet are still sore, my back's on the fringes
Me and your cold, driving in the snow
Come get lost with me
An interesting way of life
I woke up with a strange tattoo
I saw Johanna down in the subway
I could move town
Hey, soul sister, I don't wanna miss a single thing you do
I'm not your only friend
Come on, baby, let's get away
Ooh, woo, ooh I've found what I've been missin' lately
She had to press her nose on the refectory wall
So who's gonna be my next door savior
You love the danger in the night
What makes you feel alive
Ah, just one look at you
I know life is long but it goes so fast
Here's what I feel, ba ba ba ba
As you dole out the packages, noone seems to want you around
If you live the life you love
Did they mistake us for an eight that's turning into a nine
Another love note no one got
Tell me all about your men
It's just man killing man
It's getting harder to leave it
The Candy Man the candy man
I've got tunnel vision but I'm doing fine
Do ya, do ya, do ya, do ya love me do ya love me, 'cause I wanna know
Still it's all that I want to do
It's getting boring
You can't take away from me
Everybody is waiting for everybody to get out
And they're singing the same goddamn refrain
You make we wanna say
And every single day it getting harder to give
You said fight fire with fire, fire with fire, fire with fire
We can walk dear the pier is farther than it seems
Baby, take a good look around
And I really love the way you turn
We've got to keep it physical
Where storms are sand
Thinking of you like the way that you were
But they locked all the barn doors
That's his first words, we asked what it meant
Still your soul
But I don't know nothing 'bout love, uh
And it's such, it's such a perfect day
I was singing this song about you
You've been selected
Frenchy, I'm faking, 
The man nearly flipped to learn that he was free
Stop, adrenaline rush cause
He's supposed to show me where the money is
No, it didn't used to be like this
I don't dare to touch your hand
Whistle as the girls walk by if the cops roll up so what
I'm so scared, but I don't show it
You are a song for me to sing
Who's gonna play with me
Getting nowhere sleeping somewhere 
Holy, holy is the sound
It was the worst date of your life
Kicking up the dust in bed
I guess I ain't the great romantic
If you need me, I'm your man
Fears are getting stronger
And make it sound so very nice
Too afraid to say, he'll give his heart to you forever
Ooh la la la la, yeah
I know exactly just what to do
I'm tired of the fork in the road 
I'm not looking for a fight now,
I almost wished you would have loved me, too
And reaching for the stars to hold on a little bit closer to
And a wave tossed bottle is thrown to the sky
For the price of a night with me
I love to dance dance dance dance now the beat's really hot right on the spot
It's only words
Topped it off with a pair of old shoes
And when I finally kissed him
With the lights all on around us
Until I've gone bitter on every word that you've spoken
Ranches and ranch hands are bowing too
I know I won't be alone
Used to love me, now you hate me
We're so pleased to be with you Sky
You might just feel the same
To meet your friend the star of stage and local press
Keep this skin out in the open
Brings you closer
No one will surprise me unless you do
Everything must belong somewhere
Run, baby, run, forever we'll be, you and me
Oh kiss me with your eyelashes tonight
And time would be a distant memory, nobody could tell us to stay,
But I'm still trying to make my mind up
Then we wouldn't have to wait so long
Let me live my life
Clap your hands y'all it's alright
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
You keep saying the past is not dead
Oh love, love
We face the hardest part
And people are selfish, and people are prone to hate
I will let you be, I will I will
You, you know, you know my name 
But I know, yes I know
And do you ever feel the time slip by
And it seems I can't get a grip
But, really, I should stay away
Your mother should know yeah
Through the door, someone says,
You hold the white light much better
I'll huff, I'll puff and blow you away
'Cause it was my job to be her help
I can't go back
So welcome to Meadow Brook and welcome to Shady Space
Wishing I was somewhere else
Keep taking it easy
I'm going downdowndown there at  in the morning
How does it feel to be under the gun
And I know
I could stand by the side
With days like these you couldn't ask for more
Honestly, I just don't care
Felt that was fine but to rhyme, had to try it
I'm happy and I can thank myself
Of good and bad men all around
Through the sliding doors
That someday it would lead me back to you 
When I was a young boy, I got a stereo and I taped all the songs straight off the radio
And it was time for all the wrong and lonely, lonesome reasons
I'm in the mood to take a chance
And years of resentment
Tell her I just did what I was told
Wrapped in green gladness
This whole world will take me down
Is it true what they say  You can't behave
Don't be stressin', send them in my direction please
In this brand new colony in this brand new colony
I got a, clip full of hollows, money makin's my motto
In love you'll always find
They play Good Charlotte on the radio
Or clutch a rabbit's foot when I'm twisted like Oliver
Anything you've been thinking of
And in my room woaho its gotta be at least a hundred
So won't you please show me won't you, give me, baby
Pick up the phone  my jacks are all blown
I don't know how
The stables would be shadowy
That crossed my mind
White clothes in a hot pink hot wheels
I wanna make you happy
And how you really should know
I wasn't looking hard enough
If you only knew
I feel like freaking out,
I never ever stop wondering, wondering if you still think of us
I still need you, but I don't want you now
But everything else
I will send to you
That your dad was gettin' wise to you now
Holding the last of the season
And then it changes,
Man buys ring, woman throws it away
Let the wild rumpus start
Oohoohoohoohooh oohoohoohoohoohoohooh
Maybe we'll get it right You know I'll get it right
Kneel to condition all the feelings that you feel
Can it wait for you
She said to get better
Practice makes perfect
Oh baby please give a little respect
Living without life
And I love the riddles that you speak
Now face north
Tell them put the money in my hand right now yes
That I'm not doubling back cause
Have you seen her all in gold
And maybe if I'm lucky I can catch them before you fall
And I said I'd never seen anyone look so dumb before 
To stop you falling
Ain't got the intellect 
Don't you know that Rome wasn't built in a day, hey hey hey
Of all the little things
We can hear it in the back of our minds
I used to worry I would wake up all day
Just to touch a lonely heart
When you're worried, call me
It might bet he way that we talk
Be the love generation
So much on my mind
I've been leaking like a garden hose
I'm a cynical cunt and I'm much too lazy to change
There was a fleet of battleships
So I called you home your so called father was on the phone
I'm seein' stars, I can't believe my eyes
This will turn into something else, something else
I'm a be your girl
Burning out my dreams
And yes they know New York will thaw
And while Jackie bestowed the joys of fingerlickin'
I never said what you did was either right or wrong
and how your forthrightness betrayed a secret shyness, 
Don't gotta tell me where this is going
I won't look back anymore
Ambling madly all over the town
And think about you all night long 'cause you're the one for me
Don't you know
The sky was gold, it was rose
When we were dancing cheek to cheek
You don't know the way to his heart
Or it's like finding something pretty in a jar of flies
It was something you did
I might add, its black paint and gold paint on
And I'm filled with doubt and I'm immature
And we're people too
It was
The dark canyon wall, the call and the answer
Not a chill to the winter but a nip to the air
You might find some fools at your doorstep
A birthday wishing chimp
But she doesn't know who I am
I'm a dream that died by light of day
Your pain's gigantic but it's not as big as your ego
Avoid eye contact at all costs
Við spilum endalaust
Don't tell me that you didn't try to check out my bum
It's a perfect day for making out
To give up everything
Your song
No more should'vebeen, no more could'vebeen
Does this city have a curfew
Until you start to sing
Nothing is too good there for my girl
I woke up today in a very simple way
Yeah, I feel so down
"How you been and what's been new with you lately"
Surely, there's a story in counting all the minutes 'til July the st, 
You'd still enjoy it with your foot on Masada
I know happiness writes white
And stirred it with my fingers singing
But to play is easier than to set the groove
Between God and a shot of scotch, let's get fly
Well, I'm a little child
In a green field somewhere near a freeway
'Cause honey when I get up close to you close to you
Always inviting, always exciting but I must not take off my coat
I've come to watch your flowers growin'
She go up in the air, come down in slow motion
We're all standing with our backs against the wall, sooner or later
I got to tell you something
I heard you're feeling 
Laughing in the back of chauffeured cars
I wait for you I promise you I will
If I say, "Too bad," I'll take a lesson in my head
Whatever weird way my mind goes
And I will hope for the best
When there's nothing in her bed at night 
Yeah, I need you to help tie my shoes 
You never asked me to stay
Aslappin' on the floor
Well we move with such elegance, with such grace
I'm just thankful to be facing the day
I look at you, you look away
Your world is so inviting
My ribs that show through tshirts and these shoes I got for free
Just standing where I am with all the people passing by me
There's a reason for the sunshine sky
You're my fashion tip, a living museum
And I know you ain't into all that
Some things in life are undeniable
It's gonna be a beautiful day
Don't be so unkind
So you send So you send
Wondering if there are clouds in hell
To that gun on the ground
So the fun won't start 'til she's living it up
There's nothing in this heart but me
Been dreaming of this since a child
It's alright
Oh yeahoh yeah
Tell me have you seen the girl
Inside a zoo
You're not a land mine
Because we only have one life
The wind is a gentle breeze
Wegotta kick that gangster shit
I work hard then watch some TV
But just until the fish start to smell
Girl don't you walk out
You gotta swim
But that's just all right, all right
The less room you give me, the more space I've got
You don't need to call I ignore everyone
She likes whips and chains
All of the subatomic pieces come together and unfold
Don't say next time 
This road that is narrow is the one we should follow
Falling, yes, I am falling
A hammer hit the nail with great sympathy
Don't keep it all inside you
That you cannot comprehend
Yeah I love you and you love her
I'm given all I got to make you stay
That works for  wait a minute, wait a minute
You come in, I can read you
I've read the same books again & again
It takes those tears to make it rust
Ooh yeahah
Her lover
If you ain't got the doremi
Long live rock, be it dead or alive
You got groove in your hand the way you spin those tunes
Could've made you forget
You're just not the girl for me
Shading my eyes from the morning sun
Ain't got no love, ain't got no name
I wanna take you away
The prairie, the frontier Run from yourself, from your friends
Should I bend over
We will get by
And do you ever see yourself in love
You take my hand and drag me headfirst, fearless
Walking in the shadows to his senorita
Seconds in a day 
If you don't like my plans,
Þú augu fjúka í sand tárast
Since I let your love keep me warm
I keep on dreamin',
Shop the streets to find out who I am
For once in my life
I wish I could change the ways of the world
Well, you could bring your roommate
I wrote the kinds of papers teachers hang up on their walls
Fortune depends on the tone of your voice
Don't let go; You've got the music in you
Tonight, maybe we're gonna run
Take off the mask let it all collapse
Spread the word I'm thinking of
You're stealing from the lost and found
I don't mind
You got an angel on your shoulder
And I know that now that's why I'm staying here
Someday
And very often causes his downfall
I picked up a seashell
You left your dark horse in the stable
Break away your ties and find a new squeeze
Let's see what we've got
I don't know where the sunbeams end and the starlights begin, it's all a mystery
You can see the truth, you can see the way
It's a fish in a sea of granite
And it's feelin' like old times
And you want to go for a ride
And I am a mating rhythm
Not sensible, I wanna marry a dancer
Here comes success
My heart's aflame, I'll love you till Tuesday
As a young girl
She breaks down on the video
I would cross through these state lines
All trying to understand
I'm just looking for a little squeeze
Waiting on love to call
Worrying we start to wonder, what was right
Bbbbbbbbandits
But your life is just one big mess
Be cautious, 'cause what I be on'll leave you with amnesia
Many dead, tonight it could be you
I'm too hot hot damn
The story goes
I've never seen a girl look so good in thickrimmed glasses before
Neon black tanks grope the skyline
Imagine all the things I could do
And you know you wanna go go baby
Prepare for the best and the fastest ride
You're my doll, rock 'n' roll, feel the glamour and pain
Today I sleep in the chair by the window
She put me on meds, she won't get out of my head
A little sunshine sympathy
On a holiday, far away
A lotta guys try to catch her
Lock the doors, that's when Ghost just g'd off
Ba dadada da da, feelin' groovy
They go all their lives and never know
I kiss you all starryeyed, my body's swinging from sidetoside
Or you're liable to get licked
Nothing means I gotta gotta
To keep my blues away
We've got a fantasy affair
Well, they're no friends of mine
Sukie was a kid, she liked to hang out at the art school
It's a serious thing in a grownup world
My heart always seems to know
I'm living out my dream
City city won't you calm down
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah I want you back
First thing they teach us, not to give a fuck
The air is wet
Maybe later in the afternoon
I'm gonna chow down my vegetables
Hot July ain't good to me
And it's clear to me that this life is gonna be
Is that the kind of thing that you think you might be into
I stand and strain to make ends meet
And as I stood there as a broken hearted
Leave all your love and your longing behind
Us to surrender
I ride rollercoasters, I try all the cultures
Oh, and you love me too
Yesterday
Everybody's gonna feel the beat
By the faultlines and the soil
Yeah, after all this time, I'm still into you
Just look to the rainbow, you will see
We're taking no part in your cracked antique life
I don�t understand
Sometimes I'm not that sure
Had room for two
It was all
Oh intensive care,
Oh, Billy Brown needed to find some peace of mind
You should stop and ask me
In the city on the streets
You're never coming back again, oh no
Everything that you need
well, there's a reason why the last is smiling wide 
Waited for your kiss,
Let's celebrate, let's celebrate, let's celebrate OhOhWiOh
People lie, people hide
Oh, nobody know
And turn that sadness into something that feels right
Three steps till I finish mine 
And when you're holding me
And I'm her king to her heat
Maybe we were born to run forever
Just love someone more than yourself
And I'll try to stay here with you
I knew it couldn't be just a onenight stand
Don't really know how I got here
I say, we can act if we want to
Hiroshima, Los Angeles and each town in between
Give a little love
To tell you how I feel about everything
I speak a different language but I still hear you call
I've been alone and I have missed things
You're fooling nobody
'Cause you and I both loved
Oh skin and bones baby
Whispers Chinese leaves a message, leaves a metaphor, 
Can't forget
It's like I didn't need to say anything or do much, I could tell
And they say Hey Hey
Lets forget about the rain
I wish we had one more kiss
Round and round
Out here in these streets, if you get down on your luck 
You build me up just to let me down
The cowards way
Just smoke cigarettes
I gotta go, gotta go
By the river of dreams
All the roses blossom into skulls this season
Better look up my number 
You never felt so cold
Everybody smiles at you
He pointed to a conch shell and then to the lime
Oh like you were saying something
Hey, it's all on your head
And I made my way to the kitchen
Stealing our hearts with the force of the new evidence
I bet my momma found my letter, now she's calling the cops
You say that I changed
It's a crying shame, that the love you've made
I howled at the moon with friends 
It was you
You're the ocean
You to feel Mine to feel
You have shining eyes
So I call you out
Walk away
Like a cloud his fingers explode
Used to be the underdog,
Can only get better
Take my hand and watch the world go by
And the world is so much meaner,
They're really saying, I, I love you
Woo hoo, and you know I'm yours
You can Scoop out my brain 
Till I opened my eyes and walked out the door
Trying to make it so I never see your face again
I don't know where your heart went
And the stars they all aligned
Clap along if you feel like that's what you wanna do
And you've got nothing left to lose
Music is my sister
I don�t want no savior baby, I just wanna have a good time
That makes you act the way you do
Better recognize your brothers
I don't know you
And I don't care who's wrong or right now,
Heartbreakers gonna break, break, break, break, break
And after changing everything
Be happy
This was a Pizza Hut
People tend to disappear
You got me in the mood
If any word that you said
True love
I'll never get, I'll never get to be with you
Oh tell me will you bring the key
Can't get no rest, keep walkin' around
You should turn into something
Susugar, shake it like a Polaroid picture
Yes it's good
Talking 'bout the young style
For that great jazz note
And you can love anyone
Yeah let's dance, come on and dance
In a stairwell I seek
Oh, to find truth in all my lies
I can't stand missing out so when you call me, call me
And everything is plastic
Every time that I turn around, I let you down, you read my mind
We are falling
Think about a new destination 
Steady wasting the day spittin' silly verses
Oh baby, do you wanna dance 
Primo mixing  Noreaga talking
And we still hear the echoes of abandon
Can you tell me what was ever really special about me all this time
I keep my mind on my money, money on my mind
Breaking into hotel swimming pools
I'm just a prisoner in a reign of love
She's the kind of girl who's not too shy
Someone who needs me Ooh baby, for once in my life
Just lookin' at the pies
My heart is beating, beating like Ringo
I'm a racing car passing by like Lady Godiva
Take me away from here, so far
Doctor Jones, Doctor Jones,
We'd fry our brains
Or else my heart is going to pop
I just want your kiss 
Where are the hidden folds
You may not know
You say you keep them close by
You've got soul, you know what to do to turn me on until I write a song about you
Wait for me another year or two
I'm around when your hands aren't steady
To leave your house and home unhaunted
I'm a racing car passing by
When the worlds go to it, they always fall, but can they do it with a cold foot, I say're you're
Well, one look and I yelled "timber"
We are diamonds
'Cause stories of your brother make my crush high bop
He comes here almost everyday
It is that flower that you took the time to smell
Well, you might be a bit confused 
I'm movin' outside
For every stranger with a promise
We lifted this house, we lifted this house
Lay down and wait for you
Back to the street
But my wit won't allow it
I woke up filled with fear
People tell me not to let myself evolve
Turned out just to be an honest girl
I feel you coursing through my blood
By the time you get on the bus
What have you become
I wanna be your thing, your anything your everything oh yeah
Right beside it
We'll hope it's not for nothing at all
With a freaky kinda music, you can't understand
And America does, if America says it's so, it's so
It's a show all on its own
There is a map in my room on the wall of my room and I've got big, big plans
And they all fall down
I wish you cared to see 
Tweedle on the needle, man you're just for thread
And let your love grow with the smallest of dreams
Life dangles your dreams in front of you
Will you choke your children when they spit in your face
His Honor drove southward seeking exotica
I'm telling you from the heart
This, this could be, the summer the summer of love
It's been a really, really messed up week
As the tanks roll into town, as the tanks roll into town
So I've heard you know how to write it
What's really good that gonna happen to you
Everybody knows I've got the magic in me I got the magic, baby
I have to admit it's getting better Better
We love this exaltation woh oh, oooh
Oh, you're standing there, look tired as your singing
Like seasons, just move on
Baguette, ah ha ha, baguette, oh oh oh oh ohho
So they won't get inside our happiness
But my crazy love 
Now, now there's no need to swear
Then this somebody, somebody is you
What I have inside me it's enough to fill a house
I'll stay here with my beer and fish 'n' chips till it gets dark
And go to a place where she can't find me oh
And I wish I could get back there
I'm outta rhymes I've gotta say
The city
Feeling so lost, ticking you off
From all around the world
On a street where reality is not much different
Never felt this love from anyone
As I dove into the waterfall
I tried not to let you down
Oh, the trouble we can get in
Is more than words could mean
And they are offering eternal suffering
She knows she's losing it, yeah she's losing it
LA parties and the vodka fizz
Night turns to whatever we want
And in the daylight we can hitchhike to Maine
Don't cry for me today, ahahaha
So now you know, you know it all
Show them all you're not the ordinary type
I just want your kiss, boy kiss boy, kiss boy
Let's go, right now
Keep on money makin'
There will be no flowers flowing
That adds the sunshine to the magnifying glass
Then I gotta get, right back on the block
I bet ya been goin' around town lyin'
Gave me love, babe, now it's over
Well I've been out getting wrong
'Cause I know it will be fine
That you make me smile
Oh, I'm finally feeling the stitching of beautiful seams
We'll live rejoicing, ev'ry day, ev'ry day
Asphalt to me has never looked so soft
And you said "Hey hey ho, you know this is the way to go
So dance, yeah let's dance, come on and dance
Till I'm running out of air
Dancing on the dancing floor
And the baskets weave with your mothers strength but the ones we'll never keep
Whether or not the weather is on my side
They keep things loose they keep it tight
'Cause what we are, is victims of fun
If I cheer the other team if I cheer the
They say it's gonna stay bone dry
To make me smile again
A hazy day
I am on reprieve, lacking my joie de vivre
You turn the picture on to me and I'll turn over
Your boy comes to see you, he's your Hollywood thrill
That stuff makes me feel waiting for a train
Baby, you're sailing away
Selfless fool who hoped he'd save us all
She can't be dumb enough to dream so big
And there's times I think of leaving
I'll get 'em back in a few more tries
Today was a fairytale
And what a sweet sensation 
I've got your letter, you've got my song
Wind is cold all right back in Dallas
She comes from far away far away, and gets closer every day every day
It's a perfect day for dreams come true
Never had to battle with no bulletproof vest
You'd get a line of coke
And every page and every paper
And fall on my face on somebody's newmowed lawn
But if the sun will rise, bring us tomorrow
Onto a bale of hay looking the other way
Well, her face is a map of the world
Come on, come on, Come on we were once upon a time in love
Phoenix, ride wit' a G, St Louis, ride wit' a G
But I'll take the chance and tell you what I'm thinking
In the van we dubbed the Gary Glitter
And I told her that I'd be back someday
Call the investigator, the heart investigator
That no sonar would list them
It doesn't matter what we do
You hang about the park but you don't play football
And I only found it today
Not even money for some glue
It takes some work to make it work
The girl
And I still buy two pairs of everything
My momma said to me
He is accustomed to hiding from people
Say "Damn" and let the poor sucker sleep let him sleep
A weekend from the holiday
And even if you try and hold me back, there's nothing that you can gain
You say, baby, I only what to make you happy
I knew the words but they didn't sink in
Until there's nothing left of you
Gold is just a trick of light
So, so I need it too
I don't know why I go walking at night
She saw the lights, she saw the pale English face
Boots and fists to pound on the pavement
And when it starts getting blurry
If only songs were sung to guide the doubtful ones
Nothing's ever gonna happen 'round here
And it just feels good when you're coming home
In the middle of the parking lot, yeah
When the winter's here, yeah, it's party time
Staring into the bloodred sun
Searching the world for what's right here
God made, God made love
Hey yeah, oh yeah, yeah
All our friends would say
Happiness ahit her like a bullet in the back
I got here, where
With not enough love to go around
I see you at the foot of some mountains
And a dream inside our heads
And we'll forget about our problems
Nobody would see us go
It started in my eyes
Though it seems like every time I get a little bit closer
Sometimes I just can't explain
Hey, look, what do you see
No, I'm not asking much of you
Shake it, shshake it
They say that they don't know me anymore
And I know that you think it's just a fantasy
And the sun always shines down on your shoes
I put a tag on everything
Do I repulse you with my queasy smile
Oh, I really need one
Got to live that love
Trying to keep my eyes closed
Your letter an'
Instead of making changes"
Plenty of girls and boys in love
I've got the cure
This place that I now call my home today
By the time we hit Tucson your parents little girl,
'Cause if its ever gonna get any better
With you, with you
Betty, I'm a dreamer
Where ho niggas be snitchin' at and often come up missin' at
We live this life 
And we'll get to know each other for a second time,
I play my guitar like lightning
Happiness hit her like a train on a track
There must be enough love ooh
You make my heart beat like the rain
Oh yeah a shooting star
I left my baby on the side of highway 
Either way, my change came like Sam Cooke
I don't think you even realize, baby you'd be saving mine
But a man who's got the type of moves to make you loose your mind
Now so much I know that things just don't grow
In a couple of years
Or do you prefer to fly
And your heart, your heart went missin'
I'm for damage
To make amends
Got the shake of the grass roots beat
Is buried down deep with the rest
Seems she forgot all about the library
I think this could be right now
So don't ask me how to get started
I guess I was
I'll be holding you so near
You might be the village joke but 
Sitting in restaurants
Can you cut, I can cut, 'cause I'm a rough gem 
Keep fafallin', these heels they keep me borin'
You been doin' this so long now
A pair of Dutch chimps
If you ever make it back to Nashville
Yeah All right
Go ahead with schemin'
Run for your children, for your sisters and brothers
Won't change
Somene else's date
I want it all, but there's nothing you can do to stop me now
When you ring my bell
Don't let your friends tell you why
If I had the chance
So say goodbye to green 
And you're on the gossip team
He knows that in a moment
Momma, I'm coming home
J�aimerais déjà te dire « Je t�aime » sans consonne ni voyelle
Some day they will be forgotten and die one by one
If anyone can make me a better person you could
'Cause it's too much, yeah, it's a lot
And I'm turning from all the lights tonight
In honesty it's been a while
No need to be alarmed, 
Cause your up shit creek
I was blinded by the light
Surging through the darkness over the moonlight strand
Knock me out like Michael Tyson
Oh you cut out the middleman
They got lost as they were taking off each other's clothes
So dejected by my own design
Yes, I'm on my way
Best things are green now pimpin' get your paper
I'm not going out tonight 'cause I don't want to go
Burn and start again
A pretty pair of blueeyed birds
There was a good man named Paul Revere
The last person in the world right now she wants to see
Can drive to the flies and bees
Let's go the world ends tonight
And if you are a deity
And your love it's all I wanted
Love, real love, love, love, love
To catch a shooting star
But she threw it all away
I know I can't do without
Get on the floor
I don't know what to do
Now I can't walk in a vacuum, I feel ugly, feel my pores
Across a dead end street
Can't take away those times we stayed up and we talked all night
Come on down to the front, and stand right here and don't be shy
I can't stop, I can't breathe, I can't think
Love's what I got, it's within my reach
Looking for
Who can take tomorrow
Little deuce coupe, you don't know what I got
And no matter how old we get 
Cattle in the marketplace
Push me through, counting the miles
Did I hit you in the proper place
 months, yeah I feel fine
To the end of the light
Ain't gonna ride that yellow bus 
Friends do things together, la la la la
Diet Coke and a pizza, please
It's like a million dollar phone that you just can't ring
Hey momma, hey momma, hey momma, hey momma
Since I made you smile
You made me feel love like the old days
On buildings, buses, streets, trees, rain and friends 
That can see through many lies
And your eyes must do some raining
There was a man at the wall
In a sea of perfect stripes it's hard to stay afloat
We're gonna be alright
God saw fit to put this kiss inside
So tell me baby
You'll get your money, you'll get your night
I've got a key
'Cause you're the only one who understands
We will write a postcard to our friends Sheltered in his bivouac
I'm just, I'm just, I'm just a man stuck pushing some wheel
Run round with trousers on fire
I got some shaved chimps
Well if you want to say yes, say yes
Don't you dare ask questions 
My baby don't mess around
Bones in your body and you was made to be a celebrity
Discotech Meet me at the back door
While outside the leopard frogs sing sweetly
The words on the tip of your tongue
Fell to the earth at a fascinating speed
And satellites that compromise the truth
Nothing can push the feeling away
Look all around at the mountains you haven't climbed
Will perform her famous lawn chairhandcuff
To build my very own Motown
But you loved and built a house with my love,
Swing sets, grade schools, and black eyes
But she's been gone
Keep movin' don't stop rockin' ah ah ah
And From what I've heard with skin you'll win
There's songs, sounds you bring to us
Single in his bed someday
Everyday, it's agettin' faster
And that's the hardest way, ooh la la
Spent the night in someone else's arms
Já, endalausir og birtan
Now it's getting late and there's still no sign of her
Your love, lifting me higher
Neither you or I would ever know sunlight 
This hit, that ice cold
I can't wait
Yeah, oh yeah
Uptown funk you up say what
If you work all night you keep the rhythm through the day
A baguette, ah ha ha, baguette, oh oh oh oh ohho
You even might wind up being glad to be you 
Don't want it to be over, move move slower
Every day is ice cream and chocolate cake
My passion's neverending and I'll love you till Tuesday
And I want to play the guitar
But everybody knows the truth
Tonight, tonight and we're dancing on the edge of the Hollywood Sign
Unplugged the phone
I'm bouncing off the walls again
Oh today I finally overcame
I always dreamed it would be
I know it sounds stupid but it sounds about it
But you, you have a mind full of wonderment I'll never find 'cause I was never young
And don't go finding a replacement,
I'm hangin' wit the ballers, yeah, or my nigga Ghost
She spins and she sways to whatever song plays
I'm on my empty bed
Don't need money when it's sunny,
Ah la la la ah la la la I la la la la love this
Now if I lived in my land, which I do, I'd still have Chinese children
It won�t take long to get when you feel like you're soaring
When I'm falling down
Take step outside see what's shaking in the real world
When you fell in love it was so sweet
Ride your tongue along your bottom lip and bite down
To Friday night's reversal of time
Who's that hiding in the apple tree, clinging to a branch
The growing pains
My arms get cold,
And when I gave them some they'd know
So she said, "What's the problem, baby"
Call it reach it get some words and get some timin'
All work, no play
Now even if you hold yourself
If you're with it 
I'll forget what I've done
'Cause I was never young, even as a boy
I stay game, stay game, stay game
Tell me, tell me a story
So who's the girl wearing my dress
You know you really gonna live yo' suenos;
And do you ever take a chance, my love
Here comes success here comes success
Sometimes I'd like the rain to end
I'm coming out and I'll tell you the truth
The dead soldiers lined up on the table
Then gone in the goodness wish I could stay here every time"
I feel alright, I found a face that fits tight
Take a chachachachance birthday
I want the sun to bleed down
If love doesn't kill me I'll be lonely as a king with everything
Colours are where my brain finds glue
Where I was almost famous for almost a day
And everything looks like a giant cupcake
But they don't know where to begin
And to enemies it brings defeat
Picking up the phone
what they've been missing 
Helicopter has taken to breaking this dreaming spell
And you are mine
We're playing for our lives, the referee gives us fuckall Ref, you're giving us fuckall
I almost didn't make it
Now the light of day I no longer see
It's not exactly love it's to adore
Into a room where it's nine in the afternoon
My waist it's got a slinky belt
Look all around, there's nothing but blue sky
Yeah, oh, yeah, now
"Beware", the sign on the door suggests
I was a dancer all along
I could've been after you
Just bring it on
And I was there for you
I can see it in your eyes
Know how much you need it
With my cars keys hidden in the kitchen
I need to improvise
But don't say victim
And your mommy suddenly becomes your daddy
Cause all the loudest voices in the world whenever I
We can be heroes just for one day
The dog days are over, oh
And feel it, feel it, feel it, babe
I got a dalmatian, and I can still get high
I know you won't, it's just that I am unorganised
If we could find a reason, a reason to change
The stars in your eyes would turn and break my heart
I could have guessed that you'd be this way
Hear now honey
I couldn't wait around 
If there's no parking on the street pull up on the front yard
And with your bitter words you kick me in the gutter
You come in
It's a shock, not a kiss
It finally seems like we've turned into strangers
Got to find another way to keep from going under
The colored stones and troop leaders
We're drivin' down the road, I wonder if you know
But you never knew,
It's in your blood but not in mine
We stand tonight, hearts in our hands
The words are
I've got nothing to hide
While the kids don't sleep for days
There's no stopping us yeah,
I did the Flaming Waffle with Ho Chi Minh
My last case I got bail
Taxi driver, sun is rising
Charlie's fixing his van with the left arm tan
Say you haven't had enough, say you wanna
And now she's looking for a downtown man oh
I love the temperature and smell of your body
'Cause you're such a success
Are also on the faces of people passing by
It's a bright June afternoon, it never gets dark
You're only unique until compared
Come out of the cold
'Cause we're way too wiseassed for that
This house is falling apart
All is love
And it kicks, and it kicks like
All right maybe gonna find him today
Don't let it show
And all that I can see is just a yellow lemontree
One ocean to another, waves come crashing down
She got what she wants
Yeah yeah yeah You know you're made in heaven
If they knew just how lazy you'd been
You're stuck in a world of makebelieve and I can see it
When I feel the whole world falls apart
And each person I encountered
What's a dad for, dad
And oh, I've been cryin'
Do you see these tears in my face
They say it's your birthday
Whenever we're far apart
Her friend the stars dripping from the jewelled sky
Bought me a diamond ring for Christmas
Only in your head
Far and away whistle delayed delights 
And you can hear she's a beautiful girl
His greasy fingers strung together and stretching cross the sky
You've seen my secret garden
Watch and wonder as they come alive
And from the hard time living to the sleepless nights
Don't come up to me and say you like it
I feel like committing a crime, yeah 
Give me moments
Get the show on, get paid
Discotech You know she's gonna be there
They don't know how long it takes
Yes, I do believe what he says
And I said I didn't like the way he got things done
Oh oh oh, ooh ooh ooh
Why did you give up on me so soon 
Pay the piggy back, back,
Taped it up, The Reunion, a brand new cut
And baby dolls
You know you know
With my I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming of age
And you laughed and said I still know how to turn you on though 
Will a child find me by a stream 
A photograph of myself
You are a thunderous thing, wonderous king
A place that's built on noise and needs
Some people write the songs that really ain't songs at all,
Relieved and now we see the road 
He's just glad
I know nature is beside me, when he's inside you
Grabbed my bag and kissed my mother
And when someone else instead of me
Well I don't know what I'm living for
I know it's only getting better
The sky I've seen blue and green
You'd do anything to jinx it,
But hey man, now I'm really livin'
If you dig her recent work
You've been lonely, you don't even know me,
Staring up into the solar system,
Go Decatur, it's the great I Am
But when our fingers interlock
Ariella, , I don't want to get up yet
It's over, Good luck
Headed out to god knows where
Ooh somebody loves you
Hello my small foreign currency exchange office
Mexican waitress
You trouble me for money 'cause you've got to make a drug call 
In the high boots Oh yeah
Fumbling with matches
In an octopus's garden in the shade
I close my eyes and what a beautiful sight
Doin' stuff with the food
We have gone to the country 
Baby, ow, baby, baby
A whirlwind came into my life and he tried to rescue me
It's ok with me if you don't have that much to say 
Who I am, how I ever got here
It's far too early in the morning,
Bring, bring, bring your flowered hat
Heyo Heyoooo Heyooo You are the fortunate all the time
It's nobody's fault but I'm so low
You'd think the world is ending
I'm not so sure when I got here or how
In the nude in front of you
It's Jade, the girl of the hour
It's coming from inside her heart
Stick around, nostalgia won't let you down
Replace it with a UV light
Won't feel the same
Why did we hate her It's the great I Am
I'll think the bells inside have finally found you someone else
On an island in the sun
Ich weiß nicht, denn es ist mir irgendwie so peinlich
That you are on my mind
Still am your man
But the other half's at the bottom of the sea
Dear I forgot your name again
Make friends with you
These are the days, oh
Her love to bury
And we'll fight with fire, fire with fire, fire with fire
Which way the wind blows
I rock the cow girl blues
Walk out the door
Light my cigarette and
I says the comedy is that it's serious
Will you teach me now
Too much of your line made me blind
Changing your ways 'cause you don't know what to do
Here's a little song I wrote
Hard times, well all I know is that
Slip and slide on subway grates
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me
That love was so, so
And your head's in the air
Like a melancholy song
But still I'm glad I hitched my apple wagon to your star,
Her mother called her "Mary," but she changed her name to "Tommy,"
And in the evening she still sings it with the band
This boy really drives you mad
And I let clean comfort you from the wild unknown
Yeah, she's ugly, but she sure can cook, baby
I tried, I'll try to start again and find somebody
I can't forget the time or place where we just met
If you're lonely, you can talk to me
If one thing I know, I'll fall but I'll grow
I need this now
'Cause I love the gap between your teeth
But I'll do that on Mondays, I don't have to work away
I haven't slept a single night in over a month
You set me up with your girlfriends
Your heart grows cold
Their boats are full of flames
A brother and sister and a dogaphone,
Well, she woke up from a weird dream
Wouldn't get too far 
The spaceship
I'm feeling blue, 
You can start when we say it's a lot, I know
Ajust before you draw your terminal breath
Come on, come on, check it out
Get on the dance floor
And I've become just like a chemical stress
Were still the same
What are you waiting for
All the things I wanna say, and
And the world will smile with you
That's all you've gotta do
I take a wake up pill and fill with energy
So, give us a drink
Lets find some place new
Knees in my back 'cause we're flying high
Ooh ooh, I've been trapped by love
You will come down, you'll come down, come down
Bright eyes and subtle variations of blue
And maybe I should call her up
I will not call you back
Cause a lot of wags want to hear it
What I feel now
We wake up with the sun in our eyes
Crawl into bed tonight
And I am thankful for the love
From the time I fall asleep till the morning comes I dream about you baby
Your girl's a dollar bill we don't know where she's been
Well, he just drove off, sometimes life's okay
And climbing the waves
Yes you are my star
Well, I couldn't say
I get to wishing that there were two of you
You know, All of you know
They were put up there to keep us apart
The night outside is five below
He likes to keep his fire engine clean
Say goodnight and go
And when she kissed you on the kisser, boy, you kissed her back
Now don't it feel good
There's something special on my mind
Didn't have a camera by my side this time
Derramar no céu, se purificar
That won't wipe off your face no matter how hard you try
Till we skip through the towns to the bright, sweet, past on
Where everything will change, we'll give ourselves new names
Ring all the bells sing and tell the people that be everywhere that the flower has come
Imagine how the world could be, so very fine
Tonight we're gonna blast with the power of a thousand guns
And I give my money to my landlord, he was needing it
Just 'cause everybody doing what they all do
The river and the rock that fell there
Oh you never stop, you just collide
Those palms and firs that grew in your garden
Oh, yeah, now I'm walking on sunshine, whoa
I'm cracking my sweet love x
Every little bit goes a little of a long way
The warm water took me by surprise
And all the forward thoughts
And out my toes my little blue baby grows
I'm an owl with tired eyes
And I mean it when I tell you that I need you
I gotta get some
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
People running 'round, it's five o'clock
Got holes in my new jeans for you
And up from my lungs and standing on my tongue
He looks for clues and finds
And find the distance to the stage too far
His greasy fingers strung together and stretching 'cross the sky
But didn't feel so right
Good times around the corner, I swear it's getting warmer
And one new watch
Who's learned to love you but has also learned to grow
And Sunday always comes too late
From side to side
But my faith in love is still devout
Our love will stand the test of time
I'll do anything for you
All I did for you
Buzzin' in my head head
Who cares that it makes showers since you broke my heart
Music is my girlfriend
Do you think, everything, everyone, is going mental
Where I've been or where I've put my nose
Drawing the pictures of our lives
Always changing my mind to be a friend is fine
Start pretending
Flowery frocks, no uh oh
There's some kind of wonderful
And that was the turning point
But I'm just gonna shake
We're stumbling, tripping home again
And it's some kind of wonderful
I used to hover outside my truth
She's a beautiful girl
Cause all your wrongs are wrong and you can't make em' right
And nights of together
We were up against the wall on the west mezzanine
If I say I'm not loving you for what you are
Nobody's ever gonna
Blue eyes, blue eyes
So won't you please show me
Let me climb under your skin, oh let me in
Our haven on the southern point is calling us
But back to the matter at hand
Well, I should probably warn you I'll be just fine Yeah
I'm pretty sure you have a new girlfriend
And I know that ev'rybody
Some children are so strange
You're all our brothers sisters and our babies
One day at a time, sun gon' shine
I feel it all, I feel it all
Did your heart break enough Break enough
Yeah, you got that something
Friday night, midnight, Atlantic City
Everything's right
To wake you all from bed, from bed
Stacy's mom has got it going on she's got it going on
Though there were moments
Whenever you're underdressed
The moon is before us
Nothing can happen too soon
Do you know the reasons, did you wonder why
I found a tape in my back garden
We major, C'mon homie we major
Things are sent to try you
You serve a motherfucker, you serve him for that
The two of us are really one
On the fire escape now
Every pot of gold fill and full of distortion
A knock comes on the door 
Now this would be our best song you have ever heard,
I seen ya, I seen ya, I seen ya walkin' down to Chinatown
Don't wanna hear you say mayheyheybe
And nothing more
To something good, oh yeah, something good
An engagement ring
Give me a moment Just give me one shot
Sometimes you got to fight
When I'm crashed and got parts to repair
You take over the rhythm, take over my soul
Years go by and hearts start to harden
I know this ain't real, it's gone to far
I've been creeping round this town because
A little place like Kokomo
Lady watches like a cop
Kiss that girl and I will shrink up
Cause her family was wearing on her nerves
So tell me why our movement's out of time
Three little birds
Know that I been waiting for so long,
A room full of all of my friends all dancing 'round and 'round
So coarse in kind it can't be sought
Sit down, enjoy the show
Put it back together
Ooh so come on and hold me tight
You'd think the world was ending right now
We hang past right and wrong
It's not my imagination
I love the sun, it's your reflection
You've made me yours, with your lovely cures
"If he really loved me," she said
If'n you should say goodbye 
I want to turn the whole thing upside down
And you are already missed
We celebrate, we celebrate our love
As you know, I've never been a praying man
Look straight ahead, there's nothing but blue skies
We gotta kick that gangster shit
See  it could be you, tomorrow, next year
Four letter word just to get me along
I wanna try, make it right
Would ooh, baby, make me lose in the storm of the eye
All the once upon a times
So happy
And you will never stop me
I'm gonna make you wanna stay
We are splashing in the water to the beat
Give it all you've got
No I won't get by if you take that light away
With my best friend
I know there's no use
When you look into her eyes
Tonight, I'm seein' stars
I used to think maybe you love me
We're gonna see sunlight
Got my head tied to the sun
I am the white in the walls
And I miss the days of a life still permanent
How my heart laments
Are you coming or are you not
Just like everything I said
As long as I am with you, my heart continues to beat 
Cause I'll be in my own country, good and dead and gone to rest
She wrote me a letter from San Diego
It's the ride we take
I was just some stupid boy on a bus
Licking his wounds in the shade
Nonstop till the break of dawnin'
Unless it feels so right,
Should have known again
I been bummin' around this old town so long
In Penny Lane there is a barber showing photographs
Met a group of likely girls
What number is this, Chip
I never would've got here if I'd followed my heart,
I've got a cure, hold tight
Cocaine is great thank you more
We can start right now
Let's go together
When I saw you on that stage
They've always been so kind
I just can't believe the loveliness of loving you
He met his lover almost every single day
We'll defuse bombs, walk marathons
That we were meant to be just right
And makes the world taste good
C'mon everybody
And I know you're leaving me soon
Well, there's nothing more to add before I leave
'Cause everything is never as it seems
So I broke into my own old car
I think you do, we're lying naked under the covers
Everyone is slipping backwards
Tell him the story of a boy like me
Can speak the words on your lips
Couldn't see me without you babe
And finished up the game
Everything that I had till my feet went numb
Now I've looked in the mirror and the worlds getting clearer
The sun is shinin',
Eat our chips, come on, we've got loads
Yeah They're calling out our marriage
We gonna rock it to the top
I'll place a call around the world, operator get me Bejingjingjingjing
The last time that we got away with lies
And then you say you'd rahter see me dead
I climbed up your front porch
I'm feeling blue 'cause love is gone
We're nothing and nothing will help us
And I'd have never been aware
That people should smile more
Yeah, shake it up, baby, now shake it up, baby
Escapade Let's save our troubles for another day ooh
The next location is mine
Your looking east
The day expires
All the things you love
So go unlock the door
With too much makeup round her eyes
No good pretending
Out of the concrete or from window ledges
Do you want to like you know I do
I'm gonna make a supersonic man of you
I'll be back with a capital H
 hindsight, but how did they know then
You talk of them as your friends,
You're tellin' tall tales girl
And your lies are so much bigger than my lies
Converse boots and a look on her face
And when I, and when I call
They sing on and on and on through the town
He said to never look down
The pain ain't gonna stop
Be number one
Dance with me and we'll be all right pull shapes,
Can you feel a silk embrace
Baby, I feel good 
There's no way to say and there's nothing I can do", go
Now we're falling, falling, falling , falling into the night, into the night
Faced with the dodo's conundrum
Underneath your stars
Get them to love you
To keep, keepin', sleepin', dreamin' on
What's the matter with
Oh that I, was the fool
All I wanna be, yeah all I ever wanna be, yeah, yeah
A walk on sand 
Archery on Thursday
Baby anyhow I'll get another toy
I traced away the fog
Huh, come on
Oh, what a shame that your pockets did bleed on St Valentine's
It's gonna hit me with a big wave
When the worlds gone quiet
All my party people let me say one time
You look like the songs oh
Of the silver screen
You can't hold it in your hand
I'll bring you all along with me
The Carver and the bends
'Cause ten years ago we all strived to be twentyfive
One's a bottle of pills, and one's a bottle of gin
To have a real good time
All the colors fade
Dirty old shadow, stay away
Take me to New York, I'd love to see LA
And keep it locked up underground
Someone who needs me Hey, somebody that needs me
That's been inside my mind since the day we crossed
Where them suckas get it at and hustlers keep them chickens at
And I'm juggling all the thoughts in my head
There's a world inside and a world out there
Say the word, love
But it's not the fall that hurts
Right at the front door I recognised the perfume
Say goodbye to my heart tonight
We were born with sun in our teeth and in our hair
Leave the poor black child in his crumbling school today
Anything we've ever known
Dirty floors and sticky tables
Royal familys don't have time for that shit
Yeah my body's like Bugatti
Ooooohh MundiaLLL
Looks are deceiving
I thought it was over but it's not
The more I know it's true
But honey you know
You need to be careful
Big man yeah walking in the park
But being such fawn of a man I didn't burn down any old churches
Staring at the natural tan 
You should have seen that sunrise
Saving face with all your friends
It's pointing to Heaven 
My mirror disappoints me, and
Ashes to ashes and funks to funky
Well your laws are for dummies, yeah
It's like I never had to see it in your eyes or feel it
I don't want this feeling to go away
And I won't listen to their words
Warning out of something
Said everybody's gonna love today
When I'm down and my hands are tied hands are tied
I just saw Peter Parsons
Something is holding the light 
Before the regret you hold in your heart,
The rock swallowed the girl
I laughed at all his words
You painted a picture she wanted to see
So put on that dress tonight
I'll keep chasing it, I always will
On some religion that he said he newly found
I'll hold you, don't you go
Once there was this girl I knew,
I I I I just try to stay alive
But backstage back on earth again
In this moment, now capture it, remember it
It's so perfect, for a flying honeymoon  they say
And she knocked twice and we got silly and noone knew what would come
We're getting high, but we're still feeling down
A time outside this pressure 
Raise it's big bald head
Give me good good times around the bend
Shoppin' bags full of cartier forgetmenots
Te busque, te busque, Yolanda
But now I wake each day
Would be a welcome surprise
A tree gave me a fruit 
When your mommy is to cold to buy your pills
But that doesn't mean my eyes will soon be turning red
Well, I guess they just don't understand 
Now when the sun come up
Oh life, oh life, oh life
It shouldn't feel like it is ending
I got nothing to say
All the things we've written in it
I've got a sheet for my bed
As in people that mean everything
Filling in the ticket in her little white book
I'm getting it back with that terrible feeling 
Because we know you're younger
Now through the lines of the cheap Venetian blinds
Lover's on the phone but they got none 
Will you be there to carry my load
I've got someone new who's just like you
You can be Jane my wife Should I marry Jane tonight
Don't you worry there, my honey 
We're flying
Though she was born a long, long time ago
Rooted in between the computer games and cartoons
Ist da etwa jemand
There's so much for the kids to do
Why do you think you won't get none
Once again, I find myself with my friends
You've been all my thoughts of passion
The more you are with me, the more that I'm alone
A dream transmigrates its way in the dark 
Days replace days
I'm burning up with the puta's fever
But if I should break
Another postcard with chimpanzees
I been had and I been held
And maybe you'll understand, 
I'm always at your service, oh her highness
'Man about the house' with Paula Wilcox
You're wastin' all your time with someone else
Dancing downtown
Do you believe in love at first sight
Make a little love in the moonlight
My mouth is just a mush of drool
We're gonna flip the switch, and plug it in
When it's you I find like a ghost in my mind
Waking up at twelve in my clothes again,
'Cause I found some kind of fairy tale
You can do it yourself, but make your ends known to your means and your lovers
Into the arms Of anyone
You see me ridin' through Atlanta in a Phantom with the double door
Butterfly
But it was a turning point
And time stood still
It's time to roll the windows down and
And everything is quiet
And all the girls out on the stoops, yeah
It's okay It's okay
'Cause these walls have all worn white
They fill my heart with little things
The time it takes to get from here to there
Then played some shows in the suburbs
Neptunian blues that eyes forgot Blues that eyes forgot, eyes forgot
Drinks are pouring, girls so fine
I didn't wanna settle down
Line my eyes and call me pretty
And I won't get by if you take that light away
It takes the dust to have it polished, yeah
So put a little bit of bitter in your pink lemonade"
And pulled my sleeves around my heart
We come and we go
Sweatbox, laser beams, flashin' lights
I think that Bert Susanka made me drink
I like the way that you turn the wheel
I waited so long, I couldn't find a cause
I thought it was for real, babies, rings, and fools kneeling Babies, rings, and fools kneeling
She gave you everything she had,
He's shaking you down
Just me in a room sunk down in a house in a town
Alive tonight
With eyes closed
Got Chucks on with Saint Laurent
And I gave some sauce to my bestest friend for cooking
Tonight I'm gonna have myself a real good time
Hello Seattle, I am an old lighthouse
Let's go far away to the humming meadow
Big feet
Feels so right it can't be wrong
I can't even see him 'cause his room is so smoky
I kiss you and I know
And it makes me want to cry
Revenge is the saddest thing
We were holding hands walking through the middle of the street
The story of you and I oh yeah
It's all about your rotten lies
If I only knew your name
With the eyes to see it
Now all the secrets of old age
And we fight them with water that runs through the cracks
Baby I gotta get through
Out of breath and out of cash
It goes ooh la la, I see stars
And the light shines on
And I won't let you steer, commandeer the atmosphere, since you suggested running away Romantic
It takes some silence to make sound
Oh, to hold you when you cry Do ya love me 'cause I wanna know
The neighbours complain but that's the kind of girl I like
I'm feeling guiltier for leading you astray
Join the voices of our soul
Up in a tree knowin' damn well you'll never reach the top
And she'll say, "Yeah, well I feel all pretty happy too"
A little better all the time It can't get no worse
If I did know one thing
And I'm looking like a fool again whoa oh
I'm on my way from misery to happiness today
A struggle always suck it out  
I can tell there's something going on
Sometimes it rains, sometimes it pours
It's a very dangerous thing to do exactly what you want 
But I'll be back all around the way
You've got to kick it out of me gently
At the place where lost is found
But I ascend and serve my feverish need
I can unroll rip off my own tights
He's got a rolled cigarette
Oh, mirror mirror upon the wall
Oh Stacey, look what you've done
Take me by the hand and stand by my side
That surrounds us and we get stuck between the places I messed up
And his father's not the man he'd like to grow up to be
The rabbit hides beneath the ground
We'll leave the light of day
My roots are lying deeper than I ever think they will again
Sit around and wonder what tomorrow will bring At the end of the line
From the inside after you drive
There ain't a cloud in sight
Where will we be when we've come undone Just a simple meeting of the minds
When the cities are on fire
Be it true you ain't got nothing to do
As soon as he marries her then she starts
K  I  A baby let's get this started
Ooh ooh
When you kiss someone,
She's just the girl for me
Took me to Columbia, back then CBS
Will I catch the moon
Just give me moments
Dwelling in such happiness, your gift of purity
Play it cool boy
Well there's a house on the block that's empty now that Dominique's gone
Never ever fall on the pressure
Because the only thing you own is everything you lack
The lies that tied your tongue in knots
Oh, falling apart, is anyone watching
Swore upon the stars I'd keep you till the night was day
Baby you've got me tied down
I said we're solid gold
Let's bump the beats 'til beddybye
I heard it from a friend
And I'm so lost inside of my head
'Cause honey you know
And the stars are shining brighter
So keep your wick in the air and your feet in the fetters
All the way to my car
It's a shame that, did they get you they got you
Boom there go the treetops
I'm down on my daydream
But it's behind your door
A pretty woman makes her husband feel small
Dated some stars but respect their privacy
We can take it slow, stop me if you want
Better keep your head up, keep it on the up and up,
So I let it go what matters now is story soon
And jump between the boats
Like the gristle of loneliness
My head was full of brilliant dreams
Cause all I wanna be, yeah all I ever wanna be, yeah, yeah
And its the rain, not just the sun that helps it bloom
Showed no fear, she'd seen the thing
Looking for the answers in the pouring rain
Want to share it with you
With your job and with your life 
There's so much I wanna say
She's got super human lips, for super suction
If it gets to be too much
Man it passes right by me, it's behind me, now it's gone
We are golden, we are golden
I hear the music all the time, yeah
With facts and figures that never add up anyway
Fights problems with bigger problems
I was sure that I'd already gone
Is if I ate blue diamonds, pink hearts, and horse chews 
I say ya kill your heroes and
Messes with my head
They'll lie to your face
From the land of the throne
It was second class but what's to lose
When there's feelings involved Ah
You know I'm in control
Lost in a silent ballet
And there's this scene in the show when a hustler knows he's gonna die
And the windmill's perfect for movies and such
They can change the locks, don't let them change your mind
And I'm no different from the rest
So kiss me
Started hearing voices sometime in June
I hope that you remember this
Here comes my Chinese rug
Are quite well know by the evening tide
Inevitable orange 
To keep my soul all right
Out of words
And I wanna see you break it down,
I'm gonna keep it carefully
It's Friday I'm in love
I can't believe I'm back up in this motherfucker
We're walkin' into the fields
And you were happy for me
And you'll turn your head
I see myself on my deathbed saying
You're a sophisticated lady, you've got it all
Well it's guys like me who get somewhere
Change these rivers in my veins
I will always love you, baby
So afraid of getting bored
Crazy auto car gonna mow me down
I never knew there was someone
I'm going to get a treat from the ice cream man
Half of the ring lies here with me
They get nostalgic about the last ten years
You steal the show, no competition
First gear, I face the trouble ahead
Don't act right when you know you're dead wrong
Just lace up your shoes while I'm fetching a sleeping bag, a tent 
Is this last time my dear
I'd hope I'd be up 
In order to love child we got to be strong
Hmmmm, yeah
That you got the look to see right through me
Just to do this thing
It seldom turns out the way it does in this song
I was next to you, and you were right there next to me
This is the way that we love
I'd tell the children
I remember the times that we kissed,
To smile, laugh and flirt
Yeah, yeah
For years
And I may never find the meaning of life
So calm that wicked wind,
These dreams under my pillow
It's all in the way you are
You can hop on down and stay warm by the fire
I can see the meltings of inhibition
But I knew that's what she'd say
Late nights and early lights
I went over to the wayside
And seats are getting fewer, space is losing place
Keep your lips closed,
And as you feel it you'll know it's true
Scars of where the war was waged on words that we heard as a joke
Through the crashing sound
She is super woman
It's temperamental
That woman come to see you with her song so sweet
Loaded words and loaded friends
I'll have to say that I adore her
But you're still so careless with your words
I'm Andy Warhol with other peers
Who's the boy you like the most
My heart is on my sleeve
I'm startin' to realize lately
I just want to know today, know today, know today
Walking in circles around the core
I get to record demos at attempts to blow
I know it's your fault
Ramones
They've got two flashing eyes and they're colored why
I've been waiting Waiting
Oh no Please God, tell me we're dreaming
And I hope, your majesty,
If you don't leave the world behind
Bitching because Steven booked us
Is something I will never do without you
You live too far away
I've been waiting for, waiting for you, girl
At least that's what people say, mmhhmm
When I consider what you mean to me, It's everything
Stacy, do you remember when I mowed your lawn mowed your lawn
You've a quiet life out of town
You looked at me, that's all you had to do
And now the smell of these wood frames
Don't let the ladies fool y'all now, fellas
You think you know what happens
You'll feel it when the dance gets hot
It's only been four months but,
A little way to your heart
All the feeling
That could rock your world
A smattering of distant applause is ringing in my poor ears
I have been lonely
The future's here today
I'm still the angel to a girl who hates to sin
And I give a finger to my step father for beating me
The moon rise up and turn to silver
The kids keep on playing the driving game
Like The Switchblade and the Cross
I know the rent is in arrears
The world requires no audience
Biggy hat, little hat, fatty man, skinny man
I'd understand it
You can brush my hair, undress me everywhere
No girl, oh yeah
That there's nothing for the kids to do today
It's gonna be a bright bright
The line into this real life fantasy
I said something on the surface 
I jump over the seat
On another's affair
And I took out my tongue, twice removed from my face
I'm gonna kiss up and rub up and feel up
Had a big hunch that the world was a big lie
I sing about the tide and the ocean surf
And she's so sweet and
When electric hearts, collide
I hope that you see through your picket
As they carried me away
I want you to get cured
Remember that I love you
That we could be fallin'
I feel the same as you
I knew I wouldn't forget ya
From a guy thought too cynical for love
You had a black shirt on with a big picture of Nietzsche
But the blues are still blue
And about to reach my heart
And people should smile more
Like there's something
Don't you know I feel heaven in you
Look out, Sunshine, here's the punchline 
Ooh, ooh baby I want you back
I know exactly what you mean
We felt so far away but we were still in town
Then Billy Brown fell in love with another man
That's why I'm standing here today 
She's got you thinkin' you could never escape
Well I just take one last look around
Well, he says he's got a big boat
There's a river in my mind that's never still
On her way from the school,
These lines of lightning mean we're never alone
I got food in my belly and a license for my telly
Ooohooo
Why can't we just design
I don't wanna stop at all, yeah
Who knows this as Class Historian
Because I I am open
I was delirious
Got my brains, I got my ears
You've been thinking that your fun is all through now
I got no deeds to do, no promises to keep
We gonna ride down Bankhead, my nigga Bankhead
It's a nuclear show and the stars are gone
Come on to my side you will define me with a knife
If you take a trip through my mind
Yes, something worth keeping an eye on
But it wouldn't stop my love,
Another one about a babe from back in the day
I'm in love again 
Can't find the money for your rent
Don't stop me now
And the sign said "Long haired, freaky people need not apply" x
Lost at sea
Now I'm letting silence do the talking
In the colors
Wishing for the time of my life, she says
But we are young
And every time you feel like crying
After all these implements and texts designed by intellects
Shifty eyes pay attention
Just like a giant spotlight
Can you feel it 
But the stars are feeling colder
You're a supernova in the sky
Kids across town
I'm a good guy for a gal
And are their actions hand in hand with what you want to portray
I'm coming up, put down your cup, don't make me start without you
Did you ever care to sing your free love tune
So ignore the bad and know the good is to come
Or do we soon forget the things we cannot see
Yeah, I only feel all right when the VU is flashing
And I can get caught in the rain
Bordedom was my companion
"Wake up young dragon, let's go get compromised"
And I ain't got no time to kill on your dime
I know you�re gold
You bought all those lovely things, yeah
Can't get over your love,
Never gonna get away
Everything is made with the same old labels
Should I go, should I stay
I watch her as she runs
Everything you see
Eye patch tongue ring little black book
More than an hour at a time
How the magic's in the music and the music's in me
Livin' it up in the city
Now all I need is someone to tell it to, maybe that's you
It's like hey you were always there
And fuck yeah, we can live like this
One or two ooh's
Free to run and cry 
Come come come come
She moves in her own way
You don't need no Halloween
That is what my youth was for
Maybe I should move to another town
Come on, dance, jump on it
And if you can't be with the one you love, honey
This land is yours; this land is mine
A walk on sand, a fire I can warm my hands 
Everybody on a shoestring
Your picture
She took her winter coat from her plastic wrapper
And doesn't that sound familiar Doesn't that hit too close to home
But who's that ghost who keeps walking by my door
In fact nothing really mattered at all
Clap your hands if you want some more pull shapes,
When my world's been turned and overthrown
"There's no higher ground to stand
Working weekends just to pay for drugs
Duckin' every other blessin', I can never see the message
Yeah, we carry the mail now
Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah
Like you'll show me where to go
Put it back together yeah yeah yeah x
You won't regret anything we do
Le bonheur aux lèvres un peu naïvement
All the day I wait
We mirrored the world
You know each drop of blood I need
And set this whole place under water
All of this world
Become a moving target,
So when the storm clouds dissolved into thin air
Some strange machines repeating beats and thumping bass
Because you're gorgeous
Don't you Feel your dreams lie right 
The one where you told me you'd love me forever
Vicissitudes are boxing our heads
And my heads up in the clouds
They just may run away from you
Still you just can't please everybody
Hundreds of pages, pages, pages for words
I work hard cause at the end of the day
Mister Blue, you did it right
Oh let the sky be grey
For a cup of English tea
All afternoon then
And doesn't it feel peculiar when everyone wants a little more
Baby Lee I'm only trying to remind you
I'll make sure you get home safely
To crawl inside you
I feel like I'm gonna kiss you
'Cause it's written on the wall
So I've come to say goodbye
Do ya, do ya, do ya, love me
There's nobody lying next to me dear Yoko
Everybody's gonna hide out back
I can't wait 'til the morning
Doctor says, come on, eat your pills
I don't care what the whisperers say
What are you doing there
I'm learning to let in all the laughter
They'll be spittin' in your eye
So let's start it right here right now
Our eyes aligned, swaddled in our civvies
Someday your secret will be revealed
Hard to see past the window, facing forward, looking back
Watching how you feel
And the angels are fake
But if the summer's wasted
'Cause if the rain starts falling
My best friend Kimi wants to go with you 
I downshifted as I pulled into the driveway
Den enda regeln är att du ska ha sa javla kul och du ska
As long as you live, when you were mine
The lightning over the park,
And, eh, there's nothing else I can say
Take their cue from the slightest thing 
Tell me I'm not mistaken, give me the information I need
She is famous, she is funny
Tryin' to get his mitts in my oven
I can and call forgetfulness
And then we stayed up really late
Watch as snowflakes melt inside our hands
Expressing the desires that daren't speak their name
So nothing ever made it right Aaah
And I tell you all too much, girl But I want you to know what you got is a natural gift
Now I'm home for less than twentyfour hours
As we spent the day alone
Alleyways and payphone calls
And nobody's gonna take it away
Now where's the woolen sweater
They're all waiting here for me
I'll give her anything she want if it look good on her
All night day dreams 
Happy ending's gone forever more
I only feel all right when the VU is flashing
I can't fight your war, until I'm finished with mine
We're all digging if you wanna know
You keep covering their mouths, they keep on talking
Leave my sorrows in the sand
I want to grab you and just kiss you
I got misty eyes as they said farewell
The people there where dancin' on it 
Hier ist man nach Tagen erst zum ersten Schritt bereit
Been running a blender in a lightning storm
My mind is aracing, my heart is prepared somehow
A harmonica and a box guitar,
To the floor
Love has placed a seed
I will marry you on Tuesdays
To await and confront my big fear
Alright, already, and we'll all float on alright
And so I'm sailing through the sea
A phantom of the heart
Can't get no sleep tonight, feels so good tonight
But I make the morning dew glisten
Taking a moment just imagining that I'm dancing with you
I drew a smile on my face to paper over me
Remember through colors, remember through towns
Send me on my way On my way
And if you didn't know about us then get into the flow
So I could hug you like a man"
Now, honey pie
I need you in the daytime
So we stepped back, but it was drawing near
C'est plus dur à faire qu'autrement
And oh, underground, I wasn't that far from the tree
Sit back
Mm hmm On my way
When I'm coming down to hit the ground again
I tried to discover, a little something to make me sweeter,
Shut up and dance with me"
It's everything
To walk out and make me lonely which is all that I deserve
I'll make you say no I won't let them take you, won't let them take you
There's no other love just like this
That same boy that stood by the sea
Now baby I'm sure
I get jealous, but I'm too cool to admit it 
There's an empty street
Where the rivers unwind, rust and the rain endure 
I promised you the world again
I'd say I'm one step closer to being just 
There was a factory
So better keep your head up, keep it on the up and up,
We can make it last forever, baby
I thank the stars and the heavens for you
From your lips, a precipice
Oh, I sing but the world can't hear me can't hear me
He does not break any dad rules
It's pointing at nothing
The glass is halffull, not empty
Seven weeks of staying up all night
You seize the opportunity to get you some rest
Oh baby, I do, I do, I do, do do do do do
Oh and this years for the brakemen
Strings let themselves loose, my feet won't touch the ground
All you ever do is run and hide
Mr Pooostman wait a minute, wait a minute
I can watch a sunset
To the top of that cloud
I hate people that think that I care what they think
They say it was written
Miles and miles
But it was daylight outside 
When I'm dreaming of you
And it don't get me down, don't come around
This is all that I will say
A higher, a higher power
I'm having the time of my life
Standing in a crowded room and I can't see your face
My time will fade away 
When the morning comes, I will be all right
Hello Seattle, I am the crescent moon
What in the world you thinking of
That there's secrets that could be revealed with knowledge and philosophy
Said look at the clouds
You love hip hop and rock 'n' roll
I know there's a light
Please just let me go now
We can take a ride
I'll put a flower in your hair
You keep on dreaming up
I've got nothing at all
When you're young you get sad 
You're making it harder than it has to be
Holiday, far away
This season's changed since we've been away
On my wall
Stumblin' with every step I take
When you laid me down into your beautiful garden
You're in your head, you're all turned around with it
As if I could live off words and dreams and a million screams
Hey, I put some new shoes on
Who cares that it makes flowers
I'd rather waste our time together
Saw you in a crowded bar, pale with hungry eyes
To share this life with one I hold so dear
Ruby's in the afternoon
And as I continue you know they're getting sweeter
I see Neptunian blues that eyes forgot Eyes forgot
You always told me life's a dam that breaks, well, here it comes
Don't stop now, no no no oh, oh, oh, oh, I feel fine now
And I need you to make me take my nap 
Yes, they know that it will pass
We need it more than the air we breathe
Of people with each other
Deli markets with their flower stands
Runnin' round in circles all day long
All skulking around
VCR's and motorcars unite on the Seventh Day
As I hear your voice it sets my heart on fire
And I will love your heart with mine
And I hope you find your train
If you keep holding me this way
Next thing I knew they ripped me from my bed
I don't know why you say goodbye
And true, you might run away with it
I took a right, I took a right turning yesterday
And I'm high enough from all the waiting
Wishing to avoid an unpleasant sceeeene 
And the mare in the pasture
Whoa ooh whoa, I've been waiting for, waiting for, waiting for
It roughed my steel and shut my mouth
We'll be falling in love
You go from day to day
I want you in the morning, girl, I love you
I am somewhere in the city, I am climbing up a fire escape
Well you tell those motherfuckers
Do I feel all right No not slightly
You're the line in the sand
Too much useless information plays with your head
It's only one part of the story
That whole thing just really seemed too bizarre
Go see the world 'cause it's all so brand new
I'm gonna be the man who comes back home with you
Addict till it fall, fall, falls
I ain't trying to do what everybody else doing
Too easy to say no
May we never be stripped of anything we love, may we grow so gentle, never go mental
Dadeedoodadadeedadoodah
You're looking at me
If you wanna look like Rocky Dennis better drink your milk
Baby, you're a rich man
Sometimes I don't feel all right
That I have a taste there is no turning back
Recovering, tectonic trembling
I was alone, I took a ride
She says she'd like to score some reefer and a forty
I'm sticking with you
I don't know why I let go
I see myself hitting a baseball
I said What Fa real Oh it's all good
Won't you tell me, do you love me
There'll be love
We'll be rubbing shoulders once again in the sun
We're gonna break it to your folks tonight
Saying everything is groovy
The more I can feel my antenna just sensing you up
You're so much to touch
Come on, come on, the fun is just begun
But wait until tomorrow morning
And it's going to cause a crisis
Block after block
None of these remedies, I feel
And one day we could move to another town
What I'm saying isn't fair
You'll always be my girl Yeah
Got they bras and ran through they whole apartment lalalala, lalalalalala
With my old watch on your wrist
And I feel alright, 'cause I know tonight I'll be with you baby
I almost got drunk at school at fourteen
Child  the child
People who surround her feel the benefit of it
You make me feel much better Cause girl we're good together
You're the kind of guy whose hand's in mine
For they are breathless over you
Trying to swim but your sinking like a stone, alone
Friends help you when you're in danger
Remember the house we used to live in
It stumbled on the steps
No, I won't let them take you, wont let them take you,
So your fireman I will be
I said I'm blue babe
And the shame was on the other side
Everywhere I go I'ma have my own theme music
But it gets bigger till your horse is always running
But I've been doing all I can
And just enjoy the show
I can see you standing next to me
Which incidentally made Grey feel inane, so he set off to find a less trite identity,
Come on, come on, settle down inside my love
And any bitch givin' head, if she blow I know
For you to come home
And life's complexities
Nobody else is in your room
It's coming around
Oh darkness can be difficult like needles in the hay
You should know it's true
Till we run on empty
'Cause if you've gots the poison, I've gots the remedy 
He said, "If life gives you lemons, then thus god bade
Victim of her black magic
Can't seem to get enough
Dark damp has stopped where I once stood
Throw me into the sea for my ability
All on my street
Sometimes I'm feeling like I'm going insane
Yeah, I can't get it out of my head
I didn't wanna fall in love with you        
World, what you got for me
And for a fraction of a second you can't remember where you are
It fuels the lies, it feeds the curse
I'd rather dance with you
If you get drunk and vomit on me
When I met you I said my name was Rich
"What's the day What's you doing How's your food How's that song"
Everyone loves you
Car je ne t'en demanderai jamais autant
Watching the laughter play around your eyes
But it's feeling just like every other morning before
When seven flies swarm together
You live by the sword but you die by the knife
A smile, a guise
Your coffee's warm but your milk is sour
Do you care what I am thinking
Ooh, those girls tend to hide,
Fear is in your head
And I was possessed by something quite unfriendly
It's you and me, but I don't wanna deal with you
So why I keep thinking to myself
What d'you say
And were just like, how Rousseau depicts man in the state of nature
So let's stay out tonight
I'm seein' stars, I'm seein' stars
Nobody knows what lies behind
From shades of gray meaning that turn out so sweetly
To the fact that I go this break in my back
I can't figure it out, it's bringing me down
There's a whole lot of walking, whole lot of walking to do
We're on our way home
It makes me smile and it keeps my teeth clean
Shake it like a Polaroid picture
I went walking in with my mama one day
And I can see them falling through, almost feel them slipping through
When I feel that something
Yes I've been too long a rolling stone
It is her hour so let it be hers 
I said they call me Mister Fahrenheit
I let my past go past
And get away from here
Mama don't take my Kodachrome
I gotta know, when can I see you again
And stay awhile
Oh happy day, 
If those lips start speaking my name
I won't worry my life away
We don't believe in what the big people tell us
Ooh, now that the years gone by
I'd like you to fall for me but it would soon turn lousy and wrong
You don't wanna let the moment pass you by
I've been ghosting, I've been ghosting along
I just want someone to say to me, no oh oh oh
Up so early, feel so bright 
And some children are so strange
This is how we used to play
You pretend to know exactly all the things you keep on moving
You don't know what's right anymore
Where they'll do absolutely nothing 
No, I'm only getting started
I think yore saying that you will make me,
He's walking along with a soul in his lungs
To rid yourself of vanities and just go with the seasons
'Cause I'm having a good time
Then we raise our heads for the colour red
'Cause people are strange and you can never second guess
Negates the pains I went through to avoid you
That's what you do with no sunlight
There's so much skin to see
We all spit at stars
The rumble strip clack
Would you believe in a love at first sight
Your eyes are the size of the moon
We have a good time with you
And true, let ya get away with it
I was feeling the night grow old
And it's long enough to put the best of us on our backs
This feeling treats me so strange
And there's always something in the air
I'd have to get drunk every night
Measure distances with tears
But my friends keep on telling me that something's wrong
If you don't bless them with your patience
Gotta make a move or you'll miss out
Coming from the room next door
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
There is only one thing
You could 'cause you can so you do
How could I be without her
We can't get past the how are you
But you just try to stop me now
I tell him he should get up 'cause it's nearly half past three
And your skirts fall below your knees
And then we'll walk on you
Monday, back from the dead
Well, I have got a sister,
You've been looking good today
You burn through my mind
Oh these nights out alone
I know you're beating my heart, beating my heart
How much is required to set things right
There's a car
The things that I know I should do 
It's the taste of the chase, I do confess
A faded union that won't survive the years
That we will have to part 
And what better way to celebrate make it on over now
You better keep it in control or you'll go crazy
But you're happy, you're happy, you're happy, you're happy
You'll never be a better kind
Got caught in the crossfire
And I'm already missing the summer
And you're still mine, we're locked in time
Meant angry young men with immaculate hair
Oh you can be your own god if you want to
You make the call to make my day
You're thinking negative, nothing can go right
And fall flat on my ass
Is that I'm feeling strong
There's nothing you can do
Remind me how to dance again 
Nothing left to do but to keep on seein' uou
All that I want and all that I need
And you're riding through the city with a shotgun 
We're gonna to crash around, till we wake this whole damn town
You are so good for me You are so good for me
So slow that they'd never know where I'd go 
Homage to Venice, the home ha ha of the
Tattoos on his arms
Come to life on a brass spring
Sing it right back, I like it like that
If you stop staring straight through me
You got women, you got women on your mind
She says, "Where have you been I've been lying right here on the floor"
Countin' down the hours 'til I get to see your face
'Cause music is power, it's easily sold
I feel like I'm part of a book I've read
It's gone on too long, tell you how it ends
A wind so loud that we might never mention
And some tea
And when I'm eighty years old I'm sitting next to you
People are wasteful, they waste all the food
It means I love you
And if you need to tell me something once
There's not a day
Everybody
Some say I don't the play the right kind of game
Be of something his own make
Easy girl if you die then too so shall I
Then I just won't take it back 
I hate poopin' in public places but we all hate that
Inside of my heart you're here
I call to say I'm on the way
And you can be sure that if you're feeling right
What's a matter
Seventeen company men
See the monkey, do the monkey,
I'm getting tired of everybody talking and not doing a thing
Praying like a fool that's been on the run
The beauty in every inch
Say a few spells and baby, there you go
Se esmera, cora,c~ao            	        Do your best, heart
A bushy, bushy blonde hairdo
With my headphones loud
We'll have butterflies soon, 
If I had a scheme for everything,
And this could be the way for us to change
But I know things will be all right in the end
I gotta live on an island to find the juice
I've been dreaming of a true love's kiss 
Stay right here where you belong
Do you ever get lonely playing with your toys
I'm so hard for the rich girl
I need to freeze, I need direction, aww please
We shall lie and dream
Didn't understand
So tell me where I'm standing now
One day you're out, you give up the fight
That's what I need
You can see that you're being surrounded from every direction
Life is glowing inside you and me
The chewing gum, dream catcher Illi'
My sister she counts the bars,
And you'd better get out of his way
Do you pick and choose amongst the jewels for one to keep
Soldiers fighting with the Cong
I could make you excited
Pick it up with the band 
You have a hammer baby break down the wall,
If you leave me, I will follow you and bring you back where you belong
Watch the sky
Oh, you're just reminding me
I was on the wagon, I thought I was done
Soon, you will see the sun shine 
But hiding at a crowded party
I still remember she was like a princess
And walk on me
Hey, don't give me that face
Got this feeling that you can't fight
I spent my childhood lookin' at the stage
And there'll be sun sun sun all over our faces
Hawaiian air
And I wanna feel it too
Open up the dirty window
He's a regal man
What is this Are you some kind of hypnotist
I got some money in my jeans
Take them by surprise
And if you kiss somebody
Because you cannot know yourself or what you'd really do 
Every time I turn around
For sore eyes
So we hang all the posters up with jam
Pylons bust, right outside
Let me take you on an escapade on an escapade, baby
Yeah something
Nothing holds a Roman candle to
Learn a little givin' and stop
Until I can see your sweet face
Well, she crept back in the house at half past three
Do I start to feel like I'm losing myself
I hold sunlight and swallow fireflies
You'd say we're playing house now you still say we are
O'Malley, run
To be trying to call you
Woke up late one Thursday
What we are, what we see, what we are
He watched behind the screen and she started to undress
Though I'd be drunk as I could be
And you can just get on down 
Better believe that it's gonna be the biggest night of the year,
Oh badumday oh dum do dum de dooby do
You should start treating me like I was just the same as you
I can't look at the rocket launch
Come lick my balls
And you don't need me
Everywhere in town is getting dark
Before I head for home
I got nothing to say but the things I know
You feel so free like your high as a kite
There's too much, too much, too much love
Have you ever been to heaven at night heaven at night
Thanks for the time of my life
It doesn't matter that you're serious
My mind's tired, I've worked so hard all week ooh, all week
I can be a tornado knocking down your wires
Livin' with Louie Dog's the only way to stay sane
Is this the end
Somewhere back there I left my worries all behind;
You gave my life direction
How we'll be in love by the morning
We are all alone, but we're better off by ourselves
When our tellies are six hours away
There's nothing to say that hasn't been heard
I'm gonna try for an uptown girl uptown girl
It's just the bureaucrats who won't give me a mortgage
At the icecold water all around me
Bars start spitting cowards
She was surprised to find,
And stumbling through the street they say
New yellow lines that I earned
Don't stop me now don't stop me now
I've found a reason for not going out tonight
I set up a record player, and a generator
Rainbow colors in my hair
You will find those lingering voices
And she has to wash her hair
Lovely day, lovely day
Uh, haven't really talked to him, but he looks pretty, uh, down
So to speak's the uncertain kind
I came here with a broken heart that no one else could see
Make it everlasting so nothing's incomplete
Suddenly you are the one
From our mouths
My global position systems are vocally addressed
Nobody can take away
So very fine
To the story of how we learned how to survive
When the grand scheme plan keeps all these people wondering
Got a tattoo that said, 'together through life'
Living in a city of sleepless people
Cause this shit's just right
Are spelled out on a double word and triple letter score
I'm playing like shakin' under the coconut tree
It's a casual goodbye off the mountainside
I spent the summer wasting
For someone half as smart
She's been with every girl in town she's been with every girl in town
Tell me, you'll always want me to stay
The new frontier is not that near
You want some bourbon for the pain
We got live like it's the end of the world
You don't do it on purpose but you make me shake
I believe you mean the best that life can bring
It's the strangest, most dangerous place I could hide
Take your chances
Temptation's not a word until we've let it go astray
I ain't in the Klan but I brought my hood with me
Use your eyes, you'll know you are
Now it's payback
I'm a band in a show about a man holding hands with his wife
Hey hey mister man
Oh honey I'd swim across the Atlantic
I'm gonna loop duplicate my heart into a million songs
The beats yeah, they were coming out the speakers
Heavenly, that's what you are
In your eyes I see the eyes of somebody
Flying 'cross the floor
Every man has been broken
Would ooh, baby, baby, build up these walls of mine
We got everything
I ain't even know what a record advance was
She's laughing inside 'cause they can't refuse
Wednesday's gone
Sometime's shit won't feel all right
I think I'll get a job receiving people's thunder
I guess it's time again for me to mention the wordplay
Can it be we've run out of time
And come right back to bay
Oh drinking cheap wine to bossa nova
Resting our head
Let the song carry you on and keep you strong
Cold cold water, bring me 'round
Of Desmond and Molly Jones ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
It may be years until the day
The ceiling's spinning 'round like I've been drinking
I need some of what you've got
I wouldn't cause you any harm, I just want you in my arms
Watching you's the only drug I need
I'm ready for this, I need you all in
So let seasons turn
That you know every inch of
Yeah, they say 'true'
You have to watch out
And i know every constellation
That just ain't how you play
You look like the songs that I've heard my whole life coming true
I've been tripping from sipping the dripping dirty water tap
I'm talkin' bout blue eyes, blue eyes
Uh huh gon' work all day, work all night
I can't sleep these days
So come on make your move
Well, give me the rest of you, and I'll get the world
In the middle of a dream
I don't think you got this
Mistaken for magic
Come on go with me
Practice makes perfect sense
Do dah
Someone who needs me Aheh, heh, hey yeah
I was so, so misled
Don't want this to stop,
Show me that you care
Sometimes it creeps up on me and before I know it
But I feel alive and I feel it in me
Where trouble melts like lemon drops
And there's a rose in a fisted glove
Protectors of this band  oh oh oh oh
And parallel tracks of our tears
It's all money gum, no artists anymore
Kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss me on my lips
Anywhere with you girl is where I belong
So when I'm gone these words will be here
Me back again
Telling me there'll be no next time if I just don't treat you right
Hey, hasbeens
Sometimes I can be down like that, when I don't cross myself with you
She had to pose for life for all the scholars of art
Yeah, you know what just to do
I've been dreaming of the city for a long time, far from my home town
And investments fade away
Yeah nobody else
Potions, lotion, perfume to find you
She comes in colours
When the rainy days are dying
So let your arrow fly and sing
If you ain't got no soul, that's fine, alright
Now I got this pain in my heart, that's all
Oh, I'm walking on sunshine, whoa
It ain't the end of the world
Tell me that you've got everything you want
And when I give birth to our children
Never been a better time
It's all that I got why don't you show me
That is why I love you so much
It's a mistake to blow away
This thing is your mission
Don't try to fight the feeling
I waited all winter
I have seen no one brighter than you
I've got this banging in my head
You can dive into the water and cross the rivers
Uh, call the police and the fireman
Till I saw the American dream come true
I think it turned ten o'clock but I don't really know
When we're apart whatever are you thinking of
Well, I sincerely miss those heavy metal bands
And we're treading water now
Meant to play the penitent part
All I need
We all be sharing a river of love
Crush high, don't want it to stop
And explosions never make a sound
It rockets through the universe
Wanna run away, oh run away you and me
Like I'm floating, floating, up above that big blue ocean
If you think I wink, I did
I'm only saying that where I come from
In his octopus's garden in the shade
I don't believe in love
I wrote a letter on a nothing day
The end is growing near
C'mon we gotta kick that gangster shit
First place in the race
I don't remember what you said to me that night
They know everything, they know where you are
My shavin' razor's cold and it stings
Into a thousand pieces
Just please, give me a chance to say no
If I said "I love you"
Just leave a little room for some naiveté
Time I pressed my lips against yours
A lemon Now and Later
Walkin' that walk, talk that slick talk
I used to be your girl, girl
Are you prepared to take a dive into the deep end of my head
My heart would call and I would gladly go
My faith won't give in 
You can laugh this one off but it's not funny
I'm looking up for my star girl
And it's always
We can pretend that you're a star 'cause life's so very simple just like lalala
We were heading for at spin
Close your eyes close my eyes
That original feeling never went away
I loved you in the evening
Calling, calling, falling, falling
One more song for the radio station
In the end
The date didn't mean that much to me
Won't let you get in dans ma vie
You're every minute of my every day
I had one of those flashes I'd been there before, been there before
It's a perfect day to throw back your head
These days of frustration, keep y'all on tuck and rotation
And gave a wink and smile
We're falling in and out of love and then again before the bell rings
Gimme what I need or give a little sign
Oh will they talk
Everyday, so glad that I found you boy
And I know Mexico is south of here,
So find a place as this forever divine
Hey won't you show me where the money is
Watching all tha lightning fill up the sky
If you wanna have a good time, just give me a call
And both got stomach aches
I've been completely shut down
Although they did not feel, no
I'm gonna run like I'm seventeen, forever
And now I'm always home
And I feel good, yeah 
Wait a minute Stacy, can't you see
This world is a warm, sunny park
I'll stay until the weekend
Shines them out by day
Is it very big, is there room for two
Looked in the mirror and you said goodbye
If I lose my fame and fortune 
First love, heartbreak, and true love
But she only cares when she's got the time 
Gonna hold my water in like I'm Gunga Din
Das ist Wahnsinn Wer die Sachen in dein Kopf bringt
Look, we gon' break this thing down in just a few seconds
At Haggerty's and Swami's Inside, outside, USA
On the pretty waves
Here, I'll give you my phone number
How am I supposed to be that king without you
But I don't believe that I'm wasting mine
Beats something else, you know I never worry about myself
And you breathin' in
Oh this life is so confusing
I don't know what's come over me
Saint Jerome
There's nothing better I have to do
'Cause I got my friends
I can't help from cryin', I wish you were mine
Your favorite vegatable
We've got things to say
Never knew how much I didn't know
Should I look older just to be put on your shelf
Breaks tomorrow
I put myself together
Nights not up close still hold a ghost of our empty town
"Who am I to work so much less
The emotion it was, electric
I could take you to heaven
This man you call with lover's draw
T�as des chevaux, des poneys, faisons des enfants
They say ooooooooooh weeeee
Downy feathers kiss your face
Is call you on the phone
Got a tattoo and the pain's all right
Feels like there's something broken inside
Who you are, are, are, are
I can't believe I forgot your name
Payback the donkey, payback,
Let it be and come with me with the look in your eyes
Clean your hands and go to sleep
'Cause that can be so funny
Making her feel like there's gonna be a war, oh
My imperfect offering
Abandoned as a summer cat
Don't say later 
I could have read of your mind
You're lying through your tttteeth
Such a lovely cup
One tear amazingly
She's kinda hot though
I found a pair of broken glasses and finally I can see clearly
It is the beautiful game that you choose to play
How faint might that light become
There's really nothing you can do 
Soundstage in California, televisions in Times Square, yeah
Yeah, you know what I'm talking about
Oh no, I say, you got it wrong
Drunk, watching the television
Rather stick it in the background
How I lost my boy
I don't know why I feel so skinned alive, oh, oh
When one falls in, another came out
But I meant every word I said
And the stories that we tell will make you smile
I had a dream we were running from some blazing arrows yesterday
Here I am, completed my whole record deal
Sacrificing all the things that we had
Happy Bring me down, I said Let me tell you now
Heyla, heybahelloah heyla
Of love to the desert 
I thought a year from now
Why should I follow that beat being that I'm
As the dust clears and it all starts to disappear
Shake shimmy shake shimmy shimmy
They sent her to the front line,
I said what they told me to say
Not like in a book or the leaves and trees that shook
I got a house with windows and doors
Well, I woke up in a car
You know what I do Do
All the bitterness has passed
I will hold you tight so you know
Please take my hand, here where I stand
Wished you would have loved me, too
Humanity has no blame in this case, this big game of chess for us all,
The world keeps spinning around
I've been watching stars coming out of the sky
Can't you hear it all around
Let it be and come to me with the look in your eyes
Somebody misses you when you're away Somebody misses you baby
The elephant won't forget what it's like inside his cage
You're the only one that I want on my back
There's no way
Those teenage hopes who have tears in their eyes
Tell tell them you know, tell them you're great big poem
And you won't see tomorrow
I didn't mean to scare you
He holds no currency
And fall down again, all black and blue again
Sadder than the end of Summer 
We used to microwave
'Cause you'd be living in a world of your own design, undermined
Follow a straight line to the brink
You put him right on the X mark
I take it back; I take it back
The clown with the frown driving down to the sidewalk fair
And I'd never make it through without you around
While you're watching TV
And Jackie wasn't perfect but she did her best
Think back, think back, to the summertime
He's got a shot though No, not really
There's no tomorrow
We are smoke
Billy Liar's got his hands in his pockets
I still can't believe
Don't sell your heart, don't say we're not meant to be
She said "I got a problem with your shoes and your tunes
The age to get in
Of things that I miss
I can't believe I fucked up and made a halfass album
"Harry, you're going to be a lawyer some day"
Ease my mind
I tried to do handstands for you
Persian kitty better stay out of the train
Dreaming of the dolphin song
Let's see how far we've come
Dogs in the moonlight
And I can feel fire in the night waiting here
I don't feel like I'm fallin' 'Cause I'm so high that
hopelandic
Goddamn right, it's a beautiful day only you
I don't know where you come from
And drivin' away
But still we couldn't find what it was we were looking for,
There is an empty space in the chair tonight
That I gave wasted on a nice face
While we strive to figure out a way we can survive
Wander the great indoors
Tuesday afternoon is never ending
Damn, this love is skin tight
When we hear that song, we will dance
I got faith you know
In a couple of days they come and take me away
From the TV's buzzing in the house
Leute kommen mit Stelzen und Zylinder
But in my mind I'm havin' a pretty good time with you
Leave the slot machines on the riverboat
Reaching for something in the distance
Behind the stadium with you
This, this could be the summer, the summer of love
CCCCinnamon Lips, go powder your cheeks and meet your new beau, oh
Pow, pow, don't run away
I see you're dressed in black
We used to share the summers nights riding our stolen bikes
She says 'everyone around here's wasting my time'
And there'll be no search for time
Me to the night  say goodbye, time is up, fight the time
And I'm longing to feel your embrace
To the single solemn place
You're every thought you're everything you're every song I ever sing
But it's awful complicated and you're warning me to beware 
Now bugging because the label had just dropped Def Jam
Music is my beach house
Rocking in the dance hall, moving with you
When silly thoughts go through my head
Chop another line like a coda with a curse
We act upon desire to each a hand for hire
See the tears standing in my eye
I found you sleeping next to me, I thought I was alone
Can we please take this hour and talk about me
Don Quixote was a steeldriving man
Chichi parties
Scared of spiders, scared of flying
It's getting too loud it keeps on pushing you out
And just like the guy whose feet are too big for his bed
Time goes flying by 
Just to get a little closer to you
Back to my bed
To watch the colors change
And then they took my blood type
I'll have to lend you excuse me is this the venue
As I did today
Said, I was never young; I've always felt beguiled
I'm gonna chill the marrow in their bones
No no no baby music cannot last
We keep it rocking till  am
She is Superman's cousin
SSayin' words like I love you
Up to the weather vanes and the tops of trees
After all that I've run from, where the fuck did you come from
We're on safari to stay
And as I roll along I begin to find
First five hundred bitches went crazy we he let 'em ons in
From where I stand I see
I'm on my way to what I want from this world
The open road is still miles away
Were sour in the summer heat 
I was born a unicorn
Tuesday's grey and Wednesday too
Now everybody's gone, you pick me up for a long drive Pick me up for a long drive
Then you take a shower
So heads down, thumbs up
But you're still runnin' just as fast as the man says
And girls better beware
I hate killin' people 'cause I hate to keep score
When we are lost in the Technicolor phase
Whip away the sickness
Yes, we're going to a party, party
I've got no spirit for dancing,
I wanted to be everything for you
Oohoohoohoohoohoohooh
Do you hear me say now
And I know, one day, I'm gon' come up
The beavers are so cute 
I was wrong about Bobby, don't you know
But this love is ours
Last longer than more than half of you clowns
And I say if I don't leave now
I know
Of the freeway
We get down, get down
And maybe, if the music is right
Couldn't stop the flood
With every tear came redemption
They're gonna wash away
The Girlshapedlovedrug
'Cause I don't need your mess
Come back, come back, my little peace of mind
How will you know
I was walking along
At a church rummage sale
Like the ocean needs the moon to take the tides away
I can tell by your shakin' hands that you want me
But I don't know which way my brain is going
CNN, we like the Grand Royal, I write rhymes with the Coke oil
You're father pointed out that you said copy
Gonna love you every single night, yes I will
And I need you to please explain the war 
So many times 
I want you back
So have a taste of my bass 'cause the girlies got smiles
The invincible, untouchable, CNN
Third or fourth weekend into June, December seems to come too soon
Anywhere your luck was
Uptown girl
To let you trouble me
Shields up Shields up Bar the door, and keep your dukes up
Say lil mama
When will I get my chance to watch autumn leaves fall
The rain is fallin' on my window pane
Ba, bababababy, don't blow me away
We can hang around by the ppppool, oohhoo oohhoo hang by the pool
Sell me on a silver sun 
Where I know that I'm free 
'Cause honey, I've got nothing to lose
Seven stars in the sky, in the sky
And we'll stir the stars around
Should you be blown back
That's why I know I'm here to stay
Oh, the summertime
You'll never stand my fight
And I feel so alive
Feel alright
Give love, give love
So can we say
Let's get out of here
Where I almost did five years and then seven more
Officer Friendly's little boy's got a mohawk
On the floor of Tokyo
And it just feels good when you're waking up
Just to greet the day
But I'm a garbage man tonight
Ribena, I know what you're drinkin'
But if they don't see the quality then it is apparent that
Took me by the hand, dad
Now I'm crawling towards the sun 
Can't aget awhat they want to steal
The girls are screaming "Let us in
For I feel I've held him for all of time, and he said
You want my air
Play it through the air
Baby, you keep my feet on the floor
Hopelessness got some by the throat you can see it in their eyes
Dark times Gotta let it go because I got my friends
I didn't rest, I didn't stop
Into wine, learning, burning, driven deep into this maze
And if it's worth your time, I've got ten digits
When we were out drinking
But I'm no fool, I can't stand here betrayed
Jackie Wilson said it was ReetPetite
To feel the shadow and cry
Unrestful eve, I sipped on leaks and sat in the room had a grudge
Turn around
Easy living
Just a place to call your own
Phone call rings and your voice is desire
Listen to the morning music, cursing the alarm you set
Been there a half an hour, I wanna come home soon
Ain't nobody's business,
So cover your eyes
So happy together
You tell me I'm a real man
When I look at you
And it's not like I can't stand
It's a beautiful day 
And I love you love you
And since you're headin' up to Carolina
Very simple and true, like, you know, when we doo doo
And you'll come running home
You'll want to share it with your friends like a poorly rolled joint
To rent a display home
Why don't we runaway,
Taking for granted all of her smiles that got away
Girl, I said, ooh
The show isn't over, but I'm long since gone
He knows just where we're coming from
Things that are right in front of me
Escapade Come go with me, we've got it made ooh
Is all me and my baby'll need
Oh Is it real I don't know
Telling me not to let things get in my way
I want the best and the best things in life are free
Maybe you need more time to decide
The more you know you know you don't know shit
Build me a home from a cardboard box
So far away
I dream about you often, my pretty girl, babe darlin' you're so fine
Heyla, heybahelloah
I ride roller
It started straight off, "Coming here is hell"
I'm breathing new air
Morning, where am I this morning
Speaking on the themes of stolen virtue missing from the radio, radio
You ain't what I'd call a friend
To spin tales and bend truths through the evening
The catalog and the catastrophic smile
Life goes by so damn quickly for me
That's the cause, just because
It's all right in front of you
Know that maybe I will be okay
You were tearin' up the rug
You could seem to color your hair
Trynna get our head rights, get this money right
Now what would you say if I told you that
All I know is driving on drugs feels better when they're prescription
She says, "Inch for inch and pound for pound"
I love you never feeling old,
Well, work it on out, honey work it on out
Let's do it now, 'cause one day we'll both be old
Messes with your mind
Feel them licking at my face
Playing Sarawithnoh's favourite song
The sea of lava
My dreams would be constantly wilting away
It looks so good, good, good
We can dance, we can dance, we're doing it from wall to wall
In the end technology unto the world will set us free
Starts out easy, something simple, something sleazy
Don't let them tell no lies
Pull down the mirrors and pull down the walls
And waking up in the water
I gotta lotta old friends that are gettin' back in touch
No one will ever know
I broke free on a Saturday morning
There's a devil in that angel face
Two days, she's leavin' me again
A love they'd know 
Check the odds, was it worth the cost
Bird outside the kitchen, fighting his reflection
I was the boss of you and I loved you
Will a lady pin me in her hair 
It feels like floating
Let it all go baby x
The starlight above my hometown
Bass bass
You see, it's easy when I'm stomping on a beat
Yeah, you know it's not the same
My mind's tired, I've Ooh worked so hard all Ooh Worked so hard all week Ooh, all week
I'll be mine where I place my drafts
I start recovering
Well if I lived in Greenland, I'd still have Chinese children uh huh
It stands for hero, and the hero is me not
There's a black rainbow upon my house
It's all your fault, momma
But you say
Come up and fetch you, saved up for the train fare money,
Nothing else but you you and I
Don't need approval tonight, tonight
Shysters live from scheme to scheme, but my th quarter pipe dreams
Headed north on the Arabian sea
You been on too many catalogue sprees
And try your luck again, be strong, don't bend
And you're the funny little frog in my throat
Pay the donkey back, back,
If you should say we're through
Support your brother, support your brother Sport brother
And I can see them looking at you
I'm sitting here in the boring room
Father, I will always bealways be
One forgot to wear shoes
On and on and on and on and on yeah, yeah
Yeah you're a bitch but I love you anyway
Gotta kiss myself, I'm so pretty
This has gotta be good life
Love is what I got , it's within my reach
Wondering why you can't eat
I'm never short of new inspiration 
In the midnight, moonlight hour
Lady on the water, make me rich, make me poor
Ah sugar, dance all night to this DJ
Far away, let's go today
Hey, what I'm thinking of
He said you're just as boring as everyone else
Moon people going to the stratosphere
I can weep through my own midnights
And I got a bone to pick with you 
Happy Bring me down, the love is too high
It seems like every other day
When May is rushing over you with desire
Her heart so heavy
I get too tired after midday, lately
I'm sleeping in a dreamhouse
Rambling down the boulevard, with a fire burning in a wooden heart
And we in control of the whole damn place
But my love's too pure to watch it chip away chipa, chipa, chip away
So let the music play
I've seen all kinds of strangers
I don't need, I don't eat, I don't sleep
This world is going crazy
I got bruises on my knees for you
'Cause it's the only thing, I think, that's real
I'm so tired of having to live without you 
Oh yeah gotta make your way to the top
Live without your light
Payback the donkey,
From myself and from the land
Would carry through your laughter
At my door, at my door, at my door
She knows she's looking fine
Our bodies became one and then we so really turned on
No, she doesn't know what she's missing
The way that she does it, I can't get enough
And never need a doctor
And everyday I push him off and tell him boy we're over
I'll be back with my Superman action
Come meet me in the sky I'll be waiting for you
And the flowers that I gave you
Yeah we're all right here so you better eat up
We had it all and all was well,
Hard to talk when you're staring at the ceiling
The crust of a tan man imbibed by the sand
Stay here, my dear,
She was everything to me
Call me in the daylight, speaking of a future plan
And there'll be sun sun sun all over our bodies
Surrounded by some china men
I can feel your feet touching mine 
We carry it home
We will find that we're stuck in the middle
With your cherry lips and golden curls,
And the ground, it's closing down
Trying to get to Providence I know what for
Painting testimonial pictures, oh, ohoh, oh
Well you can keep on laughing behind my back
All of my days
I said, Papa someday I'm gonna write a symphony
And what kind of God would serve this 
Behind that crooked line
I've been here for years just wandering around the neighbourhood
If it's cool with you
And to go back to where I was would just be wrong
I'll be okay
You can trip
Took apart his old life
Trifling the slack, no head gating
Fuck with the sure shot
And love
All I need is a bumpin beat to bump away my blues
And there's a light inside of me
And Imma go down that drain girl
Woohoo ohoh oh
Ooh, Silver screen on a rainy day, Sally Bowles in a cabaret
Ain't got as much as you
And in this life we're free to dream whatever we want to
To live in the moment
When your lights have gone
And just because she is in misery
You know, I don't find this stuff amusing anymore
Let your blue veins show
Will I pay for who I've been
If I live for a million years I would be Right there to catch your tears
Are you free or are you tied up
A fella looking dapper, but he's sitting with a slapper
To my heart or to my mind
Thunder's getting louder and louder
Just tape the numbers to the bed
I'm a new soul 
My My Time flies A new day is on its way
My trouble raised its ugly head
I'm gonna snap back into formation
You know I won't forget
Lucky to be coming home again
Creeped out into the sun
And protect the wayward child
You are my girl and you don't even know it
You can tell by my smile 
You promised me a dream home
It's all right, oh it's all right
Put your hands over your eyes
On a highway
There's something I need to say
Your eyes, your lips, your hair,
I'll tell the girls that I'm taken
And I give my money to the bank for safe keeping
I was  years young
Memphis, ride wit' a G, Chicago, ride wit' a G
Come along to bring you the banana splits show
'Cause I'm looking up at the ceiling, but it's turning into the floor
And my thumbs inside your mouth
And times before that I was mean, I was mad
If there's such a thing as love,
Came down upon his head dodo dodoodoo
Did we fight, or did we talk
She didn't feel funny, she didn't feel bad
It wasn't 'til I looked into the mirror
Boy toy, sure needs to sing
I gotta find a way to find her
You'll soon run out of choices
Attempts to crack the party code
Is mine tonight
What are you worrying about
I wanna go there and never come back home
But in the meantime, I got it hard
You are always looking out for me
I was underage in this funky bar 
Just say you want me too
Star pa scenen vill ha dig inte dealen
See today, no way
But you just say that we're all spinning
With peace in my heart
You son of a gun
And it's never okay
Cause this is going to be the best thing we've ever seen
Oh but at often times those words get tangled up in lines
The songs that I heard, the occasional book were the only fun I ever took
And the waiting scene and the Sunday dream 
Check my email write a song and make a few phone calls
We were having fun, there's no harm done there
Of girls and their emotions
The sun will heat the grounds under our bare feet
It doesn't matter now
In another place, other space and time
The only child, my little brother was he
With so much left to say
I think you come from another world
Make love to you
I kiss you once or twice
Just waiting for you
My mother said gently, you can buy her a Bentley
See, I lost my clothes, I'm skinnydipping
And I watched the world being reborn, till one am
Everything's just wonderful
I hate to be honest but I'd hate to be you
With the last ways left to remember, sing
And that's the way
I'll be home, I'll be home
Just a few more months and we'll be fine
Maybe I need a little company
Higher, higher power
Yea I'll see you tomorrow
But if you want, we could double team you
You left, for your duty call
For sticking two together
We're all just lovers and takers,
All black with diplomatic plates
We can beat them forever and ever
Your western homes are locked forever
Hooray success hooray success
Starry eyed
And swaying like a smokey grey, a drink in the park
Don't do it, be happy
Peep how we movin' the rocks and wit' pounds of dro before I double my shit
But today I worked it out, I got something I can shout about
And tonight I have to leave it
She's got a heart that will never never melt
Until the day that I die for the first time
Out where the waves wrestle with the dirty brine
Run run over the hills, can't feel the bouncing balls around me
Aim high when the target is low
You never let me fall
An apple falls on his head
Sometimes I fake that I hate you and make up
Baby, anything you want me to
You'll be doing it a while, livers only fail
I know you see me, I'm just like you
And we be so happy there to be
I'll believe when the sky is burning
Will steal your heart away
How come
I know one day I'll see you all
It's industrial, work it underground
Say goodnight to gravity
Well I heard two men, talking on the radio 
The clouds and rain
Tries to tell you life has just begun Just begun
The wind that wakes the ocean For ya
Hanging out always till this starts
'Cause the kids at the shows, they'll have kids of their own
I gotta feeling
You are eighteen year old girl, who live in small city of Japan
Do the whirlwind,
And everything's going to pass 
But not the way that I do love you
The Candy Man can the candy man can
Just close your eyes, take a deep breath, and start another war
Let it echo in time just to get it
Don't stop, never give up
I've been feeling wellrested and healthy
Coming up to the surface
Bright light in my eyes, oh, this desert's a tease
And when I steal you gotta smack me 'til I cry 
Like a new religion
Whiskey or a gin, that's alright
His man you love, this boy you hate
Above the sky, I, I, I
There's nothing true and nothing's real
The only way is down, I can see that now
We're the kind of people who can shake it if we're feeling blue
And in the evening she's a singer with the band
Vámonos a por la luna en el cielo
But maybe I'm a little bit weak
Don't call on your brother, odds are he's here and all
A world that I built on my own
I want to take you far from the cynics in this town
For a ride I'm escaping, you're escaping
Wanna have some fun
We laid on the mattress and tumbled to sleep
I flow through this feeling
I really don't like your point of view
I need you here like you've always been
Long live love
Everybody in a hole
Devastator violates with dirty fingers
I gave you mouth to mouth like Resuscitation Annie
And episodes left out to make it all go our way
I'm getting tired of living my life like nothing's happening
Do you dream or do you sleep
Bring it all back to you Bring it all back now
In the middle of a dream I call your name
Never want to stop at all
I should walk before I run
You got me feelin' like a child now
Do it, do it, all right
It's because I'm ghosting your dreams
I mean, what have you got to lose
Cause the sights that I'm seeing are priceless
I'll always be your girl
I don't even know myself
Catch up with your life, catch on up
I know I'll be safe in these arms
You, you make me happy, happy, happy, happy
So come, on come on
Tryna find a moment where I can find release
This is a world premiere
Cause all my feelings
It was here just the other day
Say the word
She said you're like a disease without any cure
Love's talking to me
All kinds of names
The party's over, what was your favorite gift
'Cause it's used all its better days
I'll watch them bloom for me and you
The way she danced, the color of her hair
You're the apple of my eye
And put it back together again
You're so damn keepable
I'll send a dress to you
The sky of daytime dies away
And it's you I need in the summertime
When you're on a golden sea
With a Buddy Holly hiccup on a karaoke
You keep moving, stop moving, it's the same
Peel up off the street
Shake my arms, shake my head
And the dance clubs
And when we're making love
It's a cool place, and they say it gets colder
That if you go won't you please take me
Oh, love was out to get me
Now the spit's flying everywhere
When we walk along the shoreline
You've been locked up, and you need to escape
I can feel my breath growing faster
We dug for money, we shoveled four tons
Pop subculture in mine
Not a trace of doubt in my mind
Now, You got it, you're wow wow wow wow
I'll be the platform shoes, undo what heredity's done to you
And on a Sunday evening bells ring out in the dusk 
No way to say and there's nothing I can do,
I feel alive
Alongside my innocence I laid in bed awake
Tonight I'm gonna have myself a real good time,
In a heartshaped hotel room
But you're nothing like you seem
So I walked on pretending that you still belong
Go baby, go baby, yeah we're right behind you
Some say I'm paranormal
Open up your window just in case
We're just one big family
Fear's just in your head
Our train stopped moving hours ago 
They didn't know they'd been disabled
But you're bringing me out
You can sleep with one eye open
Thinking of a way to get you to stay 
In our hearts in our minds
Teardrops in his armchair
When it's candlelight I see I go insane
To say
Listen baby
I'll be good to you
About the house packed with people and their loneliness
You came like a thief in the night and stole my heart
There is no such thing in life as normal
Oh girl,
Out in the sun while we're all soaking wet
You'd go away and let me spend
Stockholm's cold but I've been told
I wanna be a billionaire so fuckin' bad
If we've only got this life
Remember how uncomfortable that made you feel 
Right now masquerade, master the mary go round
In the backyard
Why, I wonder, is my heart full of holes
With clueless guys but now it's over
But I need to find it
In the shape of an L on her forehead
I'm the cashier I change girls
The drunken dames
Now he's changed his mind
sie hat dich im Bann und entkommen geht nicht Ohh
This one goes out to you and yours, worldwide
To see through super human vision
Say you won't be coming home
Don't you want something else
I'll be careful give it to me
In the attic of a house
This is the kind of place I know
Oh, I've been sad
On sleeping with your roommate
And they're alright
I do this everyday
It must have been the way you kissed me
Packing blankets and dirty sheets
Two gondolas to carry us
We'll sit for days and talk about things important to us
Nothing else but you and I
I'll never let you go
Won't help to hold inside, give a real, give a real shout out, Matt
And if he smiles, it's no more than a genius deserves
Wake up, you know I feel OK
'Til the day
Express yourself, come on now, yeah, come on, now,
Let's get emotional girls to all wear mood rings
Summertime love in the moonlight
And people are impatient, they don't know how to wait
The spookiness of night surrounds us in trees
Gotta love that afro hairdo
Somewhere in the night time sky
Where the rivers unwind, rust and in the rain endure
It gets you through the night
Or they were counting down the ways to stab the brother in the
And wake up where the clouds are far
But anyway
You gotta love the sound
I'm sticking to the wordplay
Don't look down, so what'd we do
Ain't got any money left to blow
I love that everything you say is so funny
You got it, you got it
As the years they pass us by 
But even fools know here they're far and few between
Swallow pride but spit out fire
All I have to do is let it ride
We've got to change our point of view if we want the sky blue
Maybe then we'll last a million years
I said "I love you"
The manager arrived with two guards, that's an insult
I am asking for the planets to align
I've been waiting, I've been waiting, I've been waiting, yeah
Being poor was never better
One settles a score with a trip to the floor look what we've found
And you'll be free, yeah   
Baby, oh baby, oh baby
I'm getting to the point
I had to let you go
I'm the next best thing to "X", oral sex
Just kiss me before I go
As they surround,
The California girls and a beautiful coastline
Muck around 'til the end
And my reasons for the way I love you
Isolation is not good for me
I'll be the queen and you'll be the king
Even with the heart of terror and the superstitious wearer
Let me tell you something else
There exists a star above
Where all my thoughts are found
Hey, man
I said, I'll write someday the satyrs of old songs
So hold on to my hands
I walk into a club and I've found paradise
Even with the rest belated, everything is antiquated
It's time to turn into a frog yourself
Get up under your skin
Will you come, will you go
Steady my heart, it's beating faster, beating faster now
Getting off the train
And look at all the bugs we've found
And everything that you receive up yonder
Floaters in my eyes
Those lips and teeth that asked how my day went
One day I feel so happy 
Spending time
Man, play something for me DJ, cuz there's nothin' but love
Think I'll grow myself a big ol' hairy moustache
Ain't got no perfume, ain't got no beer
Look into your heart and you'll find love love, love, love
'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
Whether or not this cold front is moving in
You got potential come on
The things that I wanna say
There's no I in team no me in us no you in we
Sometimes I wish I was there with you
The girl at the window
Come on, come on
You all deserve what I am walking towards
I was there when you were sad There when you were sad
Baby, I've been waiting on you
Mm, yeah Mm, yeah
Truck driving the black night away
I say, mmmm, hello, little girl
Help to get me through
Stay in bed until Sunday
Only 'cause the sun shined once again
And my heart's beating out of my chest, whoa oh
The dream of all the bowlie kids that hang around here
Sprinkle it with dew
I thought I was going to be sick
You say yes
Guess it's time that I was quitting
Bermuda, Bahama, come on pretty mama
And if you would fall you know I will catch you
We get together
She got a shack
Anybody try to stop it
A feather in a baseball cap
To break in these bones
Rabbit or a habit Habit or a rib
Dying to take you away
Well I'm buried in my bedroom
You'll fall forward because
So I gathered everything I had left in my world and put it in your
It'd make me sick, sick, sick, to kiss you and I think that I would vomit
I love it when you call
We'll look to the stars but not just yet
And you'll say don't you worry your pretty little mind
Y dale a esos hijos de puta un sonrisita
Seated here by my side
Everything's gonna get lighter, even if it never gets better
When my face is chamois creased
And the bright light of salvation
Love was out to get me
All that I've ever was,
Yours sincerely wasting away
You know they don't speak to me
Throw the phone out the window
So what if I break down
This world keeps spinning and there's no time to waste
But when the wind is in your hair you laugh like a little girl 
Waiting to take you away
You know it only takes two words 
And all your thoughts been left to drown
And though she knows it isn't real
To the jungle through the night forever, uh
We watched the sunset from our car, we all took it in
I know a nigga seen me and how my change is laning kid
She got very tired of picking up girls,
If I knew how you do it to me 
From the age of the dinosaurs
Oh I've tried boy
The poison then could reach your heart from a vein
I try to compensate her lack of love with coffee cake
I thought we were all your children
Where have we gone, It's been so long 
Of a bus heading out of town
But I don't think right now you care about anything at all
And river, it flows
The Patient, the Patient fall
It's alright I'm getting dizzy just enjoy the party 
And what I really want to do tonight
All my youth, the young offender
Winter legs give me heart attacks so take it off with laser, so it never comes back
Climbed to the roof to see you if could fly
Let's blow this ugly, ugly, ugly little world
He's got me runnin' around the office like a gerbil on a wheel
We still have to take it slow
Let's fall, look where we land
With friends like these, well who needs enemies
Kissed in the moonlight
Just an itty bitty little bit hot
And I was afraid when you kissed me
So I'm turning, turning a deaf ear,
Something might last
I'm in, I can't get off
I said go, down to the sea
It's a funky beat
Bite your face to spite your nose,
And we'll throw it away 'cause we don't need anyone
Just say yes do it now
From your mouth to your hands to the floor you're babbling syntax
He's a heap of junk that pours from his top drawer
I get kind of hectic inside
Cause love is a marathon
Pop and lock together, ZZt brrt zzt brrt
Before you came around
I rock too fast for love, I'm footloose in my Velcro shoes
I still want your love
I'm just trying to make my way
Singing songs loud on the way to the game 
A double kick drum by the river in the summer
When skies are grey, even when there blue
Now she's getting off the plane
Or does everything just out of reach seem just too far away
This is gonna be, this is gonna be, this is gotta be 
Turn everything red and the dream is complete
Still wrapped inside your rubber as I wriggle at your feet
Nearby a parkbench in the sun
The house might burn down, and it's all my fault if that puddle doesn't get me wet
Just 'cause you think it,
Tone zodiac in tune, with the fossil of our themepark
Author of the moment
'Cause I knew I'd never see the ground
Well do you wanna dance under the moonlight
And when we are apart
Some people write the books that tenderize their names,
Hello big family who's gonna cook the noodles today
I spend with you is the new best day of my life
Till what I want and what I need
Doesn't matter what she does
He says, Why am I soft in the middle now
How will I get her to strike a pose
I can feel the summer sending signs of fall
Behind the craze there's a pretty sunset
I know I'm always drunk as drunk can be
Oh, won't you shine, shine on
And it'll be love love love all through our bodies
I see you crawl, now you stand tall
The tunnels all around me
Ooh, woo, ooh It's the reason why my heart's been racing
Till you tell me that you'll be in my life
We could drive your car through the east end streets to the city
You became a legend
I got a question for you, ooh, ooh
And faith is growing thin
Go ahead with your dreamin'
So tell me nothing matters less or more
I think you'll understand
Trying to get home find a phone
Someone please say that it's okay now
To call a friend of mine
Cause in the end they'll judge me any so whatever
Wonderful night falls
The youngest was the most loved
The colors are bright
I don't even care, no, I don't even care, no
Became procurer of young girls
Ever since I met her, I keep thinking
When you were just a baby
And it won't take flight
Crimson and clover Our house in the middle of the street, why did we ever meet
Wake up it's a beautiful morning
My shrink says I'm witty
What you want is just outside your reach
The smokestack spitting black soot into the sooty sky
So what's my line  shake it baby
I know that you're smiling, baby,
Would I get up off the floor
We are bound and marching to an ever static distance, static distance
'Cause every time you hold me in your arms
He starts running beneath the awnings
Who's got everything
Desmond lets the children lend a hand arm leg
Tell me darling can I get a break, somehow
I've got this feeling, so appealing,
Say I've never been stately
Give me hot, hot love around the bend
Why must I be a teenager in love 
And our daddies took a ride
I drank the water and I felt alright
Lurking there beneath your feet
I'm seeing a thousand stars
There is a feeling I love;
Everybody fades away
Throw it on the fire
I know, you'll say
And if one day I should become
So don't pretend that you don't feel the pull
I have been treated so badly, baby
We play in a room where the mix isn't right
You cannot find the light Light
Well, now I'm back at home and
When guilt fills your head
'Cause I know gold is just a trick of light
Been working and put on good habits
So many trips in it
But with a little bit of money we could buy us a car
It's just the end of the world
Open up both your eyes
Goddamn, I'm glad that I survived
Ain't got no God
Grow and grow till tall
And your man watching from the trees
You're afraid to break some bones
We gotta rock, rock, rock, you get us rockin' the house
Why must the children play in the streets
Cheer up, sleepy Jean
A place where they will never find
Glimmering, glistening, I'll see her tomorrow night
Friends go out and grab a snack
Wish I could say to you 
All of her boyfriends gonna make her feel fine
We've got our feet on the wire, talking 'bout flying
I hope tomorrow you'll find better things
Be right back after this 
And something without warning, love
Here's wishing you the bluest sky
He buys her diamond rings, you know
If your friends like a certain you, that's who you've got to be
I don't like girls the way they are
I know every line
Really high into the sky
There's this one word, it's called comfort
Sources say that senses are your friends
I turn myself out, outside and in
Licks her lips they're something other Something other
And we can dance Come see
All right, all right
She's a hurricane in all kinds of weather
We were destined to live out our lives
Oh, wherever I'm going, I'm already home
Who am I to dream Dreams are for fools, they let you down
It's the truth we all been wrong
We'll turn up the heat as we burn up you boxes
But it'll be back tomorrow same time again
So if I survive, then I'll see you tomorrow
Yeah, oh come on
But we are young, we get by
Trust me, those days won't be mourned"
Pay the camel back, back,
We're the dream boys baby and we'll make you smile
Sick flow inundated with the doc bills
Putting my life on the brink
Just give them back to me please
Let your body sink into me
And I hope you miss me too
The SUBLIME style still straight from Long Beach
I've been everywhere with you hey
Can't help but love, you know
Let's go out and feel everything
If you ever need me
Sure is the greatest thing 
Snow banks and drifts down the hillside for you
Parliaments
Electricity
Your all mine
They're in the car on the highway
Ain't nobody's business Ain't nobody's business
Sprayon dust is the greatest thing 
Nothing left but pray
I love my God
Only you make me feel this way
CNN, Network Channel 
Bring it all
The revolution wasn't bad
Here we go again, another drink I'm caving in,
Your beauty took my breath away,
I don't feel so unfortunate
And though I walk home alone
And I've been watching stars coming out of the wall
I've got a pencil full of lead
If you'll be my bodyguard
Lucky to be coming home someday
Well she blows 'em outta the water like you never seen
Good evening
I'm making out tonight, with my computer
Let's crash at your place tonight
What you waiting for
My friends all crazy
I said I'm blue, baby
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
I got the power
Wake up to show me what I could not
And this'll help things turn out for the best
Creating it right now
I'll go out, get drunk again
Well, it all seems a little abrupt, well no, I don't like this change of pace
With a heart full of mess and lore
Tell 'em to buzz off your nutz we don't care what people say dudes who critique clothes are most gay
We live in a free world Free world
Oh yeah, well, 'cause you Ooh, ooh, ooh ooh ooh
We are doomed but we wanted more
Typically terrific, busy and prolific
Move outta' the way man, domdee
You already know what it is
It's neither here nor there, but shake your derriere
Oh, let all my memories be gone
Be easy on the kid
You'll sigh and crack a whip for us
That really reminds me of money
We search vegetation
Yeah, I don't fit the shoes
I'm going away
I'll never get to tear your clothes off on the photo copier
You don't know who I am
The night air breathes
Lloyd still got them polaroids
That took  years in the make
My love is true
I look down below serenade the world
And open hearts with clear content
A lifetime is short and death is so long
And if I should falter, would you open your arms out to me
Walk my bare feet Walk my bare feet
Look at me, boy, so what is fate to say
Don't take it as a sign
Don't want to break her crown
You You baby, you
You're coming around
But I must get from there to here
Sing along lil' mama you ain't gotta worry 'bout no drama no I'll provide for friends and fam and fans
I painted you on my toes,
The breath is daffodil
I dream it all the time, girl
Mark the places in my book
I would have liked you anyway Would have liked
Fireflies and the stars in the sky
The smell of  just waiting for you
Don't you worry, we'll all float on alright
With this slight
It's you and me, we could get out of here
I can not believe my eyes
And I love that here you live with me
She was struggling with bags from Tesco
I understand
Then winter moves into summer fires
Lisa likes brandy and the way it hits her lips
I can't really breathe, but I feel lighter 
I know your eyes are just for my but t
Don't give in, don't give up, don't pack it up, stop cracking up
Roll out the map and mark it with a gin 
He said I gotta get up, life is more than suicide
She wears a new dress everyday
I'll miss the catch if they throw me the ball
I want you to know
'Cause we've gotta figure out
And cheers rolled out and I thought early of tunas in tenison's tubs
It's not what I say, it's what I do
I just love what you've done with your hair oh yeah
You came over for a while
That the morning star of a prince
But my feet won't dance no more feet won't dance no more
When you gonna do some damage, little brother
Get carried away
Then it's a beautiful thing 
Woohoah, love, love, love
That you left your land, to trade for a place, so far away,
And I don't know what to do
With a beautiful highway
As he steps outside
And I'd rather be home in our bed
I know it's love that's got me feeling OK
Yes, king kong on ya chest
That's what they don't know, mmhhmm
You come to throw me
Photographs and stupid fights
Repetiton to work
Jump on in, the water's fine for swimming
I am floating away
It's only us, it's us right now
If you touch me you can never go back
Cell phones clenched along
Never really knowing it was always mesh and lace
Never lets go, never lets me grow old
One day, I'll be stepping
She seemed like an alright girl
I like what you say
Is it me, or are they younger every night
Than here with you, it's perfect
On a highway, on a highway
What are you whining about
Gonna make, gonna make, gonna make, gonna make it, make it, make it mine
Over years spent tracing, wondering how you left your track
There's tension in this room, 
That makes you wanna dance  don't it make you wanna dance
I got a dalmatian, I can still get high
His eyes begin to flood
But that's OK I'll be president someday
It's pointing to Heaven
Some people write the songs that stay inside our souls,
First time in the backyard
So go ahead and take a picture
To keep his girls alive
I'm in love with Stacy's mom, ohho ohho
I said, "Where have you been I've been waiting for you"
And I hope, I hope you're arranged out"
The tree by the river 
And everybody knows its name
But separate's always better
I got a long, long day ahead of me
I live out of state in a mobile home
I'll make my own way
If you let her go, she'll move on
Oh, the country road is a boulevard
I look for work today
But now I'm shoved through subways 
Cause a scene
Baby, we're aging with time
Believe me when I tell you that I've been persistent
I could see into your window although you're far away
I'm getting tired of living like I'm dying while the world is moving on
Walk away 'cause you're breaking up the girl
Possibly in another mind
Let 'em wonder how we got this far
She wants to know if I approve of the dress
I can't do everything
Dancing on a Friday night
Run, baby, run, don't ever look back
I break all the rules like Evel Knievel
I see you dancing slow
I'd jump up and down and hope you'd toss me a carrot
In the city, in the city tonight
I was biding my time
A duotone on the wall
Yeah yeah yeah, la la la, la la la la
It only makes it worse to live without it
Whatever don't break me amake me stronger 
Take care
I see friends shaking hands
You won't be stopping
Pretending the echoes belong to someone
Tonight's the night to cross the line
It's five minutes to midnight
And are you mine
If you say, I'm always yours, ooh
And let you settle down Let you settle down
Nouns and books and show and tell
To lighten up I'm gonna tell 'em that
Say man
Some days I feel like crying
Just can't let it go
How you make it sparkle and glow
Do I look to the other side
Not just who I am but the pink in golden land
We major, c'mon
I don't think straight with nothing to prove
Molly lets the children lend a hand foot
This is no broken heart
Don't touch the laughter and away we go
Don't you love them enough to stay
Since you walked right out the door
I guess I've always needed
Maryanne, do you remember
You are fighting for
Do it for the monsters under your bed
Well I didn't mind, I didn't mind, I didn't mind
Saw you hangin' from a tree
Oh what a lovely time 
When I get myself home to my bedroom,
It wasn't hard to find, you painted flowers on
No more destination, no more pain
But things like bad timing just won't wait
He's got to keep his nerve
We'll come dancing and we'll make you sweat
It's Friday night and I ain't got nobody
One as stunning and bold as Scarlet used to be
To go away and not look back
And I can't breathe
'Cause it's one thing to remember
And maybe even you can feel it too
And I need you to sit me on your lap 
The closer that you get
As long as I got you, baby 
Not hours or days
The afternoon in a cold hot air balloon
Down on Lexington they're wearing
With the water rolling in
'Cause I know that you feel alone
Night drains just to wake in the end, it's always fake
The way I saw the world when I was young
Seen enough, make a motherfucker scream, "I love myself"
Doctor Jones, Jones,
As long as I know I have love I can make it
Illinois in it ran from the Ronald Reagan toll way
The native has returned
Fake, fake flowers
You're always there for me, now you're with me in dreams
Gave me back my feelings
The cancan such a pretty show
Maybe it was rushed
If we believe you then you're successful
And I'm shitfaced
And it be Love love love all over her face
I'll give you my only love
I don't think you even realize baby you'd be saving mine
Why do I have to be bored with being foolish and young 
You can't because you're working
Living our life
Though the world will tell you it's not smart 
A high roller
Held its breath so I could see
We only get one chance at this
Maybe sometimes, we got it wrong, but it's all right
We have the right combination
And I'll promise to fight the wind and waves for you
Dallas, ride wit' a G, and Houston, ride wit' a G
I was a kid again
From now on I'll show my weak spot
Whatever gets you through the night, it's alright, it's alright
There's a reason for the warm sweet nights
Very fine Imagine how the world could be, so very fine
Like a fresh manifestation of an old phenomenon
Staring up at the stars that aren't there anymore
And I move slow
In February air
Would it take a bakers dozen to get my point to you
But it's gonna take money
You're still miles away
Don't want to miss what I'm looking for,
Put a penny in the slot and count the swans through a telescope
Because I'm mental, be gentle, be gentle,
Be it true, you ain't got nothin' to do
We are getting better
Their souls are crumblin' like a dirtclod hold
Traveling by choochoo train
If she wanted to remain inside the family home
Well, since time had a mind I've been lazy
Seven weeks of feeling guilty
But nothing ever happens and I wonder
Our differences would be the end 
Won't you knock me on my head
The illusion of fun
Now if I lived in Ireland, I'd have some Chinese children
Clear away the clouds inside my head
Jump in the line, rock your body in time Somebody, help me
As night becomes the sun to rise
I wonder how you touch yourself and curse myself for being across the sea
To a mind consumed by brass money
Everything is serious and everything is fatal
Nothing made sense
Once I have found the words
We're running out
She's the midnight pick of the day, yeah, yeah
Life, oh life, oh life, oh life,
Do the chicken payback
I feel the love that's really real
Girl, I gotta have you
Hey, now, you're an all star
We know what's up, the river will flow
Walk, walk, cat, walk
It makes you cry
She saw me sneaking out the door
It was such a surprise,
That you would walk away
Singing we'll fight fire with fire, fire with fire, fire with fire
A light that is fine and is filling the cryingest eyes
Says as long as we're here everything is all right
Out on the town we went 
Another chromed out gat
All drum rolls and applause
She's got you wrapped up in her satin and lace
Guess I miss your touch
When we come running
For my boys in blue in case of an emergency
And I've forgotten what food tastes like
Selling subtleties, it sickens me
And you should follow through to make it alright
Change, changing the way
I ride rollercoasters I try all the cultures
Boy you fill me with so much joy
Now I know not to go through that again
"I've been hit, this is it, this is it"
I'm all tan and smiling and running from rd base
I'm windin' up with none, just zeroes, no 's, just space with no air
We can be together, if you want it
Come back, come back, my little peace of mind
She said, "Oh my sweet goodness wish you could be here every time
In the silence I hear your fading call, in your eyes I see and feel it all
My face as I'm dying to figure out a girl
Absentmindedly makin' me want you
Ain't nobody gonna replace it
We all want to go with the breeze we will blow
Skipping and a jumping, yeah yeah
Just follow the seasons and find the time
Did you think that I've been foolin' around
And not a single tummy around me would know what hungry was
Watch me overcome what I'm running from and change the tune
I believe that it's called al fresco
We are moving as one, we align with the stars
An honest verse of longing
Shook my fist in my own face and said I'll show you who's the best
Mm get high with a little help from my friends
Shake shimmy shimmy
She told me she loved me like fireworks
My neighbor told me that I got bad brains
What turns diamonds into dust
Girl, I've never loved one like you
President Bush doing takeover
I can almost make out the surface
If you're vaguely attracted to rooftops
And it should be where it ends,
'Specially when I'm in a park
You get more
'Cause I couldn't stand to face you
You're gonna see the reason why
Here it comes, here we go 
Tonight, to the stars
Can we forget about it
My love will turn you on
There's nothing left to rise above but you
For you, ooh
Have you ever made love to a beautiful girl hey
Who's out of this world
Until I'm just knocked right off of my feet
For we are all breathless without you
Thier watchin us walk
And god I'm good at it, I'm so spot on
Call on a Monday, come on a Tuesday
Heartbreak comes rollin' in like a storm, sooner or later
What's up with you
Ooh, I get the shivers
And I'm not only among but I invite you all to come
The taste of summer sweetness on my mind
You're shaking my confidence daily
I can tell you what they say, haters, if you wanna know
So the sun always shines in the magazines
Tonight we're gonna climb the ladder of a thousand rungs
There's more to life than this
You're better off leaving town
Love for those who gotta make a livin' movin' muscle
Your nightmares only need a year or two to unfold
When I'm lonely, well, I know I'm gonna be
Óró mo churaichín ó Like stars burning holes right through the dark
Watch me ride on you On you
I see how you like to run
Don't need a gun to blow your mind, oh no, oh no
What can I say This house is falling apart
Woooohwoooohwoooohooh
So overjoyed at the love that's so alive
I have been crazy
Because I pitied all mankind
There's something I can feel when I breathe
The game I used to play
Hanging out on the hooks next to the window displays
For my head for my heart for it's true x
Like heaven needs more to come in
Was filled with darkness
Then maybe place all your winning on an outsider
We got it everywhere
All my loving, darling, I'll be true
And someday maybe make of me an honest man
The things she does for me
Do it in slowmo as the day unfolds
To the farm like the others said
Roll your eyes when you look at me
And I remember, you remember when
You're such a lovely lady
Not that I'm aware of
And it's the time we waste
My My Time flies Maybe we could be there soon
'Cause we're all in this together
Let's go for a ride
I have a love
Payback the monkey,
Sugar dumpling and muffin baby
Boy, we've had a real good time and
We could stick around and see this night through
Maybe I wanna do what bunnies do with you 
Never thought it would come to a goodbye
There I was, it happened fast
Oh, I lack what the world can't give me can't give me
Complacent and miserable
River water, holy water
The Jehovah's are standing by your door
I'd look psychotic in a balaclava
What's you're persona about this Americana
Cet homme qui pique, sa force hippique
Money got no hold of me
The dance of the cosmos shows
I was a man but now I'm only a child
Mmmm, you're my little girl
I just wanna be the one to make you fall
Gave you a minute
And let me live my life
I've got a fever baby, it's your love, yeah
And I'd let you crush me
Uh, uh, can't let you go
But if it's as it seems, and I keep having dreams
No matter what the distance between
How you doin' I'm Mr Mos I'm back
We sewed the day above LA
I look at things now
Your feet start tapping, and you can't seem to find
It's hard to let the miles pass me by
All the world is birthday cake 
To show you that I love you
Oh yes, safety dance
I think yore saying that you
Yeah yeah yeah you know you're made in heaven
Cold cold water, whatcha say
Shake it, susugar
Conflicted in these chains with the impetus of age
And then someone told a story about something dead and gory
And team look at me now
And you held this letter probably got excited,
I've been dreaming since I woke up today
Joy and pain are fighting in the corridors inside 
Is it from the baby Jesus glow
'Cause they remind me of you
Red in the morning, blue in the evening sun
If the world were to die, the light will guide you
You go to town
When it wasn't once Knew Nevers,
It's all right, the camera is talking
There were times I was sure, so sure
You gotta give it up for the new modern man
And time's not poison but once you drink it all you'll die
When it dries I know some dust that
I'm gonna be the man who comes back home to you
On the back of my neck
First I'm gonna sing my song
'Cause you got my heart unlocked,
Every time I look at you
You just gotta call on me
Sick of holding on to nothing when I just want to hold your hips
Don't bring no vodka, or whiskey,
You see mom, I'm a good little boy Good little boy
And where you've been you've come so far
I go on too many dates hehheh
You carved a path to my heartland
That's what they say
If you want, want my love
Hey boys and girls we want to see what you got, hey
I said something that I never intended to say
The way you spin me around
My mirror's reflection is you
And move on, and move on, and move on, and move on,
Hours on the phone making pointless calls
I'm coming back for more
Whatcha gonna have to say for yourself
It was randy described eternity
When you're walkin' out on the street
And then it's not just showing off here
All I know
The world
Jason
She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah
We'll design a clever disguise
Ooh C'mon everybody
I learned to wave goodbye
Don't care enough to write you a letter now that I'm doing better,
Salon will commence immediately following
Where streets filled with people
That's the way
Pulling out the sun
And don't you feel it's all the same,
She and her friends sit at the back of the bus
Don't wanna control ya, ohoh
But in the stars and closer to home in every planet
Friday night arrives without a suitcase
We major C'mon homie we major
He doesn't need to trouble his good soul
Baby Britain feels the best
Leaving the world down beneath the clouds
Drivin' away, and leaving it all behind
Rain is falling down on the sidewalk
Choking on a vitamin tablet the doctor gave 
You gave them nothing but the best
The colors are beautiful
You mean a lot to me
Well I guess it's just the way that things go
You see, well I'm feeling lucky 
Been hating on my new perspective
I've got a perfect body
Just love the way that you move
I try so many times
Found eighteen reasons I can't pick up on the phone 
And you was looking at me like it was my bling
For still your face comes shining through
I thought I'd known love before
But my forgiver found a son
I love you always know the way,
It was against the law
Understanding you is making me not want to do 
The record seems broken, yeah I really don't care
Ancient walls of whispers falling low,
Real sugar, I don't wonna climb no walls
New, tall, elegant rich kids
Oh, the way I fell for you
Don't worry 'cause it's all under control
Cause America can, and America can't say no
And I watched as Summer turned quiet 
The words of the things I think about
Are you gonna live your life
Money's got no hold on me
Just can't help feeling something's wrong
Sometimes luck's not on my side
Gonna shake the water out of every nook
I really don't like the way you smile
It is her hour so let it be hers
Maybe it's his first time around
If you get busted you should stand there proud
When I am with you, there's no place I'd rather be
Within the confines of such chemistry
And it's all flailing limbs at the front line
It's like heaven to me I must confess
Down to the general store for nothing specific
If I got my piano, then I know I'll be okay, baby
I'm the messiah, recognize it, political prisoner
She tells Max to stay when the class has gone away 
It's like I've seen the light
See you gettin' down till the break of dawn
You'll always smile upon me and I'll smile upon you too
And that's to laugh and smile and dance and sing
Long live rock, I need it every night
In the salsify mains of what was thought but unsaid
Yeah, she's kind of friend indeed
Like a bat out of hell, time has come for you
Are you trying to stop it
Don't tell me 'cause you know it's gotten worse
Got to find the reason, reason things went wrong
And the leaves like the artwork to "Major Leagues" look like dead foxes on the hard shoulder
And we know that it should
Handwritten track listing restarted every time the pen smudged,
Please, please, Mr Pooostman
Well I love you
Did you forget to read the script
When you need to shout
Work, work, work
She was looking kinda dumb
As the wheels, hit the ground
Just let go
Le garage, le garagerage
It'll probably get druggy and the kids'll seem too skinny
You gotta wait a minute, wait a minute
The girl's a fool, she broke the rule, she hurt him hard
Let me hear you say
I get it down on the dance floor
And I had tangles in my hair
Oh, won't you hold my hand
Oooooooooh weee lalalala, lalalalalala
Six cylinders underneath the hood crashing and kicking
Well, no way to say and there's nothing I can do
I got my smile
'Cause I don't have my mouth organ
Anywhere you looked was
And still you want me all the time
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Seen like the gods
Trying to be a superstar like everybody else
She's like a sunburn
Turns out there's nothing at all
Your second chance may never come along
All the stars are fixed up in the sky
When the Youth of Today and the early  Seconds
Opinions were like kittens, I was giving them away
From skating all my days
Forgetmenot eyes
With the ghost that was there before you came
Nothing ever mattered to me more than this
Lovely day
And I wonder if she's been pressed against an unfamiliar wall
And though the saints dub us divine in ancient fading lines 
Look around, see what you do
And talk me back down till I believed I was the crazy one Aaah
And with the radio blasting
Jump in the line, rock your body in time Up the chimney
Tell everyone that you know
The teacher had you write a letter, you were eight years old
She fell in love with the drummer
I can edit those parts out
She's broke his heart and that is rough
My feelings for the girl
And it's wonderful baby, baby, baby, baby
I picked up the bottle and star sixed it
Baby there's nothing, there's nothing we can't get through
Love is like a song
I was hummin' a tune
denn der Teufel bittet dich zum Tanz
So let that beat control your body baby
I know there's allbody types but we have just one size
Your boyfriend is mad
Increases the chance of misinterpretation 
Don't worry, be happy now
She was in her mindset
Today has never happened and it doesn't frighten me
It's such a mystery my, my philosophy
Nuclear distress, I still want you
Nothing too big or small
But baby don't put out this spark, no
The radar's got it wrong
Lost to the world he had known as a boy
For me boy this is just the start
Queuing up for something under priced
Not a thing can stop us now
Then again I'm always sad
Know, my own electricity
I sat down right there and I stretched my bones
As the shadows played tricks on the girl in the dark
That I love you baby girl
Oh think it over baby
And when I look into your eyes I knew it was true
Love like a river, a river, it flows
Tightfisted with his compliments, it didn't seem to bother him
We stalk each aisle,
Give me a shot at the night 
And I'm singing "oh oh" on a Friday night, and I hope everything's gonna be alright;
But you disappeared on me
I can't see much of a future
There is nothing that would sort you out
From the pornographic page
These days get so long and I got nothing to do
Take back this and that
So you wind up next to me
He got smaller and the world got big
Well, I need you to help me reach the door 
I'll stay here with my beer and fish and chips till it gets dark
Because you're not done
Why'd you have to get so hysterical
Passing along and sleepy as night
As long as I keep dancing, oh
And in the top of the canopy of the trees I am climbing
I know you feel deprived you don't trust me
Ooh ooh
But circulating the streets in the pulsing heat
I feel the chemicals kicking in
I was feeling good
Keep your pride, don't go
I want to ming with you
Well your arrows are soaring through my chest
Yes, things we say
I'm going to get you out of my head  get out
No, I was never young; kindness seemed no ploy to temper or annoy
I'm finally getting over you
Who cares that it makes plants grow
Come on, come on, the world will follow after
If he looks within he finds beauty and power
Help me drive this craziness away
It takes some cold to know the sun
Because you're sweet and lovely, girl, I love you
But I let love rule
So please stop talking
I'll love you more and more, I'll love you more and more and more
You took my feelings for nothing
To lighten the load
The wildfires look so pretty
The melting, sliding dice we've always been
Oh ooh oh ooh
Meaningless scientific breakthrough
Will you say goodnight
Mass romantic fool separated by sheets when the curtain calls you,
You bought me all those good ole presents
All that I've ever been
When will I get my chance to put you in a trance
Just a little something to help to keep you high"
Oh, beautiful baby
Have to contend with all night
It's fine by me
The girls were holding hands
You better turn to god
Damn, that wasn't nuttin but the intro Here we go
"Get up" a voice inside says
We all end in the ocean
It was crime at the time but the laws have changed, yeah
And you say
I feel like a sailboat
The bluebirds fly so high
Taking out the trash and the pictures that I stashed
Curl your upper lip up and let me look around
When my angelic work was through
It made me feel like I belonged
You're looking beat but you say "no, oh, no, no"
I'm gonna tell you how it's gonna get done
And a beauty that annihilates all life
Take me above your light
Now I'm asleep in a car
Gonna change
It's a real live mama and papa phone,
Do you see me reeling off the lines
You know he'd rather have his time
No me tengas más consideración
'Cause I had just been told
And sweep you off your feet
'Cause summer girls come and summer girls go
Galaxy defenders, stay forever
We can get crazy let it all out
Left this haunted town
No one needs to know we're feeling
I ain't with it, I ain't with it, I ain't with it 
Shed a tear for the one you love
We are thick as thieves 
It's like my heart can't be tamed
She is the reason that I still believe
But I know that I don't wanna wait anymore
I see Dylan Thomas in your face
Life is a drink, your love's about
Better reach for the sky and raise up the ceiling
That girl is like a sunburn
I looked like a goon
What a wonderful world
Taught me some of life's most valuable lessons
This world is of no empty part
And the neighbourhood, bored, started buzzing with joy
Losing the feeling of feeling unique
The side she tries not to share
Broken hearts hurt but they make you strong and
Run run rurun run
A fragment of the girl
We'll have bizarre celebrations we'll play Tristan and Iseult, but make sure I see white sails
So much more than I needed before
And who believes that my wildest dreams and my craziest schemes will come true
And just because I am in misery
It's a brand new day
Just grab it 'cause it's yours and the empire's dying
You cut a line, was a big mistake;
Roll out the map and mark it with a pin 
Like 'em run state mag 'cause we living it up
De du anda blir sta aldrig still
Hook up with me, meet at the rally
Why do you bite the hand that feeds you
I couldn't even see the floor
If I were her I'd paint my body
Our days are as the wind blows us,
Loose at their seams
Whenever you're gone I get lonely
Watch the water drop from clouds, it sure rains a lot
That you didn't have
Are you in the mood for some dude, are you in the mood to be subdued
Well as long as we keep our stride
I'm letting it go
It's driving you mad, Even if she falls in love
Till they stop rollin' so far
Tasted the watcher
Tryin' to find the friends inside my head
It's not a walk in the park to love each other
Is there some way you can be out on your own
We dress the same ways only our accents change"
I know they'll be coming
The way she say she never give her lovn' for free
And it's our Godforsaken right to be loved, love, love, loved, loved
I will say a prayer, just while you are sitting there
Like a line of poetry
Kiss the tears that stain my neck
I've got girls and friends
You should start realising that I'm just as wild as you
To a daydream believer
But you don't pull my strings
Kiss me beneath the milky twilight
I'm just a teenage dirtbag, baby, like you, ooh"
Now stand in the place where you work
I wish you a merry Christmas baby
You gotta do it different J
You can say it out loud it will be okay 
If you wanna dance
I'm going to get you
Bat it with your eyelids
You can't imagine so many monkeys in the daily mail
Well you've been taken and it's gonna hurt
There's too many questions to why I love you 
But those are the breaks
Everyone has a home
You say you've never seen America, I really think you'll like it there
Fails to mention I still hate you
When I'm in your light, just when I'm in your light
But you've nothing new to show me
But storms won't last, they clear the air
But she can't be what you need if she's ,
Then what makes, then what makes
In the city
Why must I be a teenager in love
Feeling better than I ever felt before today
When neon light from the building
Shut up and forget it
I think I'm getting closer
If you took all the girls I knew when I was single
Danger, heartache
When's there gonna be an end to wondering
Let us be free, let us sing songs along
I said I never ever thought that you'd be messing 'round
Where all them girls was doin' Tina 
Give you all the milk around town
That you fear, what makes you withdraw
Escapade Come on, baby, let's get away ooh
But if Jesus comes to take your hand I won't let go, I won't let go
And the stars in their cars roll their tops down for you, singin'
There she goes with a twinkle in her eye,
I've never been the type to call
Lean out and touch the treetops over town
Yes me got the reason to come question your love
Though nothing will keep us together
Taking his time as he crosses the bridge
But I won't waste a day
I am older now, I see the way you operate
I've been here before
Don't need a sword to cut through flowers, oh no, oh no
To see your fine teeth smiling at me
Thursday doesn't even start
Ba duba dop ba do, yeah
If there's a choice between a chance and flight
I was so stupid for letting you go
Got out backs to the pack
No room for make up
It's kind of level but it's wavy
How is it you seem to know what I tried not to show
On the Ronald Reagan toll way
I guess that's how the future's done, oh, ohon
Now to the other side
The sun eclipse behind the cloud
Put out that smoke and breath some air
Tear out the pages with all the bad news
You might lose your faith in science
Well, it's all right, even when push comes to shove
And you're the one I want to know
Oh, oh yeah
And all the people that come and go
The sky was yellow and the sun was blue
I got your nights I got your days
And though the road has got some steep climbs
Rocking like a cradle, yeah, it won't let you go
Another one lost to the winds of change,
But if I never, ever hear them ring
Oh life, doo, doot dooo
Bring a mirror to my face,
And my parents
Oh, Billy Brown needed a place, somewhere to go
And I swear it isn't fair
I know that what I've started
Never wanna let you go
But she didn't care, and I didn't mind
I call my phone and I check my messages
To the place where I fell asleep inside you
He passes big houses and family cars
Said, I'm a believer, yeah I'm a believer
And I don't need an excuse
A prisoner in PVC a minute after three
Be quiet, the weather's on the night news
Riding through the city on my bike all day
Unpacking the bags and setting up
But you say it's okay
There's space for us to shake, and hey, I like this tune 
We're home at last
And all I can do is read a book to stay awake
And the angry silence that he throws on the floor
And go all the way up to heaven
But we didn't make a sound
Not with changes
And nothing is worth winning without a fight 
Have you seen her dressed in blue
And our mouths  In tune
And when she's talking, she'll say that she's mine
'Cause I was fine till you came along
You know I would, and I could prove it That I'll do anything spontaneously
And with this silence brings a moral story
"Lets make the world's stupidest stand and truly mean it
Do you start to panic
It's getting harder to give
You're back so late Where did you go that you were gone so long
I just need someone to love
Rock my world until the sunlight
And when you go to work
And the new way of living would be a reality
Senora dances Calypso
I could make you stay
And it's hard to breathe when you're not near, oh yes it is
And write it's so much fun out here
But when I look the moment's gone
So fucking useless
Asking you to wait, wait for me
I got depraved chimps
Doesn't mean a thing
I was counting the trees
Why I make that face Oh why would I
It is wonderful
I try to imagine a careless life
When we had done our thing for a full Christian hour
A little bit of Erica by my side
It's this one thing you did ohoh, ohoh, oh
So old that that it feels like it is ending
I was backstage in Pomona
In the morning
When I say
'Cause they are free of thoughts unpure 
When we climbed to the peak we planted a flag
All I need is you by my side
All your dreams are about to happen now
Remember when the sun was hot
Can we take the next hour
We'll get down, to pass the time
Yeah, lying with you half awake
Can't count the years on one hand that we've been together
And are you going out 
If you still don't know how the cadence goes
I'd pop myself in your body
Studied pataphysical science in the home 
I, I will be king
You say you see it almost every time
But fuck it though, what I'm spendin' something on a nothin' for
The future of my understanding of love
I'll buy an old car
And it's the shakeup
To  the winter snow
Let it all go baby
Do you still love me
Surprise and make it right
But I say go, go, go
Ah, baby, I'm upsidedown down
Leave a song no one has sung
I don't always think of you
Some nights I break down and cry
Tech TV hottie, do it for Scotty
Too much candy gonna rot your soul
and not above letting a love song disappear 
You're burning me, like a shining star
More ofern right than wrong
Yo, yo Melvin Flynt drop, my whole collasso stop
Going to the fruit stand to buy a dozen oranges
Daydreaming, daydreaming into the night
Nothing you can see that isn't shown
All that I want is a photograph of Photo Jenny
And I had a lot to tell you but I didn't think you could say it better, oh baby
I'm getting it back like it's four in the morning
You can stand in line
This went on for awhile until they finally found you
So I'll spread out my wings and fly
My nigga flippin' buildin's better than he was flippin' birds
For falling like a spiny feather the tears begin to cry
And what did we find
I say hellowhoawhoa
She woke me up with a bang bang
And all the guilt will follow you in a line 
I get carried away, carried away, from you
Umi she'd say
And so much wonderful love for everyone
Fade into the feeling
You can let somebody know on the 
So let's jump the border when the coast is clear,
'Cause we're all a part
You turned it on
Summertime girls got it goin' on
Standing here right now 
In truth, the forest hears each sound
You're a lover of the wild and a joker of the heart
Even if it's just a day
With doors ajar,
Till I was stung dead
Making you feel like there's gonna be a war
But no one wants to see you fall down
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
You look inside my wild mind
Walking on the golden line
What are you going to play
Elle lui sourit légèrement avec un tas d�arrières pensées
'Cause I know that you wanna dance with me
There's only one thing left to do
If we're gonna show you how
Is it over yet When she spent the week in bed
And you know this Class Historian
And your wings begin to unfold
When your doors are shut tight, I will dream you tonight and my dream will just sweep you along
Magical waves just under the sky
Clever little guys
Love isn't this game where
Bringin' us to life
You won't be hearing from me anymore
Well homie let 'em know that they shit out of luck
Shaking at the sight
Now, it's all covered with daisies
The most I have to say isn't really that revealing at all
Shoot me one of those glances I need to interpret
Probably has nothing to
Well don't lie down on the job, oh yeah
Oooh
We came here to rock the microphone
When the sky is overcast
Trying to get my self to bed
When I'm in your arms it turns me on
And the night she looked so fine to me
Come on and let us in
Take it with you; you can pass it on
'Cause I'm always right behind you
Finding nothing more to argue
Maybe we were born to kiss another
And we'll paint the perfect picture
There is something I've been meaning to do,
so dry your eyes or let it go uncried, my dear 
Put your hands on the ground
It's a simple message and I'm leaving out the whistles and bells
When the money is high, we can start to spend
And all this time I've watched it change
Leave the acid kids in their green fishbowls today
Put your wings on me, wings on me
Over rooftops and then dive 
So what if this world just throws me off the edge
Live live live live right now
Never you mind, wonderful you
I can only see when you're here, here with me
Blessed is this life oh, and I'm gonna celebrate being alive
I didn't drink what you drank
I can feel complete, stop paying dues
Writing you a love letter
Won't you please let me
In my finest suit, like a perfect gentleman
'Cause with a match that's mean and some gasoline
One more song for the radio nation
I'm sticking out like a sore thumb
And then stay there forever
Come back stay here at my grandma's house
I'm not sure of my every step
In his kitchen, in your chair
Wait a minute, wait a minute
That you couldn't wait to see
Brace yourself for love
Taper jean girl with a motel face
Eternal life, but you say no
Ever so careful on the strip
Inside a paper napkin
Thinking things could not improve
And meet an old man to present my plea
Through the screen door your thoughts are quarantined,
Uptown funk you up, uh
The ancients just stayed down
Mechanicsville and Summerhill and Zone  to roll with me
I wanna fly with you
I'm lying in my bed
'Cause then she might be happy, no longer lonely, uhoh
Who loves the sun
'Cause I wanna know Do ya love me 'cause I wanna know
Of your bad fun 
Just to find the ground deserving of your feet
Little darlin' come with me
Giving deadarms in the hall
You said my clothes were sexy
You were calling her a lover
They say Confucius does his crossword with a pen
You walk up the stairs
Two or three times the bell will ring but when when we look for the better things we search for this we have not build I feel it crash upon your skin
And every night my mind is running around her
I'd rather hit it road hard than go hustle a check
And thought about the moment and when it will pass hey
While I was out While I was out
You mother
Now the funny thing about it
Let's get it on, yeah, y'all can come along
Everybody gonna feel alright tonight
Murmur simmer and I'm feeling slow
In my heart is a spring
Don't take chances
Hey, boy, I push it out
I can't wait, wanna see
To the darker side of town
With the lights blinding and my heart weighed down
Someone is born and someone dies 
Bright
The devil cuts loose, zing, boom
You look so good in the shoes of an outcast
The grass gets greener when you get to the finish line
Let the wind blow through your hair, be nice to the big blue sea
She bites at blades and leaves
But you can make my bed
Flying away from reality, whatever ever happened to gravity
We are a pair of apples
I still never told you about unstoppable sorrow
Baby's got a praise like a scarecrow in the corn
If we settle for this compromise I'll stay with you
Like I don't know how it is
Hangin' out up at Laquiji rock with pops for sure
These are days
Let's save our troubles for another day
Everything is yours to lose
The power to give
And disagree with everyone she knew
Sometimes you're forced to fit in between the lines
Some things last a long time
I go outside, it's not so bad
The citrus drawing out the scene in stains
My feet are buried in the sand
If it were up to you, I'd be in my bed crying
You can be my head
It should be clearing up soon if only in dreams
Ring ring ring ring ring ring ring banana phone
I've been waiting just for tonight
And there's no other place I'd ever wanna go
Without a line to divide what is theirs
Let's go for a ride
I got there, where
But love is nothing you can tax
In tired paths of light
Remind me of you because you rock my world
On how you keep on getting boys to stick
We'll be rollin' on up
That's okay, don't worry 'bout it baby
Down parkway lines, I was losing my mind
I went away, 'cause you were near
That might stop the tick of time
And when you wake up early and the sun is shining,
There's no stopping me
With redwoods around us
Bones
Just for one day
When you're hot and your fingers itch
And it's the truth you know
Young gal, you done me bad and I went and did ya wrong 
The busy sister's stunning, won't she be stunned
I've been waiting all this time to be
Before, my face hits the floor
You revealed a world to me and I would never be
Everything you ever wanted from this life is gonna happen right now
I miss her bed, I lost my head
Somebody wants to hear you say Oh they want you to say
He's got a brand new car
Well I thought that I was doing well but I just want to cry now
So sweet,
Did you stop to accept how pathetically dumb
And drink our daydreams away
Dream of falling in love
On a river of red red wine
It's too far to discard the life I once knew
And the only word is love 
All of the world and all of its powers
Please have faith in if you feel me
I will be waiting here with open arms
We going down town, oh yeah x
One dance left
Nothing's gonna bring me down
I'm too scared to look away,
When everything is falling
Part of what I would call amazing
Te lembr'o                     		        I remind you
That her baby buys her things, you know
Caught up in the things that you could do without
Come on, come on, move a little closer
What are you waiting for
You could be home, with Oprah Winfrey
That sacred night where we watched the fireworks
You closed the door and stumbled down to the street
But soon comes Mister Night
In front of the other one
Believe in the magic that can set you free
And in the jazz of squalls and impassioned brawls she danced
Somebody once asked "Could I spare some change for gas"
Hey, nothing serious, we still have our fun, or we had it once
This is the fifth time straight in a year I've ended up in here
I'll be thinking 'bout them as I'm lying in bed
Then the cameras click then we are stars
And reach out your hand and I'll make you mine
All the ways you move
Hey, remember that time when I was broke
These bandages cover more than scrapes
And a heart of steel, always on her own
I was fine before I met you
Or maybe we were born to come together, or whatever
Throw yourself on the aeroplane and fly like magic
I guess I'll always be 
Choo choo Charlie had a pretty good band
You You baby, you I'm talking about my baby yeah
I'm so in love with you, I'll be forever blue
The boy, the boy's in love
We skip inside of the store
Oh but I don't wanna know
And I said your love lifting, lifting, lifting
Real sugar, I don't wonna climb the walls
So come go with me
Went home and buried her love tonight
I've been a lot of places all around the way
Ooh ooh ooh
I feel like I let them down when I don't wanna trade my sunshine for a cloudy night
You love fun dip and cherry coke
Singing in German the cold summer warning
You get to the next on down the line
I never tried to hold you tight until you left me now
Their sentiment is just as hard to pluck from the vine
Smash on morning Southwark stone
I remember thinking, oh this will never be lust
So I stared up at those leaves 
Find a way to bring myself back home to you
Oh, that rain that's iching on my skin
Knowing they're happy and they're safe
'Cause this life is a beautiful one,
If it's because of me
I do love my Ma and Pa
Just leave the restless ghost in his old hotel
'Cause we are a pair of apples
Eating at Welcome Breaks daily
If you were the floor, I'd wanna be the rug
The animal inside of you
And I won't sit back, and take this anymore
Get an ugly girl to marry you
And I'm sure they make your point but
There beneath the blue suburban skies
And I was home in bed
Switch on the sky and the stars glow for you
If you wanna be happy for the rest of your life
I'll pretend that I'm kissing
Don't you stop 'til the tears run dry 
We'd lie and tell our friends
Everyone in town wanted to be around you
We'll fly by wheat fields and water towers
I'm supposed to feel better
'Cause I've got the cure
From sucking on my mother's breast 
I'm happy and I know that makes you sad
Two broken strings, attracted,
I wanna be the one you steal
Rip out the binding and tear the glue
I may never work it out
En la gran feria, de la mentira, tu eres el rey el rey de un día
It's been too long since I've tried to take the time
She's whispering like Morticia now 
So hot and heavy
I can't see me lovin' nobody but you for all my life
So the summer is eternity for you
Giving other people my despair
Is that you on the phone
If you are the Ghost of Christmas Past
Well, you'd better get out of his way
To decorate the tomb with petals from the groom
Now stand Stand
Sugar, ah, honey, honey
It's so deep in my daydream
Would make my dream come true, yeah, yeah, yeah for once in my life
Waiting for my moment, I was destined to shine
Fuck yeah, we can live like this
When you come around
I said oh yeah, in an mmm bop they're gone
The blacktop singing me to sleep
Welcome swallows dip and swing 
We've got no place to go
Someday we might learn to tell the truth
The face of rivalless gods, deep in your thoughts
Hello Seattle, I am a cold seahorse
Needs a real man, here's why
Some nights kept me awake, I thought that I was stronger
Do things I can like so
Cause in the evening time she makes me feel all right
Because tonight we're singing the songs, busting these rhymes,
And if you're trying to sing an old song
It almost breaks my heart 
I'm hypnotized by this world we live in
You gave every song to me 
I scream it to the nothingness
Wait for the dust to settle down around us
How could someone mislead you at all
As word across the window frosting out
Acan I get get get to know knknow know you better better baby x
We were gone but what was on the top of the mountain,
And I know you stay by my side
I'm gonna reach the top
Set me free, babe
I came along one day and you rearranged my life
Still fixed inside your fantasy
I get strung up from her loving 
Meant for a distant lover
Put your arms around me
Turn your magic on
The fortress, the faker Run for your life, for your friends
And family in free verse
It's too big to swallow
Maybe then I realize you ain't got what I need
While you're waiting like a factory line
Can't stand when I disappear
Ashes till it fall, fall, falls
You know you know me number, too
But there's nothing else inside it
And everybody's features have somehow started blending
And the dream that you dare to, oh why, oh why can't I
I watched my old habits die and it was painful
What went wrong, your grades were good
Like the Texas Chainsaw Massacre I'll get in your face
Can't you just shut right up
And I never felt as good as how I do right now
Well I have no way to say and there's nothing I can do", go
I'll stay if you're gonna keep me in line
All got our dreams
A candy man, a candy man, a candy man
You can trip on my synthesizer
Don't stop me
Oh I love this house, I love this house
Nothing else but us right here
I'm left here wondering
Convert your self belief for a new Religion
I say we lose control control 
Wanted to fly
Wasn't even like that kid
Well I am a woman
Did you think that money was heaven sent
They touch me, but I can't say
Come and let this man go
Swirling, soothing all the time gives me a thrill
Ya estoy decidida
Ooh, and every time that I'm with you
Go get yourself up straight
Rap about big paper or the black man plight
Skies burned, eyes turned
Boy, your love makes me feel like
And your love is so pure and so clean
You love me too
I was a lonely soul, but that's the old me
I said your love your love keeps lifting me
I'll write my full heart
I sold you a thousand lines
I thought I couldn't do this without you
Change the weather, still together when it ends 
So sweet I can hardly speak
The plane has almost landed
As the kids throw yellow roses on her grave
Stupid but it made you smile
I scoured your town, completely aroused
Now you're really giving everything
You know I really like it
But at night with lips of honey calls the devil's heart
Hey, soul sister, ain't that Mr Mister on the radio, stereo
Though I know I'm wont to wonderin'
When you're touching me I'm not afraid,
I smoke bud, get pissy, who could flow with me
And standing on a pigeon toe in his disarray
I've got to, got to get to some place I've not been
There are too many candles in your cake
Turning away from the high road
And there's this one episode, closeup cameras are showing him crying
The conversation turns to girls we knew when
I'm not sure about a life after this
It's not too late now to change your mind
Jackie flips the pages and she dreams little dreams
And make no mistake, my friend
Every moment like a sudden pleasure
Ripped down from the brownstones to the street
Well, stop and smell the smoke you keep saying
And it's us guys writing down a funk rhyme
Never felt so good, sleepy smiling
Pulled the jungle underground
I feel as if I'm wastin'
We can get crazy, let it all out
They gonna throw me out when the morning comes
That I'm a little bit wrong
It's a little bit me
You know we all ride on
The deal that kept the courts at arm's length
In the broad day
And think of what the others say
I get a table and a nice bottle of Chablis
Ransacks with the mad man
I can't stop hearing all the singin'
And I'll never let go
This world would be
What if I'm right
The ghost said, "Take off both your shoes
Stack it up like cinnamon, we'll get it real fast
And screaming like a battle cry, it's more if I stay
Flew me to a place not far away
Let's leave this place
Keeping versed and on my feet
Got to find another way to live the life of leisure
I've been awake from the first day 
Et tu feras, ça t'apprendra
The town,
Tried to change my figure my diet too
Occasionally guarded, just keeps us surrounded
Sweet body part
Was all that I needed
I won't sleep tonight
See I'm all about them words
And love you 'til you're sore
Barefoot on a summer night summer night
You know he's holding you down with the tips of his fingers
Its only 'cause the sun shined once again
They left a strange impression in my head
Oh my, you make amy dreams come true
Na for,ca do amanh~a            	        In the power of tomorrow
And once you left me in the spring
I feel now
When your heart is hard
C'mon people, we're making it now, yeah, yeah, yeah
To be something I'm not
There's something you should know
You're the one I'm talking to
I play it cool when it's slow and jump it when it's fast
It's wonderful
Wednesday, Thursday
He made you smile so easy, so make a smile for me
I met you one January day, 
But I awake each day with the new sunrise
Everything you want's a dream away
There ain't no hope for coming back
All the games that we play
A needed award I can't afford, a finished song, one more chord
That I gotta let you go
That always steals my stare
And when we're tired of the city
I'll stand up on top of the dugout
Always and forevermore
She's everything I've been dreamin' of
How is the weather
I laid on my back, let the punk record spin
There's a house on the block that's empty now that Dominique's gone
Someone always thought a good reason, baby
'Cause they're just girls
I I I I turn up the radio
And we'd lie in the garden and watch the weeds grow
So I headed way down to the big pier
Is a mystery no doubt
I need you here with me
And watch me walk away
Needlework on Thursday
Girl, I gotta tell you, I'm feelin' much better
Payback the monkey
Take a long walk down a short block
Away the key, are you coming with me
Are bright
You worked hard, died poor 
No more nights in this weed and thorn infested meadow
Bound to get together
Give me love
And she asks me with a sigh
I'm too stoned to write this song
And it looks good to me
So let that wonder take you into space
For this correction I need direction
I already forgot
Is a lonely box that holds you she's a star
Tell me why those clear skies so suddenly have changed
In the city, in the city I love
I never learned just get up and go on
Than run away with little boy blue 
And my heart beats big before it drops
I'm walking all by myself
How do I feel by the end of the day
In and out of the blue this cruise is losing altitude, all we need
I got a steel machine 
In the end they'll be the only ones there
Hey girl, you've got a short fuse
Keep ya head a goin'
'Cause I ain't got all night
Summer in winter
Ooh baby, oh oh, oh oh
The smiles returning to their faces
The TV is your window pane
Go on, I don't need it
Só gastando grana
And have a baby boy
Do you remember when Do you remember when
Rivers and playgrounds 
And all my kisses when we huggin'
You won't soon forget the name
I'm not the boy that will fall to his knees 
Front to the back, I'll make you go 'round
I want your answer so I won't forget
If it's true looks could kill and you will be the first to make me mad
A good, good life
'Cause I wanna know
Like the color purple, macaroni and cheese
I'm everything you s'posed to be, boy, ain't no runnin' over me
It's a phone with appeal
Into this life we're born
And bury them beneath the sea
Just keep me guessing please
Everyone's got a combination
Just trying to get by
There's no measuring of  
I can feel so swollen when I'm in good shape
Fish tank this thang along with four more shots Potron
My old clothes don't fit like they once did
Thursday, never looking back
You're tender and you're tired
Someone just tell me that it's okay now
You know my name�ha
Hemmed in by the room
But God I love some people sometimes
This winter is much like all the rest
They all got a sales pitch I ain't buyin' 
Till the radio plays something familiar
Are you gonna waste your time thinking
Are you callin' me bird
Is how to let you go
Love is the greatest thing our heart can know
It shimmers slightly dancing in your hair
The more I learn inside the city
The tenements recall Rome
You never get to
I painted a dirty word on your old man's MercedesBenz 'cause you told me to do it
What did I do in a past life,
Þú tyggigúm í hendir hár fast
I was young and I was stupidI had just turned seventeen
But I can always tell she'd rather be allone with some other guy
The engine hums, a humble tune
I've got something I can laugh about
Slowly strolling in the sweet sunshine
You can't carry it with you if you want to survive
You make sense of it
I say, "Woof"
Bet you don't even know why
And now she's looking for a downtown man downtown man
Final word has been said
And no, I ain't been to MIA
Ooh, ooh
When I can work out how it was
Sometimes suds and soda mix okay with beer
It's this one thing that got me trippin'
When someone else instead of me
People are just people like you"
Just breathe in the air and blink in the light
Or you'll never know 
I can't remember it went straight to my head
So happy, yeah, so, so happy, yeah
I can't get insured for the state I'm in
All those bugs buzzin' 'round your head
You'd remember drinking horchata
Tell your boss he can invoice my ass
The radio
Please turn me over
It's the bough we break to blow away
I am the wizard of ooh's and ah's and falala's
Colours are one to hold in my head
Take a sip, sign the check
Mama, someday you'll be so proud of me
Must be something strange I kissed
And I know they love it
And I'll still think of you on cold winter mornings, darling
So we're going to make friends with you
No, lets exceed it"
And the broken bones
When you know where my lips have been
Oh I am a man on an Odyssey
No matter what you keep repeating
This boy has broken down, yeah yeah
And my thoughts have turned to murder thoughts have turned to murder
Like walking the world
But I know one thing
My stolen gold inside the emperors tomb
In a dream that I had
Every step I took and street I've walked
You carried on
Don't believe me just watch
You're gonna wait a while
'Cause I'm not good enough for her
She follows me 'round wherever
Daydreaming, daydreaming into the night and I'm alright
I know that it's true
Hold me secure in flight I fall asleep in hospital parking lots
Rock is dead, they say
Then this somebody ought to be you
For the good thing tonight
Ever kind
You were caught kissing  Chinese brothers, 
Just before he finished breakfast 
We're gonna be alright alright Hey
Singing wait, wait, stop, drop me, go, go, go
Makes me wanna turn around and face me
Some hear a call
If nothing else
"God, how great it is to play a guitar"
They're cued to sway
We're not talking like we used to
Du kan sova på min arm tills det blir ljust
Sucking too hard on your lollipop
I get scared
The end is never the end
Ikea just some oak and some pine and a handful of Norsemen
You'll never shine if you don't glow
So the next one came with a bag of treats,
We'll drive, one thousand miles an hour
Buy a brand new semi next door to the Taliban
I stopped eating and sleeping
I know that you need help
Someone's that I never really knew
I miss your touch
Which way will the wind blow
When the ride gets rough you got to carry on
And then kiss and stuff till we get dizzy and fall on the bed"
Who sits to your side
I was a lonely soul
You didn't stop to make me feel better
'Cause I don't like you 'cause you're not like me
When you cannot sleep
It's up in the morning and on the downs
If you touch me you could never go back
And be there till the end
I won't need 'em anymore
He's the only of his friends not shot down dead
If I was a different man,
She's got a picture on the table 
Love love love love
The birds in the trees
On a tear, under siege, under oath, Anna Lee
It's time to roll down the windows
I used to think maybe you loved me, now I know that it's true
Escapade Well, you could be mine
One day these could be the days but who could have known 
You're making me feel so fine
Here is my request, play the ones that we all know best
Is there anyway to find
Like coming off the pill that you take to stay happy
If I could tell the truth
And they knew all the time
Voilà A conversation in the park
Raise your glasses, here's to living out our dreams
I didn't listen, cause my brain was missing
But I'm floating away
And stumble your way through the night
I wanna come home
But can I get out from under it
To make babies crawl to windowsills and all
I've been up all night and fight to keep out the dawn
I don't like dropping names but Kurt Cobain is all in my face
Burns my feet as they touch the ground
I was happy, just getting some answers
Je ne comprends pas
So I save all my breath for the sails
Weightless, mindless, homeless Vacuum state of peace
That bridge is on fire
Self addressed stamped envelope stuffed with your own death letter
You should see the canals are freezing
We will cure this dirty old disease 
You'll catch 'em surfin' at Del Mar Inside, outside, USA
You know they never add up
But I'm coming back for you, and I'm walking through your door
Wrap him round your finger like you're playing with gum
Now pick me up with golden hand
And it was here
You know that you're cutting ties when you cut in town;
It seems like years since it's been clear
We can dance if we want to
That smother you, all radiant with joy
You've got the music in you
Ancient walls of flowers tumblin' down
No one else can feel it for you
'Cause magic ain't no handmedown yearning
Now the kids are all grateful when they left the nest
Upon an endless trail of moonlight
Let's dance to Joy Division
Inside I heard the trumpets call
Honestly, I just don't, I just don't, I just don't
Think of me, don't let me keep
And they covered up the sun
On a highway along the Atlantic I'm rifling through these last seventeen years
Live your life
Yes, since the day we met
Outside the lines, 'cause they're out of their minds
They go you're just as boring as everyone else
Don't ask her how she feels, 'cause that'd be a lie
Fighting tears just to carry on
It was undeniably clear to me
Seconds away, Seconds away
You make me feel like natural man
And it always somehow seemed to fall apart 
A slight figure of speech
If I had it in me to stop my random thoughts,
You are not so old
Clocks are running late
And a homecoming queen
Out in the cold I lost my way
Yitho omanqoba
No matter where you from, you'd better hear the truth
But you can't quit cause Jackie needs the benefits
Heading for home, you start to roam, then you're in town
We get high in back seat of cars
And Molly says this as she takes him by the hand
It's so very obvious to everyone watching us
I was young, I was surviving the times
And then one day, those who would passing well they passed on
Your moony face 
Some people write the books that bastardize our claims
Mistakes, heartbreak, and true love
Jessica numbers to the wall slip through
All right, all right, all right
You jump in the saddle
Shot shot to the
See whatever I do, I do it good
I love the way you soften my life with your love
Like it's lived in these nights, holding your hatred tight like a sign that you're right or you're strong
Or lose faith in your friends
Macaulay Culkin wasn't Home Alone
Even if my perdition were just in front
As long as we're together, there's no place I'd rather be
And who's gonna play with me
I nearly did explode
All I could think of was sunlight
Where did you go while I was out
I feel like I'm in paradise
They say
Before the levees start to crack
And we go where the money goes
If you wanna get with me
Money lost in the backfire of the boomerang
And hear them answered with a whispered no
And opens the canvas and out comes twelve
Know the price of flight
But your empty eyes
If he had to say 'hello'
And the mortars may fall
I just wanna be happy here sometime 
If you have a broken heart or a battered soul
One wrong move and yeah we're through
Take my hand now, understand me, you can come here too
My tears quench five feet of lawn
Me far away from my wise
I give everything up for your touch
Every second of time Keep wait
Curses to this mirage, a bottle of ancient Shiraz
I'm telling the truth, said it don't win with pretend 
Roger will attempt to write a bittersweet
Inside a perfectly straight line
And we'll enjoy picking apples in late September
You'll never see my eyes
Tell me have you seen the boy
But then you came and made the past look so funny
The last night of the fair
I'm might pleased we met
I'm lucky that my father's still alive
Are you gonna play with me
You're the ocean 
And I am breathless without you
Are, are you with me now
Riding my decision home
But Friday, never hesitate
Got yourself another hour
I sure miss you honey, when you're not around
We're all so fake happy
It all comes back to common sense, I guess that's what you're looking for
You can put some money on it, you can place a little bet
Draper Street caught me believin'
My vision is cracked, but it looks like it's healing
Everyday I look across the office floor, there you were
Limping and broken the tunnel fell in
The bayonets clamor on all night, hemming scars into the hillside
When I soak so long I forget my mother
Every time my name gets mentioned
You're gone, now, I feel fine
We can leave your friends behind
I'll stop the world You've seen the difference and it's getting better all the time
Oh, what's in my mind
Twentyfour hours on an empty brain
Some songs see us sailing away
He wasn't easy to ignore
Well, a fake Jamaican took every last dime with that scam
And I am the blue in your back alley view
All the things you say
If it's just me, adjust me baby
I got friends locked in boxes, that's no way to live
What happens if I go through that door
Her bone structures screams I want someone
You can hurt, or take heart
That I managed to give it flight
But then I knew you, I knew you, I knew you
It feels so peaceful
Everybody was dancing in the moonlight
It was the last time I forgave you
"He looks pretty, uh, down" Yeah, well, maybe we should cheer him up then
And once I tried to make a life
No matter how you try and disable it, yes, I'll still be here
I just wanna have fun
I forgot the colours that the grass tend to grow
Good morning
Now there's no place else
That it's all to start
With the spotlight burning a hole
Oh but if you're gonna stay
When you have to work late 
Of thoughts and dreams that scatter
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah
Two of them and four of eyes
Our rifles blaze away
Little Ray had an NSX, I was hoping I'm next
The songs that we sung when the dark days come
You are on my mind
Together
Quiet, boy, quiet
Sell your soul, like we did, tto Rock & Roll
The kiss will know if lips stay still
What's up with Will and Grace
The tracks'll run for miles when I feel those
I say soda
Though the sun has yet to appear
With a helping hand to lend
I'm living out my
Disconnecting the alarm
I'm never in my right mind
You Oh You, you, ooh ooh ooh, you
I want a shot at redemption
He lost the scene, there's something wrong
And I heard the steady swell of applause
Never wanna say I wish that I'd been there
I was half a world away from my home
And with just half of a sunburn
Senora's dance has more title
You're mom's going to the country
To do it right, child
Wow, I've never seen Sharon look so bad before
And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there
Why am I soft in the middle
Your brain gets smart, but your head gets dumb
I got peace in my soul
When they say grow up
To not let this play with my mind 
You can see that we don't have to get along
Me and him together, la la la la
Nobody told you
But I trip fast and then I lose 
I took a wrong turn and ended up in Michigan
What's the matter with you
In a second she knew,
Keep the beat up, let's drop the beat down
As I ignite things 
Can you feel my heartbeat when I'm close to you
When you're so far away
I don't find it funny anymore
Is a child of god
I think about you day and night, it's only right
Now, there are mountains and rivers
From all the drinks I get drunk off music
Until the nut comes out, come on coco girls
Just Hold on, yeah hold on
It's already in my mind, inside
How she got in the door uninvited
Listen to the beat
One day when I'm gone
Well if you've gots the poison, I've gots the remedy 
Come fill my little world,
You know exactly what you do
I'm so in love with you, girl, 
Take one step left and one step right
Let the hot winds howl
With a big black dog to bite your behind
Hey, remember that time when you OD'ed
Like God's hands
He'll never get to say
For the rest of your days
Say my name, you know who I am
Saturady's so far away there's so mush shit to shirk,
It's got me wondering if you ever dream of me
But I'm still not sure what's going on
And if the world stops spinning
And I took the book, I lit the page
Rolling in the evening breeze
Do whatever you want, baby
And look for the stars as the sun goes down
I used to go to see on the landing in the summer
I'll be okay if you'll
Listen, watch, and wait
Singing "I see songs in shapes and colours
And all your winter sorrows hang 'em out to dry
I can do a backbend
Oh c'mon, oh c'mon, what's a boy to do
She's only one step away
Thursdays I reminisce
Because at home they got her smacked
And all the signs of your life
This whole life is too complicated
There my life was bound and tethered on a porch by the shore 
So come on and get down 
I knew right away she was not like other girls, other girls
I'm sending out all of my love
Can you feel my heartbeat when I'm close to you, ohoh, ohoh
This is my sound 
Well, life is too short, so love the one you got
And if you want just hide your eyes behind your hair
Over and over away
So stand by the fire
Well, it's all right, if you got someone to love
Just pure fiction, that's all right
It's a unique find that only some people get
Gold and silver shine
But he's coming for you, yeah, he's coming for you, wait
Fill it up, fill it up to the brim with love
For rainquenched golden days
And close their eyes and open
Whos always hurtin',
Until I come back to hold your hand
The things they call our destiny
Love, when I get that dust, hit 'em up, recock then I get back up
Wait one minute
Start please start please start
Lay your traps for a thousand miles
Could he be waving from a tropical sunset
Not something real so I'd rather keep whackin'
Crime is on the rise, I still want you
I won't worry my life away 
Erm, I'm gettin' some pretty good oscillations
Yes she want a lover with the sensativity ya
Keep clappin our hands to the songs and
I hear you come in loud and clear
What will be revealed today
I've got you
We won't fade away
But he doesn't know who I am
Just like that, th grade footy heard
But there's no way I'll let'em take me for their petty little woes 
Man, I just saw something I'm glad that you are here
Oh that'd be spent in sweet content dreaming away
I found a reason for staying home tonight
And Wonder Woman's hair
'Cause I feel like such an insomniac
I know I can't wait until
Standing up like a man, like a father
Yeah yeah yeah Is enough to send me crazy
You ought to know what brings me here oh
Sometimes we take chances, sometimes we take pills
Well you got so much more than I figured was in store,
Oh if I was an Injun yeah, if I was an Injun, uh huh
Casual we ride through the big blue sky
Just please, please,
Then again we don't want it to stop
The word is good
His girl Friday
Why does it always happen
And if I die today I'll be the happy phantom
I'm not the girl that you remember from the start
No, I ain't got cash
You be dancing, leave me asking you for more
Until you have a daughter that's what I call karma
So I say
She's a super human girl
We will find a way
I long to be right by your side
A friendly face will bring you around
The porter smiles to me
For your heart is like a flower as it grows
I need you love
I go walking in the middle of the
Your love makes me feel like oh, oh, oh
Huddled up in fear and hate because we know our fate and it's a lot to put us through
But still the bank's gotta break
Wasn't what you hoped at all
Well I shouldn't sleep all day
I could sleep
They love me, but I can't say
For all those nights and days you spent hanging out
Yeah, we shut our eyes though we're in doubt
Said you know the world is big and got a loose heart
Like the land joining the sea
From when her hair was sweet blonde till the day it turned gray
I care that you feel at home
Well life is too short so love the one you got
And maybe you'll understand 
Of how much I've been touching you
The prospect of lightning was ever so frightening, 
Bullshit, bullshit, bullshit, bullshit
I'd like to change my point of view
And I'm trying to care a little less
Yeah, we're going on and on and on and on and on and on yeah, yeah
This thing of ours is dead, but don't you grieve
Giving me the feeling of a lightning strike
Oh what a beautiful day today
Just give me back my pieces
You smile and laugh, and I feel the love you have for me
Oh say Wouldn't you like to be older and married with me
Can you tell me Which flower's going to grow
Walking on blue waves, blue waves
Oh oh oh yeah, oh
Release your inhibitions
It ain't nobody's business No
The sound, the sound, the sound
All you need is a voice now
I had no plans to meet you baby
Nothing ventured, nothing gained
In the middle of the night
O you could chose a friend but you don't seem to have the time
If it takes years to be any more than a jellyfish
Hope in the freedom he can almost touch
Won't be steady, never be ready
Uh, say what Huh
You're running to lose
But I'm too tired to argue with myself
When I open my eyes
The fishes leap up to take a look
And take on whatever together
I will be redefined
This has been my hardest year
But you don't think you can say it better, oh baby
I love you, honey
When we come to them
That I've got your number, son
You know me name you know me number three
Gentle glowing light
That's why your love your love keeps lifting me
And you were bleeding all over the place and I rushed you off to the hospital
I had to leave you and go away
I've got a feeling you could use a little smile
You're gonna get what you give
Just don't stay too long
Waiting for the salty water
We could stay here till closing time
I'll understand it's true
Higher, a higher power
The papa said, oy if I get that boy
Like the Pips at they Gladys
I feel so fake happy
When I'm roll in my Mercedes, all the ladies wanna roll
Forever with you Stay for ever
I was counting the rings
One night I fell asleep 
And I began to smile and I said
It is the moment you remember you're alive
It just feels like I can't afford to let myself go
Hey brother, it was a nicer time
And you could be a love to me,
About everything
Counts the waves that somehow didn't hit her
We can beat them just for one day
Practice makes perfect sense to me
Romantic Piscean seeks angel in disguise
If only you would take a vacation from this thing you have created
Don't wait and see 
Neon black flowers on the mass grave
To the town's best baker
They're gonna help her spend the fortune
Whatever gets you through your life, it's alright, it's alright
Time to compromise to occupy the lies
Start a new fashion, wear your heart on your sleeve 
Send out a battalion
Are Don't it feel like sunshine after all
You know that I was hoping
I love all the things that are wrong with you
The rest is up to you, you makes the call
Cheer up and dry your damp eyes
The cat calls through the night
We got a damn good reason
He says times like these I don't want to be a superstar
Staring at emotion
Swallowed into space
Don't fix my smile, life is long enough
And this deep secret that hasn't come out yet
And my heart feels so new
I found a letter that describes
Just tell them we could be building something out of our despair
Nothing that doesn't show
Keep it up, rock'n'roll,
Whoa, whoa, I never realised what a kiss could be
You said she's beautiful when she plays
Tunak tunak tun, tunak tunak tun, tunak tunak tun, da da da
Can't read my mind
Sitting in silence in bars after work
So we can pretend it's natural
On my last night on earth, I'll pay a high price
Out with the bad in with the clean
It's the shape of her legs
Please let's go
And the clouds came tumbling down
Then you been high 'cause you got sad 
It's like , , , okay
I've been searching for something
So say what's on your mind
All this just to go out for the day
Then you know where you are
I'll have to walk a thousand miles
We're on to something good here, and we're gonna make it after all
You set them alight, burning the bridges as you go
So stop laughing and play the muse
Ooh, ooh, ooh
But all their words and actions come entirely from you
Gonna hold up half the sky and say
Accept your life and what it brings
Greasing upa teasing of my fingertips
And it's a long way up when you hit the ground
Tuesday, shoot me in the head
I'm coming home
Are you to assess what I've been What I am Or become
Open up your plans and damn you're free
But I will contented be right now if we could keep our secret
You say you can but you don't know
Oh, kiss me beneath the milky twilight
Que paso, que paso, Yolanda 
I got to gage and barter to get out
I look at the sky
Dreams really do come true
And the dreams that you dreamed of
Hanging out with Steven Drew, Theo,
And the purple's talking down
But you can rent some love with a couple stacks
Celebrate your side to a new division
I need love
And out below the streetlamp like an orphan with a halo
Tired or wasted, I think you're decent
You mentioned in the letter
And my little band is kickin some ass
And we'll become
A limegreen lizard scuttles down the cabin wall
To shield me to disguise that my heart has a secret
I meant every word I said
You know I'm going to take my turn
When you're saying "goodbye"
I wish the world could do
We're accidentally in love
And I will flail under these lights
And then I open my eyes
I try the light therapy from the Xeroxmachine
Who send their love from Amsterdam
Gave my middle finger a brand new start
The more I try, I try to stop
High five, look up, look alive
Lap dance fantasy
Let's roll, uh 'oll 'oll 'ollout
*Cheering*
See all our younglife friends that we made again
Look at all the people and take note of the setting behind
And so my soul collapsed into a big guilt wad
You'd think the world was ending right now"
Well I think that love has found me
So tell me darling, do you wish we'd fall in love
I take a hit of that chronic, it got me stuck
I'll make you happy
No, no I know you need it
I feel your whisper across the sea
Then what are we so afraid of
I'm wasting my time
'Cause he's got all her jewelery and wallet
I love in the rain
Now I can't make you love me, baby, if you don't
And we kissed as though nothing could fall nothing could fall
Till that day, just
We love one another
Yeah, kiss me like we die tonight
Can I ride with you until the sunset gets all red
Well, it's all right, riding around in the breeze
But the hole that it leaves in its absence can make you feel so low
And I think it was the summer of th grade
Forgetting all your worries life
You got me losing my mind
Et le musique dance
Started picking up a mic, thought I was cool
There's a small voice crying on the other side of the river from here
We'll put out to sea
From my girlfriend so far away
I said God I love some people sometimes
Back to the place, hey
So I take the stairs and hit the gym
And you hear it from friends
Put my emotions on show
Do it again, I know we should
Sleepyhead Óró mo churaichín, churaichín, churaichín
It comes in a day, then it'll never leave you
Don't you try to call the cops little girl
It wasn't nothing for 'Quence
Brush my hair, kissle me some more
Clouds float away like iron tools on the moon
In this days' modern times,
In the twinkling of an eye
The only one I want on my back
People move so fast
It makes the world go 'round and 'round and 
But I would be up for being down with a ho
I won't make noises in your stairs
And then she's right there next to me
Sooner or later, I know, I swear we're gonna make it
And we can climb its way
Then I was wrapped in discourse with the magazine reader
You sit outside in the dark
Oh baby, yeah my heart's a thumping, you
Went out and killed herself tonight
We can steal it
And I wish I would've had the nerve to ask you to stay
I stomp with my right foot,
Says he's got a big boat but it's just a fairy boat, enough to fit an extra one or two
The words that I longed to hear
And do you ever feel like you're alone
Your love it's all I wanted
Me your love Me your love
Is life, love, with you
Hush hush yeah I knew why
Of the rusty fire escape
And I know we won't always be getting along
But you make me feel so pretty
Alone though Shit, he just doin' what he known for
They're just girls
A time outside this common notion 
Have stopped to say goodbyes
Well there ain't nothing wrong with the way she moves
I'm so surprised to find more
And everything that makes you cry
As I lay me down tonight, 
I'll show you mine if you show me yours
Before the leaves disappeared
I was laughing and drinking and smoking and singing"
Nothing inside
Filtered water and pictures of you
So please forgive the words I use, my mind it tends to run
In lama land, there's a one man band
And I don't wanna lose your love
I'll be president someday
Leave the secret talks on the trundle bed
There's not a lot that I still could say to change your mind
I should say that I need you here
Then I waved goodbye to you 
It's been a long cold lonely winter
Remember you have still got a friend
I'm the worst in the world
Try to open up my eyes
So I used my one phone call to dedicate
Although maybe all these moments are just in my head
Wish I could get into your mind
I lost my head
But I know now that we were not the people that we turned out to be
On a Sunday morning
Listen, I'm your friend don't quote me
And I need you to walk me to the store 
Then may his soul live on forever in my song
Oh my goodness, here I go again
When I go out When I go out, well, I know I'm gonna be
Although the distance is daring
We're caught in a landslide, the minutes come tumbling down
One more song we can sing along to
They usually stay out of our way
In the kind of world where we belong
To hell with Sydney girls 
Well I'm afraid I'm not qualified to do any of these things for you
Smoking pot
I'm looking tired and feeling quite sick
I didn't wanna know the things I knew
I told the gang we weren't welcome
