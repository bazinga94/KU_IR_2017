Go now and get your own life and live it your way
Rumour has it that you could play dirty
Thinking about his pretty wife
Mugging on your sister, smart as Bobby Fisher
I'm the reason they made the dress code
Said take your water to the Leprechaun man
Use a blood stained sword and a snowwhite horse, please
Right inside and
Well, the little things you say and do
Oh But what do you need
Yeah, there's always someone cooler than you
So you my love can sing this song
They are friends of mine
Sometimes I feel like I can't run, I can't crawl
Step out your house and prepare to be amazed
Inside us all, it makes me cry
I bend in shapes and ways I never knew
We'll never change
Give me a break
Thinking of a real way to see
I'm calling it love soon
I'll be the greatest man of your life
Burgh representative I need y'all behind me
What is it about you that has commandeered my brain
I went on without you
Got to time it right
She slips from the stage a foot no more
When there are ghosts in my coat
But happy is all that you make me you make me
And if I could have a door knock
That ex got a bullet aside and she likes what you did before
We should start somethin' simple,
Just say what's on your mind
You know there's always something in there to see
It's nights like these when you know that your alive I feel like I've been living
I'd a hit everything, from Cancun to Grant's tomb
Climbing these walls in an hourglass
I could claw back my heart and soul
Pra mamae, mamae titia
A phrasing that's a single tear,
That dazzles my eyes
Now it won't shine
When your mourning has a sound
Doesn't have to be that way
A record wheel
I'll take my eyes off the prize
Think we're ooh so unique
Now I'm peaking in so many ways
Have a sniff, it smells like a cigarette
Move in a little closer, let me tell you about
It involves pain to look inside
Hey mister, we gone and done it
I'm ready for the good times
Could I make you stay
Getting thinner by the hour
But I don't care, I'd rather wait for you
This is a song that came upon me
We'll just have to wait and see Wait and see 
Nothing can save us
Fightin' the good fight
I felt your body move through my coat
Is the best love best love
Do the shackles underneath your bed
Oh baby
And we all want something beautiful
But my heart finds a dream in these unseen hues
Everywhere you can run
If she lived in space, man
I never knew all that I had
Yeah, so much I just wanna get out
Can you see the lighting flashing
No one in her family knows
I know I'm kind of distant
I can put us to bed tonight
Was it the mending of the gown, or the running it around
And made it light
When we were together you tried to break my heart
Now give me the catalog, I'll show you how daddy bought
So maybe tonight I'll be the libertine
All we are is too fast for love
You weren't that drunk, and that I was your favorite Salsa dancer you had ever come across in New York city
Some Christmas Eve some God was kind enough to set aside
We'll be lying together tonight
It's the way you swell, slow
Out on the blue sea
He's got  tattoos
And even better, I get to be the other half of you
Another scene that we're creating,
Before the sun rises
That I can feel
It's always a good time then
And only I still call you mine
It's a sweet summer's night in Hammer Hill
I'm still waiting for
I walk through
But now its time to get some better days some better days
I'm curing viewers by thousands
You've got it all worked out with so little time
And I love it that way
Down came the good fairy and the good fairy said,
And I share her love of wine and cake
Left a thumpin in my head
Snooze all afternoon
A love natural, oh that love actual
And I dress with what I was blessed with
Everywhere I went it seems I'd been there before
Doesn't matter when
Can you feel that yeah
When time stands still as it's trapped inside the letterbox you gave back to me
But there's always someone cooler than you
You've been wasting my time, always
And while in the meantime roaches used to climb my door
Beyond the northern light
And then drive that train
Even if the words are probably gonna hurt
Ooh, ooh, no
I've got my Scrabble game, food on my plate, good friends and family
Little bitty hearts upon my cheek
Let's begin, bring this BS to an end
Look up child
On the verge of a world profound
You're a hot track, you're my super duper star
Oh, what a world this life would be
Yeah and we both despise all of the academic swine
And my broken heart
And dance, dance
My black dress
It was clear there was no one else around
But there is nothing like someone new
You just take it or you leave it where it was
You can see there's something in the way
Circuit flights bend the lights when I am spent
Can't you hear the laughter in the air
It was a straightfaced lie
'Cause there's a river runnin' underground
To make you understand I don't have time to explain
I don't wanna look at fashion magazines
Where your skinhead friend passed out for several hours on the bathroom floor
And it make my day if you would just stay for awhile
Whatever you got in your crib
The thunder struck, the clouds appeared
Well if it was me then I would, I would
And I love you
Just to be loved
Ring all the bells sing and tell the people everywhere that the flower has come
I wanna turn all their dance floors
My words are just ccccoming out all wrong
Girl come with me, it's plain to see
One thing's for certain, I'm insecure
Comment ca va  Je ne sais pas 
Yes, to get the answer
Staring at their shoelaces
For the rest of my life
But in this world who would
But hear me when I say I'm glad we steered that way
Uhhuh, yeah
I'd make a wish for sunshine for all the while
Everything was bathed in light
But my party has just begun
Always meant to be, I can feel it
Heartbreaker, it just feels like somethings going on
Here is your shovel, there's the ground
Don't on the good times
First as tragedy, then as farce
But when I look in the window I see girls on TV
Nanananananananananight work
Like grey paint caked on a flower
I can't tell what kind of life I've led today
I feel a burning in my eyes
Do you want it to be outside in the sunshine
See maybe if the world contained
Gotta do the night work
Is what you're feelin'
She'll hold your hand Hold out your hand
They can always find
Just when I was gettin' used to the humdrum
In Paris on winter nights
And when I wake so helpless and thinking of that
Hey Eugene do you remember me
In my thoughts in my eyes
I'm not afraid of a love parade in my daydream 
With what they say and what they do
And now things are gonna get better, baby
I fell to the ground on a windy, windy night
And I've got a hunch that you're thinking the same thing and with some luck
She's got me dancin'
Oh baby do you want to dance
There will never be a time when we have to say goodbye
I'm finally breaking free from fear 
Now you know that I can see you and you know that it is easy
Was it the mending of the gown, or the running, and the running it around
Kicking beer cans and rubbish along the concrete
Baby love has gone
Your naked body shimmers in the night
Is it true you just don't care
No wonder I feel
Well sometimes I go out by myself
Well, if I had to choose a number
My baby just can't take her eyes off me
Your true love has drunk herself into not being able to pay her rent
Because if you throw a light
All of the things that go to make heaven and this
 nightmares and  days since I got near you and your anxious ways,
We'll spend some time together
You speak kind
Show me your love
Even if nobody else sings along
Just a little bit higher, then I come back down
Did you know I could be a lot of fun
I've never been laid so low
Did knock me off my feet
Und um das Ganze noch zu toppen, gehen wir shoppen in LA
Oh, what is it your thinking
So while you daydream my Mercedes gleam
When feelings with meanings keep on appearing
I'll stop my heart and then I'll wait for you
And we like different minds workin' off the same brain
Time that we had was like sand in our hands
Nigga's talkin' shit they ought to quit
Their control over the sky
And the moment could last them for ever
You keep callin' me back to your heart
Ooh ooh ooh, oh oh
Sweet Pacific scenes through,
I know where I stand I know just where I stand
I felt you footstep silent but heavy, you followed me onto the shuttle
I'm depending on you
With the warm, salty sea
I hold your hand when you weep
So for the rest of my life
And I can feel that destiny is on my side
It hurts me deep inside and
Mr Higginson, am I not good enough for the world
They hoped and prayed
First let's see the West End, I'll show you to my brethren
So I'll have to say I told you, 
Blame it on the boogie, woo
I've played it in clubs and I've played it in bars
But with you
The walls line the bullet holes
Inside my head, your voice
Standing in the spotlight, I bought myself a gray guitar
Complete attention to a 
That's how I am girl
Something you may not believe, yeah
But things started to slide and thinking in retrospect
Let your fit body bury it
I promise you I will bring you home
You make my heart beat faster
Look at her falling out of a taxi cab
I'm onto you, yeah you
Now it's your turn you will tie me to the tree
It's always a surprise
It's all right
But baby I'm fine because maybe you're mine
I remember mother that day
You can't understand we be Waikiki
Agora so me falta sair
All the girls in the bathroom, talking
Heyladayla my boyfriend's back
And you thought he was cute before
And young girls
There's something going on that's not quite right, uh huh
But let me draw attention to a exhibit B
I, I bet I know what she's like
I know you won't stay there forever
Where the light's even and bright
We've got an energy
Everybody
Love that you just can't help feeling
Can find a song for every time they've lost and every time they've won
Can't live with what he's done
My brain is super fried
I went home, we stared blank
It got you this far
Can't say I'd even notice it was absent
See we'd rather fight with music
What is the secret to your song'
It wouldn't be a bad thing
Mr Jones and me staring at the video
To play five songs and drink some more and fall asleep
With the invite in my hands
If she's your only then why are you lonely
When you're happy to be alive
For though I cannot fly
Ahah, okay
Everything that I'm trying to say
Because I'm free of you now
Talk of the weather will do
Though I need you more than air
You make my dreams come true
Would angels come aflying down
There's lots of things that I can't find
From this second story window I can hear the church bells
While the children of makeshift hills
And it all falls down, there's not enough hours in our life
I have asked myself what are we gonna do
Do you wanna fun dip and drop, look at me in my solo pop box
Looking like you do
That's why you keep on runnin'
When everybody loves you, you can never be lonely
It lights up the dark
Where nobody here could know 
Swim out far 'cause I believe
She points at me
Oh, the days you came around
Gonna gamble everything for love
Standing in your doorway where we use to kiss
And I hope to be free
I can wash your sins away
Whenever you call me
Ever remember what's the use
No need to sleep we come alive
On your way down
For a small town girl like me
Still I burn this earthen fire
I feel so alive so alive
Oh baby, yeah, yeah
Walkin' that walk, talk that slick talk
I'll play you a song on my guitar
But it's certain nothing's certain
When the sale comes first
But don't keep up this old line
All that wine was tight
The life I chose is past
Though I'm thinking it's not what I wanna hear
But no matter what daylight brings to us
Don't know what I was on but I think it grows in Oregon
Rotting on the train tracks
My life had barely started since you jumped all my heart
Oh rejoice, his eyes are big X's
And I lay in your bed again
I don't need you to hold my hand
We bounced a blue ball
Old men with kazoos and beating drums 
Yes I was
No point regretting that it went so fast
Oh yes, about that thing
Or maybe let you watch too much TV
On random notes of parchment I'm scrawling my existence,
I'm gonna turn my back to everything I know
I never knew till someone told me that
There's a place where the strange ones go
And we know the night is always gonna be here anyway
Spiritual fashion, yeah
But the new kids have got one above
She kept on dancing, refused my romancing
Don't show me no more, please
I carved our names in a tree there,
Forget about the price Hey tag Hey
And we all fall down, there's not enough hours in a day
Beginnin beginnin beginning beginnin yeah
I wanna see me staring right back at me
But I don't, and I won't, so you've got another thing coming
Our fearless crew was not prepared
Sunshine on the water looks so lovely
Don't lift a finger, let me hold you
My heart plays a rhythm in my head
I'm in the way
If this is how I feel
So you're standing on a ledge
There's a blue sky
I'm there when you fall
I said, "That's one thing I won't be needing"
But in my heart I know
When I don't wanna dream
Love forever love forever baby
Behold the "Super Keith" on the cup
We'll fall asleep
I visit your city and I've slept on your floors
To hear her talking again
So I left it beside the road
But the streets are still white, been this way for so long, yes I know
I know you've been sworn
It's hard to celebrate with a headache Oh Yeah Yeah
Because it's on like
And they say,
It's so funny, we went down to the store
I can sing a song of suffering
What matters most Everything
Suspended in the air
'Cause the numbers are wearing off
For something good, for something great
Are getting mirrored everywhere
One of these nights I may just
My first love, and my only muse
You call the shots
A few more minutes till they bury me
When all is in order you get lost in the heat
Denn ab heute bist du mehr als an nur einem Ort daheim
Cause each and every day you would hear those four letters
And she takes your hand when the world stays outside
Just touched down in London town
As the glow from the street light bled
This world, which time forgot
Uhoh, here we go, turn up the radio
Don't you blame it sunshine
You hold me up
When the frisbee in the sky
Everyone was funny and everyone was pretty
Too many voices
But only in the street man
Sailin' all the seas we've never seen before
Make all our dreams of make believe reality
Just stylishing cars 'cause they all true Nig'
Will I surround you, entombed and warm
If you're willing let it go
always be the wind from your wings
I said hello, Eugene
And we've found the music
You never had a boyfriend
And we got me this far
He was a man of many nations, two hearts, two hands, it's a slippery slope
That makes me fly
Just to be loved by you, baby, yeah
Now we can see what do we need
I'm curious I need to see
You shouldn't wake me awhile
Because these days aren't easy
A game that I'm destined to lose
Don't forget, don't forget about me
Then rock it, dance right till it falls,
Don't you blame it sunshine
I wanna walk into the mall
Do you want to dance under the moonlight
Slim chicks, round chicks
In a way I'm relieved
You're okay in your secret place
Close those doors now
Wish it didn't faze me
Mr Jones and me tell each other fairy tales
Making love to only you, so
You're Travolta getting into your groove
And sometimes I feel like I ain't nothing at all
And our attributes are the same
Let's be, let's be love
Che cosa posso dare
You gotta walk tall
So much for believing the fat guy doesn't win
We're ripped apart by the crow and the vultures
There was no time or location 
We just wanna make the world dance
Why don't you come on over Valerie
Honey in my tea
No, I couldn't cut a check with a blade
All his songs are stolen so he hides
Do I drive you up a tree
Get the girl in the end I never thought that I could
I'm pickin' up good vibrations
Thinkin' that his head surely would explode
Shined a diamond with no end to its trip
I walk in from the kitchen
And I don't know why I stay, I should leave instead
Yeah, yeah, yeah, whoo
Your friends were pretty cool
I watch you held aloft way out of my reach
And the sunshine
Here is a bedroom that you've never been in and
Rave on, it's a crazy feelin'
But we got lovely posters for sale
There's something in the sun this day, I feel it
And rejoice despite the fact this world will kill you
Sweet thing 
And there goes my hero, he's a underdog
How I loved to catch your gold and silver tears
Speak in the garden
And make me still believe 
And it's cold inside
In fact, I wish your heart was mine
But when I look behind, I'm so glad that you were mine
I play the music in the sun
You had me going out of my head
Born to a world where it is a fight just to fit in
And I want you to see when the sun goes up"
Everything dies
The sound is ringing clear
But now, my dear
Woke up on the right side of the bed
You wanna see the smile on my face
When we get delayed can we cast a line towards anyone dismayed
But there's never been a song or a melody
Why don't you come right out and say it what it is your thinking
All the boys raise your hands up in the air yeah
You'll be haunted by her face
I wanna walk into the store
The game was gruesome
To get out of this town
"On the roof" he says
Until you're sleeping 
Now that I've got the disease
But we'll climb right back up
But stood like kings
You say I'm acting naughty but girl you're naughty too
Oh, bubbles, float through the air,
We're all children of
Next stop, right around the corner from your mom and 'em
Is my cup of tea
Where my life's sweet as it's slightly disappointingly just gliding softly by
He is the perfect boy
Everything makes sense when you
The windows of aeroplanes and hotel rooms
All my friends know it keeps the
Never seen the sun shine
In the need
All that you said to me is still so very clear
Can you hear the beat of my heart
She was a young girl
We all wanna be big big stars
From the cradle to the grave, it never ends
I do what work for me, you do what work for you
About whether to flake out or fecking stay out
But you should never let the sun set on tomorrow
Bajando de la montana en seguida me puse a cantar una cancion sin motivo pero tu te tenias que quejar y siempre estas asi no puedes parar no puedes entender que quiero estar solo que no puedo ser como los demas que solo significa sin nadie alrededor y si me voy ya no se como vas a poder decir que lo que hago es cosa tuya y yo solo voy detras a repetir lo que digas tu como el loro al dueno si todos saben que soy el que te ensena las historias de naves espaciales los tambores y los pasos de baile y en vez de estar nadando juntos en el fondo del mar en una hoguera con los cuentos de noche me querias quemar y siempre estas asi no puedes parar no puedes entender que quiero estar solo que no puedo ser como los demas que solo significa sin nadie alrededor
'Cause I like your head on my shoulder
And they only steal me away from you
Cooler than you girl
For a taste unknown
I could wrap you up, wrap you up in my love
If I don't need anymore why's this bus taking me back again
If I am another waste of everything you hoped for
You are invited for all time 
I hope she sticks around when he does dirty in this dirty, dirty duel he has brewed
In the heart that you've been handed
There's nothing else to do
And it's magic if the music is groovy
I keep comin' back to you
I know it's useless to complain all these years after, well
The king and the queen
Haunt the records in their grooves
So keep breathing
Please don't misfire
From the fine, fine girl with nothing but good intentions
Oh, once you crawl in you'll never come back again
To see Chrissy kiss the corpse
Somebody push me through the door,
Everybody dies frustrated and sad
We all know
I had my mouth on her nose
Little rivers run in rings around the town,
And if you catch us coming up about around the bend
When the chaperone said that we'd been crowned
With the beat one two
And at my feet, it fell, like
So look out now 'cause he's comin' after you
I just can't seem to shake Emily
Each time it feels its in vain
I've been sleeping on the floor
Who's gonna stop me on the road to success
When I woke up with a smile,
You can't buy one at the mall but he'll come if you just call
Cuando menos piensas
To rock it till there's light our fists in the air
It was a straightfaced lie I believed
Oh I love you and that's all you need to know
When you've got me on my knees
Looking for a place
I said "Yes, okay, let's,"
I guess their fathers taught them well
With the sun on my shoulder and the wind in my back
You know you make me feel so good
I don't know
You are who you are
It's not appealin' as you truly speak your feelings
To make history of a love, a love like ours
Can't you see if I could be anything
I think I heard you, yeah
Gonna climb that hill behind my house
Wondering where would I be without you in my life
You'll always remember my name 
Boys will be boys
I miss you, forever you'll stay gold
But she wants to keep you in her corner
Ain't nothing new, now, now
Keep it together
And made it light made it light
This small town, without you,
Down all the power
But yours and that boogie good times
And we don't know what's left,
You call me up around noon and
Straight in the eye
I tried with books but I'm not pleased yet
Em caras de presidentes
We'll last until the end
Midnight, who lost control and found this world
And though you will see me with someone else
Cross the delta looking
Every fucker needs a home
Well, I know you like her
Find a one who could turn you on
Kissing and having fun
It's a little red sea let the miracle worker go free
And although they still exist,
And I wasted tears, I let go
On the back page of a supplementary magazine
I wrote you in this song woo woh
You rattle my bones
Sacrifice it all and maybe say
Don't know what to do
Float through the air air air air
The midnight fell, we felt the measure fall
We both think the weather's getting better
There's stardust in my head
Come on LA, take advantage
Do you want to dance
The feeling alive
By then I'd stopped looking for my way out
I get you off till the break of dawn
I recall, Central Park in fall
In the places that you never knew to get through
I'd ask but we don't know how far these interstates go
And you rock chicks, datin' hip hop chicks
Damn, I wish I was and that you were too
We gotta make it all the way
When everybody loves you, oh, son
We don't care what they think
It's all about chemistry, sweet Pacific scenes
There's no need for guessing
Anything we find out
I hope for you to get through this rain
Knew this girl back in junior high school
Thoughts of love
We like our fun and we never fight
Get out of my life
And your friends were pretty cool
Have faith that when you call on me
Now that they've shown you what to get
Since You took my heavy heart
A jealous Frankie Valli says "Dawn, I want you back"
But you, you look swell
We gotta take it now Yeah
And your soles are worn
She's got me dancin
'Cause I lived with many ghosts when I was younger
I'm leaving the light on just for the sight
Get mugged at knifepoint
But dreams come true, honey; welcome to my reality
You're dead to me if love is death
'Two chord cool in the head,' she sings
Keep your chin up when you're feelin' lonely
I want you to know To know
You can run
And he saves the day and the world knows So watch his head explode
I can be anything that I, anything that I see
Put it in a place you keep what you need
And now try to guess what goes on in your head
We shot them in the things we said
I know, oh, it's got me reelin'
She said my name and my spirit are both corrupt and if you hold me close, you gotta hold me up
Cause you my friend have had your day
I hope that you know I'm wondering where you are 
And we might break up
You know now mama's torn
Well me personally, It's nothin' personal
Because wherever we are in this great big world
If you wanna move it so, why don't you make it go
Che cosa vuoi spezzare
I'm tired of waiting here for him
So, I kept on going, going, gone right through
Understanding that I misunderstood
Gotta let it
So we have to get off
You said, "I don't know, you don't know"
It longs for me, and someday we
And don't pick up the line
So then I hooked up with a model from Singapore
But three days later
And now look at me
You're extraordinary, baby
Clowne towne a big dumb kid
Makes me want to kiss and not
Woah, woah woah yeah
Run along, run a long way to find a one
You've got to make your own kind of music
And if you must be going, I will understand
I say that I don't have the strength 
And he is watching
Yours and that boogie sunshine
I love being in love
I'm wide awake, and so are you 
Turn around and what do ya do I don't know
And I will make it someday
From cradles to sleepless nights
I watched it all come crashing down
You'll be in love, there's no other way
We all fall down, there's not enough hours in the day
Don't use this one to point the blame
Don't lift a finger let me show you
I wanna travel round the world
Shoot me out of sight
Find a place that you don't know
But before I sign it
I guess the thing I'm trying to tell you
You've got to express what is taboo in you
When I'm dead will use my bed
We need to take it back in time
And I won't be back in your neighborhood
There's only one song worth singin'
But in my room, I hear the sound of trumpets,
Our friends are so unreasonable
Ooh la la, that's what you are
You'll do what was done unto you
Another day older and closer to the grave
Changed the color of you hair, are you busy
You gotta believe
Please say it is so 
So I won't be harmed But I know I can shoot my own arrows
I hope somebody lends me a dime
You're so ooh You're so, so ah You're so, so cool Baby, you're so supersupremelybabadioh
Everytime you look like that
Don't run and hide
I'm tired of believing in the things that go on here
You don't pay no mind
Their moonlit delights
Because it's cloudy out there
Calling me all the while
She's grinning, singing, spinning me round and round
All the way, get lucky
And the basic construction of my feet
The wuthering heights
CCC climb to the top of the mountain break ya backbone
I just wanna compliment
If things go right, we're meant to be 
Get me through the weekend
With hard working security guards
But now I've got a shoulder that I can lean on
On the wings of an eagle
What have I done with it
All I can say is I can't fake it
I don't know when I've been beaten
It must make you sad to know that nobody cares at all
Maybe it's your awesome songs or maybe it's the way
Well I would feel for you
Happy New Year, you are my only vice
I'm there with no questions asked
Let my shoes lead me forward, please bring me some luck
Are there people you don't recognize, do they lie
And everything starts today
Everybody needs a home
Now you'll wear any old thing, oh you'll wear any old thing
I'd sing a song to make you feel this way
Tell me, does it make you feel too real
The hateful, hateful tough little boys
Che cosa vuoi tentare Che cosa
You were shooting at me instead of landing on her
I need you here tonight
I've only count the sunny hours, brightest hours of day
I've always been quietly dreaming
But you are just a blur
Oh rejoice, the sky's fucking falling
I dream you paint the stars against the twilight
We don't go around here putting poison in wine
All these games you play you're messin' with my head
A mouth said, "Not a sound at all"
And parting with them is like
But you never let me stray out of your view
Every penny don't fit the slot
Don't need to deny the hurt and the lies
But seeing you with him
Hey Yeah, yeah, yeah
You're still waiting for someone who never ever came
Especially when I take my clothes off
To hide the fact your girlfriend keeps textin' me
Was to backstab
But later that week it was Friday once again
Ooh, you can go your own way
I would hitch a cable car
But either way, I'm a man of many nations"
C'mon c'mon
I've had this itchin in my shoes since I was just a little kid
In a minute you can realize you lost it all
Take it easy son, this ain't so deadly
Now she commands
Why don't you come on over Valerie Valerie Valerie Valerie Valerie oh Valerie Valerie Valerie
The Taliban said who rejuvenated your eyes, boy
Your making curtains out of my shroud
And bluer skies reflect in your eyes
So cut the crap, stop that shit, don't be dumb, I will love you forever
Around me
I never count the gloomy hours, I let them slip away
While we're thinking 'bout the people we meet
They searched but they could find no trace of us
If you're looking
That we work as one
Can you take me back to that place where stars glow
Message to the world, can you feel the heat is rising 
Don't make me feel ashamed
Make me feel tiny if it makes you feel tall
And I will live with many ghosts until I go
They gonna remember me
I miss making your room a mess
And I know this is not the way it should be
Heyla, heyla, my boyfriend's back
In the perfect fashion; just watch my heart's reaction
She's too good to be true
But then I act like I know everything
It feels like ten thousand nights of thunder
On an island with red kites and verdant seas
That won't wipe off your face no matter how hard you try
Man I can't tell as she says to me
My bones begin to shiver 'cause I'm aching to deliver
But you know there will always be some oddball singing
Take it, take control
As the descent began I got the distinct impression
Then she sigh 'ah there's one thing
And all this time it was staring me blind
He had a fear of being naked, but you're any other man in another man's clothes
They know this, they know it all
And you still think that you're so it
'Cause you'll be going loco down in acapulco if you stay too long
To do all the things you used to do to me
They kill their lives every day
So many faces
You don't talk of dreams
Hear ye, hear ye, punks and skins and journeymen
I feel like a machine
You bite my lip
Then we know we've packed up all we had to move from '
Unfearing, allappearing message divine
And your face and your eyes and your hair
Beneath the fruity landslide we both laughed hysterically
Still I wallow in the mire
I only just left my dying bed and
And pointing my way
You enjoy your life
Put your new weight in gold and see what it's worth
I be riding in my car with the music all the way up
I think I'll download a brand new head
And now they see we rollin',
Even lucky man has a bad day
Living in a lonesome avenue
To make your kissing complete
You're feelin' good
Gonna grab some afternoon delight
By the moon by the sea
I say it all the time
There is one time that I'm thinking of
I know you won't admit this
Nights like these when you know that you got fire My life from the beginning
It blooms to spread love and joy faith and hope to people forlorn
Believe in me 'cause I don't believe in anything
I don't mind if you play your game
You are so brave
Nothing in this whole wide world saves us from this situation
When I speak from my heart you laugh like it's a game
So I've got a  I got a new girl repeat  times
Let your heart go where the wind takes it
I've been living out my dream everything I saw came true
He laughed under his breath
Everybody look to the left
Hey Eugene, then we kissed once we lugged your friend into the elevator and went to write my number on a soggy paper towel
I search among the clouds trying to see you
We had some real fun
Or any other random spirit lover busted, I have lusted after you
Guess it serves me right
Oh yeah, Mary Ann
The sky is perfectly brown instead of black
Our history is damaged, at least it was a thrill
But I will give them all back to you
Dreams come bouncing in your head
Try to mute the sound,
She didn't choose this role
Waiting for the rain to stop
Girl stop your talking
You shouldn't wake me awhile 
Don't come near, don't make a sound
You're messin' with my head
That I got to be
Air in my lungs, air in my lungs
Back and forth, side to side, oh my dear
Your feasty eyes won't make me fall apart
Some girls they got something to prove there's usually one or two
Jump out your bed, shake your head, clear the haze
And all of my unfaded charms
Work out just fine
Not who I was in the spring
We were born on an island, we grew out of the sand
When you and I both know this is the end 
Yeah, for the rest of my life
Then I could barely carry your weight
I've got some loving for your soul
You go in that team, I go on this team
In this world of wisdom
I said 'You know, Doc, I don't feel swell,
And I'm feeling the love of you
Well I've strolled across some dance floors
Everything's a mess,
Don't matter what you find
My lips were much too shy
Oh rejoice, the world we know is turning
Rejoice despite the fact this world will hurt you
Back in my head we were kissing
Invisible wires keeping us apart
Staring out of classroom windows
But heaven knows I know
Once upon a time, not too long ago, we took a day out in Manchester
To light the way gladly
At the bar just sippin a drink
I used to love The Tenderloin
Che cosa vuoi tentare
And if we're gonna take this ride we can go wherever we like
I said to my sidekick, I'm up to my high wick
End of story, I fade to black inside
Peter Pan, I'm a sucker for Smucker's jam girl
Don't go feeling insecure, no feeling sad
You're the best in the world
Little piece of me wants to go I don't know
Why don't you come on over Valerie Valerie Valerie Valerie
And as long as it's talking with you
It feels so special
Nobody can take that
And waiting pent, save, sad, and look 
Divide everything, a flag or a number
You're gonna struggle with that
But she looked at me with a glazed smile and said
How you tore your dress, what a mess, I confess
In a different time, in a different city
That father's sleeping
It feels like I'm constantly playing
They stole the children
And now little rich girl
It's all an orchestra of strings
I hope my little brother puts a call in today
It's what we are
Let the lovin', let the lovin' come back to me
What's all this talk about love
Inside a thousand people with yellow ribbons sing
And we dance in the living room
Just in case someone thought they had missed it
So here's your life
Maybe it was only a dream
There's still room in my wooden horse for two
I been reggae and calypso
Those pretty faces always
And if he feels my traces in your hair
To find a diamond at the bottom of the drain
Then you're destined for the world without chores and sweating 
Don't like his baggy jeans, but I'ma like what's underneath them
Some say, yeah
I woke this morning shackled and drawn
I still believe I still believe
When I say I'm not excited
That you'll be thinking about me now
So far away from everyone
And I don't get around how you get around
Everybody needs this happy thing
Your true self has become weak and alone and annoying
And hope to God it hasn't changed
The way her shadow used to walk by your side
Last night we had a rendezvous
I'm rolling so quickly
I want to feel through you tonight
Your turquoise and silver won't weaken this old heart
I'm big in every way I'm running as fast as I can
Everybody is dancin' in the moonlight
It's a mystery, I guess
How can I say
Tastes just like a warm body fluid goin' down
And up in my head I'm your boyfriend
I hope he don't forget where he came from
It's green, the fire
But I made it to three, and I foreclose a five minute fantasy
When was the last time you smoked a cigarette
Fights away all that decay
How d'you do Comment allezvous 
Shut my mouth and just believe
Said you always did your best at keeping us apart
I'm sittin' here on the back porch just eatin' chocolate pudding
Walking with a love, with a love that's all so fine,
And tiny island chains throughout the sea
My boyfriend and the summer's end is here again
Gotta keep those lovin' good vibrations ahappenin' with her
The best thing I can think to do right now is leave it alone
Many works, Many men converse
"She's perfect for you, Man, there's got to be somebody for me"
And when I'm with her she talks about you, the things that you say, the things that you do
He can't wait to tell you about his new girl
Boy what I'm feeling never feel it about another
But I forgot how to love
That you are my precious little girl
If you really love me
And I know you're tired of hearing it
Me I like the way you smile, the way you smile oh oh
It starts in the morning
I know you're gonna move again, and again and again
This song is not a fuck song
If you're sitting in the places that we use to be
The stars this night in the sky are ringing out
Well I woke up in too many beds with girls I didn't know
And heavy is fine
Do you believe like I believe Do you believe in magic
Solo creo en tu sonrisa azul
They'll just have to wait and see Wait and see
I gave it all and managed to get shot down yet again
The guys were feeling good about their liquor run
Now it's evening and the sausages are frying out back
Feat Carina Andersson
No one in the world ever gets what they want
And my shaking is 'yes'
I better check my pride because
It's funny how we've seem to made it, funny how we can even walk up straight
A dollar short, a minute early
Its either them or me, girl who you wanna do
Sie will Designerschuhe und davon
Empty hands and tired eyes
And keep you safe inside of me
This ship will still sail on
When I crash my beloved desk job
Smiling as I start to fall
Of the cherry blossom tree
I sit here in this chair and I wish,
From this second story window I can hear the children
It's a suicide, waiting, so decide
Keep 'em open, yeah, keep 'em open
"You wanna be all right you gotta walk tall"
Don't set aside
At night during dreams of submission
Freaked out, dropped my phone in the pool again
When we meet we can talk awhile 
And I felt so many wrongs
I flashed it once and I was inside with a drink 
That God made me this day
In step
Imprisoning me
She said I'll show you some rhythm
Playin' around
Of the time when they mattered to someone
So we make it up as we go along I won't let you down
You're the last to know
Happy with no teeth
So I'll run away to the hopes that I have
You know we've got a good thing going
Give me envy, give me malice, baby, give me a break
Being here alone tonight with you
With the desire to carry on
And pretty girl has a scar
This point of view is nothing that I'm used to
I don't mind if you play your game
In the midnight moonlight I'll, be walkin' a long and lonely mile
Hey, That's okay
But we don't know why and we don't know how
And the car went down
Won't you tell me, yeah
I'm going with my bad self
And then I feel the weight and then I come back down
Was it the mending of the gown, or the running, and the running, and the running it around
Ain't about the yeah babling, babling
I found a lover and then I lost myself
If that's all you will be, you'll be a waste of time
Baby look over your shoulder
Smiling in the bright lights, coming through in stereo
When you're dancing to this tune
There's not enough hours in our life
To find some kind of glow
Life was always back and forth and we were idling or making useless ruckus
Deep in a sleeping bag in your backyard
Why is everybody so serious
Wintertime in London, are you making plans
So far down, or maybe you were thinking about jumping
But baby, where'd you go
Rockin' back 'n' forth
Then the news would not be telling me
I was lost from the start
Say what you want, say what you mean
To take a second look
Day in, day out, I worked through the same old plight
Hoping that I step on out
I know that's what you've been saying lately
My heart goes like,
Some guys they get a little bit uptight
Even when no one is feeling
I will be there with you
It's like a power
It's difficult to see from the surface
When my pencil tips broken and my brain is too
With your ruffled hair
I've always been chasing rainbows
We could close the door and sleep all day 
Starts at  and plays through to sunrise the next day
Why your answer machine's still on
"Wake up child"
And I know you treat him like me
On a blue street
As night falls into dust and it's day again 
So I could fall in love with you
Everything you said
I just lay back down
I barely had the chance to shout
Make me want to be with you
Unless I'm unhappy and hugging my grudge
Late nights, play fights,
Stainedglass skyways and crowded  lane highways
Faith can keep you warm, but I'll teach you how to shake
You're so ooh You're so, so ah You're so, so cool Baby, baby, you're so
Remember all the game have I tried
I don't know where, but she sends me there
And messses up with you and falling
All I wanna hear is your voice
Yeah I'll stop or start my heart if you ask me to
No pointed fingers trying to keep you quiet
She's calling out
These pills are fine to pass the time
Something about a party and he didn't go 
But most of all I want no more tears
And waiting pent, save, sad, and look
And I think I've seen the light, Yeah I think I see the light, I'll be here for
Am I the only one gettin' tired
I wanna be just' bout as happy as I could be
I always act a fool ow, ow
We dance on the sidewalks
Can we miss the storm that sucked the whole world in
Don't try coming back
Won't you show us where you heart is
And I'll write about you dancin' without you
And magic eyes to read between the lines
Where you been 
Who line up girls
With the allure of something new
And as we planned there's fireworks, stage right,
If I was in your shoes I'd probably do the same too
Yeah, yeah, I'm just being
I'm trying to see how your lips feel
Just turned 
I said hello hello, Eugene Eugene
Going to put us together with glue or an elastic band
I see you dancin' but you never ever mark your words
You were always the one
Little kids see me, way out in DC
Wanna make the world dance
We should need nothing, nothing at all Yeah
You the shit
And just to taste your lips
Well it never was
I threw it down at his feet and I said
Drowning in despair
Even if he has to wrong someone
The father's gone
But when everybody loves me
I don't go for secretive games
And have another baby
I like the way you smile, the way you smile oh oh
Come on baby girl, let me see those legs
The sun bursts, cloud breaks
I'll sing a softer tune
That I want for the rest of my days
Everybody Singing Along
I'll sellotape them up
I'm just a penny on the train track
Lyin' on the bed while I'm at the piano
I walked a year to hear a howl in this give and take
And at least just for a second I think I might stay
Yeah, I know I'm Cain'd but now I'm feelin' Abel
When I say "Shotgun," you say "Wedding"
You just can't let them pull that cloth over your eyes
Nights like these when I'm drowning in your eyes
The hourglass it tictoc too fast for our destiny
While looking at me with the same eyes ever again
You're the type of girl that any guy would die for
Yeah, I don't want to be number four
The summer's gone too soon
But let me hear you say
Take a look around
I will, I'll make my great escape
Can we go it alone say say say
Overhead in the airway
But you smack me like a pinball
Keep that sweet heart of yours beating
Been dreaming about you a lot
And everybody loves a comeback
You can't picture love that you took from me
'Cause I'm the only one, who knows the things you've done
Keep your eyes glued to the floor
Where did he go
I'm all be e e, be e e be all right y'all
You come around every day to collect me far off into the nighttime,
You really got a hold on me
Got perfect timing with you
Hey such a mess but I don't care
Our time reduced to an honorable mention
Slow, slow it down, wait
They know inside
See whenever we're together
Although I'd love you too, I'm proud of you
Last night you sat home waiting, and I got home much too late, yeah to late
If I could wish upon a star
When the chaperone said that we were dancing too close
Who do you call to ease your pain
"Nothing else is real
I lock the door and check my pockets
I dance in blue shoes and wear a blue hat
You could be mine
It's just another one of those glory days
We can fall right out of bed
And in my head I paint a picture
Never been laid so low low low low
Oh yeah
Sunny with a High of 
I been so damn lost since you're not around
Oom bop bop, good vibrations
And put the flower underneath a microscope
Love it when you hold me,
With someone that can make me
Gonna make this songbird sing
Woahwoah, woahohoh the girl got hot
It's am, that's the evening your time,
Then passed Ernst's mausoleum defended by a rook
I'm so glad you're revealin' your love for me
Bring it, bring it, bring it, bring it, bring it back to me
Go and run through the hallways, find your way to the door
'Cause I, I wanna be someone who believes, yeah
Tell me, tell me you love me only
Let me show you, girl,
Why is everybody so obsessed
And we both know the weather will get better
To save the world or go to work
I wake up at twilight
You dream, you make movies, you dance
When you don't care then you got nothing to lose
Tell me, are the people strange, do they change
I've been aiding my fall 
Smoking, often, and calling out our guilty pleasures
And people lost their lives
I never had a girlfriend
While you are down on one knee
Sunshine on my shoulders makes me happy
Scanned the cafeteria for some good seating
But I know differently
I guess I'm quite controlling
But then you found me and everything changed
Don't try to stop the tail that wags the hound
Can we keep it together
Gonna drive my car to the sea
Yeah Yeah, now ride it, you've got to ride it
I made my way to a party all the way 'cross town 
Ignite the starry fire
Yeah, they shine like stars under the ground,
Yeah, we stare at the beautiful women
Les parties qu'on ne voit pas
Man I wish I was beautiful
Well this is life in motion motion
She's picking up her clothes
Got a handful with their projects and with their looks
Your friends they wanna leave girl they're calling you
A famous figure for every picture
And watch me run with it
You will see my delight
I thought you liked it but you called it cheap
Every street you walk on
Don't think for a moment
You know that imma do whatever I'm not gon' leave
Checked out of my room, hit the ATM
I'm not like the other guys you see
'Cause I'm right here, right here, right here, right here at home
We got the money, we got money, we got the money now
And that's just a thing that takes time
Every day, I'm away from you
You're not holding yourself in your arms tonight
Take it all with what we've done
The things that shouldn't last
Could believe for all the world 
She was a black Thai bombshell out of Bombay
There goes the heartbreak
Straight down the line
A fire burns inside me
It's up to me if I decide to be what I think is right
We look to Los Angeles
The vast expanses, the need to grind
You're giving me a heart attack
Would he need you
And playing video games in the middle of the night
They sing a song with jelly jars and bird calls 
I woke up this morning shackled and drawn
He's not so wonderful
I get a prescription and set it on fire
To be the freak that god made me
She goes above and beyond her call of duty
The devil's gotten to me through this dance
Lady singer with pinky toes
I'm turning into something
She looked incredible
I met a Mexican called Juan
I don't think I'll ever be happy,
And I can't believe you got that girl
Social Security Number please
Let me go on loving you
I was so frightened
But in the end they're just a suit
You are saying baby it's time to go
You've got to ride your train
Can ya take me far away from here, save my soul from sin
"Morning's teeth are lit"
We'll last a month
Sunshine almost always makes me high
The girls were kinda flirting with the setting sun
Won't you show me everything you know,
There's no such thing
Need a magic ball to see her in the morning
Get out while you can
It sounds all hectic, you're having cold feet
That I've been thinking of you
I borrowed your swings and I've heard your hardcore
Yeah, in Jerry Lee and in Johnny and all the greats
Wishing the card was from you
But I would love you to take my time
We will get ours
So to hell with all that rubbish
I know I'm fucking moody
You burn down the trees
I look tough enough
I sailed a blue ship
Still half high
You run an airtight mission
About all that warfare endlessly and
'Cause I know I'll make you
Wreck shows, collect those, extra O's
I got it in the mail one morning 
So rich on Summer and so sweet
It's all about chemistry, California waves
Our days were filled with frowns
We don't have to wait till the morning
Well how can I guess by the subject of the best predicate that's left unsaid when the matter is too delicate
And I'll come to you like a little girl
They look down from the clouds and smile
A baby's born
Hesitant to tell the real reason, the Nobel PEACE Prize is givenYeah
And he said "Inside of them"
You got my Crate combo
That wouldn't have me in a million years 
So all of a sudden I'm facing the raging river that passed me by
In the exact same way they never did
Sex reminds her of eating spaghetti
But hear it this way hear it this way
But everybody close the door on me
Careful when you open, it's easy to be broken
The love go on and on
To see someone like you
Flyin' through the skies we've never seen before
I used to get so paranoid In places like this
And just to keep me up, God I'm so tired of sleeping
Remember when that crab came up and pinched your feet
I told her I was sorry I came 
Put your mama in a headlock baby
We gathered around the school
These days aren't easy anymore
Hold up your hands to the sky
Hand in hand side by side
While someone does my nails
My stairway to the sky
If he looks within he finds beauty and power
In the room with the alcoholic guest
Che cosa vuoi sognare Che cosa vuoi lasciare
Buy the E, get a key, to the Lex to hold
Can you hear the sound
Tired feet
Felt as fresh as the paint in this new flat
We're staring at all these lights
Now I'm right here, you got me where you want me
Baby be with me so happily
Life is a highway and I'm gonna ride it
Let the sun fade out to a dark sky
Never be a time when we have to say goodbye,
You got your money and I got cast
To show you that I love you
Taking the rough with the smooth
Jesus wrote a blank check, all right
You'll be mine to hold each day, but till then, this is all that I can say
You're still king
Nananananananight work
And the moment to last them forever
Making coffee
Yeah it's dangerous and sweet
And we're climbin' all the way to the top of the highest mountain
Cause, everyday there's a war to fight
The confidence you held in us is the rope we almost hung ourselves with
Dancin' in the moonlight 
You're all of my days
Though I got more hooks than Madonna got looks
Forget that I was ever your whipping boy
Sunshine almost all the time makes me high
So shut shut shut your eyes 
It's a September sky with pretty pictures in my mind 
Aloft in the airway
Whippin' Piccadilly tonight, and it all falls down
Everybody's dancin' in the moonlight
Hear ye, hear ye, these folk songs of the modern age
It couldn't be touched
Didn't know how to move
Good loving find it run amuck
And now it's this minute,
Had to pawn all your nice clothes
Before the rays of morning paint the front lawn
And she'll smile for you She'll smile for you
Don't know whether or not
Just to show that they love one another
When your mood is clear
You've got an energy
And since then loneliness has been
Look both ways when you leave the building
I'd rather wait for you
I want everybody to stand up
Turn out the light
How you got there, so just blow your mind
That's what I love about you babe
Will soon start wearing you
Mayla, know I'm
If you keep looking
Don't wanna stop
Turns out that I'm not to her taste
But we feel it's coming back soon
And she means everything everything
Caught up in your feelings
All anyone can ever want is a copilot
What can I say, we just live too far away 
From a distance, the world looks blue and green
But I like to hold something I can see
Unfolding, enveloping missiles of soul
Jumping round till the ground shook
Sign on the line
You used to be such a sweet young girl
Played a bit of football, fell into the union
Jenny, I need them today
I have weapons and battle plans,
And he's mean talking beanstalking icey man
Well we go back so far,
Speeding through my veins until we hit the ground
Won't you please let me back in your heart
But you don't know what it is
I've been waiting awhile 
She's stopped replying to my texts
There's a party on the hill would you like to come
It was the tender mending of this slender gown that brought me bending to the ground
Thinking of us and making a fuss
We got lucky, hey, didn't we, baby
Through the waves as I scuba dive below the harbor
Nobody will love them, nobody will love them
Simply because I can't
We can make a lot of loving 'fore the sun goes down
When we met I thought money was everything
We're running out of time, two wrongs can make it right
So will you try and look surprised
Yeah but we've got different reasons for that
I watched Superman fly away
Give as good as you get
Con fuego baby
I guess my friends were right
Sapatao a bigodudo
Let's ride the valkyrie, commit a bit of sin
She's says
Ooh la la, love the way that you are
As the sky fade to black
We had some massive nights
But we won't ever let them win
If things go right, we're meant to be
We're both to young to sit around
But do it sound so crazy
Punch that clock and break all the numbers
And save the day, yeah
Hole in the middle, I'm seeing less of you
I feel the wind blow through my hair
Of hopelessness, left standing
I'm still waiting for
Well it's dangerous, and it's sweet
Under ceaseless patterns of weeping light
"The sky is blue, the sea is warm and clear, and golden sands are calling out to you Inviting Make a new man outta you You can come for a while, come with a friend, forget about work, start all over again, let the real you through Here's what we do"
We made some plans and let them go 
And you're hot, cold, you're battering my bones
Rejoice because you're trying your best
You don't need him, you need to be seen
Said now you're dead and gone and I've got a new thing going
Come on the weekend
But they'll still look in your eyes
Baby don't want at the end of the day
Is nothing permanent
I'll shine up my old brown shoes
He knows you're afraid of the dark
So we split apart at last
There is no other way
No one's going to say goodnight
In the jungle, the mighty jungle
The minute hand moves faster than you think it does
We're paying with love tonight
You are invited by anyone to do anything 
Or keeping her own word to her own self
In the end, makin' it right's the main aim
We got the money, we got money, we got the money
Out of luck, so beam me up
Because there's always someone cooler than you
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I leave tear stains on the ground
And there is music in every sight and every sound
From the streets of Babylon
Baby, you'll be on my mind
Tell the world that we finally got it all right
And it feels just about right
But there's a wideeyed girl back there
I dreamed she'd come, I'd make my escape
We are not perfect we'll learn from our mistakes and as long as it takes I will
Pushing right out your seams
The sound of the collective crumbling around to the ground
I don't wanna wait at all
I love you forever and ever for always I love you
You'll be my American boy
Or float upon the air the way that you might
KKK kicken' down your front door
So I let you buy the house, the car, the ring
Though we go on our separate ways,
I could love you all the time
Boogie's got me in a super trance
I don't want to live in this world
I don't wanna work all night and day on writing songs that make the young girls cry
Every day's a winding road yeah
Eagle feather in her feathered hair hey
You can have the password to my phone
It's rock 'n' roll
Heartbreak I can live without
My evenings go beserk every time your voice gets near
Let the whole world know you're out there
Always had blue lips
Caught me listening to water dripping
See I know you like being round chicks
It's been a long time since
This gone on for way too long
I'm putting my heart out on the line
Be all right, be all right
Maybe for now I'll drive back to that place where I belong
Never could be mine, no matter how I try
But then cracks peel back and hell bends the room
I want you to stand up
They'll take advantage
Underage and overdressed
Don't you misfire fill me up
But I think I get a bit confused
With sweet love and devotion
I was sure I never would be sure we were in love
In your arms I'd stay
All right now
Fast revolving 'round our feet
But then you get back up
There's not enough hours in the day
Some twinkle for your eyes, I
This right here is the DO Proletariat
Nothing isn't nothing,
In a galaxy of stars with nothing in the middle
My plastic access cards
For ever having said goodbye
That you're gone and now I'm fallin'
We kissed in your car and we drank from your purse
And your body can't take it no more
And baby, baby, you're irresistible and I'm insatiable Ooohooohooohooohooo
But I really couldn't care about that
We unlock the mystery
Knowing that you do them too makes me really happy
Firmly looking outside me
Show me your love, your love
So come dance this silence down through the mornin'
And hurts me baby when you try
Time to get up, gotta get up
Everything I did was just a bore
A young boy
Now Alcatraz don't sound so bad
Even god he would agree
You and I in the airway
Staring at this yellowhaired girl
I wanna stop
She could be sweet sixteen, bustin' out at the seams
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Here I come, Omaha 
Oh, it's real love
I wasn't sure if I should go 
Reality ruined my life
Why did I bother
Ho's ride, get your nut till I can't get it up
White flowers on our backs
Clowne towne a single beauty
Success was survival and, kid, it still is
Take everything I own
Maybe it's just the way
You've got a pocket full of reasons why you're here tonight
Well, she sure is going to get it
So you better get a runnin'
In and out of my mind
To have a good time
Tell our friends go ahead
You know just when to jump off
I wanna give you everything, all of my heart and more
Hold me tight tonight, tonight
I'll cut loose and leave this madhouse,
I know that I, I know that I will be ready
I used to think it glad while at my country seat
I got a bad flavour
I told you damn this wild young heart
Well are you strange enough
I said build high, yeah, build high
And that's why you keep on runnin'
Yeah, my boyfriend's back
It's real love dripping from my heart
Yeah, yeah
I feel so wonderful, wonderful, wonderful the way I feel
And a candle burning bright
I can't tell them apart
And bandage them with cotton wool and glue
I want to stop stop so I could thank you baby
Told a funny joke, got the whole class laughing
He went away and you hung around
We were born in the desert, we were reared in a cave
And this girl, she was nothing like you
They shot an arrow at your head
You know I want your body Your body wants me too
You'll never find a love like this
Have you seen her, the grass is greener
Endless sky with the evening around you
I know she likes you
This is the song that reminds me of my trucker hat
I just can't seem to shake Emily, Emily
Come on this is screaming "photo op"
Would only turn out a negative
Fall down the stairs
All those things that go to make heaven and this
Cuando menos piensas sale el sol
If you really want to understand it,
You say in evidence, they won't take you alive
I don't wanna be a part of all the quality that falls apart these days
'Cause I don't want to keep acting this way
With mouths open wide to devour
But I love you,
No one ever let her know that she could get it out her heart, now
There ain't nothing we can't do
But I don't wanna wait for waves
Wanna stop
Now that you're away I'm out there without you
The very first words of a lifelong love letter
This world ain't got too much time
Why does my mind blow to bits every time they play that song
Freedom, son, is a dirty shirt
It's so funny
Sickness lover
Bien vite reprend pied
How happy that would make me
Near the village, the quiet village
Don't set aside,
Don't lie to her, no bones, no form
So decide, it's a suicide waiting, all this time
It's the end of a broken heart x
I don't know anything
I've been working on getting you off, so get on board, now
Party people
Yeah baby we were savage, we existed to kill
It's what I asked for, it's what I needed
Like the one I found inside
Everybody one more time yeah
End of story, I fade to black inside I never said I was the best thing for you
Market crash, out of cash, we're in the poor house
Well hot sick fat lip
Lost in the beat of my heart
If ever you need me
And I know I can be self righteous
And any moment could be magical
Vibrations in the brain can't ever be explained
Maybe things get bad before they get worse
But now I'm caught up in a dream, don't wanna leave
And I still believe
'Cause I'm drowning when I close my eyes
So they say
I don't care, all I want is your lovin'
If you're afraid, you know your walls will keep them away 
Off the wall, I wanna say,
You told me that I should never call your house again
You turn me over and over
Lyin' here, and I've slain my hero, yeah, yeah
And I even like the birthday presents you get me
'Cause the night and the sky is so high
That the ship will still sail on
It's like tonight I'm really not me at all
Lose your friends
Oh rejoice, your nails all got chewed off
I don't care what it does to me
Maybe you should just change yourself
Chrissy put on some lipstick
Caroline fresh new cologne on feelin' so good changed the color to my phone orange koolaid go good with patron a naw hell naw boy steal my ring tones free car wash had to clean up the dodge gice back when I can just playin' my part church folk had a fish fry mustard, hot sauce, light bread, and French fries love for the big guy hit the park boys showin' off their hops Nappy Roots on the radio and you know it bops last nighr I hit the pick tree bought some Air Force ones  tall tees man I love the Begees
Soul DJs and you know the riot that that brings
And I watch you fly around the world
I met a blue dog
Sometimes the rain goes and a rainbow's all that's left
Maybe a song unsung is dancing on the tip of your tongue
And I'm sure I don't understand
"Makes you look like a lumberjack
Once I know who I'm not then I'll know who I am
But you've got to make your own kind of music
Oohooh
Gotta let it out, let it out
It's moving without me
Once the black has veiled this sky
That I didn't know,
Hand on your balls
Girl, you won't wait for me in some secluded stand of trees
You got my time on the dotted line but you show up invited
I got a pet hedgehog
Never to be left again with that feeling
That I can live without, oh oh oh
And take the cash back
I can sleep in your dreams 
Only you, know me well 
Everybody look to the right
My my, pie in the sky
Bumping into backpackers and
And when we were finished making out we noticed that your skinhead friend was gone Long gone
I wanted to be with you
There was you, there was me
The stage is set, is there glamour, I'm in this rockscene
Lazy ooh lazy
Afternoon delight
Before I know it I'm going down this little bitty river
I've changed my life completely
She painted pictures
I remember when I found out about chemistry,
You are so needed by everyone to do everything 
Like the Jackson 
So we ain't gon' stumble and fall, never
We'll sneak to some place
Yeah, let's just get married
Where the stars gravitate toward you
Ooh, you gotta go your own way
Oh, didn't I, didn't I, didn't I see you crying
Fading fast from taking this to far
There's something taking over
Then your dad came out and chased me down the street
How sad it was that we could not believe
Tryin' to live without your love
Like the girls told me
We banged on blue drums and call it blue grass
Everything has taken a turn
Such a waste, But it feels great
Used to sing along, when you played guitar
And there's something on the tip of my tongue
You'll reveal all your pains again
And they plug them all into the back porch
You go straight to the top you're not scared of getting squashed
But I cannot take flight
I think I know I can
They're swallowing the brains of all in sight,
Looking for clues
You should talk to Mr Understanding
He told me you beat her up
I let her slip away
And walked out onto a piece of paper
Yes, our love our love
Oh, they're such pretty things
Fall before I get out of it
In only a moment you'll say goodbye
So someone else can treat you wrong
But there are people you meet
That dirty rhythm fools me
Baby I don't know
And your never gonna get that girl
Up and down through what you thought would be your future
And I'm sorry that you lost that girl
Oh, I know that tomorrow I'll feel bad
I've been down here
I feel like a Speak and Spell way I got you learning my lines
See, here's the thing
And I'll only make you cry with these feelings
And we both think the weather's getting better
So what if Wednesday finds us
Hurt me baby if you like
And all the celebrities want permission, but she won't give it to them, till they learn how to love And Kim's got her watermelon gun, 'cause it's the consciousness of love
And I will love you,
I've been trapped by love
Shiver at the sight of you
In the lonely hour
I want to know 
I hope he never has to deal with wronging someone
Did you expect to kiss me one time
We do this for the love so we fight and sacrifice every night
And if we keep up this pace pretty soon we'll know the name of every kid and every grown up booking house shows in their town
Let me fill your cup
'Cause we're hanging back
How we ever started out with our sights so high
Come on come on back that's my dog
And nobody will love them, and nobody will love them
So stay awake, stay awake
Things are getting out of hand, you make an embarrassing retreat
Yet you see some hope in me
"We all said hallelujah"
Just know I'll play this song
You said things that weren't very nice
But when the sun goes down you can't realize
Telepharmevangelism
Under the burden of your heart of stone
That's why I'm here today
You see me dancin' but I never ever like to talk
Oh my god, this is who I've been
Oh Never find a love like this
Then nothing now is true
My foot to the floor I will drive to the place
You're my superstar Ooh la la, ooh ooh ooh la la
See what this place is all about
But where did I find the source
This world, it lost control and then saw God
I needed the shelter of someone's arms, there you were
So for awhile we conducted experiments,
There is one thing left to hold on to
I've been your best kept secret
That coulda took me right back home to you
I fell asleep
Just stop for a minute and smile
And catch a bus outside the reef
They talk to me
Work myself frantic to the moon and back
That's my new best friend
And everyone was coming towards the center of the city
All the hearts I'm gonna' love in the morning
Surrounded by your enemies
Isn't what it was before
Yeah, you're the shit but you won't be here for long
The palaver of Solipsists exploding in my skull
No pushing buttons, no telling lies
I know it's stout but it's shallow
I followed my heart everywhere
Oh, I'm ready to run
Because this world you know it can get so crazy
If it's jug band music or rhythm and blues
Well, you know I never want to miss,
So we gon' keep everyone moving their feet
About a blue star
Gotta head back to reality but reality is greater
Something real
You make me happy, whether you know it or not
The next thing I know you're speaking
We're not in trouble anymore anyway
New girl
I had been broke down from my enemies
The lonely light from the town hall clock tower
But I just can't get your love
That's my dog
All of these dreams I don't recognize
And you will tear off your clothes and kiss the floor
That I can feel I can feel
And I found that 'round here
And everyone move with ease around and then,
Not talking about holiday
Looking down, seeing your yellow fingers,
I used to have the shakes
I'm yearning to turn you on
Junior high love affair is okay
Well, I had been broke down from my enemies
My daddy said 'Pretty woman, Mama married into the mob'
We don't have to get colder
We declared a national holiday
Sinking in the past
He was a bore, a true chore and I still wonder why I ever wanted
I loved you from the very first day
All these words that we speak casually
Our eyes meet all the time
I wonder if he knows that I touched your skin
Oh no I only meant to be a friend to everyone this time
"No luxuries No no Amenities Too dull Your senses Oh oh Only primitive Hey hey Really get away Island of Lost Souls"
If you're so sure about this Laurel Kismet Hardy thing
I'm going where there ain't no need
You're gonna throw'em, aren't you
We just wanna make the world dance dance, dance, dance
The eyes neglect to see what the heart pursues
Lonely streets and dusty roads
And though I know who I'm not I still don't know who I am
I really didn't stay too long there 
It's engraved into this song
Like you ain't feeling my charm, because I know you are
Just why I love you so
Or if I'm just missin' the sun
And the rest was history
When the lanterns fill with finches
And I know you'd like it better
With your new change of company
I'm a doctor today
Rockin' back 'n' forth in my little old chair
'Cause I loved you from the very first day
Say goodbye
After driving you home once
That's coming out on top
I am sure I never would be sure of love to come
And even at my door, with a poor poor four
You're so ooh, so ah, so cool
And all of your friends don't know who I am
We know we might regret it but it seemed ok
She said I passed myself by day
It makes you wanna move those dancing feet
It's coming back to me
Still breathing the fresh mountain air
Some cops came by so we hid behind a tree
I am yearning for another taste
The evening tails that will fit my corpse
Always the true one, calm, selective, 
Riot on the streets, the touch beneath the sheets
What the world ahead would store
And then you run to the right it seems there's no hope in sight
And I hope you don't save some other girl
You will have long flowers in your hair
But it's always too late when you got nothing
Oh, Annie, let's not wait
You're needing someone older
The loneliest kind of lonely
Make 'em opposites, so there's a reason
Why are we so loud when we say it won't happen to us 
I pick up stones 'cause I might need them
But I'm leaving in the morning for a year long tour
Would he say he's in LOVE
At least we know we're lazy, at least we know how to play, we're so great
Life is wonderful
What do you know about the song and the dance in your mind
It's nights like these when you know that your alive
And all the people who really understand
Down these roads
"I'm gonna give you  chances then I'm gonna turn you into a goon"
There's something in your eyes
All the voices in your head that you hear
And when that old moon gets so big and bright
Had a bad tendency to explode
We've waited so damn long, we're sick and tired
I'm quite the certified sweet talker
Close those doors
From a distance, the ocean meets the stream
And the sun comes one more day
Tell the promoter we need more seats
I got the, oh
Oh, show me your love, your love
Then I know that you're somewhere thinking of me
If fingertips are relationships
Y vos, solamente contame la verdad
I should put on my armor the next time I see you
Spell it to me love
I don't care how
The power of two hearts
When no one's home and the weather's fine
Everybody has to demonstrate
I've got machine guns,
The weeds are green, the sky is shining
Here is my unopened letter to a world
You let me get in dans ton lit
So I've taken out this time to say
I want you know
Please say it isn't so 
Another girl on the scene
To find the human inside
It's the way you smile, baby
Let's forget this five year bender
I grabbed my ex in the kitchen 
Your skin got slicker
All that's known is what's debatable again
I brought my baby home, she
Inescapable fate, yeah, it's out of my hands
I see her in my dreams at night, I see her when I close my eyes
Baby, come on, take a ride in my little blue bug
Or the way you find it
And anything I said or do
You and her in the local newspaper
With a love so sweet in so many ways
Who the hottest in the world right now
Found peace of mind in playing on your fears
Go save the world, I'll be around, forever and ever
I said, "Yeah right"
I should've known this wasn't real
Can't move on
My little bird flew away from me
I'm going where the living is easy
Now you aren't so in step
Till you came and saved my life
Now you're dancing on my grave
From the fine, fine women with nothing but good intentions
We'll take it to the cabin and we'll show ya what we got
Always try and keep
I can't do it by myself, need you now
And my jaw was dropping
But now it's time to get some better days better days
It's like this man, you can't put a price on a life
My new found faith
Even though I know
I want you now, I don't care how
Heartbreaker
Wearing your matching shorts
To believe, to believe, yeah
Where midnight was, were splashed across the canvas
Well then you just figured out today
I've seen the lightning leave me
From our dreams
That I was coming round, coming round
Me parecieron anos
I wish you were here, 'cause I feel alone
From feeling down; things look grim
Grown sleepy now as the rain falls 
Mit Geld, als ob es Brot ware Yeah
When I noticed you yeah, you, yeah
Yes, those mystery hours
'If you want I can take you on another kind of ride'
I always love the feel of sweat on my shirt
The power of bein'
Yawn and smile say
Splash Autumn on gardens
I'll say just fine
Chrissy kiss the corpse
Don't sell the dreams you should be keeping
They explode us with their looks
And do I always think I'm right
That I really wanted to be someone
Do you wanna get away Get in the car we can leave today
that nobody has loved you,
Loving in the sun
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
For the love of a sweetlovin' man
The first day with the jar you find
I don't wanna stop
You were dodging all the time, are you still dizzy
Look at me with starry eyes
Each and every one of us still pray
But you gotta stay strong, don't let your knees buckle
So concerned with friends and your popularity
A friend of miiine
Time to be free amongst yourselves
You've been looking at me for days
This point you've been trying to make
I rolled the dice, and lost them all
Look at whatcha showed me,
Hey little rich girl
Though you're not mine
Like, "I don't care about the songs you sing"
Then you heard that there's always someone
You call me up in the mornings
With a blackhaired flamenco dancer
Satin tights, boots so white the girl got hot
How's that working out How's the music, how's the food
Know that you are here
Whenever wherever forever together whenever
And I've watched them come and go
I get a feeling, you get a feeling, we got a feeling
I am a lady in Spain
Is all the love I'm giving
If I never need again I'll find that sleep again,
'Cause man, I know we never get things right
To the gods in the sky
I fell in love with people sleeping
But still I fall asleep in the arms of my past
I, I only looked in her eyes
For a safety dance, ohoho
What made you think he'd believe all your lies
Joint lit y'all get what the point is
Honey pie, you know I'll love you forever
Your worn out dresses brought stares from everyone
Calm has come to take me out on a date
I'd fly you a flag, I'd bury this pen into my veins
But when the rocket ships all fall
Ooh ooh ooh, oh oh Save me, San Francisco
Work out in the end
I called you and screamed
You're like Caesar stepping on to the throne
Don't ya know baby
I know that there were better days, but to see the light and to feel the rays
You stopped me where I stood
We hold them in our hearts
Everything is beautiful here 
Cause from above it all, you can't help but say
I'm maxed out like a credit card
That's not to say
I never tell my decisions to the ones I adore
So I could beg you baby please don't go
On houses and building tops
Ladayla, my boyfriend's back
Yeah, I just wanna compliment your soul
A place we'll talk about now and the past what the future holds
Then you said Stop it Ca suffit 
And when my curves came into play
I can be anything that I see
Finally got it figured out
We all kinda fumbled through the Jitterbug
Sell it to me, love
Keep saying that it doesn't mean much
This kind of love don't come easy
Why don't I fall in love with you
So Timmy goes to school and Timmy goes to work all day
Might make someone think that I'm still around
I feel like Superman
He drives to school every morning
I sense evil at the heart of each far flung welllighted home
And you were left feeling so alone
Thought I could make up your mind you had a decision locked up so tight 
When you've been treated like a queen
I've tried to show you, my door is open
You take your seat and hold on tight
And we talk about life and we talk about death 
You're a big man now but he'll cut you down to size
The surface is gone, we scratched it off 
'It's the rhythm you forgot'
Mr Jones wishes he was someone just a little more funky
Oh, girl
It just goes to show that
Picture of me when I was just three
And so blindly sure that he'd always have the satisfying hug I needed
That tears me inside out whenever you're around
Musty rooms house racks of fur jackets
I know that I'm neurotic
Then my life can finally begin
I will become yours and you will become mine
So for a while I conducted experiments,
Head west, red Lex, TV's all up in the headrest
Mayla, sunshine
Because he knows I've been true now
What'cha know about living
The moment a million chances may all collide
When I had nobody to call my own,
But we'll climb back to the top,
Because mimes are dears
We're so middle class
And all the parents
But they're all disappointments
But your never home
And if you say everything will want to go your way
And jump on the back, if you can handle the candle
Grab that beat, by the balls,
Unbending, neverending tablets of time
Yaeah, baby you the bomb
And I don't wanna see it end
But its mine to decide when I'll be all right
'Cause the 'screenstar' was you
Put your helmets on and take a seat on the short bus
Oh, they are waiting
And sing for the wings of a dove
Since I was fifteen
I hang on every word you say, yeah
When the going gets tough then get to going
I was been told, you will never grow old, if you live your too fast
Cause you came and saved my life
I'm "hot like wasabi when" I'm next to your body
And I can't hear one single word they said
And then I sung
Well no more, well no more blue days and lonely years
And it can come as no surprise to me, with another guy
"Little bunny foo foo I don't wanna see you scooping up the field mice and bopping them on the head"
And the way you look when you say good night
Total subsonic vacation
I'll take a mile if you let me
It matters to me, took a long time to get here
You found comfort with my distance
I am wasted but I'm ready
I said "It used to be my grandgrandfather's
Every moment on her feet is torture
So many rights, so many nights
I'll show you some rhythm'
'Cause your never gonna get that girl
You see, it feels like I'm starting to care
Come fill up your souls with our blessings
Thanks for asking now I'm fine
Asleep in a golden ocean
They do the unpredictable
You're my hero in a mythical dream
Once in a blue moon
So keep going till you know when it's time, when it's right
So in the desert of the bed I looked hard for an oasis
Because you're true blue
We got the money so we'll put you down
I would say sorry, what's the use
Says the magpie to the morning
We got tickets they were free
And leave a voicemail message
I'm so good for you
The night alone I've been waiting 
Never find a love like this
'Cause I know you're willing
And let me look at love and I feel better
Our time is ever on the road,
Do you wanna celebrate our just made little holiday
Oh if you were mine
Won't you stay with me
Yeah, I feel that good
Before the sun rises today
And this week the trend
As long as we gon' rock forever
Whoa whoa for the wings of a dove x
Music tastes change like the wind
From higher points than sunrise
But it's harder just to be who you are
Some girl you turned out to be
And I look across the water
In this cold, World so cold
On the little back porch it's about to fall apart so I think I might repair it
Lately we're running out of time, aren't we
The sprite ones on the corner, dream of something warmer
Would this song live on forever
Don't let this fading summer pass you by,
How long it's been there, two years, I bet
We're gonna have a good day and all my homies gonna ride today and all these mommies look fly today and the only one we wanna do is get by today hey, and ain't nobody gotta cry today cause ain't nobody gonna die to you save that trouble for another day hey we're gonna have a good day, We're gonna have a good day and all my homies gonna ride today and all these mommies look fly today and the only one we wanna do is get by today hey we're gonna have a good day
Was it the mending of the gown, or the running and the running and the running and the running it around
And I won't let go if you wait for me
That I love you so
I remember seeing someone dressed in a suit, looking like a lunatic
Match a name to the face, do you suspect
People move a new direction
I'm all right y'all, I'm all
Our present was empty, our history a mess
You hold me down and up
You're the cutest thing
Shoot that sky 'til the moon explode
I certainly hope that you are happy
My debut comes today and my feelings have all run away
We fit together like if we was two Lego's
Where the fog wraps itself around you
What surely said, "We wrote a book"
I've always been in love with
Live my life in dignity
The Spanish guitar someone strums
When I am so used to driving with you
The telephone number I got from you says nobody's home 
I did what I had to
But hell seems like fun to me
For though you cannot fly
Won't you come on over
A room at the top
And you wait your turn to fall
And it runs in the family
Let's get lucky, come on, go all the way
Man they was puttin' you down
I won't mention tomorrow
And my friends they all looked stunned yeayeah
Come to the club girl, I'll get you on the list
I wanna see your hand waving "Farewell"
I want to be there and then I'd understand
We took the highway to the One
It's from the television lies
My greet will cure your great soul
And no, I ain't been to MIA
Up and start a secret
I'll tell you about the magic, and it'll free your soul
Oh, I nearly started screaming
Ain't nobody's fault moonlight
  Bad, bad, bad, bad boy
If they told me you could not come true, just love's illusion
Try to make a brother fall in love
It's not like you ever cared
We crossed the borderline at dawn
Makes you want to kiss and not tell
We're always kickin' back nobody can take that
Who's dancing all around
I can walk and I can need
And rejoice despite the fact this world will tear you to shreds
Oh rejoice, your father's been calling
So let me feel your leg of hope around me
The lion sleeps tonight
As daydreams slide 
The ride is in what we make
That I don't feel the limitations and the
Their needs too deep
In an apartment by the River Road,
Temptation's callin' you, a secret reply
Tell me how many more times
If you're afraid to love
All dots and lines that speak and say
You gotta walk tall y'all, y'all, y'all
When we all come together, this song will play
Let's not forget we're alive
And she'll spend her life
You can stay with us till paradise
In the jungle, the quiet jungle
Having an argument with myself down Elizabeth Street
This is a world of dreams
If you've been looking for me
We're passin' out on the carpet
He smelled your boring apex
In the middle of the night
Well I've got the same phrase
Nobody's hoping for better days
They figure I wouldn't wild when I'm in my French clothes
Who doesn't have curtains on her windows
And taking advantage of amateurs
'Cause I don't want to get stuck in here
It's the oddest feeling since you're gone
Got the lips and got the skin
Every song was right
Oh, I want to be your firmament, 
Ohh, talking 'bout the magic
We dance in the movies
Let the bough break let it come down crashing
Could sparkle and shine
To the islands, the black kites, the wishing tree
But I hope someday he'll take me away
Still we could not conceive the call
Soul where did it go
We could sit for years
It scares me just to
I'll take care of you
But you were just a rich girl only having fun
Must've been your attitude
I didn't think much about it 
When the boy gets that look in his eye
I wonder if he knows how much that I miss him
After three, after four times
Kitty at my foot
Said you're making fun of me 'cause I'm young and got no money
The sun will never go down Yeah
In the sun in the rain
Places I ain't been before
Wearin' my heart between my legs
You always said the world would never last
I've got a weak heart
You've got to get the shit they sell
The eternal hell of boredom in heaven
It's like the more time we waste and less time I get to taste you
Always under the bed
That I chose to spend
So you want to go on with someone
I miss the typewriter in the basement
Picking pennies off the floor with my cold hands
We're just normal people exploring our minds
That I can live without
And I'll shed a tear between my legs
'Cause every moment life is slipping away away
I said "What's up with this weather"
I hope I got a little more time
So why is it hard to breathe
will someday lose its salty flavor, 
You always put me first, and somehow that broke my heart
So I step back to reflect in this town I hate
I don't understand language of people with short money
You know you never should've listened to my father's advice"
Where do all the lovers meet with one another,
Baby, I'm stuck in the middle, and I don't know why
Why you wanna be someone else
I feel like I owe you my life
Yeah, we got some guns, got some dogs
Watch his mouth its open wide
'You will be all the things in the world you've never been
You to get over this
I think you failed to mention'
Woahwoah, woahwoah the girl got hot
I've lost it, you've ripped my mind
Porque uno y uno no siempre son dos
And pretty soon the spirit was a lot like
I'm always looking for some kind of sadness,
Like a destiny thing written in the stars
As the lights go on with emptiness and how you seem to stand out
They tell me everyday
Forging for the future but to sacrifice their lives
Ah we didn't need no bullets
Hey what do you know I think you've done it to yourself again
Otherwise, we're just going backward
A diamond at the bottom of the drain
I'm not gonna sit here wasting mine on you, yeah, you
So hold me up, Oh
I find I always move too slowly
So much it feels nice
Like an old red woolen glove
What I will do with my life as I know it
"We don't want answers anyway"
Why wait until the middle of a cold, dark night
To feel the high, we got to learn to fly
To the road that we've been on now
Pick up the rock, son, and carry it on
I shoulda put my heart on the table
I know that you know it
I can't swallow, I just start to shake
You'll never be evil, you'll never be turned
That summer feeling
If you had a blue bag, I think I'd get well'
But for the time being, bump your head to the beat
When left to devices some humans try shit
Rubbin' sticks and stones together makes the sparks ignite
More than any other girl yeaa
Something more than this
And the people are kind, a new state of mind
'Everyone feels good in the room,' she swings
But I still talk that caaash
I can't stay, I can for the night, for the night 
The girls ask the guys
And walk around naked with our bullocks platinum plated
I was the only one left at the right time
I better start oiling the gate
I understand I wasn't part of the plan
And I still believe I still believe
Have your face to see
'Til I noticed you, yeah, I noticed you, yeah
And she snuck to my lips
and because of that, my heart is yours
And baby's gone, she
To see me something has been on my mind, something has struck me
You bend 'til you break
Your heavy breathing scaring the wind
Of your Saturdays
Everything's gonna be all right now, everything's gonna be all right
At least it was never until I noticed
But I like you 'cause you're
I wouldn't change you if I could
No siempre son dos
You seem so glad my place is free
When when when when whenever, rock scene repeat
They'll summon
You make it hard to breathe
And a baby on the way
I'll never let it push your arms no more
It's always a hit or miss
I was always thinking
Now he's back and things'll be fine
Stay indoors, sit out the storm
But over is not a word that you know
Are we not trying or are we trying to hard
Jump on the big wagon 'cause I'm so cal
Baby, bitte mach dir nie mehr Sorgen um Geld
I'm not done with my traveling
Night work gotta do the night work
The magic down there is so strong
Look through the tree
To be the best, we got to pass the test
I didn't catch much through the sobs 
Speak to my needs, my needs
I bet that we could light up the sky
I'm all right y'all, all right y'all I'm all right
Ain't love such a sweet thing
She was once mine
Your true brother has betrayed you over and over
He was a man of many nations, with revelations, oh revelations
Come over sea
I'd cruise where the grass is smooth
Why don't you come right out and say it
And I'm so happy
And though we did not believe in God
Think how you spend all your days They all say so
Had to write you this song
I shouldn't beat myself up
And I chill the way you met me
You know I love you baby
Now we can see, now the image sticks
I'm sittin' on the back porch kickin' my legs back rockin' in my rockin' chair, just sittin' there
Good times good times
That he would never be the satisfying shag I needed, no no no no
So a pig was the closest thing he could get
I need a little space in my mind
I need to feel my soul come alive
They say I'm doin' you wrong, doin' you wrong, doin' you wrong
Oh this miles that have
Like they have been once before
Stop at the cafe, coffee and a salt beef bagel
And it took shape in the form of an image in the form of a living memory
That the struggles gonna come in all shapes and size
Who doesn't want a machine so they can go back in time
And then the tears pour
Funky squaredance, funky squaredance, funky squaredance
And I hope his guardian angel puts a gun in his hand
My only tears fall with the rain
She was always such a pretty girl, nobody like her in the world
I don't know what I did
You open up and let them in
And though I've been warned to live day by day
Bring it, bring it, bring it, bring it, come back to me
Come on baby girl, let see me those legs
I had a blue dream
And then it'd leave for a while
The sculptor we hardly knew
Heads up, heads up, heads up
I'm on your side
You go walking through the terminal
We had them saved for special times
Wrap your world around me,
Where no one's home and the weather's fine
You and me trying hard to remember,
You're my super, superstar
I watch you from the distance
Their brains are like porcupines
Bring me all the good gossip
Now you're wondering how oh yeah, you're wondering how you ended up here
But it was just too late
Are you everything that I missed Don't hope so 
With the skaties on our back
Oh, oh, there's a lot of things I could say
Since outta high school I dropped
Though we live in the same city
Will I walk away from love knowing nothing
Like nothing for the choice
You said you were my girlfriend
No argument can amend
'Cause I don't want to keep acting this way
What you gonna do when I come for you uh oh
Old man on the back porch
When you came I woke from many sleeps
Except for number one, write "love," gamble everything 
No confiding nor bite it to my rose
I'll be right here on the ground
All the deer despair
Here comes the comeback
Reading between the lines, like writing on the wall
I got a little bit of hope,
Do you have the slightest idea No, I don't 
Sing your own special song
And they'll put up with all the poses you'll throw
Down the Langlands Road we set off the best of friends
Well now, oh oh baby
When the fire's burnin' from sky to ground
What I feel like doing, when I'm inspired to
They were the roadtrips that we launched
It had resigned itself to night
Dropping in a heaven fantasy
Possibly reconvene and play some naked peekaboo
Is one long, sleepless night
And lives are falling and
And it's obvious I'm heading wherever you're leading me too
Still the little boy had died
Lola, lola, will the world end me and you
Stay just a little bit more
I could beg you baby please don't go
For a soul, a soul
When all the stars collide, in this universe inside
Oh rejoice, his arms are burning witches
Reasons to dance in the moment
Tony Orlando has been postponed
I'm moving on, I'll look ahead instead
And I finger the remote control
I'm using my left brain
Singing that's my dog that's my dog
The gray skies fell, we felt the pressure drop
Got your voice in my head
Ooo That's alright
Another dose of unhappiness
Stormy nights reawake
I want you to know now
And did you have to pay the fine
And slept away the rest of them
What if I shout shout shout my name 
All the scores of the C to the A of the youth of today
Every fucker needs a home 
See me shining imma star take a picture see you later
Give a lot, a whole lot received
We'll find our way
You can see that I've been damaged
You'll have to sell your car
Who knew I'd cum so fast
It's all in the stones that you throw
I got on the blower
Wishing the car was from you
Only fools fall in love
Oh, 'cause there's always someone cooler than you
Don't say no 
In this city
And those be the same ones walkin' while I whip
Tshirt salesmen and the followers it brings
How sad I just got
She rocks my world
And your waist and your smile
Started out this morning feeling so polite
But now they're good at getting me played
Now its time for you to leave so baby please go
That anyone here will be thinking in modern ways
Pay for my tattoos or buy me diamond rings
"Close your eyes now, kid"
Did I look stupid
I always thought a fish could not be caught that didn't bite
They come running
Honestly I could easily replace you
And share your freak with the rest of us
And now I'm counting knowing I'm here with you
You make me feel, oh how you say, feel so special
Good evening shuttle bus
So, if we take a walk down, the beach tonight
If I died tomorrow would this song live on forever
But don't, don't, don't let's start
The sort which leads you up the streets of sin
'Cause we're on fire, we are on fire
But I sure know there is someone, around somewhere who's meant to be
Oh wayow ohwhoaoh, oh wayow ohwhoaoh, oh wayow ohwhoaoh
I found you seaside in the fog
That's right That's right
I didn't even want around
Here comes a comeback
I hold on tight and reminisce
Sometimes your soul might make a stumble
When you say it's no love affair 
And if you find another boy when I'm gonna be broke
Oh, how I love things as they used to be
If you wanna, you can gamble everything for love
I can see, hearts carved on a tree
And the sun burns one more day
You know tonight you're mine"
From time to time her eyes get wide
And are you shoppin' anywhere,
People are intricate, people aren't swines
The way bloodsuckers do, the way bloodsuckers do, the way bloodsuckers do
So I got drunk, had sex with all your friends
What we'll do it wait forever
Oh just look at you
Don't let the daytime get you down
I got dirty clothes
I can't get enough
Be still
Because there ain't much that I won't do
I will bring you home
I could learn from way back when and still live right now
Cause, I'm not what I was last September
He's not with me
Keep showing yourself in that light
And the forecast, I know,
Stop
And when your legs give out just lie right down
Did they all run off when they knew
Please keep a eye on those red haired boys
Everybody break it
If I win or lose what the fuck I gotta prove
Have a session while we're smoking
That there's no reason to doubt
Would you be my American boy, American boy
I'm feelin' so mischievous, original cheeky chappy
Bad thoughts away
That I get
I been up
While I'm still sitting here
I've got no time for school books 'cause I got no time to study
Rivers that still bring us life
Feel the weight letting go, feel more lightness than you've ever known
We dance at the festivals, 
If it works
We still need the medicine quick
Nobody will love you, nobody will love you
If you're still up when the ships
If you really love me 
The girl got hot
And it gets so old just saying we'll keep trying
Written about my friends
To the fullest you spin the bottle and I'll dim the lights
Tell me, are you letting go, do you know 
Something on the thermals yanked his chain
Honey lookin' perfect
It's ok, hey come on, no time for education so let's go
Than you could ever imagine you say that you pull up
And the sisters take pictures of brothers
At the debutante ball
That you know that your fine as hell
How sweet it is to be loved by you
'Cause, Since I've come on home,
Not everybody made the list this year
Our love's always growing
Don't blame it on the sunshine
No matter what you might do
Honey yeah, a sure thing
And I've been tryin' to never mind it man
And are we all part of the latest craze or is this how we mend our ways
Next to mine
Fall in love and kiss and smile from every girl walking by
And I can't wait for you to hear me shout it, all about my new girl
Let me talk about this feeling
Let's cross the river now
But when I got up in the place there were smiles all up and down 
Brama, am I shallow cause all my clothes designer
From the end of the sofa
Lookin' at my scars
It's not like we'll never know love
Does it take to get smarter
Oh yeah it's almost our time, the feeling's coming up
From the Sky Bar to the Standard, nothing took
I simply, Lucifer, refuse to wind up on fire with lowlife liars
'Cause it makes you feel good
And who said life was easy and who said a man was fair
Deep inside the 'but' is 'please'
On the sand
If you don't wake up and the truth never comes up 
In the untouchable
And I felt my head exploding
Sound advice, sound advice
Come on, everybody, to the Nth Degree
La la la ooh, it's so amazing
"Come on, let's stay here for a while"
Someday they'll play drum with my shinbones
Deliriously, mysteriously I'm feelin' curiously marvelously
Missing you is all I'm thinking about, yeah
I was Jonathan to your David
And my friends said
Clowne towne no exit
What's you're persona about this Americana
Now a spectacular night ahead
Everybody's gotta get their kicks somewhere
I wonder how they sleep at night
Damn it, I'm in love with this planet, you gotta realize
Can we get away this weekend, take me to Broadway
Everybody needs this
Look at it from another way
My contracts are finally void
Can we all slow down and enjoy right now
Fashion magazines line the walls now
Stuck in the underground
I told her I was looking for somebody to appreciate,
Somebody tell me, tell me, tell me, when will I learn
Where the song repeats itself inside you
We're gonna have a good day and all my homies gonna ride today and all these mommies look fly today and the only one we wanna do is get by today hey, we're gonna have a good day and ain't nobody gotta cry today cause ain't nobody gonna die to you save that trouble for another day hey we're gonna have a good day
We proudly welcome Tony Orlando
I'll never let you touch the ground
Light up the sky with your prayers of gladness and rejoice for the darkness is gone
Y, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ah, still I burn this earthen fire
Well, I'm gonna paint my picture
I'ma talk a hip hop and how bad its got
If you stay too long
That I wasted on you by the crowd
Leave it while it still smolders,
Stand tall, that's right, be proud'a yourself,
Sometimes I feel so isolated
Do you want to dance
I like the way he's speaking, his confidence is peaking
Sound oh so sweet
You can't see when light's so strong, you can't see when light is gone
Like a spider hit it's you deep inside and
I'll never find my way back home,
So the doc came with his black bag
Well if it was me then I would
Just because we could
They keep calling
Sometimes it hurts
Lately I found myself thinking
Guarantee we'll be feelin' all right
Do you still pick up the seashells on that pebble beach
Let me hear you say,
Leopard handbag out of sight the girl got hot
And she's got simple feelings
Konnen wir tun was wir wollen
They keep things loose, they keep things light
But all I could find was a dead camel in pieces
But there's one thing that you missed
Your search for the meanin'
And my poor dog needs feeding
I need that little hope I can find
It's funny when you find the words to say
Its such a shallow scene
Then maybe I could use a break
Would he touch you
They don't hold no weight with me
And I said fine
It seems like yesterday we had the world our way
I'm all right y'all, I'm all right y'all
Just take one moment of our time, mmmmmaybe
Why am I dealing with this feeling
I know they don't understand they don't get us at all
I need to feel happy Every, everyday
They make the music that we play
I don't know how, I want you now
'Cause I'm a rainbow with you
I was buried alive
Sometimes it's hard to dream
But she'll play it and make it sincere
The band was doing their thing
Lighting up drugs always fightin' in the club
And that's important because I need to travel
Are you still rocking Converse with your old Ray Bans
My heart is racing
Then tryin' pull a brother, I'm not lookin' for nobody to judge
Be waiting for me, baby, when I come around
There ain't no man can replace
You'll never get her, etc
Near the village, the peaceful village
I'm licking your postage stamp again
Something in me was not the same
Though I never pray God reigns today
I sleep all day but I break my back in the moonlight
Spellbound rhythm gets me on my feet
I'll be right there 
Thinkin' of you's workin' up a' appetite
The only way to let this go
'Cause it's not my place to choose
I would steal for you
You had three ugly brothers
Ooh la la, ooh la la, ooh la la
I'd tell a tale sure to make you smile
You know I'm not a weirdo
I just want to stop stop to thank you baby
Oh wayow ohwhoaoh, oh wayow ohwhoaoh, oh wayow ohwhoaoh Yeah
I'm liking this American boy, American boy
But in practice believe me, there was a nasty fire burning
This is the life I'm gonna live to the end
But there's no need for you now
Here comes Superman, from neverneverland
Singing myself to sleep
All right
When the crew would call a shakedown
But I awake and I see the streets are ice cream 
Island of lost so oh oh oh oh Far away from Babylon Oh oh oh oh oh On the boulevard
Don't slip away yo
Saying, "I am the water at the foot of the palms or I am sand and wind and a shitty mirage
I conducted the warmth from my metronome sternum
You walked by in those tight ass jeans,
Ciao adios, I'm done you get on with your life, I'll get on with my life
I know you wanna leave so come on
Und meine Mietwagen
When I see land, land, land
But together is much better
My mouth on your neck
I'd want it to be number one
I'm gonna be the man, sir, connecting people everywhere
The party wasn't all that great 
It's a suicide, waiting, others say
I got that ow ow
We are what we're supposed to be
Seems that I'm still waiting for the sun
Pra mamae, mamae titia
While I walk alone in the rain
But I've only been laughin' ever since I fell
But you got nothing to fear
Said catch your reel and then catch mine
I got on a boat on a hot sunny day
Leave me the way it has to be 
All of daddy's money and she fancies herself
Ja sei onde ficar
Hit the big big big bang
The kid is back he's back on track
I regret every single thing I ever said, I said those things too softly
Hear ye, hear ye, friends and Romans, countrymen
How I found a love so pure
And if I couldn't have you, I don't know
I'll be making music out of joy stick thumbs up
My boyfriend's back and you're gonna be in trouble
When I was a young boy I pretended I had a job
I feel like moving back
I knew that you'd miss me
You can see my broken heart
Cause after all the blouse you're wearing is kinda see through
And all you want is something you can move to
Whether wholly heartened life fades away
And I hold you to the light to see
Look at me no hands, ain't it cool yeah
You call my name, ooh, so sweet
Moonlight
Is the last hope the world has Yeah  Yeah
Begin the windstorm
I'm all right
He just stares back unblinking
She sat around forlorn
The moment to get closer, the moment's almost here
We took a trip down in '
When you're happy to be
You're not alone in this love
One star player doesn't save the team
I've got some sugar for your bowl
This old world, well, it was mine to take
And I don't wanna let it go
Get funky like Bond
We together like, oh
And the sun is shining
Yeah, you're the shit but you won't be it for long
Caught in this old room,
And bandage them
If you think of all the things that you feel
Reasons to live in the moment
When you say I love you, I say rave on
Comets swarm like fireflies outside your window
A don't stop stop your dreamin'
And I'm up, down, I'm spinning around
I wanna wrap you around the world
Whether wondrous will stands tall at my side
Your hair, your Spanish ass
Everybody here is outta sight
My future to the new horizon
There's an open road
I crawled out the harbour with recession behind
I never had a sister
You got to demonstrate
I thought out loud, but no one heard me saying
in the kisses that you give me 
I'm the same, I've just been rearranged
I want everybody to stand up and be counted tonight
Y un dia despues de la tormenta
Through the week and can't get away
My computer mechanism wants you mentally
I wish your silhouette would always stay there
But pretty soon it will happen, the sun will go murder the snow
The thing I finally found with these other girls in town
No cares, come what may
Lake Michigan had been frozen for decades
So hold me up
The world is born
I'm far away, but I never let you go
Look, two lovers covered in covers, uh huh
Let us grow the balls to break the walls
Are never what we had in mind
When I come home, home, home
I never felt too good,
Am I the only one, who see's what you've become
In the shadows, I will listen to their every movement
Drops a marble from the sky
You'll be fine
Raindrops splash rainbows
Looking
I said hello hello, Eugene
I'm gonna ride the biggest ride, it'll be out of sight
I don't have no pretty friends, can't pretend
Does any of this ring a bell Eugene
For the life of Riley
And don't bother me when I'm watching 'Planet of the Apes' on TV
You don't sound ready better scream it just to let 'em know
Said that those who rush will fall
Smile at the empty sky and wait for
A red light
Just my name in gold leaf on the front
I need to feel the strength to get by
There used to be a lot of things,
We like loving, yeah, and the wine we share
When his desire was stuck in plaster
Say, little bit by little bit, someday
You've dreamed of thousand dreams, none seem to stick in your mind
Oh yeah, there's always someone cooler than you
The empty rooms feel cold 
And how could I forget
Still waiting for
Wearing rabies parachutes
That her mind's completely wrecked
In a small ghost town, there's a little arcade
You talk about trust, I talk about lust
You've been away for so long oh
It's like the wise man said,
Got fifteen hundred bass drum luggin', bugeyed monkeys
Me and you we strollin',
Oh looking, oh looking, oh
But I am your man
Ran into a friend just the other night
For the language we use
It's an act, I think she's just pretending, it's an act, I think, she's just pretending
And I realize I'm away
So I packed up and I left town
'Cause every moment life is slipping away
Until right around amazing o'clock when I showed up
You're doin' now what's already been
If you say everything will want to go your way
I stepped to the floor with her best friend Jill
Your grinning face scaring a poor parakeet
That move their lips whenever you're around
It's ok, come on, I won't do the things they learned me
And kickin back feelin' real good, real fine, real full of the wine
And the way your shaking it at the club,
And baby when we get older,
Some have turned to dust inside
Now, I know you're working hard
No matter where you go, you'll never find your way home
You just got to moonlight
It's the slacker lifestyle
I hadn't tried a lot of looking for anything at all
Became the dark reminder of
Success which was survival gone too far
Although this world is a crazy ride
Scratched on the back of both my eyelids
East, West, every state, come on, bury the hate
At times like these I'm at my lowest ebb
I've done our charts and it says
and no matter what they say 
Letters intertwined, for all time, yours and mine, that was fine
I was down at the New Amsterdam
Still I couldn't get arrested,
And when I can't take the fall I really wanna make that call
The weather is sweet yeah, woah
But it's like trying to tell a stranger 'bouta rock and roll
Moonlight on the beach, sweet amphetamines
But we enjoy what we like which is not always right
Everybody was dancin' in the moonlight
A last ride in the city's hearse
I feel so good for me
Life got a little serious
Everybody look to the left, to the left
And they sit around playing all their favorite songs
Wondering where it all went wrong
I need a little faith
Flock of pages torn out
And never was it your eye be
In loving your true self and your true love
Hold me baby all through the night
We are the Cartoon Heroes  ohohoh
You're Abe Lincoln 'cause you fight for what's right
And I will ride you home drunken in the rain
First the feeling's all right
Baby you should know that I would, I would, I would
The first thing I did when I got up the nerve
Find sweet simplicity
That you don't see the hands upheld to catch you
Broke every rule from the start
You, yeah, you yeah
But once again something's happened
Same crimes even though the names changed
He had a weird twitch
First it was that and now it's this
It's so strong that nothing can ever break it
Let a man work, is that so wrong
You are reaching something that is beating
Of the man in the moon
My life had barely started since you jumped all on my heart
Because Mother
I took off down the next hall, running
And bride white
My stairway to the sky, yeah
We were looking for a place where we don't need heaven
Was say, "Hey baby, what's up" What up
Imposing, unclosing thoughts that compose
I can't stand all these rules,
That we could lay here for hours, and justa reminisce
Wahooh, wait and see
And you my lover
To the place that I can always call my own
I will know and when we go 
Is a place that I respect
And tonight I'm in love with everybody on the city bus
Money, money
Talking 'bout home
Everybody look to the right, to the right
I still believe that
Out in the streets, I hear the crack of thunder 
and in everything you say
Some things just might be changed 
And I just feel so good; you know I'm seventy years old
I know an Ital Rasta man
Cause' we were singing along to Peter Gabriel's "Sledgehammer" song
Do you believe in magic
Never feel happy
Now we can see, what do we need
Tryin' to wind me 'round and around
That make us happy
When you grow silent I start to fall
Just like that ACDC song,
And I'd tell ya babe if I could
So  O'clock sees me heading out towards the tabernackle
'Cause I was absolutely sure
I know that's hard to believe
And your Sundays
Sayin' "let's just be friends"
And I won't keep it up even though I would love to
You will feel better
It may be a waste
But you said, "I don't know"
And I think I've seen the light, Yeah I, I'm gonna be here a long time
I heard your lyrics, I feel your spirit
And wondering what dreams
"And I don't want to get obvious
You hold me glad
Turn rock to rubble, punch me in the chin
My heart melts like ice cream cones
The light is green our break is through
Keep close the cold compress, such a poor substitute
Sunshine yeah
I always used to leave before I went to sleep
So many ways to walk upon the earth
I'm so happy 'cause you're so happy
And everyone's a little nothing,
When the news it had been telling me
And back doors to the heart from where we always, always fall apart
And while the city sleeps
I know I can't come near you 
She was easy on the eyes so I had nothing to say
Though I didn't know it at the time
I will let you down I will let you down
She had a name, she had a spirit, she had a line in the play if you waited to hear it
And now I'll take a step back and look in your eye
White hot glistening shadowy flows Feel flows
And if I win or lose, nevermind
And you know I'm not getting by
Heartbreaker
In over my heart
And just when I could run this race no more
Laid bare
Where I felt the stars explode
Swinging in your backyard,
Hey here comes a comeback
Corn rows have companion feel
Take my fate in your hands 
Hmm, that sounds absurd to me
When you are alone
I don't believe that the sea, 
We'll sneak to some place and
Baby, if you can't change the world
Forget about the price tag Forget about the price tag
Both of them side by side so determined
It's a suicide, waiting
And the thought of loving you is getting so exciting
That's the way it looks and I'm really glad you think so
Everyone is golden, everyone is golden
I know everything went wrong OK OK
Make a list of things you need, leave it empty
On the outside looking in like an aquarium
Gambling man rolls the dice, working man pays the bills
When music made us all unite
Nothing's wrong with you and me
From a shooting star
I don't know what I don't know with nothin' more to gain
From where you laid me out flat one look I was done
Weekday  to  shift is over
And girl you turn me on
Look at me, what do ya do I don't know
I told my friends not to worry, my wife would know how to fix it
And it's hopeless, hoping to be found
Believe in the magic ofa rock and roll
And you will slide on the back of my bike
Sometimes the sun shines on us
Don't get up 
I just show up like a Biblebreather outside the door
And I am getting out
But we keep inside and our looks stay at bay
Hanging out with not much to do
Heaven knows what I'm gonna do
Tryin' to make a brother fall in love
We are the color symphony
Because I can hear the memories in my ears
I wanted someone to love completely
Said it's days like these kicking back
Crazy for running all the time, mmmmmaybe
I've been so frustrated
But the clothes that we wear
And I can hear the taxi calling, telling me we haven't left yet
Well, if you really love me
Yeah baby we were nothin', we existed for less
Now we're feeling extra high
Hear ye, hear ye, my sisters and my brethren
Something so small
And now you're half awake
To tell you the truth
Don't let my heart turn sore
I noticed you yeah, you, yeah
Oh, they're such pretty things 
You're going with me
We're both too young to be sitting around
Everybody gonna to say you, K
White hot glistening shadowy flows
Staring at our fears
And rearranged the size and forms to look like something understood
Haven't seen that boy in over seven years
I'll memorize everything you do to me so I can,
By now you took what was to take
Be original, and remember that
You had your photograph, in a magazine
That I love you,
I'll get myself a new one when I get you on the piss
How sweet it is
Ooh ooh ooh la la
I felt so symbolic yesterday, if I knew Picasso
The girl got hot
But there's just one kind of love you can spend your life dreaming of
I thought she liked me but somehow I was wrong
I need someone like you around
I'll be right there
In West Palm Beach on your holiday
Found something crying, it was my soul
Got me flashing keys and I don't even own a car
I miss everything everything
She would know that our love our love
This is crazy, but I know I left you to be with your art
Going loco down in acapulco if you stay too long
When I was a movie star
You declined so sweetly and commented on my jacket
I'd be dancing like a monkey up a tree
I need a kind, and honest man honest man
We can set this thing apart, 'cause we're gonna
To take me all the way, you got me right here
Good god girl, you're giving me goosebumps
Single package systems
The rhythm's been running through my veins
My neurosis was thinkin' everybody's staring at my red eyes
And we both like to stretch the truth
Baby you should know that I would, I would
I know its there somewhere
You punched a hole in the sun
Oh, you'll never sleep at all
From far away
This a number one champion sound
If you want me, baby, that's fine
And shifty expression but now I'm past carin'
I dream and see you floating high above me
'Cause, since I've come on home,
Yes, all I need are keys and guitars
Have ambition simply to see things through
Behind green skies, I can see my girl's eyes
And we'll play you this tune
Why don't you come right out and say Come right out and say it
Do you have a clue what this is I don't know 
Walking rounds in search for stars these nights
But it's mine to decide when and if I'll be all right
Yes, this I know
I can't believe I never noticed my heart before
If I were you I'd take a permanent vacation
This ring will help me yet
You're gonna get in trouble with that
Singin' original songs by the original masters
And I'm righting all my wrongs
And where is the woman you love
Clowne towne revealing nothing
I trace my footsteps to the place of my birth
And the boys with the brown skinny legs
Stay a while and wait and see Wait and see 
All right
Now you're mine
I used to dream and I used to vow
Memories are lost and found
I just want to stop stop just to thank you baby
So you better get a charge 'til I see you again
On a Tuesday in the rain, I never thought there'd come a day
Crossing the street and crossing galaxies of taxis and
I know I cannot see you 
Em dentes, pernas, bandeiras
But I love it
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
And I look stupid
We just can't get enough
I'm in love with this soul
Ooh, ooh
It's never gonna work, I don't know what I'm doing in here
I love love
I'm love struck, and looking out the window
So, wrap me up, return to sender
'Cause we rely on some words instead
You said inside grand central station
Tonight I might just loose my way
I was crying on the bathroom floor
You know what
No, no, target market, television
We will never have our old way; we will never have a right of way
And every time I do, I keep seein this picture of you
Squeeze me, squeeze me baby all through the night
Ready, ready, ready, ready, ready to run
I can live, live without
I change my name to "Did He Really Just Say That Shit"
To te querendo
I want to shake your tree
Are you having an affair
That I don't know a thing about love
The light that wraps itself around me
What's up with this Prince song inside my head
Ooh that's alright
I wouldn't change it for the world
And there's something about this rush
It wont be too long till
Yes, those mystery hours,
Now we can see the warnings and the signs
So this mic thing can move the right thing and do the right thing
At your dad's office party
When everybody loves me, I will never be lonely
In my head it's insane
Burgh representative I need y'all behind me cause
Then our allies grew
Whenever wherever you wanna go one day
The faces there
Is a dreamy melody
The state fair marquee reads
Makin' him a perfect life
Oh, the sound of distant carnival drums
Who wants this rockscene
Good, I'm good
Their faces are green and they don't know what they've done
What's broken gets stronger when it mends
Can't get over you
Six cars and power to fire big stars
If you're rock 'n' roll, disco, heavy metal angel
Where feelings not reasons
Two people synchronized
But I'm okay
Your mother likes my smile
But I picked up something I just can't explain
Leads away decay
Do Mase got the ladies
More than any other girl yeayeah
Sneakers looking fresh to death, I'm loving those shell toes
I get a feeling, you get a feeling we got a feeling
I am on your side
So smart just shouting answers shouting answers
But I know I won't keep on playing the victim
Will a lady pin me in her hair
We gotta let it out, let it out, let it
My feet are walking over him
Need you right now
You say this could work someday 
How you end up here
'Cause when you're walking along
That I might feel should she appear
Now you're gonna get a beatin'
Sitting in the back of my next class, napping
Be careful with that game you're tryin' to bring
I'm glad you threw all that away 'cause now you look so great
Well this is life in color color
Whoa, babe
You can send us some sun
That I pretend
We had those all ages hardcore matinee shows
Your touch on my check
And love was in the air
To do whatever do whatever baby
Taking pictures of everyone
You keep callin me back to your heart,
And now you take her out, in your fancy car
At times I wonder if we really took the steps to break right through it
She made her home in a poor country
But I'll never get down hearted
Has been so bipolar
Everybody's dancin' in the moonlight Mmm, everybody
Living on alert, rubbed in the dirt
Climbing over people 'cause I've been blinded
You know we got to pray together
It's not about the money
"Look at Twisterella, she hasn't got a fella"
And I wish that she was mine
Two winters gone in a blur of sleepless nights
Lying down with a scoob
I drove into Seattle rain, fell in love, then missed the train
I wear my blue jeans and fly my blue kite
I don't care what people say when we're together
We built a wall around ourselves
You're takin' me out to wine and dine me
I only believe in your blue smile, 
Easy  I know what my speech should be
His name was Bluebeard
And when I feel bad when people disappoint me
Your just going to get sacked
Everybody gotta fit in somewhere
When we would take trips
You're still my favorite melody
Watching our spirits dance on the
What you need is higher than your shame
My life was falling
He can't wait to tell you about Repeat  times
We do battle in our bedrooms
Parting with invisible best friends
We might as well do what the children sayin' take a day off hit park and just hang barbque roll a few and put up your dukes if it's beef put down the peace and put up your dukes it's time to change our ways so we can save the day for the children sake and make a better place to play and if it's all good break out your click and grip your wood and if you ridin' dirty just light your swift abd blow yor sss but dot real big exactly like a player should enjoy your 's do your thang and rep your hood the world is all yours but still we all bound forever in a day the choice you make is relly all fine
Got the skin got that thing
Forget all your technicolor dreams
Never saw another creature, never knew another man
Without your love,
Every day I'm fighting 'cause I can't leave it
What matters is the love that you give
And do it right
I wanna be a hippie
And sometimes you just need a night on the town
If you can't beat 'em, join 'em
Body my holding cell
But still turned out all right, yeah
You've wasted every moment
Up the coast to catch some sun
I've seen lots of brothers act tough,
Night work
You're a heart attack, just the kind I like
Like nibblin' a little afternoon delight
And you will slide on the back seat of my bike
The cops they got the guns, the night destroys the sun
That's when I need you two to help me believe
You will learn it can be quite demanding
It's true, but just remember that
I want to be where I've never been before
Because all of us are
Of sleigh rides in seasons
He's got more channels
And you looked into my bloodshot eyes and said is it too soon if I call you Sunday
It wasn't supposed to be like this;
But I sure don't want to get hurt
You've dialed that number now, so where's the surprise
That does take me away
Over little things the way I do
Bend your knees when you're lifting these
It's the thing that does drive me
All right, yes, can we just try to figure this out
She ain't no good for me
It's wrong to feel the limitations and the
Tears me inside out whenever you're around
We'll sing, it's a beautiful day
Why don't I just fall in love with you
So I'll stay away
Life is a journey where you stumble and fall
I close my eyes and see cellar stairways
This has of course nothing to do with anything
You'll shiver all summer
One time where one woman
It was thrown by the friend of an exthing 
Got your shades on your eyes
It was a park through the trailer park
And my eyes want to cry
Can't see their faces but I've noticed that they seem to have big hands
Eugene oh yeah
Don't know where to go
Got chicks, all hot chicks
And I been oh hell no
The lines about you, they never rhymed
I compliment your
We got the drinks by the dozen and mo' bottles coming but
Well I long to be alone with you
Am I destined only to die the same way that I lived
But every time I get a new number, she finds it damn
I won't leave any doubt or stone unturned
That still make me think about my middle school kiss
Drive so deep where we can't see a thing
Hey that's alright
I watch them pierce the blue, blue sky
Remember it was Paris you said we were gonna meet
Past the sky
What'cha know about love
Is that it's best, kid
Can't lift a finger, can't change my mind
And it's funny how you find
One glance was all it took
From on the bedroom floor
But if it would have been easy I would not have cared
If I am another waste of everything you dreamed of
Whoa whoa for the wings of a dove x
Just to do your thing's the hardest thing to do
I never thought there'd come a day, yeah
They're on your back
I have to sit down on the curbside and count the coins in my pocket
Just like it hasn't been three years
"She's looking at you Ah, no, no, she's looking at me"
Then you look in the mirror, wish you were somebody else
We break down a party landmine
Oh yes, you are
And if you really love me
You're like Brando on the silver screen
When I look at you, oh I feel my heart
So I never hear from you, and that's fine
On a shortlived flight, making love on economy
With a john deere logo and a stain on the back
You got soul
So, go turn their heads, go knock them dead, go break their hearts
When we were young and the world was free
D, world destruction
I love Love
And I know you're underrated but one day we'll all make it
Hey little rich girl where did you go wrong
When I see land, you will conjure up a storm
Whether whiteness whisks soft shadows away
Go save the world, I'll be around
I just met this foot guy who's just my type
"Shotgun," "Wedding," "Shotgun," "Wedding"
Today I watched the boats
Tonight, sleep tight, and build your nest upon my shoulder
Everyday I'm fighting 'cause I can't read you
Infatuation took a hole of my mind
Your pentagram is down below our floor
There's a number you can call
But that's one thing you've already got
Hey You I moved to the side
Right now my only rhyme is this lesson I learned
"You and me are the world", she said
Got keep on, gotta go on, gotta go on
Can't handle you their way
And all the people who've seen it all before
Everyone lies, everyone lies
Everything else would be overrated
Lord it's a long way to go back home
Roamed the drunk chipped tooth
And when you walk inside I feel the door
when they tryin' to work it out 
Chime of the bells striking
I was walking along in the sun
I hope it can stay this way
And she'll show you some rhythm
I respect your hustle girl
Happy happy
I've been up some baby shit and every time I wake up
Looking like you do 
My rollercoaster's got the biggest ups and downs
Just give me six strings and a hashtag
With soul searches sweat it out
For what it's worth, darling dear,
We've got an energy, energy, energy
I know where you belong
Sippin' DP to the TV, look greedy
Got to hold on tight
There are worse ways for a guy to spend his time
This city's full of life
We could take a thousand walks
Went 'round to see her
And I've got my family, and one big bed is all we need,
You can gamble everything for love if you're free
Let's keep, talking, anything to stop clockwatching
That your love is all my soul needs
Get out, goodbye
Yes, I just wanna compliment your soul
It made me feel so good
Swim to me through stars that shine down
You call me up in the evenings
I should have muffled my obsession but I was all too pure
Yeah, you're pushing me, pushing me, I can feel it, yeah
But this song is a real song
You said I never get things right
I'd give to you a day just like today
And now the family's cried
I'd love you to love me
Torn us apart
All of these faces are crowding around me
When he's played by Connery
Good, good, good, good vibrations
So sing with your hips my baby
Sleeping with a bookblanket out at sea
If he took a look in my brain
Just aimless with each other  is what we do
Makes me want to kiss and not tell
Oh Darci, Darci don't look so sad
I know that you are just like me, oversensitive
From no hoes at shows to menage in suites
I can take most anything
Love is all we need
And everyone fell right to their knees and then,
I give thanks everyday for these words that save my soul
And bring a bottle of rum
No, better than fine, perfect in my mind
a ray of sunlight 
To the center of my heart
Fading fast from taking this too far
Why did he run, run away from me
Push me up to starry skies
﻿You'll never feel happy
It was never supposed to be like 
Mr Jones and me, we're gonna be big stars
To raise her son
Did not let me down when I was a kid
Can you hold me up
Because I love you,
No matter what, I'm by your side
You dirty dance me all night long
And when I hold you in my arms
He's in the yard just washin' his car
Yeah, well you know gray is my favorite color
I been rock 'n' roll and disco
You give me ten thousand nights of thunder
We got an energy
You deserve to get your wish 
This song is not a long song
Ooh they won't come knocking at all
Quiero ser tu firmamento
You're extraordinary baby
What can I say
Don't cheer to the echo
And you'll smile and say, how are you
But early this evening
Wake up your saints, Jenny, I need them
Have in me a little faith
Oh, love natural, I can't believe how you do it to me
Thing's like a bluebird, until the wind dies
Let it take you on a ride
It was a long, long way from here,
And a longer day spent accepting
So don't expect me to stay with anyone
I'll memorize everything you do to me,
In a blue town
And everybody on the street is singing like it's Sunday
We'll take our chances
You're dressed to have a good time
I am bruised but she is dressing my wounds
I'd have no peace in my life
I think about all of the things I learned,
Instrumental
I would remind you of the photo in your pocket
When I am thirtyfour just talkin' 'bout high school years
Where silver never gets golder,
That's lost its feeling of so afraid 
I'll be the only thing who cares 
Here comes Spiderman, arachnophobian
Boys will be boys, baby
They are waiting, waiting
If tomorrow's not too late
Look out now, yeah, my boyfriend's back
We don't need to admit, we were wrong
But someone picked you from the bunch
Trying to make ammends
Your mother complains that you need a man
What it is your thinking
Don't let me down
'Cause without you I'm just bones bones
Ain't no way you're walking out
Until you've had sweet lovin' there's no lovin' worth the name
And the truth comes second
I'm coming round to take a stand
I got nothing to fear
I'm in if you're down to get down tonight
So c'mon c'mon and dance with me baby
The bus driver laughs and he shakes his head
Come on say "Oh Oh Get on the floor
'Cause I'm a straight pimp with a gangsta limp
Everybody was dancin' in the moonlight Everybody
Damn this wild young heart
My boyfriend's back now
Magpie comes a calling
You asked if we should sleep on these cardboard sheets
Gotta get that midnight meal
Ah, one I haven't cashed yet, all right
Love's rating in the sky
I'm going where there ain't no disease
Lavender wrestling a rich wild boar
Mr Jones and me stumbling through the barrio
Good times mm
Dreams don't always come true
I fall down and I try to get up
Any minute you will feel the chemistry
I'll meet you tomorrow, sort of late at night
He clutches the wine and tips it in cyonide
You're running through my mind and it makes me cccrazy cracracrazy
In the sound
I got to say California
So I say
And she stands up strong and she demands
Hey, that's a say ahh
'Cause what you bring
No need for headphones
We love it and we leave it and we watch it burn
In the sky when you parachute over the harbor
Lately it makes me feel just like someone's forming in the air air air
I hope he's right in the head
And walked out on a piece of paper
With a whole lot of nothing on your way to nowhere
Avec ses apparences instables
Every single one of my friends
By kissing my honey
But we just hang around and think of clever things to say
What's a poor boy to do but keep singing this song
I give my lovin' on the run
The souls that made the call
I'm there when you call
When I was an astronaut,
But when we got slightly more intimate, it wasn't that bright
You are the best, but you say you don't know
Still I can't get enough of it
And I think of all the things, what you're doing
On the road again
Sold my bed, no need to sleep these nights
We should need nothing, nothing at all
Truth told, truth told
And the choppers in the sky
At every kind of disco
All while hoping things
Something wasn't right
The buttons on my phone are worn thin
Replace, retrack
Shot an arrow in your head
Get a load, get a load
I'm gonna search for someone just like you
Oh rejoice, his hands perform hexes
And everyday I compare your face
There's lipstick on your collar
Wouldn't change your mind, non pas du tout
You let me come alive
And we have to take our clothes off
Battle at these shakedowns
Crashing into horizons, on the brink of success, hurrah
You never need to be afraid just know you went the right way
If you're a landlord, the social on BST
I want to go to heaven for the weather
I'm going past, I'm going past, I'm going past the next two lights
Keep your fingers off my money
I, I love the colorful clothes she wears
But she says she loves me all the same
Suddenly my mission was clear
Come back, I'll be with you someday
You'll be my American boy, American boy
You've got to learn to love what you are
Will somebody wear me to the fair
With matter removed of divine dimension
"But not the only one I need
To get used to this new feeling,
She sat me down and lit some colored candles over my head
I took it in the first place
You don't know what I've seen
I'll tip my cap to the world even though I don't wear one
The moment has come to face the truth 
Let's clash with madmen, grime is fine
'Cause I'm drowning When I close my eyes
You havin' problems with your family then work it out
You know the kind I mean
Went to a show last Saturday night
We dance in the living room
Way back when, we were the latest around
Second seat, go Dutch treat, you were sweet
I'd rather have the truth than something insincere
Old captains and brand new cruise ships
When I'm outside from over the phone
When you hit the ground just roll
Will I surround you, entombed and warm
You breathe in life forever
But before I know it I'm going down this little bitty river
There's still more to come
We got the money, we got the money, we got the money
And maybe, if the music is right
You're James Dean driving in your fast car
I'm too much in love
Woke up this morning shackled and drawn
But everything goes in and it stings,
And now I'm sunny with a high of 
Leave me the garage
None of those would matter much without you
Well no more, well no more blue days for you my dear
Says, "You're okay, I drive this route everyday"
That you feel while listening to every word that I sing
It's always a good time there
Rocking it straight down from Long Beach
I had a hole in the middle where the lightning went through
I swallow the beams and sun drops
All these rocky mountains
For years feeling dead
Well maybe it's the common curse
Two scientists were racing for the good of all mankind
Missing her warm embrace
"Just do what was done unto you, always"
Oh, trying our best to feel alive
Wanna see you smile
I'm under attack again my dear
My spring, 
You've got to drive your train
Said 'young man
If you're giving all of your money and time
We're on the edge of a beautiful thing", he said
And dirty hands
We're on fire now
He's not the perfect boy at all
Everybody loves the underdog
The water and not descend
Time will bring them back I bet
'Til I hear her say your name
All of the things that go to make heaven and earth are here
I'm walking rounds in search for, doesn't matter
I didn't have to explain to her that I wasn't dead
Me never find a lo lo lo love like this,
Oh, so demonic, oh my TVC one five
Let's go on the subway, take me to your hood
Little players comin' 'round
No one in this fair new world can talk us through this situation
'Cause you're so ooh Tootootoo, so ah Tootootoo, so cool Baby, you're so supersupremelybabadioh
Till the day I die,
It feels great
As long as it keeps goin' round its unbelievable
We learned to run at speed of light
Well baby look over your shoulder
Staking a claim among the young defectives far off under the nighttime,
I've been beat by an industry I've never seen
And we ate blue gill and we ate blue chips
You will end up like always back where you were before
She knows as well as you and i
Yeah, you were always the one
Oh wait for me now Dododo
Remember all the thing that you've seen
Fine spring day, California waves,
In favour of the mean, mean moves
I try not to let them show
No answer at the end
The words that came made not a sound
And she looked at me
And before my eyes
But some say we're headed for destruction
Leaving broken hearts all over town
For all of these simple things and much more a flower was born
Think I got a tan from the light which I was basking
Problem with y'all I say it directly
Down by the railway station
This rocky road and this steering wheel
So much for the late rent, cause your money's spent,
Find the words you sing to be
And the sound of the sea
All the words come out my broken jaw
You know I wanna be the one to hold you when you sleep
Right here, right now, you never have to feel alone
No date, no place, no time, no RSVP
I can't believe I love you still
Mystery hours
She said you musta like him 'cause he's, oh, so nice
You said, "I don't know"
For the next three minutes please
I've been falling apart
Well if my feet don't touch the ground
We gathered arms and fired shells
Your feet are dry with the ashes from dead babies,
And though I feel so sad,
But our dreams are all we really need to know
You run wild, I lose control
They look down from the underground
Growing sleepy as the rain falls 
Doin' unbelievable things
When I look at your face I can tell that you're not going to be stopping soon or even slowing down
You know today I just woke up and I said you know instead of waitin' on a good day waitin' around through up's and down's waitin on something to happen I just say
It sounds so good right now 
Tell me, are you gonna cry all night
We got the money
Just in case the world end
All these haters say I'm faking but I really don't care
The third week with the jar you find
On a sunshine bus
Leopard handbag out of sight
Foaming like the melody of sea foam fairy flutes
I've got a collar full of chemistry from your company
Dancin' in the moonlight
Slip away and out of sight, feel the magnet of a night
Still just go to the same old clubs
But the hurt will never destroy her hope
Because your light is the light of ten sunsets 
And she kissed them
Only you, know me well
And Matt Damon's not meant for me
What's up, enough's enough, where's my morning coffee
My mouth has sprung wide open
Logos is the king of life
But I don't even know if I could look you
They're just paper cuts
Why you standin' on the wall
Never took a scene check
The feeling inside
Give up your life
But all of my thoughts just seem to form around you
Gonna find my baby, gonna hold her tight
And her heart may be broken a hundred times
It's weird how she comes in so strong
There's something strange going on tonight
Was that the best part of your life
So many choices
How the magic's in the music and the music's in me
For me, there's you and there ain't nobody else
And stuck another needle in the ground,
It's spinning circles around my ears 
Memories of loving her
I play the piano and I play the guitar
In the place to be Uh huh
Let me tell you something, oh
In a rabbit hole to the sound of you
That I've been dying to see
So come on and face it
Mr Jones and me look into the future
Oh, can you hear the beat of my heart
And with a picket for a knife
Trudging through the dark in a world gone wrong
Yeah, we're on fire, we are on fire
Ooh ooh
For you and wait
I've bought a calendar, and every month
It's clear I'm only here for good clean fun
And when all is said and through, would I know just what to do
'Cause I just wanna compliment your Soul
It's been three weeks
Take me somewhere new
Get a load, get a load of it
And it feels good
Give me a night that I won't forget
I can feel it calling me
Need to take a break and figure it out, yeah
I couldn't help but to notice how alone you are
I've been watching you all night
We could made a brandnew start
This hour, this day
That's a shame that love can make you stay 
If it's your birthday
I'm aware that friendship can die young
We gathered around to hear just what they'd done,
We spoke for hours
Oh, baby
I'm givin' it some heart and soul, now
Throw off your fears let your heart beat freely at the sign that a new time is born
Let's get, backwards
We've got to find the time
Would he hold you when you're feeling low
I don't know how much more I can take
Doesn't matter where
And then you take it away
Reluctance ties up the line
Let's all have a real good time together
Good friends keep enemies at bay
Night nursing a broken man
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah x
Because that's just ridiculously odd
It feels cold, it's creeping
Though we go on our separate ways,
I can do anything I want to
The big big bang, the reason I'm alive
And none of us stay, ah
And pass me a bottle, Mr Jones
Only you, bend my reason 
Estas semanas sin verte
Made it so you had to walk away
Go on, get going
Just sounds like a worn out cliche
But if you really love me
Are these the good days
Take me to my city by the Bay
And all my questions still ask for answers
So I requested this song
I hate to love you
Just don't feel right
Your legs are a melody my hands
More people like these
Would you be my love, my love could you be mine
Jig wit it 'cause ship crisp, split it all
So, baby, tonight just be the death of me
Make your own kind music
Bottles and the cans, the idiots go dance
Still I build my towers high
If I've seen it all before why's this bus taking me back again
What it means to hold you tight
I don't need a tuxedo
Underneath a cloudless sun
That has the power to raise a temple and tear it down
Oh, the memories come astreamin'
He was kind, polite and divine in public, tender as a sleepy child
Make you mine and mine will be all yours
Run and get your quarters in
"I feel it coming on"
Nobody cares at all
Tear the tear, and fold the fold
Goodfellaz baby
Wahooh, wahooh
What's the matter, take a number, Buttercup
And now I'm sunny with a High
And we tend the garden all day long
An American hazy sea
Now I'm right here, right here
I don't wanna stare at stacks of paper all the while while the world goes by
The things we go through just to work it out
But it's still your reflection, you and no one else
Giving me a heart attack 
Hit the streets
Took them away
You're gonna be all right, all right
I got it real bad
And by the looks of things, fate came along for the ride
Everybody shake it
And tell me what they did this time
Dancing feet, wasters on the cover of a magazine
Kiss me baby all through the night
There's something about you
It's like y'all be talkin' funny
And make the same mistakes, always
Underneath the town towards the sea
It's such a fine and natural sight
And he knows that you been lyin'
a song from your mouth, 
Well I can't wait to tell you all about her, all about my new girl
It's sneaking around out there
They never care at all
One day I'll tell you what you did for me
I ain't looking to receive
Oh man, it's ladders to the sky,
You been spreading lies that I was untrue
The pills that fix the way you feel
If you believe in magic, come along with me
Like something we had seen before
And call to the sleeping world as they fall to Earth
He said, "Hey, sister, it's really, really nice to meet ya"
This world alone this world alone
Credit card number please
And I don't want to see it end
Drive so deep that we can't see a thing
We'll dance until morning till there's just you and me
Now means a lot
And the wind and snow and the rain that blows
And I was a stain on her unmade bed
When we all had finally washed ashore
It's catching my eye
Or buy some acidwash pants
We're on the edge of a beautiful thing", she said
But I'll stay right here and hide 
She's off and she's running
You're lookin' so fresh
The blood of mankind runnin' through the same veins
But when I get under control, I see you ache for it and all
We all wanna be big stars
If you can't get behind your own life 
Don't blame it on the moonlight
And nothing really feels the way you do
Don't you know it's dangerous and it's sweet
Can you still hear my voice
Combustible, and I can't wait to finally explode
I thought that she would never let me get it
So many ways in which to reach for the sky
And rejoice although this world will penetrate you
He holds up paperwork  sign the line
So baby come over
Who have passed the test just like all the rest,
And my life is sublime and it's mine and it's time
Go without the love I receive
Stand back, son, and let a man work
'Cause I could live by the light in your eyes
Ladayla, my boyfriends's back
It's gonna be a beautiful day
I got my hands on your teenage poems
But I don't get no loving, and that's no lie
I don't know why you can't see
I think it's your heart, cause you don't want me around
Used to take me out, in your fancy car
It wasn't that hard
But now I just pass out watching TV
And can't you see if I could be anything
We are the tide, and none of us stay, ah
It's just the way that he sings
You above with the ocean around me
All the seasons where you dye your hair
Baby you got me sick
Ten thousand stories and two lovers disguised
Now I remember earlier in the day
Right here, right now, Elvis brings his children home
But the heart of creation it's the only
No turning back so you better buckle up
It's better to be loved than left out
Forget about the price tag
Well my body's been a mess
That I'm not the kind of boy that she needs
White hot glistening shadowy flows Feelings to grow 
A part of me drift away with you and will never return
Like a full moon to a werewolf,
Just remember to sing along, yeah you better start singing along
Who's got the crack 
When I look at the television
The grass is greener on the other siide
You haven't mentioned me yet
Did you think of something He didn't think of
What do you need
I can do anything I want anything my heart tells me to do
You're Bruce Lee with the way that you move
Money please
Love me with an open heart, tell me anything
Oh, show me your love
You know they needed aid
You know it's clear that tonight we belong in this place
During the fight
But yeah, like you told me
Well are you strange enough 
But I'm beginning to see that instead its trouble
The east river when you are in love
The bottom line is laying in the bed that we've been playing in tonight
She wont ever let you meet her family,
I was down on my knees
Together we'd be fine, fine
"So come on, jump with me"
You can hear voices bleeding through those warm Latin nights
In your father's steps
Just your smile 
Then why don't we call her
We don't want those things
Ah, in the first place
Things I don't understand
Seems like everybody's got a price
Gonna push this beat till it hits the top,
Our enemies lay dead on the ground and still we kick, hey
Thinking in a real avenue
I will let you down
I feel like I'm loving you in 
I'll be right there showing
And baby I just don't mind, mind, mind, mind
Struggling with the parameters
I know that like me you can be oversensitive
Now the time has come and yeah the show it must stay strong
You've seen the future, now a love that is blind
You hold my head when I throw up
When you look in the mirror, wish you were somebody else
We just gotta get it up
There's a cold frost sweeping
And you should never let the sun set on tomorrow
You'll be pulling out your hair
If you really want some understanding,
Nights like these when you know that you got fire
But these feelings run right through the night
But it feels great
Absorb the summer sun and think of me
This is screaming "photo op"
How the music can free her whenever it starts
You might be found tomorrow x
And all of the things that you did to me
When a sailor stole my glove
You're the only one that knows me,
Just when I could run this race no more
Before I get flattened away
I can work this thing on top
People say that
Sitting around
Always tried to keep
You left me for no reason
Honey I need you
He's an underdog he's coming out on top and
Drinkin' yager all day
Ripped apart by the crows not the vultures
In a way we are an army
We can work it out, we gon' work it out baby
I been down
I'm sorry love but I don't really care
All you did was construct a mess
Hear ye, hear ye, now anybody could take this stage
Float through the air
Waiting for someone to come around
Just be careful when you shine
Upstairs
N, do I need
Got chicken on the drums
You've got me tripping
Will they ever find their way
You can't dance and stay uptight
Just some one new
Even know
'Cause I know I'll make you scream my name
Hopin' that I'll catch sight of the sun
Meanwhile in Tahoe outside Casa Tony
Free from all the happy thoughts and smiles across the sea
I don't think that I knew the chaos I was getting in
If I had a song that I could sing for you
Let's bypass the bullshit and move on because
Tin roof sounds alarming
So just let it be
I used to cry against a wall
Someday, someday in a cloud of gray
I'm not the perfect guy
Why don't, why don't I fall
Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I see you crying
I was looking for a decent boy
I'll never find a love like this
Till I made some tender coin
Song after song after song after song amounting into mountains
Their skin too thin
At least they'd have a hella fine merlot
You'll never feel happy
Our ways will separate tonight 
In chilly subdepth railways
Where nobody here could know
I used to sing the saddest songs
I hope you didn't catch a tan,
And I know you will
Too many noises
And laugh all day
'Cause it's a beautiful thing
So maybe later today I'll know
In the city with no one else,
Be with my baby, then
I guess this world is over to me
You said our love would be
I'll never find my way back home
It's always a good time
Apartment lights go dark
My teammate right beside me
Every step I take
I am a lady from Mars
As we play hide and seek
Welcome to the toon town party
When he's at my gate, with a big fat eight
You're aloft in the airway
Helped me sing a song and
Its waves crashing over me
She served up my heart on a plate
The places you go
And its funny how you find
I won't weep because I didn't keep
So many sights to see
All those times I'd hung my head to keep the peace
Where is the man you respect
Lasting love, if you know the difference
I been low
And you know you know
The day we're born till then we
Long Beach Dub Allstars, Black Eyed Peas, Will I Am
So let's get lucky, let's go all the way
Visions of love recollected
Begging you to please
And I'm slurpin' everything through a straw
But if I did I would groove, and hit the ground running
'Cept the planet that we own and its playing nd fiddle
If you let me baby
And I believe in something again
Up to the stars and counting all the suns and all the moons
CCC climb to the top of the mountain but your still alone
Cause the poor wretch died with a book on her knee
It was the moon that stole my slumber
Kill someone in argument
Well you sure look fine
There's an angel knocking on my window
Would he kiss you
And we'd sing along with the crowds
Now I'm not going anywhere and I don't know what I'll do
Bills are due on Monday and I
Very good friend of mine
When your love slides
We don't need your money, money, money I don't, we don't need it
Can we just talk about this, please
When you and I both know this is the end
Like the Pips at they Gladys
You're on my mind all the time
I will turn you away as easily as I turned you into me
I wanna die, and I'll take it from you, if you got it
Iis harder than I ever feared
There's something going on that's not quite right
And we all fall down, there's not enough hours in our trip
Whoa whoa for the wings of a dove x
You're so good
We were cool back in high school
Watch him burn, he never fails to please
And get back to the high street, I need somethin' to eat
And lately the weather
And cotton wool you safe in me
It's a suicide, waiting, another day
Their moss mangles polyanthus
Boogie you just gotta
Cause it won't be the same next summer
What it used to be back home
My boyfriend's back he's gonna save my reputation
And failed out of the priviledged life of his dream
It's been a long time coming
'Cause he's kinda big and he's awful strong
In love on the airway
So you're walking on the edge
When everything's a little clearer in the light of day
His thoughts go deeper than ever yeah yeah
Hey, these are different times but we feel the same pains
'Til I ended up
The sun is shining, yeah
Your heart is big enough for two
I'm fortunate they don't see a fourth what I get
You gotta keep on movin', remember
I really love your peaches
Step out your house and prepared to be amazed
Because you thought that you could outrun sorrow
To the top of the mountain
Show me your personality
Passing the market now, the windows in neon illuminating my path to defeat
Will you drift away
And still, if I yell at the top of my lungs
'Cause back in school, man that gets cruel
The farmer told me I was late
I don't wanna become someone
Found something dying, it was my light
You've got a busy day today
Baby, are ya cold, are ya cold, baby
If you're afraid, fear will only break your heart 
Such an angel with a devilish angle
So hold me up now
I waved her goodbye
It feels so hard to win, so hard to lose
You're starting now so please stay off 
One, two, three, let's go
Went from hard to sweet, starved to eat
Mr Jones strikes up a conversation
Damn, I wish I was a lesbian
That we're getting up early to go to the state fair
Sometimes your life can crumble
After waking up postoperation
And all the kids now
Prove to everybody who doesn't understand
I will not let you down
Through our window
Now she sings along, when you play guitar
Baby, break their hearts
They say love is hell,
I'll be lookin' at the ceiling, so concealing
We'd like to make it right some which it remain tame
Our hands are bleeding through
Diamonds shine like stars beneath the ground,
What are we all looking for
But it seems to take an hour for her to reach the floor
And I say
Some people walking round calling me Maurice
Clowne towne no shelter
You way too sexy, never be shy
To let me pass you by would be a shame
And good with talking
Yeea, yeah
I've sworn a million times
The clouds have fought
Watch it burn, acrid smoke making him wheeze
I just wanna, I just wanna, I just wanna get up off the shelf
And he's telling you to make up your bean about what's left of your evening
The four of us, the royal we, he bangs the drums, she's VIP
 days since we first met
Inside every man lives the seed of a flower
So they know I'm not forgetting them
And it's been hours now, to be here like this
Back to the years and all those tears
You're breaking branches
And I'm happier than whores with chivalrous clientele
Where I felt the stars explode around me
And I'm waiting, I'm waiting around
Sem lenco, sem documento
'Cause I just wanna compliment your soul
I'll stroll down your treelined driveway
That I know wrong from right
Your best you tried, yeah you did fine
I will never be lonely, son, I'm never gonna be lonely
No more bad times
Hey handsome, we got it good
Why the world is right when you're near Is that so 
Pictures of things as they used to be
Your father said
I said baby, don't ya know
Went back to places that I knew
The rest is just a dream"
I can't believe things are really that bad
Your lowcut dresses threw stares from everyone
We were all powered up on some new upper drug
Don't need them around
In the womb of winter, summer seems a myth
When I've spend one with you
Whoa whoa yeah yeah yeah
Over and again, racing out of my skin
When this life tried to keep us apart,
Hey that's say ahh
I gotta be with you now, baby,
Could believe for all the world
Gonna find our love today
When they took the beach that day
Lookin' forward to a little afternoon delight
I got a strange neighbour
Making brand new memories
To come around
It's a meaning that I understand
If love's the truth then look no lies
Just can't wait to get on the road again
Cause you know so and so, and you made a hit
So full of energy nothing to hide
Your back's against the wall
A few more weeks till worms lick my bones
Don't stop talkin' to me please
In a crowd you raise the tempo in the disco as you make this place your own
I didn't have a penny
How d'you do  Comment allezvous 
Don't blame it on the good times
As often as the mail comes
And then return again
Just to be Just Jack and just that, still intact
I'm so warm, new dawn, reborn, new forms
Outside the in crowd
I ain't ever gonna let you down
Is look into your eyes
So try and guess my weight, waiting at the station
All I'm ready to do is have some fun
Yeah, okay
I can't wait to see your face when you and your friends show up
Not the way that you look
My friends will second that
Eee ya ya ya ya ya Island of Lost Souls Iya iya iya iya island Iya island
But a queen don't know about giving
But you know that you gots to believe in
It looks like this might be a quickie
Standing there in your underwear and new pumps
Is stay till early in the morning
Passengers on different cars steppin' off the same train
We just sold out all the floor seats
All the things that I should be
I'll get home early from work
Something's calling us
And we're playing nd fiddle
'Cause since I've come on home,
And to fall down from any height
Thought you were being so kind by keeping your mouth sealed shut
And gave us a big surprise
And we'd sneak into a carpark
'Cause it's the weekend
Some stay some go
Over cliffs we will swim ahead
Sometimes at work
'Cause when I touch your arm, I can tell
There's no bouncer in the after world
I want you to know y'all
After today
The devil wants to know if you're going down or up
You were always saying something, you swear you'd never say again
Come on, everybody, to the Nth degree
Do you want it to be outside in the cool night
And darlin' you've got me wantin' you
Nothing in my forgotten years
You wanna be all right you gotta walk tall
And I'm hard to please
I feel horny when I thinking of some of that rhythm in my mind
So let's ride bikes into the sea
Right here, you got me where you want me
Women that so sexy
Don't let them get you down
That we gonna make it right now, make it right now
We have to take our clothes off
The wrath of millions of thieves lies disguised
Comes back tenfold, fold, fold
And forget our restless destination
True ring, true ring
You son of a bitch
We know we shouldn't do it, but we do it anyway
To get cut enough
Oh Never find a love like this
'Cause now today is your day
Parting with a childhood best friend
Come on take a shot
'Cause all the lazy boy could do was RUN, then I knew for sure
A man in a bright light
With an M you'll feel the surge of your American past
This thundering and lightning gets you rain
If it was meant to be us, it was meant to be now
We're singing a new song now
At least we can say we won't be lonely
In this cold, world so cold
When everyone was in jeans
Your eyes permanent on mine
He wrote a book about the Bible and he, he wrote a book about men in the sky
Oh, there's always someone cooler than you
To practice the life
You've got the elegance but it's weighin' you down
I'll put on a brand new shirt
She crawled right in, oh my
Or all the things we put each other through
Empty hands
Well this ain't no game
And she's already workin' on my brain
The midnight streets feel dead
We turn it up, we turn it up
I'm breathing down her neck
When I tell you that I love you
I get the feeling they got you believing
I wanna be with you
Yeah don't mess, 'cause I know you gon' lie
I really want to come kick it with you
You'll never find your way home, no matter where you go
It was rock 'n' roll
But happy is all that you make me all you make me
Well, she's not bleeding on the ballroom floor
Well Kim's got the answer with her watermelon gun
Well come on, well come on, hon' get up and dance with me yeah
Shooting stars around your heart
Your decision is a sure thing
We're breaking free
In deep Atlantic skies
Each howl, I get bigger 
I've been thinkin' 'bout you
I write my blue songs
We just gotta get it up, we just gotta get it up,
And when she rings you up
So come and talk to me If that's your plan
I dug the book she read
Brings you closer
Something out of nothing
But as we get older oh, our vision becomes blurred
Hey babe, thought maybe
You broke my heart, you broke my mind
And I called, you called me
Everything that you've been giving
Cross my heart, hope to die
And everything is askew
All of the things that go to make heaven and earth
I might just get up and dance
And faulty by design
If you're caught up in the gales on the junk boat seas
And the beat that she throw at me
Now I feel okay
I know you don't want it this way
While I'm away
And your eyes grew red and wild before the chasin'
It doesn't matter that they say we'll never make it
Someplace that I have never been
But I'm an old man on the back porch
If things go right, they'll have to agree
Away down stream,
And every song was right
Where it's reggae night tonight
She smiles
And I have to turn away to keep from bursting
I know, wherever you go
And this girl, she was nothing like you, whoa
Ooh la la, you're my superstar
Stumbled round this old sundial, there these words I read
You and your ways capture what I've misplaced
You've got the crack 
Leopard handbag out of sight dynomite
Why was I the last to know
Little bunny foo foo hopping through the forest scooping up the field mice and bopping them on the head
Once I laid it on ya you never would forget it bet
How many licks 'til you get
For guitars and drums and desperate poetry
The tundra under us cracked and ruptured
When you leave don't say
You know what I'm talking about bout
And fought it off and fought to feel
Movement of my desires lost like a stone
What do you see when you dream about it
The way that you let your hair down
As colder nights harden
I meant the letters to be bolder, bolder,
My friends said I looked like I was dead
There's only one bullet
I'd just been fired and her first offer had arrived
Tell me, do you lose your way each day
I'm surprised at how hot honeycolored and hungry she looks
Where the wind withers memory
This be the route we'd always take and
Don't move your mouth, they don't like when you talk
'Cause even though we never get things right
You caused him so much heartache
My legs going numb for keeping my phone on vibrate
Our weapons were our instruments
"Deputydogdogadingdangdepadepa"
I don't want to be number two
Yeah, yeah, everything's gonna be all right
Because we will be wild like children 
Stop making a fool out of me
Knocking me flat
We on the floor and we grind to the beat
Every time the lights go out out
Oh what a hopeless tumbling down
You live in another state far away from me 
But when I know you're naked
We've got an energy
And it gets the best of me
Windows are rolled down
Make a nigga scream and shout, shout
For any of the boys
Stayed in my house for days with my weed psychosis
I'll kiss you right between your eyes
No I don't wanna be there, and feel so stuck right here
Waiting for my judgment day
Feeling all alone without a friend you know you feel like dying
I'm running a fast as I rock
And he's on the way to the real first in all the universe Yeah Yeah
Surrender the town 
It's gonna take alot of time before I can cross that finish line
I'm playing at the wrong game yeah
Demonstrate, you got to demonstrate
It could have been just another dream
Everyone lies
They're just humans with wives and children
And tell me why I'm not dead with them in the valley down below
De quelques visions imaginaires
Still the memory stays, for always, my heart says, Danke Schoen
You better hide your feelings
And I shed a tear between my legs
Do you still get knocked down by that Bacardi Breeze
We floated weightless through the tops of trees
On your side
A bass player I know swum my way
He said g'day
And I'm feelin' like Mike at his baddest
Kiss my petals and weave me through a dream
Play that rock and roll for me
Loveydovey, doveylovey, dovey all the time
Woo hoo the city float
How I love
On his mind
I don't mind if you play your game,
Just happy times and half assed rhymes and mimes
She's a simple girl
We've got to do it soon
What a cruel way to treat a friend
Come ye, come ye, to toilet circuit touring stops
Yeah we stare at the beautiful women
Some eyes were looking down at us
If you gamble everything for love
I know you like her
All I've got to do is climb the ladder to you
She says to me
That was all
Gamble everything for love, gamble everything
You're just about to fall
I'll be the guiding light
The only time I ever noticed my heart
When we are younger oh, our hearts are so much bolder
Mean nothing more than "meow" to an animal
I swear, I know you did
My friends they always told me
I've bought a watch, to time your beauty
Drew a line between love and hate
But this ship was built to go down
The life of Riley
Woo, yeah
Then we're the smartest kids I know
And I don't know where you've been
They stopped the lightning
And then you both smile, I feel so good inside
And it gets so old just saying, "We'll keep trying"
Just another one of those glory days
Starting missions at the break of dawn
But this army not destruct
Tag als ob ich morgen tot ware
So you're standing on the ledge
Know they're right, and have done it right, could I get to be like that
That we could lay here for hours and justa reminisce
I just can't seem to shake, Emily, yeah
You will feel whole
The saddled streets, the burro beats down my door 
And my chest was beating
Michael's nervous and the lights are bright
The way you make up when we fight
There's gotta be something roaming up around the bend
Than anywhere with you 
Lola lola lola lola ooh
All right
Someday I will tell him maybe, It's been like this since I don't know when, but it's great
Makes me think that every girl I see
When her tears woke us so quietly
And by no fault of yours and by no fault of mine
The words I'm singing now
Again I'm afraid of one thing
Live in a blue house
You left your keys under my bed
Gonna turn my enemies into friends
In the tall grass where
What ya wanna do about this thing
Rejoice, rejoice, God's ears are stitches
The sun on my face and my shovel in the dirt
Why did you try at the choice
My father had a dozen wives
That reminds me less of youth
Justa live a little least of your life
Oh beautiful smiles, won't you stay awhile 
You need to handle me so gently
Finally made our way back to the train, rolling into Sheffield tonight
Gettin' head from girls
We do the things you wanna see
But to my defiance the music fades
Pulled my foot from my mouth answered back to things I've said
Do you want to dance and hold my hand
Her fickleness was thrown back in my face
It's time to get this started
Well, you know me better than that, or at least you did and something happened
Will you be my American boy, American boy
And we'll go dancing, baby, then you'll see
Go break their hearts
Damon's not meant for me
But there's no romance in my blood
EEverybody wants to pass as cats
But after this day
But the happy music will carry on
Out of my blue eyes
For about four years I've hated this town
Eu quero seguir vivendo, amor
At the trees they are
Our burden rests on your back
Oh man, we won't last long,
Whenever you need me
In my blue car and when I got there
You gaze down from the sky trying to see me
I hugged a man's arthritic shoulder
We call love late at day
That it's best, man
Always on your side
You just want to good times
That I come and I go
I'm trying to be okay
That only I know all about
Like walking down ChampsElysees
And I know you ain't into all that
There is nothing like someone new
But the heart of creation
Divide everything, just put it all flat
Vermiculated with delicate animal bone
If ever they get ambushed or pursued
Hold me up with pride
And we took a train into the town,
Ooo, That's alright
And I'm afraid I need my baby, I'm afraid he doesn't know it yet
Now you're crying in your sleep
I hope you'll find the right man who'll fix it for ya
I went to look
Slept in all my clothes like I didn't care
Nobody can take that no no no
I feel better off when we stayed
Since the stars predicted something new would reconnect our worlds
Something as simple as rock 'n' roll would save us all
And I said hey wait up
Need a crystal ball to see her in the morning
So baby, let's not miss this thing
They will try and tear you apart
And you make my heart beat faster
You'll be thinking about me now
Sold my bed, no need to sleep these nights,
Good morning and goodnight
If I never stand at another corner trying hard to be a father
You are the cat, you are the phone, you are an animal
Nothing in the world could ever make me look as good
Her face gets big, her face gets small
She wont ever let you in,
My salvation's ahead of me
They don't bark and they don't bite
I don't wanna let it go
Can't believe the words came out of your mouth, yeah
I get shaking inside and the sun in my eyes 
So you say
Tttripping across this island
What were we thinking
And your hips are a note
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
The sound, it found, the ground, and it hid it for free
You can have the keys to my car
And I stared back breathlessly
Where are all the men in this town
Aw yeah, all right, feel good tonight
I'll be happy, right
They happened in these dancehalls
'Cause the sun is shining
I'm the stalker, the funeral face that will follow wherever and ever you go
I never been to Brooklyn and I'd like to see what's good
Oh, the way you hold my hand
Oh my goodness me
And mine's a paper ball
Would he please you
I was too dumb to settle down,
Taking everything for much more than it means
Well, academy cogwheels breaking your hand
Your true father smashed his hands through the glass
On a bus stop bench sat an ancient lady
But they believe it from the tears
Let the code of silence repeat  times
Nothing's something that's important to me
Right here, right now, teenage kicks and gramophones
Ripped apart by the crows and the vultures
Wanna make the world dance Yeah, yeah
You look like Audrey Hepburn
Everything loved it's way
They're into something that is too big to be
Hey what do we know I think we've done it to ourselves again
Stay a while, we'll wait and see Wait and see 
They tried to break me down
Little arms on a big body
Whoa, babe I don't wanna lie
This is a story and you are not in it, uh huh
Is your love's extraordinary
Made of blades of gray, gray bristling grass
And I know I never seem to pick up the phone
Ela pensa em casamento
You make me feel so good
Your feet start tapping, and you can't seem to find
Things are looking good now good now
I been yes
In the love dimension
I will never grow older, at least not in my mind
See this shit ain't worth tripping over
I am softer than my face would suggest
All the nights, all the fights You are out of sight
Don't you know you're alive ah
How I love being in love
Senorita, I can't forget your eyes
I've been dancing with your ghost 
Well you knew this would come
So what else is new
I've found I always move too slowly
You're uneasy and you say you're scared
Record all the yearning
'Cause we love our love, in different sizes
Your lonely windowsill They'll carry you off tonight
This is life in color
Having an argument with myself down Queensbury Street
She was not the cure for cancer
Buy and sell, may as well invest in the weather
Don't know where you are
I wanna share this with you
You moved to Montreal to be closer to France
It's always a good time
Don't ya know
I'm running as fast as I can
These boys don't care
Whether hope dampens memory
'Cause in your mind I just might find
Spattered with plasma on a bus in Indiana
Why, oh why, did I not see this before,
Don't you blame it on the sunshine
And if you really love me 
I carried on
It's the end of a broken heart
Why are the Robots so sad
Saying c'mon c'mon and dance with me baby
From those old lips to a town where its dry
Great morning light splits through the chain
Watching our lives blow up
Watching my life go by
Because on and off,
Ribena, I know what you're drinkin'
In the morning light
Right back where I started from
Whether willing witness waits at my mind
Every time, so baby
Made for your life gain, plus my man might sing , 
And I will kiss you till your breath is found
Around the angles there's a race,
Just put to bed and stand beside me
Sunshine
And we won't stop
All the things I've got
The atmosphere is viscous we're sticking to the brine
When I feel like an oar in a sunken canoe
Gonna listen to some rock 'n' roll
It makes you feel happy like an oldtime movie
Do somethin', uhhuh, somethin' great,
And laugh with love
The winters coming now
I've always been in love with you
I been high
Don't, don't, don't let's start
I never dreamed that I'd come here to become the next Jolie
Having an argument with myself down Victoria Street
Cast as a wish into a well with no sound
He stole them out from whippoorwills
Can you not stand me at all
It's safe to say, saving you, saved me
I'll never find my way back home
We swore we'd never take pictures
Four five six seven minutes in the closet
But somehow that always seems to be enough
At the thought of being stuffed in my home
Surely we're here in mind
To keep my head above
While we have oceans
I better rest my eyes because I am growing weary of
We got to take it to the sky
With cotton wool and glue
Would he love you like I would
And if you don't understand then at least that's why
It feels so good to know two people so in love, so in love
Hangin' around for someone to call
It's not that strange, when all I have to say
All those things you left unsaid
Oh, the pressure's not as great
So what if we loose our minds, so what if it doesn't make much sense
And if home is really where the heart is
Got my teammate right beside me you know where to find me
And I'm branding each day
No more fat dumb fucks keeping people out of our nation
We lined and we painted this town
You just thought you could be anything that you wanted to be
Someday will come back to us,
Again, everyday
Baby now I know why
I needed someone to understand my ups and downs,
If you try to stop this, you're just too late
I love it and I leave it and I watch it burn
Won't let you get in dans ma vie
It looks like you might fall
And I watched Superman fly away
Tradin' out the weather for a clever lyric written by an Ikea light
I got a full drawer of letters
But move
You tossed your phone fifty feet in the air, I can't believe you caught it
We're gonna have a good day and I fin to worry bout what noboy say I'm still above ground that's the reason I pray got my car cleaned up now I'm ready to play make call to the sticks say I'm headin' dat way heard my cousin cookin out I gotta get me a plate got new outfit ain't even out in the states so if they ain't speakin' to soon but this is a hell of a day and these dickies got me sitin' in a hell of a place got my stunna shades on a grin on my face my grill looks mean but I swear I'm straight and the hood showin' love so I'm a okay
Nah, I don't wanna talk to you
Can we rise Can we get along alright
And war is in our hearts,
No jumping, conclusions
Ya, that's alright
Baby you should know that I would
Still got me deeper every day with your smile
Provide me with a means of getting home 
As the years they all roll by,
Strapped to a chair
Cause the tarmac was melting and the people seemed to sway
But she'll show you pictures
Only I'm still hanging on
Till I find my new drug
Way back then
Watching history unfold
Close your mind and waste some time if you have to
I'll do what you say
"Before it happens, I want you to know that I'm here for you
When you were home, we'd sing,
You'll never feel
'Cause man I know we never get things right
It's gonna take a lot of time before I can cross that finish line
in your crystal stare,
I've tried to call you names, but every time it comes out the same
And I'm saying
That sails the sea
Dream of sights
It's gonna be alright
Something extraordinary
Falling into your arms"
Where you've been for so long
If we never get another sound
After that train comes and takes me away
How can one sit back and dream it
The life I love is makin' music with my friends
A chance to build it from the ground
Owwwww, come on
With some two string, one string, no string guitars Hey, Chris, wanna jam
Damn these wild young hearts
And get crafty
You're good to me when only flesh
So let's run let's run let's run
Jump down that rainbow way
Did not let me down when I was defenseless
I've enjoyed making you miserable for years
Time's not on our side
I work it out when the situation seems unworkable
Che cosa vuoi tentare Che cosa inventare
I can't stand dumb love songs
Or the way you find it 
Why the world is right when you're near Oh, is that so 
It's the only poison that I like
Good thing
She told me that you got yourself somebody new
Oh, I can't see where you are
God knows I'm feeling really stupid now
Cross the delta Looking
We're running out if time, two wrongs can make it right
Sunshine in my eyes can make me cry
Don't worry I'll be there to rock the party all night
Something never dreamed in all the science books the biggest light switch gets turned on yeah yeah
Went out with the guys
As the morning gathers a rainbow
You quickly change your ways
But this won't work as well as the way it once did
Ignore me in the parking lot
I'm using my right brain and I'm praying that we don't crash
Believe in the magic of the young girl's soul
You can cross the line whenever you want to
I don't believe in chance
I never said I was the best thing for you
If I had a day that I could give you
Time takes it's toll, but not on the eyes
It must be ages since I felt satisfied
High and dry and kicked to the ground
If you burn the virgin flags, then I will shake, shake as the heat waves in the sand
Yeah she rocks my world
Waiting to see or send a sign of defeat Uhuh
And that old man is me
Brighter lights fill the night
Following the girl
Picking locks with footprints from the snow
Thank you for walks down Lover's Lane
Can't lift a finger, can't hurt a fly
He said, "I hope the names will get changed to protect me"
Did the ironing in a cowboy hat
People keeping low, people searching for some cover,
Oh, I still remember "Regulate" with Warren G
Whispering
If you're not giving all of your money and time
When you threw me away
Send back my dream test baby
Backseats and drunk suites and halfGreeks
But since you've left, I don't hear anything
Growl and hum say hmmm
To get the answer
Do you believe in magic in a young girl's heart
But this won't work now the way it once did
That's something to see, that's nothing to hide
I'm changing my next flight to Paris
But the sheets are still dull, been this way for so long, yes I know
Oh darlin', I was blind to let you go
But I won't close my eyes, 'cause they're onto you
You're my superstar Ooh la la, ooh la la
Forget modern nature, this is how it's meant to be
You know I really want you for your company
People take pictures of the summer
We're all one big band across this land and we should sing in tune
When I'm with you I've got everything
Disque parfait, disque lumineux
But look at what we got, the girl got hot
I know that I have, it's time for you to go
'Cause no one was having much fun 
What I've strung together
Cause there's always time for second guesses, I don't wanna know
When you get all dressed up
For all my reckless nights
Under the microscope, hope against hope
Tell me baby I'm your lover man
I still don't believe in myself, 
While soothing words
And the new year would see her flying far away from me
And everything's fine, everything's beautiful, everything's great
She had the gun in her mouth
It's nothing to do with acceptance
I said I'll make everything all right
everybody
How many licks, how many licks 'til you get to the center of my
Gotta keep those lovin' good vibrations ahappenin'
If I don't wake up to the sun
And we were feeling down
Yeah, I'm depending on you
Wait till I stake my claim
Walking on water
You can have your fantasy with me
And I think they're buying what I've got to say
Of looking down
But I'm feeling so uptight
He kicked up the river with a flick of his wrist
And there's something about your kiss
Got a dirty mouth
T, need this torture
So I'm putting my country shoulder
Okay, Coconut Man, Moonheads, and Pea
Spinnin' with the stars in the planetarium
Make your own kind of music
And all I gotta say,
I'm so funkin beautiful
Here comes my baby, here she comes now,
You came in to my life
So if you hear me say that I believe in love
Don't see the sense in wasting time
Shit, don't be concerned with mine
But if you hold me up to the light
From that night I kissed our love goodbye
What a dark and dreary life
I'm happy knowing that you are mine
To a lifelong love letter
Grinnin' like a dog diggin' up dinosaur bones
He was a man of many nations, had a hundred souls and a hundred to go
Ain't about the yeah chaching, chaching
But I've never seen your type before
I want nothing tonight to hold but you
And they've got something
Undo, corkscrew, drink from the half of a broken bottle
You gotta walk tall y'all
Well, I dream
In the back seats of rented wrecks
All I think about everyday is just kissing you
The back of the track
Think that something so beautiful
C'mon, c'mon
But I keep coming back for more
He puts his papers in his briefcase and drives away
I'll love you forever
Not the words that he says or the band
At her feet
Nights like these when you laugh until you cry And all the songs I'm singing
We know that deep inside
But you got some bait awaiting and I think I might
I was old enough to want it,
Why won't you just let this be your sun
I don't mind
Take it away
I need some clean air in my lungs
Let's live in the moment just this time, could we
Without a leash on the light around me
When I am fast asleep
Flowers in my hair
It don't matter what you find
And I know we'd do anything for love Oh yeah
A semblance of their old ways, what has happened to our handmade days
She's always got them stuck on me
I headed for home kinda early 
So for now I'll keep believing your words
I'm a big man, give this man room
Some say more with their hands I'm running as fast as I can
A place in the sun
Everything that rises
Why's it surreal when my hands feel they can't roll the dice
But now since I see you in his arms
The girl I adore was right in front of me
I wanna hear you say oh oui 
Baby, I could fall apart
So starting today things are gonna be all right
You and I are mortal, but rock and roll will never die
You're lookin' so cool, you're lookin' so fly
"I want you to see when the sun goes up"
But never really understood the reasons why
Now I'm five feet under the ground
Oh oh Of broken dreams iyayailan Island of lost so oh oh oh Oh oh
I just get so nervous when I'm talking to you
Do you thing, it doesn't matter
We came out of a crazy mind  ohohoh
And I'm falling, I can't breathe tonight
Well, I've tried to get along with you
You taste like sunlight
And I'm so happy 'cause you're so happy
"Come on baby, shake me all night long"
There is a river running underground
All the guys tried to take me,
See all the things in the world you've never seen
I close my eyes and remember
Hiding in estrogen and wearing Aubergine Dreams
She's looking good
And that's because she stands alone
'Somewhere where it warm and wet'
Will they remember me
Oh, ooh, yeah, no point regretting that it didn't last
Every time it's the same old thing
And I'll be okay
I'm closer to the grave and come the dawn
When you realize what a fool you've been
But here I am with eight more lives
I been go
The weathered concrete stairways
There was no return address 
I feel it more and more
Yo, what you know about goin' out
Grinnin' at the women in the salon gettin' their hair done
Don't let me be the last to know
My papa told me to be home by now
And looked you in the eye
Now we can see, but the images don't stick
His mom had once been attacked by a dog
I'm fine on my own
Can't beat the feeling
Che cosa inventare
I can't go losing my mind
And you can keep the cars
People making choices they can't fake
But now we can see, now we do as we please
It gave me more street cred
I'm afraid of letting go
Something makes you think that you're some kinda winner
Lookin' at the stars
Tonight's the night girls, yeah
We turn it up, we turn it up
It's only gonna make you love me more
You know I'm contained
Lady, dreamer, you might be the soundest sleeper
Living and dying in LA and it means nothing to me
And I like my head on your shoulder
Choosing one the rhythm war
But it has taken me a while,
You know she dances while his father plays guitar
I need you to need me
In the arms of my sweetlovin' man
At least it was never until I noticed you
We can find a place to start to gamble everything
Even if the words are gonna hurt were better off this way
The faintness that you feel
I found a good spot by the cheerleaders, eating
If I talk too much 
Lost in the sight I try to reach out
The telegram said are you gonna call our way home
I feel the push and pull,
Makin' lemonade with the kitchen aid
Oh strawberry avalanche, please crash over me
The sun bursts, clouds break
Before the world catches up
The wages are down
Hands up if you're down to get down tonight
Forget about work Start all over again Oh oh oh oh Island of lost souls
So sit real still, they've got to size you up
Now I wsh those photographs
Got no resolutions, no clever anecdotes to say
Where the poltergeists play their video games
Away, I know,
GIrl, you done broke me down inside
She crawled right in my
No, ooh, ooh
But one thing is true is man now look at you
Back to the years and all of those tears
I've got a nine to five
The dance floor was crowded, the bathrooms were worse
Fur too soft for words
That's right
Take me on a trip, I'd like to go some day
In an effort to uncover what has happened to their salad days 
Even angels would be homesick in this forsaken town
My debut is coming soon and you already know what I'm gonna do
Words just get in the way
Are you out of love with me
Every day's so caffeinated
Chrissy's such a pretty thing
It's still fat and easy up on bankers hill
Yeah, dancing and chanting in a sacrificial rite
She know where you are
Like Samsung gotta shoot around the back alley oop and one
It's not a scam girl
Will I get better or stay the same
And I'm falling I can't breathe tonight
Doesn't matter to me, I could take it or leave it
I found Ive come in a dream again
Give chocolates and mirror balls
Dream all the things in the world you've never dreamed'
And you're buying every line of it girl
'Til I kiss you next time
I'm not aware
No one bothering you
And when this tune is through
Yeah I don't know much about you
I thought things were going all right
I call out the numbers, the rumble of collected thunder today
Never been arrested for nothin' domestic
The rest is just a dream
Neck full of gold, baguettes in my Rolls
I was not looking for arty farty love
I'm throwing rocks at broken windows
I watch you sailing far above the seashore
I will let you down If I am
I need to know if we're still making useless ruckus
Tell me, are you gettin' hurt, is it worth it
She's a simple girl
We need to stay
The stage is set, is there glamour, who's got my Etnies
Love is the truth I realize
Is what we'll get
Think we stand out from the clique
Hardcore reggae beat bring my feet out of these shackles
So I can teach it when it comes my turn
And my mother always made me eat broccoli
And you drop down to the tube that takes you right to level eight
It's days like these
Baby I love how you sing
'Cause I loved her long blond hair
When my world was full of seven legged cats
Everybody's feelin' warm and right
Something real something real
Maybe he'll understand
The power
Shakes me up inside
The good ones are gone or not able
We're on fire now We're on fire
You saved the day
And I feel happy too
There's an hour of sunshine for a million years of rain 
Even if it hurts you inside
If you believe in magic, don't bother to choose
When my momma said I look good in white
Hey babe, can't do it
Hearing her voice soft and low
Life is upon us and the time for love is here and now
Will go downtown in his car
And my hands were sweating
Going loco down in Acapulco if you stay too long
You might be found tomorrow
Tell them put the money in my hand right now yes
Take off, both your, shoes and clothes, I'll follow
I'll be worthy, right 
Don't forget to celebrate the radio's up
Mocking bird sings
You never walk alone, and you're forever talkin' on the phone
You are the morning
Bonsoir Jacqueline, bonsoir a toutes et a tous Pour toutes les zones de la mer du Nord et de la Manche
Yeah, I've been hiding with nothing to hide
Oh baby please stay true
The smiles, the laughs, the funny,
Midnight, who was a girl
Slide over here let your hands feel the way
No I don't need you to buy me pretty things
and I could never say no to you 
Well, your mother likes my smile
Now all the girls raise your hands up in the air yeah
My hair is poofy
Now we do away with our disease
Always find some number that we know
Some people call me the gangster of love, yeah
The person you need
All these people talk a lot
Oh why did God create this world so unfair
It's still love in the first degree
All the way, yeah we're moving, oh
Need you now, I need you right now
They tell their lies and something dies
There was this girl she looked so fine
Oh, I feel your love deep inside
Hey darling, let's steal it,
And I'm running out of gas
I don't mean you no harm
In a second you were always there to break my fall
Picture the moonglow 
Go ahead lose yourself inside this opportunity
Right here is where I'd stay
Well I have passed the test just like all the rest,
Then I'd be your harmony
Long after the days of living are gone
Misfire
It feels so right now
He crazy, I know what you're thinkin'
I just wanna know, do you,
Middle of the day
When love falls from the sky nobody ever asks why
White hot glistening shadowy flows Feel goes 
Well, I just wanna compliment your soul
I didn't want you around
When I'm walking 'round daydreaming
Just like that Barenaked Ladies song,
I swear I won't say what happened that night
Well I wish you well but keep your paws off mine
Warm panda cola by the mountain the in the sun
I've got problems,
Just take it away, yeah
Oh I feel good
Longer than three months
There was really no info at all 
This gone on for way too long
The moshpit started, and then the crowd parted
"And I don't want to get innocent
But hear me when I say I'm glad because we're here
Now I'm gonna tell you what I've been thinking
The time is getting closer, the time is almost here
Your mama told you to be discreet
I watch from the sides and try to reach out
Gonna wash the dust off my soul
My job was calling
Won't you show me everything you've learned,
That you didn't like
Whenever your falling
My mad family
He's got his mothers eyes, his father's ambition
I'm was starting to think I was onto something good
It must make you sad to know that, nobody cares at all
Not a stream of pretty lies
Sunshine whoo
Keep your eyes on the prize and realize
Will a child find me by a stream
Then you say I'm untrue
It's just you and me and oh dear, our life has just begun 
Got a two string on my lap
No men ever really dance like this
As will these boys gone through like water
I remember taking you home on that 
Something so simple
An old feeling that feels refreshingly new
Your girls wanna leave, I hear them calling you
I don't want to live in this world anymore
It's a supernatural delight
Black hands held so high
I know you'll never let me down
Heartbreak, heartbreak
And it wasn't low blows and video hoes
I hope it's not the end of the line
I'll be there right by you
If you were a beautiful sound in the echoes all around
Up every evening 'bout a
My motto's always been "When it's right, it's right"
Prove my love to you
Then it's gone from sight
I am not scared of the elements I am underprepared but I am willing
My whole heart will be yours forever
But it's bittersweet to me
Where nobody gave her a look
You're my slip, my happy country 
It won't be hard to start again
Just holding a piece of what's been left of me
Something in his deep brown eyes has me singing
As a harmless joke
Be dirty dancing me all night long
Then I could save my calls
So I walk through the streets I love
And the way you like to dress
And my friends were acting cool
If you remember just how scared I use to be
Taking it in so, so heavy
My mom would say "I hope some day you get paid for being Kimya Dawson"
But pretty soon it will happen the sun will go murder the snow
I guess well turn out so well
Well no more, well no more blue days for you my dear
And she's always one step behind
Lost in the things that you do
'Cause shakedown soon
But its mine to decide when and if I'll be all right
When the train rolls by
We'll be for a while
He has things you'd never do
Save those lies, Darling don't explain
Oh, there's always someone cooler than
No one knows what to do
With a Z, chrome VB's, they wanna be me
But your mama lied to you all this time
And the two chord cool still grooves
Oh yes, I'm up on that thing
Its all right in the sunny time with the Black Eyed Peas,
Or playing little solos on the keyboard so the kids will ask me how and why
Whoa, oh, if you really love me 
On the street when I think of some
Aiding my fall, aiding my fall 
Yeah, but I can hear a knock on the door
And that's when I fell in love
And we're divin' to the depths of the deepest ocean
Come ye, come ye, to bedrooms, bars and bunker squats
Girl your hot, your body's on fuego
Yes he was kind, polite, sound and sublime, in theory
Sunshine almost always
To keep our feelings strong 
I've been calling your name
That you can't even have a good time
They took it in the first place
But she came with feelings too complex to be amusing
And what's a girl supposed to do
From the glossy magazine that's stuck inside the Sunday Times
Is taken up by lover man
We dance at the festivals
Then I'll share an elephant ear with you if you'd like
I'm on a flatbed yellow pickup underneath the half moon
I thought about my friends
Feel that wind rushing by heyayaya
You were better to me than I was to myself
Like you've got nothing to prove
Because we never have
Stocks are in the Dow,
You don't understand, you don't understand
Let me hear you say
And my eyes were squinting
And I gotta admit sometimes it's pretty sad
But you look amazing
And crystal eyes to read between the lines
If you never go away
It's time that we say it
You are so needed if you really want to go 
Keep the windows down
All the things that we used to do
I'll be love's suicide
the way I do
Too prone to break
You're givin' me a heart attack
Let's screw the rules up and rely on our minds
When I lie down in your arms
It was a sweet summer's night on Hammer Hill
I'll be your man
You could have hit me with a baseball bat
So tonight let's be honest
Well it's all coming back around
Reluctantly, cause most of this press don't fuck wit me
I stopped to see what his deal was 
But I love you like a brother
Is real love
You make it hard to smile because
Oh, a kind, and honest man honest man
Got a stellar reputation girl be who I am
This is the worst part
'Cause I can't compete with your boyfriend
Irreplaceable but in the end,
"You and me are the world", she says
Yeah, but it feels good
You're Mike Jordan, you're my superstar
When the going get tough, the tough get going
And we're flying down the levels howling
I though if we live apart
Can't feel right today
Yeah, we leaping across 'cross these undefeatable odds
Any other girl I'd be long gone
Hey he knows I wasn't cheatin'
You know I'm not a weirdo, no
For the wings of a dove
And for all of the sweet loving that
And your father likes my lifestyle
You were on my mind at least nine tenths of yesterday
Sailing over the briny sea
They left me with these blisters on my skin
Say a little bit of sweet loving in your day
Don't you dig my grave with some excavator
I get the feeling
Bring your body here, next to mine
Hear ye, hear ye, and make miracles for minimum wage
Someone to leave this town and
Girl all I need is for you
Ask someone who knew me
I got to keep I heights
Other ways, other ways
Take my home
As will you knight in shining armor
There's one thing you can do
For the weekend and the night 
We won't ever let them win
Come on, everybody, to the Nth degree
Is gonna fly
Well eight or nine, well that's just fine
And the leaves are golden
I swear, I know you do
Clowne towne a flock of coots
And tomorrow, I know,
Let me know how you feeling
Just a little bit closer, then I come back down
When you come back down
Nobody can tell you
Why's it so great just to wake every day alive and by your side
If I died tomorrow
And the eagle takes to flight
Are the friend that act's friend in a Lex or a Benz
I need you, why can't you come over
Should leave instead
And I might never be the same again, but have you seen my friends, they're just the same
Sucking my thumb by the old oak tree
To see if the same thing's on your mind
If I look back when I begin to leave
Wetting rags in gasoline
You say if we were to wait 
There's an opportunist dude
Stuck watching our lives blow up
You better give up, come on and give up
Tell me the truth, and I'll tell you the truth
A boom boom shak
Another day
So I threw it out a fishing line
When I am so used to being with you
You see the ads and start to think
And if we step a little higher will we find it then
Today feels like no other
The happy ever after girl
Damn you cupid
What's a poor boy to do in a world gone wrong
Don't forget, don't forget where I'll be
I saw my neighbor out crying on his front porch
Blown by strong wind, but ithere we fear 
And the subtleties you start to sling
She would know that 
And my smile was growing
And then the fog it slips right in
Such a pretty boy, only nineteen
And we talk about friends and we talk about records
Hey, he knows that you been tryin'
And waste our time
Yeah every time you look like that, oh oh
Clowne towne no anything
You've got the touch, now come on let it show
Don't let this fading summer pass you by
If I am only here to watch you as you suffer
But your move that catches my eye
The players in the band
Cause a lot of wags want to hear it
And we're having fun
'Cause without you I'm just bones
Baby, crawl into the wave
And rejoice, your hair it smells like burning hair
On the slow boat to Lan Tao, the misty seas
"She's looking at you I don't think so She's looking at me"
Stand beside me
There's a ghost in your old bedroom
Na na na na that's my dog
To throw your arms around
Of everything I know
And everyone's a soldier just marching towards the ocean
I don't wanna clear the cobwebs from my head
Blow me a kiss, I'll be happy for the rest of my life
We should have stayed how we were
For a tender glance, ohoho
Tear it apart and start again
He wrote a book about the smell of winter in two, a little less simple to decipher
You and I can tackle anything of any size
Some people call me the space cowboy
But we can't go back
Keep moving and forget the rest
Who says it's hard to reach
We hang around dans ton quartier
What you do to me when you hold his hand
And tour guides make happy brides feel heavensent
Hell yeah I just got paid
And I can feel how right she'd be for me
And prematurely ended my career
And rejoice, the bed you sleep in is burning
Young boys
And the backpackers are pouring out like a tidal wave of vomit
Kind of odd, look out for quicksand, there is high ground
And we'll get a head start on the day
But most of all the little ones
Switched up and rewrote the book
All you gotta do is trust me
My baby's always dancing
So bring back the beat and then everyone sing
Made you stand out in a crowd
I would buy myself a gray guitar and play
You know where to find me
And when I can't take the fall I really wanna make that call
On the good, the bad, the ugly
And soon enough my strength will return
You're extraordinary, baby
We got space to do what you please
Island of lost so oh oh oh oh Iya iya Island of lost souls Forget about work
Yeah, Estelle, we about to get down get down
Standing on unstable ground
Need you to hold me up, I
Alright, yeah
Forget the wrong one
And we had fun
On something magical
To be the new statistic
Cooler than you my lady
But you have to work now, so get out of bed
I can't stop, I don't know why
I get anorexic chicks, who model six
It's like you got somethin' good to sell
So she left herself in swallowing up the fever to the air to a broken wing
They know your mom fucked you up
And I got so scared I tried to lure him back to bed
Picking pennies off the floor with my cold, cold hands
With the constant complaint, we either gonna make it fly
You're my angel bringing peace to my life
And just to lay inside you, and just to know this feeling
That I learned to break dance in and thought I was good
Through their clothes
If I had some money yo id lay it on ya
I've found a place I'll never leave
Bedu, bedu, bedu, bedu
'Cause when I touch your arm, I can tell
I can't beat the feeling
Smile through a joke inside
Bringin' us to life
In Babylon on the boulevard of broken dreams, my will power at the lowest ebb
And my friends say
Do I turn around, do I turn my eye to the sun
And I can unscrew the stars
Believe in me, help me believe in anything
So wonderful, wonderful, wonderful, wonderful the way I feel
If you see me hit the ground
We're dancing all around
At least her teeth are clean
And a child by every one
Sitting here watching other people live
And I walk through the streets I love
That somebody like you could be with
Diamond girl,
When we went walking through the pines
Teach it when it comes my turn
I beg and steal, I follow you
Is still resounding, but what can I do
I don't care what you tell the other guys
Just go and listen, and it'll start with a smile
Sometimes you find yourself waiting
I said hello
It's a sweet summer's night on Hammer Hill
People take pictures of each other
Don't you know honey that love's a game
This magic music grooves me
Tall, dark, and Superman
If it were up to me, yeah yeah
If you say that you love me
Hopeful days and stormy nights
I want you to know
They don't wanna come around
Because I'm ready now 
You say it's true, know it's true, nothing left except for me and you
This is a beautiful start
A gente topa tudo
I only count the sunny hours, the brightest hours of day
Hide under the bed
"You wanna get away You've had it man Nothing's going right so come sit on the sands of the island Island of lost souls No luxuries No no Amenities Too dull Your senses Oh oh Only primitive Hey hey Really get away" is what he said
Hey, Snow White  It's going to be all right, it's going to be all right
To the pages I loved
The airway
But she won't give that to them, until they learn how to love
Come with me, it's plain to see
I'm making a beautiful day
The way you stole my attention was flat out burgulary
It's not about the money, money, money
Could just come apart in my hands
My ears are burning, but I kept on walking
So let's smash the past like a tacky figurine
That smile that shines
Since graduation was long ago
Right here wishing the flowers were from you
And I know what you thinking of
You'll complete me, right 
And I'm feeling for you
Where's the woman you love
A little piece of heavenly that no one else could stand
Look up at the rooftops
'Cause our love our love
We don't care what you say
Dash of rouge, buyer beware
And I sleep all day and wake myself in the shadows
Where the clouds take their places for you
And I know it's got me reelin'
And right then I knew what was what
And I know you know I know I don't know you very well
As I was swimming through the bay
Perhaps someone you know 
And I know I'm quite unkind
Want sweet loving, sweet salvation
Maybe I could fall
Could you be my love, my love ooh
Millions, the only thing we in a hurry to make
I'll leave out the teasin'
There doesn't have to be a reason
Working class to the bone
Let hands guide the way
It's  AM, and I know that you're with him
We conquered in the sun, but we lived in the shade
Spent a long long time pretending
Or how deep the city roots go down
No more tears
To the top of the building
Clowne towne single angel
Pluggin' in their instruments feelin' good about themselves
I popped him in the kisser 'cause I couldn't resist
It's chic transportation to new destination 
My baby's in there someplace
Holla, holla, holla, life goes on
I didn't think this life was gonna be for me
Even though I'm attached to you physically
The big big bang
Cooler than you boy
If these people just don't get it
And I think I'm getting older
And when I wouldn't go out with you
Made some sweet love to the beat
But I'm still on my feet
You're a memory with nothing to show
Living next door to challenge
That you could lend
In the strangest fashion you start a chain reaction
So before I know it I'm going down this little bitty river
I went back, I went back to your love
It feels good
He's been gone for such a long time
To my blue friends
The day we're born till then we
It's time to look to the future
But some say we're headed for destruction
Money can't buy us happiness
And my knees were shaking
When you're walking along
But are you man enough to wear it"
Ooheee baby, I'm gonna show you a good time babe
Of prolonging the inevitable
He's never done, got OCD, our love is to the Nth degreee
On the backs of our lives
I need a little, I need a little faith
It's the same thing to me
But I didn't care
Don't want to talk about it
And more importantly, who did you smoke it with
And nothing now can ever be taken away from you
You're not alone in this life
Oh well it's dangerous, and it's sweet
Still I burn this earthen fire 
And screaming car alarms
This is a song
This can't be real, I must be dreamin' could somebody slap me
And I wish they would stop singing
I just wanna compliment your soul
I'm liking this American Boy, American boy
Now that the city's awake, my heart aches
Under the burden of my loneliness
Who stays there all along 
I know it hurts
O sol se reparte em crimes
Blame it on yourself sunshine
If I could have you back best believe it'd be forever
You feel it coming on
We get it on most every night
So he came right back
Would like to play
Promise we'll stay the same
Is when I noticed you, yeah
That boy is looking at you and he says that he knows your kind
You can almost hear them saying
I'm not your number one
And though the names will get changed to protect the innocent
All the energetic people they all sparkle as they're walking down the street
I'll give you a massage when you get home
Fresh and deep as oceans new
Everyone is golden, everyone is golden,
A fist to the voice
Believe in the magic that can set you free
As children draped in flowers form a chain 
Whispered "stay just a little more"
That's just' bout as funky as you can be
This is the reason we should all be tied up
Are these the good days
Oh I love you,
Say yeah 
Barged our way into the toilet with a kung fu kick
We're always kickin' back
This song is not a gospel song
If I cry to set the mood oh please could you cry too
Welcomed at the
She said, "You're right, it's a living, but you're wrong for the life
"Game over" they said, run and get your quarters in
Would I just shut my mouth, would I just block it out
Back the in your eyes
Flowers in my hair now
I dreamed one day I'd be livin' off the system for free
And now I'm getting a little homesick
She turned and she gave the evil eye
And let me swim around your eyes
One day I'm gonna get mine too
And now there's you understanding why I do the things I do
See if I have enough cash to take a taxi home
'Cause I jump back, crash, I crawl
I love her body, especially the lies
I know it's got me reelin'
In my desperation I throw my faith into the wind
Was my whole life just a lie
Always drives us away
Don't ever let me go go go
Go all the way to the right
I don't know what I don't know, it's harder everyday
Who really needs the past
Squaredoff, all bother
And there's something about you
There's nothing better
You played me hard to get for a while
Yo, now if you know what I know you need to work it out
Why don't you come right out and say it what it is your thinking
I'm all right y'all, all right y'all
Come on, let's get all antsy
It's such a waste, another day
She said it's okay that they
Smile on my face and an air guitar rocking
Here I stand
And I'm thinkin' about my boys Joelly chic and Freshly Sean
Where I can kick it with friends through the night
Because we are alive so we've gotta live life
I always forget to tell you I love you
I swear, I'll be with you someday
You gotta gamble everything for love
Well, don't let that worry you baby oh baby
My loneliness is evident
We are the ones who're gonna last forever
In your hospital room 
It's not like we'll be parted
Go on and get going
Your search for paradise will come to an end
You got to the bell rings three, do you understand
Don't you know it's now or never
This one other 'ere's got a little something else
Ready to get it on
And I know I said I needed some time alone
So many thangz that I want to try
Said you wanna get married and cook somebody dinner
Circled by eyes burned blue and open wide
Sha la la la la la la la yeah, 
Whenever you look you can see that everybody wants to be part of the rockscene
He'd kill me without any warning
Our calls on the company dime
Let me let go 
When all these people who will lead you down
Then it arrives and says, "You're perfect, my love"
Best way to touch your heart is to make an ass of myself
And I was amazed by the things I learned,
Yeah we make great friends but it just isn't the same
You'll rescue me, right
Nobody minds, everyone lies
Spent the day laughing in the sun
Few miles away from heaven above
And you warm me up and you wait for it
And the man falls in the sea
Our page is one and the same 
Gonna take you home tonight
And I've missed your ginger hair
Fine, pull the string, replay that shit
I'm still waitin for your heart, 'cause I'm sure that some day it's gonna start
I guess you know about leaving
Tonight, tonight
You are invited for all time
KKK kicken' at your front door
Shut up and kiss me like the antidote's under my tongue
Watch it burn, humming "Sherry," splits the scene
All of the beautiful colors are very very meaningful
We should be happy, that's what I said from the start
You said you ain't I never thought you was
That you'll be thinking about me
A week in the forest
If you ain't happy with yourself you need to work it out
I saw you, with her
And she was shooting up at her dreams
Swing my weight around
Lost in the moment, then I come back down
And the writings on the wall
Whether whistling heaven's clouds disappear
To fill my days and nights with something
So let us be married
Have we ever been true
I run with you
I'm that chick you danced with two times through the Rufus album Friday night at that party
Yeah Oh, yeah
A Cousteau expedition
Eagle feather in her feathered hair the girl got hot
Is not to wake up till PM
We are the tide ah
Different parts of the picture highlight the same frame
The way you want them to
But all I know is that I'm happy to see you smile
If you try to stop this, you're just too late,
Somehow I thought I wasn't worth the fight
And I deal with ho's that pose in Maybeline
I wait, yeah I wait
No matter save for a friend
When the chaperone said that it was time for me to leave
Please somebody get me out of this hole
Bringing me to life
Bend your knees, bend your knees
I picked the few conscious hours
On crystal sand we sleep handinhand
But it's so dangerous but they're determined
Aw, look at him So delectable So chewable
Dressed in all your fancy clothes
And stare at the world from deep under eiderdown
One by one, we're makin' it fun
It's a suicide, waiting, donde estas
This water that I must give her, can I get some
There's something going on that wasn't here before
You're wasted from the boredom
Nothing stays the same
When that old guy gave us all those drinks for free
Said hold me up, Oh
It feels so good
Recall senses sadly
Let's hope these wheels got what it takes to carry us home
That's right That's how it should be
Any stranger feel at home
I know you're going crazy crazy
And he's on the way to a real first in all the universe yeah yeah
Like a flash before our eyes we'll leap toward the night
'Cause kid I don't know much about about you
Let's forget we're running out of time
But a master of disguises, her demise was her design, they said
And now things are gonna get better baby
With the man that I am but understand if I don't keep going
Because it wasn't supposed to go this bad
You down, right dead in the eye
And you'll leave, got places to be
If you starwipe all your past away
And I have seen worlds filled with wonder
I'm trying to be alright
Moonlight yeah
It's ok, come on, I won't do the things they learned me
But it feels great today
Count the stars, watch the waves
A fickle beast who's nice today
And everybody's packin' up their station wagons
But I don't need to rest, I'm not old and tired, but I've been through fire and I've seen enough,
You know you're alive
For my true colours,
No instead we're doing simple things
But are you afraid
But she was with another guy
Emily, I sure am glad you didn't want me anymore
How can I begin to say
You've dreamed a thousand dreams, none seem to stick in your mind
Stopping in somebody's old hometown
I'd rather make an honest sound and watch it fly around and then be on my way
Filled with girls all dressed in red
Anyway, I'm off track gotta stop that
And there was Kiki Dee
I'm a lover
So I shall unravel my love
Mirage like soft blue like lanterns below
From sweet beginnings to your bitter end 
Tried to thicken the plot
So we could take a step
The one that I came with
I'm gonna get it times two
She got hot, and they did not, hoh
Down on Main Street They're singing their songs tonight
And we stare at the beautiful women
And I didn't need you till melody
Sie kann sich kaufen was sie wollte doch nie hatte
But what I know is I'm his girl
Only to get stopped by a girl so stunning
You keep me lucky like the roulette wheel spinnin
I am from about, umm, number five
If fingers are mistakes
"History repeats itself twice," said Marx
Acting so damn mysterious
A honeysuckle in a plastic envelope
Oh please, no you oh please
Oh baby, give me one more chance
And I, I wanna be someone to believe
What do you say let's exit stage left so me and you can
Outside, thrown out on my ass
Deeply touching my emotion
I just can't control my feet
And I can't wait to get on the road again
Under the grand silver birch tree
Mmm, everybody, has got to demonstrate
That we could lay here for hours and justa reminisce
Promise me this, take me tonight
One day finds the perfect boy
That wherever you say you want, 
Knowin' I was good and able but instead I fed your fables
Who's got the crack
And all these things mean nothing to me
And we all sit silent and I crawl back inside
Inside that's happening to me, oh
That's the only time I ever noticed my heart before
At the funny things we'd say
I love the way your body's moving when its grindin on me
I can't go on without you
I came back to haunt you
I'm full of funky fever
All right, fair enough
Tootootoodooroo
Test the eye, test the eye
The way you walk, the way you talk,
Say that you stay right here for me
Making love to only you so
Someone say I'm not making mistakes and please don't be fake
And she blew my mind
Cherie, cherie, comment ca va 
I'm pickin' up good vibrations
I remember every instance when you stunned me
And you're so sweet, you say
And the shoes you've grown into
It's not about the money, money, money We don't need it
And I know now girl that I love ya
Don't say it will all be fine
They think it's not right, fine
And a rocket to depart in
But I'm still waiting for next week's chemical blast
I love you baby, do discover was I here
They're trying their best to define you to define you
Minutes run into hours, hours run into days
Put your house up on for sale, did you get a good lawyer
There's always someone out there cooler than you
Said "I love you", said "I like you
For control over the sky
Because sitting in our room
We were talking together
Best place in Paris to be
Just as I'm thinkin about repairin' it some little friends come along
You say she's just a friend now
Than anywhere with you
Salem is home
We'll never be more than a few hours from home
It's gonna be my beautiful day
So just remember, folks, we not just saving lives, we're saving souls
Memories that I'd black out if you were mine
I'm so glad you found me,
What in the world should we do
Ill take everything and more
Picture shows, second balcony, was the place we'd meet,
Gotta catch that train by midnight for the
Fathers take pictures of the mothers
She's turning around
But just like them dogs, well those guns just get bigger
Haun' sofort wieder ab, wenn es dir hier nicht gefallt
You wake me up and you wait for it
Tie my shoes and zip my jacket
What I know your thinking anyway
Can't go back
So c'mon c'mon
You float as I look aft to watch the moon rise
And can you keep sleeping metaphysical girl
And when I find myself getting to close in the situation
Hiding in estrogen and boys will be boys
I will wait until another indistinguishable day arrives outside
How happy we'd both be
I been stop
With outstretched hands
And everybody has to see you wait
And if it feels like we're dreaming
And blood is in the land we love
But I remember that you like a pinch of spice, well I
And a bad tendency to get burned
And every day's the darkest of my life
But now that you are here
And I hear you say
Gotta let it out, let it out, let it
Or we ain't, I already know what some of ya think
Some people like to talk but I'm into doing
Say you feel the same
The quarterback asked me if I'd like a beating
A grass blade flashed with a gleam as it slashed open a moonbeam
And now try to make you not regret anything
Not withstanding I think we could work out
Fights away all decay
Dance till you got no more"
Every time I hear you say "Fuck it"
We're building us a new horizon
And sail the ocean with you
That makes me feel so good
And it's always too late when you got nothing
We have to party all night
Afraid to take a chance
You look the same on TV as when you were mine
Is it what you dreamed it'd be
We don't need your money, money, money
And now I'm walking by Bev and Mick's backpacker hostel on Victoria Street
That's all lies
And Kim's got her watermelon gun, 'cause it's the consciousness of love She won't give it to them, she won't give it to them
Yeah, we see that fire
 flavors, listen to the neighbors through the wall,
And I'm led to the house I built
I am in love with a boy
And everyone moves around with ease
You got some things to resolve
Everybody's dancin' in the moonlight Everybody
I wouldn't dream of it now
And I'll stay up late and I won't even care
I got hot head, hot eyes, hot ticks, hot mouth 
Lessons I wish that I had mirrored
No damn jedis or hobbits this time
You never heard it from me but there's a breach in the hull where the truth and the water's too deep to prove
Little arms, little arms
You had a little game on ya
Tart with a heart
Engulfs all the senses
Know I'm right and do it right, could I get to be like that
We gotta let it
When we're all in the crowd and you catch her eye
Yeah, love is an ocean of sweet emotion Sweet emotion
And gave us a big surprise 
The things that you dream in
I think it's your heart, but you already know
On which from this city we can flee
Rejoice although this world will devastate you
Pretend my feet are running away
Take me to New York, I'd love to see LA
Since the apple wasn't there, yeah
You're my superstar
I know why
Keep me in your thoughts, don't disappear
But you can't hear it being played
When your healing powers kick in
When I am in the sea
Calling out my name This table is set for one
You didn't come here for nothing, did you
It's nothing conscious
That I used to wear not to block out the sun
If I could only stay
Say sing with your hips my baby
It's the weekend
Thank you for all the joy and pain
When you look my way, something's pounding away
You know the ills of this world they can get you down
Falling back down to the floor
These precious illusions in my head
The music is so loud
You are perfect just the way that you are
I'm rolling, I'm rolling
It's much more fun
You are missing that kissing when we're over
Fillmore couldn't feel more miles away
I alway seem to make
'Cause I speak of the pompitous of love
I ain't got much to win, not much to lose
And if it hurts me baby you know why
Sit back, put your feet up and relax
Yeah, I just wanna compliment
And all I want is to come right out my shell
My mother never takes a break
Ladies and gentlemen
Damn, I wish I was, so I could fall in love with you
The weatherman says it's wet and cloudy
And I never have to know
All the pain, almost as painful as ever but
It's hard to be a garbage man
'Cause you're so ooh Tootootoo, so ah Tootootoo, so cool
House on the rock
It's not hard to know why,
And the teeth right down to the blood
I saw on TV about this little kid
It's a suicide, waiting, yo no se
I'll tell you the truth if you tell me the truth
'Cause it's always a good time
'Cause we can't stop
In this world
When the rocket ships all fall
Come on, come on
Bad, bad, bad, bad boy
Sweeter than the words of the bird in the sky
So I shook hands with you freely
Who shot a look so virulent it pierced me like a hook
That I ever did see
I close my eyes at night
Do you dread every phone call
Skyrockets in flight
I I I I I was robbed
Tell the man I'll take it all
That waves will wash the grey away
I'm just tryin' get with ya and pose in the same picture
In the port prepare to set sail,
Mason Betha
Are you there, Eugene tell me are you there
I find it to be magical
From where I live, I can hear the voices joining
I was young but I believed in no tales
I'm feelin' groovy, kickin' down the cobblestones
C'mon c'mon and dance with me baby
Could that have been back in the sweet summer of 
Have faith that when you call my name
We were looking for a place where we don't fear heaven
When it rains and pours and then it runs out
And there's a distance to her voice over the phone
I see the light of your smile
'Cause I know that i
Up on bankers hill the party's going strong
But I'm the one who wants to let it go
The city screams
And we found out that the two things we put together
Just living on dreams
And the stormy nights
All the things your trying to say
That I'm a rainbow with you
And did it make you happier
All along the path, feelings I can't tell
Do you want to break my heart
Is it a change of heart that keeps us apart
But you brighten up for me all of my days
And I guess I'll see you in the spring
Dash of rouge, buyer beware the girl got hot
But it's okay It's okay
Hold you here until the pain has all gone
While soothing words hover like hummingbirds
Like a tropical forest, like a cop on the beat
Tell me, are you feeling lost, have you crossed
Just don't say it will be all right
That used to hold your clothes
I bought a fancy charm
If you really wanna speak than make the sound
Drop it from the rooftop what's gon' break my fall
It's a wild, wide, beautiful world
You can watch the sunset from the bed 
And she's got simple emotions
When you're walking round
So come on back now comeback comeback
He saves the day and the world knows, the sonic boom explodes
"Yeah, me and you are a world", he said
Beneath the candy coated clouds
They go on and on she sees but I say
What you find and heal my broken jaw, yeah
Would I know just what to do, yeah
I'm not what I was last summer
Here underwater we're down Here underwater way down
That's why I'm still here and walk with you
Black hot glistening shadowy flows Feel goes 
And so we're standing in the street staring at a bloodred moon
Do I drive you up the wall
They named me lucky
We still take the pill, but only for the fix, hey
Pick it up when it's yours to hold
You know there ain't nobody else
Now I'm right here, waiting for your calling
Stormy days and lonely nights
Today feels like no other other
This place could be just so beautiful
People talk about me, baby People talk about me, bad to
Cause my old man is bleeding
Will hold us in their arms
But I'll wait outside
And I just know this is a big mistake
Everybody has a TIU
I wanna try to be the person you want
Don't know why
And play, just play
She was so sweet on Christmas Eve
What a rash and inconsistent faith you had
I can't deny that when I'm staring
You ate your words wrong this time
Smiles would die too soon
You know it
How did you know
I'm learning to fly
With a sign on my back saying 'kick me'
But you're always on my mind
And these are the words
Looking to the town to show us what they got,
I want to be with you forever
I miss winter just because I miss when I knew you best
And I know they love it
When I come home, you won't be there any more
It was clear she was dead yeah we all could agree
Outwit them with our brains
Would you be my love, my love would you be mine
So can you hold me up
Just a little bit closer and then I come back down
When I'm six feet under the ground
Why's it so strange when they say that the world's movin' upwards
And our airforce flying
And I won't even let you home
Build them back up with your bones
Thinkin 'bout you's working up my appetite
The lord will have his way but I'm just a call away
Had to pull off your nice clothes
Und sie will Pelz tragen
And when I ring you up
Wherever you go, you'll be thinking about me
Che cosa vuoi provare
Indie rock chicks, and hip hop chicks
Let's get into all kinds of trouble
Oh, you're so lovely
So what do you do with all your precious time
Content like a panda bear
C'est pas grave ca reviendra
If there only was a when
But you said you don't need it
And maybe for a little get to where I find it really hard to hate myself
You came like a thief in the night and stole my heart
That's my, that's my dog
It might bother you, don't let it
You know just what to do
There was a time when I would have believed them
Come ye, come ye, to soulless corporate circus tops 
And now it won't shine for anyone
Youth like a spark
Two points for honesty
Anonymous until the ending,
For the rest of my days
So the crowd gets quiet I start to play
I'm catching my second wind again
I am so happy, knowing you are the one
I feel in love with people sleeping
Let's hang out if you're down to get down tonight
And I can't see the darker wood
Turn looking at hips, and a little outfit
All the robotic families
We keep breaking our backs,
You sign on the line
You're so ooh You're so, so ah You're so, you're so Hey, hey, yeah
I can't believe that she let me hit it
Young ones grow anxious to proclaim their advances to the fray
Take me baby up to higher elevation
Agora so me resta sonhar
People you've kissed, people you lust
It's a mystery that we are all still holding on
We'll stay on the phone until dawning
We've got a life that hasn't even began
But they have no impact no value no power
Till I can't control myself
Like a puppy getting lucky
We all need to feel secure
Honey pie, don't 'cha cry, we're still together
There are worse things in this world
People say I should watch my pace What do they know
This the championship game you ready yo
